recurrence after the first-ever seizure in patients with a supratentorial cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is almost certain, so the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy is justified. The optimal method of management of these patients is still a matter of debate. The aim of our study was to identify factors associated with postoperative seizure control and assess the surgical morbidity rate. We retrospectively analysed 45 consecutive patients with a supratentorial CCM and symptomatic epilepsy in a single centre. Pre- and postoperative epidemiological data, seizure-related patient histories, neuroimaging results, surgery details and outcomes were obtained from hospital medical records. Seizure outcomes were assessed at least 12 months after surgery. Thirty-five patients (77.8%) were seizure free at the long-term follow-up (Engel class I); six (13,3%) had rare, nocturnal seizures (Engel class II); and four (8.9%) showed meaningful improvement (Engel class III). In 15 patients (33%) in the Engel I group; it was possible to discontinue antiepileptic medication. Although there was not statistical significance, our results suggest that patients can benefit from early surgery. No deaths occurred in our study, and mild postoperative neurologic deficits were observed in two patients (4%) at the long-term follow-up. Surgical resection of CCMs should be considered in all patients with a supratentorial malformation and epilepsy due to the favourable surgical results in terms of the epileptic seizure control rate and low postoperative morbidity risk, despite the use of different predictors for the seizure outcome. ","1":"In this review, we provide information about the etiology, risk factors, and clinical presentations of maltreatment to help clinicians better understand child abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment is a major global health challenge that can result in severe consequences. Abused and neglected children are likely to develop psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Understanding child maltreatment is expected to prevent and reduce victimization in children, adolescents, and their families.","2":null,"3":"Abusive head trauma (AHT) is the most common and serious form of child abuse and a leading cause of traumatic death in infants and young children. The biomechanics of head injuries include violent shaking, blunt impact, or a combination of both. Neuroimaging plays an important role in recognizing and distinguishing abusive injuries from lesions from accidental trauma or other causes, because clinical presentation and medical history are often nonspecific and ambiguous in this age group. Understanding common imaging features of AHT can increase recognition with high specificity for AHT. In this review, we discuss the biomechanics of AHT, imaging features of AHT, and other conditions that mimic AHT.","4":"Subdural hematoma in infants can be caused by abuse, and is thought to be more likely if subdural hematoma is associated with retinal hemorrhage and cerebral edema. In Japan, few doctors disagree that cases of subdural hematoma with retinal hemorrhage and cerebral edema with multiple findings on the body are more likely to have been caused by abuse rather than by household accident. On the other hand, in cases where there are no other significant physical findings, only subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhage, there is a difference of opinion as to whether the injury was caused by an accident or abuse. The reason for this is that neurosurgeons in Japan promoted the concept that infants can develop subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrages due to minor trauma at home before the concept of abusive head trauma became known. In addition, the age distribution of subdural hematomas in Japan differs from that in other countries, with peaks at around 8 months, and the reason for this remains unclear. Therefore, the etiology of infant subdural hematoma in Japan needs to be investigated in greater detail.","5":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue that causes significant morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population. Pediatric minor TBIs are the most common and are widely underreported because not all patients seek medical attention. The specific management of these patients is distinct from that of adult patients because of the different physiologies in these age groups. This article focuses on minor TBIs, particularly growing skull fractures, traumatic cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and concussion.","6":"Abusive head trauma (AHT) in infants, especially acute subdural hematoma, has an extremely poor outcome. The most decisive and important finding is the appearance of a widespread low-density area on head computed tomography. This phenomenon was traditionally thought to be caused by cerebral ischemia. However, many other pathophysiological abnormalities have been found to be intricately involved. Recent studies have found that status epilepticus and hyperperfusion injures are the major causes. Another serious problem associated with AHT is cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Many infants are reported to visit to the hospital with CPA, and its pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. This paper examines the background of these pathological conditions and associated factors and elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in poor outcomes in AHT. In addition to the intensity of assault on the head, the peculiar pathophysiological characteristics in infants, as well as the social background specific to child abuse, are found to be associated with poor outcome.","7":"Abusive head trauma (AHT) is the most severe form of physical abuse in children. Such injury involves traumatic damage to the head and\/or spine of infants and young children. The term AHT was introduced to include a wider range of injury mechanisms, such as intentional direct blow, throw, and even penetrating trauma by perpetuator(s). Currently, it is recommended to replace the former term, shaken baby syndrome, which implicates shaking as the only mechanism, with AHT to include diverse clinical and radiological manifestations. The consequences of AHT cause devastating medical, social and financial burdens on families, communities, and victims. The potential harm of AHT to the developing brain and spinal cord of the victims is tremendous. Many studies have reported that the adverse effects of AHT are various and serious, such as blindness, mental retardation, physical limitation of daily activities and even psychological problems. Therefore, appropriate vigilance for the early recognition and diagnosis of AHT is highly recommended to stop and prevent further injuries. The aim of this review is to summarize the relevant evidence concerning the early recognition and diagnosis of AHT. To recognize this severe type of child abuse early, all health care providers maintain a high index of suspicion and vigilance. Such suspicion can be initiated with careful and thorough history taking and physical examinations. Previously developed clinical prediction rules can be helpful for decision-making regarding starting an investigation when considering meaningful findings. Even the combination of biochemical markers may be useful to predict AHT. For a more confirmative evaluation, neuroradiological imaging is required to find AHT-specific findings. Moreover, timely consultation with ophthalmologists is needed to find a very specific finding, retinal hemorrhage.","8":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children. Survivors of severe TBI are more susceptible to functional deficits, resulting in disability, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, and mental health problems. Despite this, little is known about the pathophysiology of TBI in children and how to manage it most effectively. Internationally, efforts are being made to expand knowledge of pathophysiology and develop practical clinical treatment recommendations to improve outcomes. Here we discuss recently updated evidence and management of severe pediatric TBI.","9":"Head injuries are the most common type of birth injuries. Among them, most of the injuries is limited to the scalp. and the prognosis is good enough to be unnoticed in some cases. Intracranial injuries caused by excessive forces during delivery are rare. However, since some of them can be fatal, it is necessary to suspect it at an early stage and evaluate thoroughly if there are abnormal findings in the patient.","10":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death in the pediatric population in Korea. In addition, it can cause disability in children and adolescents, with physical and mental consequences. This causes a substantial burden on the health care system and occurs globally and not just in Korea. We searched and reviewed current data on the epidemiologic characteristics of pediatric TBI in Korea. Our review provides the recent epidemiological trend mainly focusing on incidence and mortality along with worldwide reported data. This review will be helpful to understand the global epidemiology of pediatric TBI and its differences between countries.","11":"Dermoid cysts are uncommon in spinal cord tumors, and the phenomenon of their spontaneous rupture into the syrinx cavity is quite rare. We aimed to analyze the imaging characteristics and etiologies, and propose some surgical strategies, for this uncommon phenomenon. We retrospectively reviewed 14 cases with spinal dermoid cysts that ruptured into the cervical and thoracic syrinx cavity. There were six male and eight female cases, aged 21 to 46 years, who had lipid droplets in the syrinx cavity from C1 to L3. The dermoid cysts were always located at the conus. Based on patients' complaints, clinical manifestations, and imaging results, we adopted tumor excision and\/or syrinx cavity aspiration in one stage or multiple stages. Three patients had only a syrinx cavity aspiration surgery due to a history of dermoid cyst excision. Eight patients had dermoid cyst resection and syrinx cavity aspiration in one stage. One patient was operated upon in two stages due to the development of new symptoms at nine months follow-up. Two patients underwent only tumor resection since they did not show similar symptoms or signs caused by the cervicothoracic syrinx. The axial magnetic resonance imaging indicated that the lipid droplets were always not at the center but were eccentric. The clinical effect was satisfactory during the follow-up period in this group. The lipid droplets filled the spinal syrinx cavity, not entirely confined to the central canal. Based on the chief complaints and associated signs, we adopted different surgical strategies and had satisfactory clinical results. ","12":"Cranial base chordomas are rare, but their treatment is challenging. Tumor recurrence is still common despite improvements in microsurgical techniques and postoperative radiotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed the course of treatment, overall survival, and recurrence\/progression of chordomas over the past 10 years. We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients who underwent surgery at Tianjin Huanhu Hospital between 2010 and 2020 and were pathologically diagnosed with chordomas. Tumor resection was performed within the maximum safe range in all patients; the extent of resection was evaluated by imaging; and the incidence of complications, recurrence or progression, and overall survival were assessed. Fifty patients were divided into the low-risk group (LRG) and high-risk group (HRG) based on the cranial chordoma grading system (CCGS). The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores and gross total resection rate of the LRG were significantly higher than those of the HRG (p&lt;0.05). The incidence of complications and mortality in the LRG were lower than those of HRG. The analysis of cumulative survival and cumulative recurrence free survival\/progression free survival (RFS\/PFS) showed no statistical differences in the extent of resection for survival, recurrence, or progression. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that Ki-67 was significantly associated with tumor recurrence and was an independent hazard factor (p=0.02). The CCGS can help neurosurgeons anticipate surgical outcomes. Pathological results are important in evaluating the possibility of tumor recurrence, and postoperative radiotherapy improves overall survival and RFS\/PFS.

This article intends to review various aspects of pediatric spine trauma including epidemiology, anatomy and biomechanics, and clinically relevant details of each type of injury based on the location and mechanism of injury. With the appropriate but not superfluous treatment, pediatric spine trauma patients can have better chance of recovery. Therefore, as a spine surgeon, understanding the general concept for each injury subtype together with the debate and progress in the field is inevitable.","16":"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an overlapped stenting-assisted coiling technique in treating vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA) via LVIS stent-within-Neuroform EZ stent. From January 2017 to June 2019, 18 consecutive patients with VADAs (ruptured: unruptured = 5: 13) were treated with the overlapping stents assisted-coiling technique in our center. The overlapping manner was a Neuroform EZ stent being deployed first, followed by LVIS stents placement using the 'shelf' technique. The patients' clinical characteristics, technical feasibility and safety, and immediate and follow-up angiographic results were retrospectively reviewed. Seventeen (94.4%) procedures were technically successful with an exact deployment of the stents and patent parent or perforator arteries. The immediate angiographies after procedure confirmed Raymond class I, II, and III occlusion of VADAs were in 12 (66.7%), 2 (11.1%), and 4 cases (22.2%), respectively. Post-procedural complications developed in one patient (5.6%) with minor brainstem infarctions, which resulted from an in-stent thrombosis during the procedure. Angiographic follow-up at 5.7 months (range 3 to 9 months) demonstrated Raymond class I and II occlusion were in all cases (100%). The modified Rankin Scale scores at 21.3 months (range 15 to 42 months) 0-2 in 17 cases (94.4%) and 3 in one case (5.6%). Overlapping stents via LVIS stent-within-Neuroform EZ stent combined with coiling is safe and effective for patients with VADA in the midterm results. ","17":null,"18":"This prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic ramosetron administration against postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD). In this study, 100 patients undergoing MVD were randomly allocated to the control (normal saline, 2 ml) or ramosetron (ramosetron, 0.3 mg) groups at the end of surgery. The incidence and severity of PONV, need for rescue antiemetics, patient satisfaction score, duration of hospital stay, and the occurrence of adverse events were evaluated 48 h post-surgery. Data obtained from 97 patients were included in the final analysis. The incidence of PONV was significantly lower in the ramosetron group than in the control group throughout the 48-h postoperative period (29.2% vs. 51.0%, p=0.028). A similar trend was observed with regard to PONV severity (p=0.041). The need for rescue antiemetics, satisfaction score, duration of hospital stay, and the occurrence of adverse events did not significantly differ between the groups. Prophylactic ramosetron administration reduced the incidence and severity of PONV in patients undergoing MVD without causing serious adverse events. Thus, ramosetron use may improve patient recovery following MVD. ","19":"Various treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are known to yield initial satisfactory results; however, the surgical treatment has excellent long-term outcomes and a low recurrence rate. Surgical treatment addresses the challenge of vascular compression, which accounts for 85% of the causes of trigeminal neuralgia. As for surgical treatment for TN, microvascular decompression (MVD) has become the surgical treatment of choice after Peter J. Jannetta reported the results of MVD surgery in 1996. Since then, many studies have reported a success rate of over 90% for the initial surgical treatment. Most MVDs aim to separate (decompress) the culprit vessel from the trigeminal nerve. To increase the success rate of surgery, accurate indications for MVD and management of the offender vessels without complications are critical. In addition, if there is no vascular compression, partial sensory rhizotomy or internal neurolysis can be performed to improve surgical outcomes.","20":"We conducted this study with the aim of predicting the biological behavior of meningiomas, and determining the benefits of associating histological subtype and grade with the expression of proliferative markers and tumor suppressor proteins. The study included 29 patients with primary intracranial and intraspinal meningioma diagnosed in the pathology laboratory of our center between January 2014 and December 2020. Clinicopathological characteristics of the patients including parameters such as age and gender were obtained from the hospital records. Histopathological findings were obtained by re-evaluating the preparations stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E), which were extracted from the archive, and by evaluating new sections obtained from paraffin blocks of patients stained with Ki67, p53 and p57 immunohistochemical stains. A moderate correlation was found between tumor size and Ki67 proliferation index (PI) (p = 0.003, r = 0.530). There was no significant difference between Grade I and Grade II tumors in terms of p53 (p = 0.184) and p57 (p = 0.487) expressions. There were higher levels of Ki67 PI in Grade II tumors. The histological subtypes of the tumor had no significant difference with Ki67 PI (p = 0.018) and, p53 (p = 0.662) and p57 (p = 0.368) expressions. In order to obtain more definitive results, there is a need for studies, which are conducted with a greater number of patients and in multiple centers, and in which a long prospective follow-up is planned. The combination of histological, surgical, and imaging markers could make a more sensitive tool for predicting recurrence, and this could also be tested in future studies. ","21":"The primary objective of this study was to identify predicting factors for local control (LC) of atypical meningioma, and we validated them with comparing the predicting factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS). We also examined the rate of LC after surgical resection with or without adjuvant treatment and RFS. Clinical and radiological records of patients with atypical meningiomas diagnosed at two institutes from January 2000 to December 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Histopathological features were also reviewed using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples from pathological archives. Of the 99 atypical meningiomas eligible for analysis, 36 (36.4%) recurred during the follow-up period (mean 83.3 months, range 12-232 months). The rate of 3-year LC and 5-year LC was 80.8% and 74.7% respectively. The mean time-to-recurrence was 49.4 months (range 12-150 months). The mean RFS was 149.3 months (95% CI 128.8-169.8 months) during the mean follow-up duration of 83.3 months (range 12-232 months). Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional-hazard regression model showed that the extent of resection (Hazard ratio [HR] 4.761, p=0.013), Ki67 index (HR 8.541, p=0.004), mitotic index (HR 3.275, p=0.044), and tumor size (HR 3.228, p=0.041) were independently associated with LC. These factors was also statistically associated with recurrence-free survival. In terms of radiotherapy after surgical resection, the recurrence was not prevented by immediate radiotherapy because of the strong effect of proliferative index on recurrence. The present study suggests that the extent of resection, proliferative index (according to Ki67 expression) and mitotic index, and tumor size are associated with recurrence of atypical meningiomas. However, our results should be further validated through prospective and randomized clinical trials to overcome the inborn bias of retrospective nature of the study design. ","22":"Development of de novo dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) at a different site after resolution of an initial DAVF, is rare. Here we report two cases, which we encountered in our hospital. A 68-year-old woman presented with pulsatile tinnitus on the left side. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a left anterior condylar confluence (ACC) DVAF and she underwent transvenous embolization. Four years after this treatment, she presented with tinnitus on the left side, and cerebral angiography revealed a right DAVF around the sinus of the lesser sphenoid wing. Another 69-year-old woman presented with left-sided orbital bruits, chemosis, and conjunctival hyperemia. Cerebral angiography showed left cavernous sinus (CS) DAVF, for which she underwent transvenous embolization for CS DAVF. One year later, she developed a left ACC and transverse-sigmoid sinus (TSS) DAVF.","23":"Compared to microscopes, exoscopes have advantages in field-depth, ergonomics, and educational value. Exoscopes are especially well-poised for adaptation into fluorescence- guided surgery (FGS) due to their excitation source, light path, and image processing capabilities. We evaluated the feasibility of near-infrared FGS using a 3-dimensional, 4K exoscope with near-infrared fluorescence imaging capability. We then compared it to the most sensitive, commercially-available near-infrared exoscope system (3D and 960p). In-vitro and intraoperative comparisons were performed. Serial dilutions of indocyanine-green (1-2000ug\/mL) were imaged with the 3D, 4K Olympus Orbeye (System 1) and the 3D, 960p VisionSense Iridium (System 2). Near-infrared sensitivity was calculated using signal-to-background ratios (SBR). In addition, three patients with brain tumors were administered indocyanine-green and imaged with System 1, with two also imaged with System 2 for comparison. Systems 1 and 2 detected near-infrared fluorescence from ICG concentrations of &gt;250ug\/L and &gt;31.3ug\/L, respectively. Intraoperatively, System 1 visualized strong near-infrared fluorescence from two, strongly gadolinium-enhancing meningiomas (SBR=2.4, 1.7). The high-resolution, bright images were sufficient for the surgeon to appreciate the underlying anatomy in the near-infrared mode. However, System 1 was not able to visualize fluorescence from a weakly-enhancing intraparenchymal metastasis. In contrast, System 2 successfully visualized both the meningioma and the metastasis but lacked high resolution stereopsis. Three-dimensional exoscope systems provide an alternative visualization platform for both standard microsurgery and near-infrared fluorescent guided surgery. However, when tumor fluorescence is weak (i.e. low fluorophore uptake, deep tumors), highly sensitive near- infrared visualization systems may be required. ","24":"The clinical management paradigm of skull base chordomas is still challenging. Surgical resection plays an important role of affecting the prognosis. Endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA) has gradually become the preferred surgical approach in most cases, but traditional transcranial surgery cannot be completely replaced. This study presents a comparison of the results of the two surgical strategies and a summary of the treatment algorithms for skull base chordomas. We retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcomes and follow-up data of 48 patients with skull base chordomas diagnosed pathologically who received transnasal midline approaches (TMA) and transcranial lateral approaches (TLA) from 2010 to 2020. Among the 48 patients, 36 cases were adopted TMA and 12 cases were performed with TLA. In terms of gross total resection (GTR) rate, 27.8% in TMA and 16.7% in TLA and with EEA alone it was increased to 38.9%, while 29.7% in primary surgery. In TMA, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak remains the most common complication (13 cases, 36.1%), other main complications included death, cranial nerve palsy, hypopituitarism, all the comparisons were no statistical significance. The Karnofsky Performance Scale scores in TMA were all better than those in TLA at different time, and the overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival\/progression free survival was just the reverse. The EEA for skull base chordomas resection has improved the GTR rate, but transcranial approach is still an alternative approach. It is necessary to select an appropriate surgical approach based on the location and the pattern of tumor growth in order to obtain the best surgical outcomes. ","25":"The surgical management of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) caused by petrous apex meningioma (PAM) is still a challenge because of the lesion's deep location and the surrounding complex structures. The authors describe the intradural anterior transpetrosal approach (ATPA) and its effect on the treatment of TN secondary to PAM. A retrospective analysis of 15 patients with TN secondary to PAM who underwent surgery via the intradural ATPA was conducted. The key techniques, which included drilling off the petrosal apex (PA) and opening the upper wall of Meckel's cave (MC), are described in detail. Total removal of the tumor and complete pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute I) were achieved in all 15 patients without significant morbidity. Five patients developed new facial numbness postoperatively, which disappeared within three months after surgery. The postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed temporal lobe swelling in three patients, but no clinical symptoms. One patient had cerebrospinal fluid leakage and was managed with bed rest and temporary lumbar drainage. One patient had an intracranial infection and was treated with antibiotics. By the last follow up, no patients had pain relapse or\/and tumor recurrence. It is worth noting that the vascular compression at the root of the trigeminal nerve was found in one patient during the operation. Our experience suggests that drilling off the PA and opening the upper wall of the MC are key elements for a good outcome of the treatment of TN secondary to PAM. The intradural ATPA has the advantages for both tumor resection and pain relief.

Studies on hemorrhagic stroke are also being conducted, mainly in the USA and China. However, little research has been conducted in Korea. In reality, stem cell research or treatment is unfamiliar to many domestic neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, given the increased interest in regenerative medicine and the increase of life expectancy, attention should be paid to this topic. In this paper, we summarized pre-clinical rodent studies and clinical trials using stem cells for hemorrhagic stroke.

The authors aimed to determine whether such drugs can cause neurotoxicity due to local effects in a rat model. Intra-arterial catheters were placed in the right common carotid artery of rats. Mannitol was injected to transiently open the brain-blood barrier (BBB), followed by high-dose drug (paclitaxel and rapamycin) injection. The optimal time interval of transient BBB opening for maximal drug penetration was determined to be 10 minutes. Paclitaxel and rapamycin were intraarterially administered in various doses. All the rats were neurologically evaluated, and their brain tissues were histologically examined. Neither neurological deficits nor histological abnormalities were observed in all the rats. Paclitaxel and rapamycin did not cause neurotoxicity in a rat model with transient BBB opening.

As the new dissecting threads were developed domestically, this cadaver study was conducted to compare the effectiveness and safety between the new threads (ultra V sswire and smartwire-01) and a pre-existing commercial dissecting thread (loop &amp; shear) by demonstrating a modified looped thread cubital tunnel release. The percutaneous cubital tunnel release procedure was performed on 29 fresh cadaveric upper extremities. The preexisting commercial thread was used in 5 upper extremities. The two newly developed threads were used in 24 upper extremities. Two practitioners performed the procedures separately. After the modified looped thread cubital release, anatomical and histological analyses were performed by a blinded anatomist. The presence of the dissected cubital tunnel and damaged adjacent soft tissue was assessed. Out of the 29 cadaveric upper extremities, 27 specimens showed complete dissection of the Osborne ligament and the proximal fascia of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. One specimen was incompletely dissected in each of the ultra V sswire and smartwire-01 groups. There were no injuries of adjacent structures including the ulnar nerve, ulnar artery, medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, or flexor tendon with either the commercial thread or the newly developed threads. The anatomical analysis revealed clear and sharp incisional margins of the cubital tunnel in the Smartwire-01 and loop &amp; shear groups. All three kinds of threads maintained proper linear elasticity for easy handling during the procedure. The smartwire-01 provided higher visibility in ultrasound than the other threads. The newly developed threads were effective and safe for use in the thread cubital tunnel release procedure.

However, its clinical efficacy in regard to specific types of pain has not been well studied. The primary objective of this study was to retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes of paddle-type SCS according to the type of neuropathic pain. Seventeen patients who underwent paddle-lead SCS at our hospital were examined. Clinical outcomes were evaluated pre- and postoperatively (3 months, 1 year, and last follow-up) using the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI). The NPSI categorizes pain as superficial, deep, paroxysmal, evoked, or dysesthesia and assess the duration of the pain (pain time score). Changes in NPSI scores were compared with change in Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. After SCS, the pain time score improved by 45% (independent t-test, p=0.0002) and the deep pain score improved by 58% (independent t-test, p=0.001). Improvements in the pain time score significantly correlated with improvements in the VAS score (r=0.667, p=0.003, Spearman correlation). Additionally, the morphine milligram equivalent value was markedly lower after vs. before surgery (~49 mg, pared t-test, p=0.002). No preoperative value was associated with clinical outcome. The NPSI is a useful tool for evaluating the therapeutic effects of SCS. Chronic use of a paddle-type spinal cord stimulation improved the deep pain and the pain time scores.

We considered cage subsidence as an inappropriate indicator for evaluating preservation of disc height. Thus, this study aimed to consider patients with complications such as reduced total disc height compared to that before surgery and evaluate the relevance of several factors before ACDF. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 40 patients who underwent stand-alone single-level ACDF using a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage at our institution between January 2012 and December 2018. Our study population comprised 19 male and 21 female patients aged 24-70 years. The minimum follow-up period was 1 year. Twenty-seven patients had preoperative bone mineral density (BMD) data on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Clinical parameters included sex, age, body mass index, smoking history, and prior medical history. Radiologic parameters included the C2-7 cobb angle, segmental angle, sagittal vertical axis, disc height, and total intervertebral height (TIH) at the preoperative and postoperative periods. Cage decrement was defined as the reduction in TIH at the 6-month follow-up compared to preoperative TIH. To evaluate the bone quality, Hounsfield unit (HU) value was calculated in the axial and sagittal images of conventional computed tomography. Lumbar BMD values and cervical HU values were significantly correlated (r=0.733, p&lt;0.001). We divided the patients into two groups based on cage decrement, and 47.5% of the total patients were regarded as cage decrement. There were statistically significant differences in the parameters of measuring the HU value of the vertebra and intraoperative distraction between the two groups. Using these identified factors, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Based on the ROC curve, the cut-off point was 530 at the HU value of the upper cortical and cancellous vertebrae (p=0.014; area under the curve [AUC], 0.727; sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 42.9%) and 22.41 at intraoperative distraction (p=0.017; AUC, 0.722; sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 57.9%). Using this value, we converted these parameters into a bifurcated variable and assessed the multinomial regression analysis to evaluate the risk factors for cage decrement in ACDF. Intraoperative distraction and HU value of the upper vertebral body were independent factors of postoperative subsidence. Insufficient intraoperative distraction and low HU value showed a strong relationship with postoperative intervertebral height reduction following single stand-alone PEEK cage ACDF. ","41":"To evaluate the interactions among differentially expressed autophagy and mitophagy markers in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The expression data of autophagy and mitophagy-related makers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The markers included death-associated protein kinase (DAPK)-1, BCL2 interacting protein 3 like (BNIP3L), Bcl-1 antagonist X, phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase (PINK), Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1, nuclear dot protein 52, and p62. In silico functional analyses including gene ontology enrichment and the protein-protein interaction network were performed. A total of 56 SAH patients were included and 22 (38.6%) of them experienced DCI. The DCI patients had significantly increased mRNA levels of DAPK1, BNIP3L, and PINK1, and increased expression of BECN1 compared to the non-DCI patients. The most enriched biological process was the positive regulation of autophagy, followed by the response to mitochondrial depolarization. The molecular functions ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding and ubiquitin-protein ligase binding were enriched. In the cluster of cellular components, Lewy bodies and the phagophore assembly site were enriched. BECN1 was the most connected gene among the differentially expressed markers related to autophagy and mitophagy in the development of DCI. Our study may provide novel insight into mitochondrial dysfunction in DCI pathogenesis. ","42":"Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure is a well established medical procedure. Still, little is known about long-term behavior of intracranial pressure in normal pressure hydrocephalus. The present study is designed to evaluate periodicity of intracranial pressure over long-time scales using intraventricular pressure monitoring in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. In addition, the circadian and diurnal patterns of blood pressure and body temperature in those patients are studied. Four patients, selected with \"probable\" normal pressure hydrocephalus, were monitored for several dozen hours. Intracranial pressure, blood pressure, and body temperature were recorded hourly. Autocorrelation functions were calculated and cross-correlation analysis were carried out to study all the time-series data. Autocorrelation results show that intracranial pressure, blood pressure, and body temperature values follow bimodal (positive and negative) curves over a day. The cross-correlation functions demonstrate causal relationships between intracranial pressure, blood pressure, and body temperature. The results show that long-term fluctuations in intracranial pressure exhibit cyclical patterns with periods of about 24 hours. Continuous intracranial pressure recording in \"probable\" normal pressure hydrocephalus patients reveals circadian fluctuations not related to the day and night cycle. These fluctuations are causally related to changes in blood pressure and body temperature. The present study reveals the complete loss of the diurnal blood pressure and body temperature rhythmicities in patients with \"probable\" normal pressure hydrocephalus.","43":"Lesions occurring simultaneously in the somatosensory or motor cortex of the brain and the cervical spine are rare. Brain tumors can cause similar symptoms to cervical lesions which can lead to confusion in treatment priorities. Moreover, if cervical disease is noticeably observed in radiologic findings of a patient complaining of cervical radiculopathy with non-specific electromyography results, it is common to no longer perform further evaluation. Here we introduce two cases where the cause of cervical radiculopathy was first considered to be the result of a degenerative cervical disease but was later discovered to be a result of a brain tumor.","44":"The etiology of angiographically occult spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (AOsSAH) is unclear. Threedimensional (3D) high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (HVM) might be useful in detecting the hidden arterial wall angiopathy in patients with AOsSAH. We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of HVM for detecting the arterial cause of AOsSAH. Patients, who were diagnosed with AOsSAH in the first evaluations and underwent HVM, were enrolled. Their clinical and radiologic data were retrospectively reviewed. Especially, focal enhancement of arterial wall on HVM and repetitive catheterized angiograms were precisely compared. Among 251 patients with spontaneous SAH, 22 patients were diagnosed with AOsSAH in the first evaluations (8.76%). After excluding three patients who did not undergo 3D-HVM, 19 patients were enrolled and classified as convexal (n=2) or perimesencephalic (n=4), and diffuse (n=13) groups. In convexal and perimesencephalic groups, no focal enhancement on HVM and no positive findings on repetitive angiography were noted. In diffuse group, 10 patients showed focal enhancement of arterial wall on HVM (10\/13, 76.9%). Repeated angiography with 3D reconstruction revealed four patients of angiographically positive causative arteriopathy and possible lesion in one case in the concordant location of intramural enhancement on 3D-HVM (5\/10, 50%). Three of them were treated with endovascular stent insertion. All patients, except one, recovered with good clinical outcome (3-month modified Rankin score, 0 and 1). 3D-HVM was useful in detecting hidden true arteriopathy in AOsSAH. It may provide new insights into the etiologic investigation of AOsSAH by proving information about the arterial wall status. ","45":"There are different types of cerebral vascular malformations. Pial arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs) and dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are two entities; they consist of one or more arterial connections to a single venous outlet without a true intervening nidus. The high turbulent flow of PAVFs and aggressive DAVFs with cortical venous reflux can result in venous outflow varix and aneurysmal dilatation. They pose a significant challenge to transvenous embolization (TVE), stereotactic radiosurgery, and surgical treatment. We aim to share our centers' experience with the transarterial embolization (TAE) for arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) with large venous pouches and to report the outcome. The authors' two institutions' databases were retrospectively reviewed from February 2017 to February 2021. All patients with intracranial high flow PAVFs and aggressive DAVFs with venous outlet ectasia and large venous varix and were treated by TAE were included. Fifteen patients harboring 11 DAVFs and four PAVFs met our inclusion criteria. All patients underwent TAE in 17 sessions. Complete angiographic obliteration was achieved after 14 sessions in 12 patients (80%). Four patients (25%) had residual after one TAE session. Technical failure was documented in one patient (6.7%). Fourteen patients (93.3%) had favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin score 0-2). TAE for high flow or aggressive intracranial AVFs is a safe and considerable treatment option, especially for those associated with large venous pouches that are challenging and relatively high-risk for TVE. ","46":"To study the factors relating to operative treatment for spinal metastasis in Thailand during 2005-2014 and to determine the hospital costs, mortality rate, and incidence of perioperative complication. Inpatient reimbursement data from 2005 to 2014 was reviewed from three national healthcare organizations, including the National Health Security Office, the Social Security Office, and the Comptroller General's Department. The search criteria were secondary malignant neoplasm of bone and bone marrow patients (International Classification of Diseases 10th revision, Thai modification codes [ICD 10-TM], C79.5 and C79.8) who underwent spinal surgical treatment (ICD 9th revision, clinical modification procedure with extension codes [ICD 9-CM], 03.0, 03.4, 03.09, and 81.0) during 2005-2014. Epidemiology, comorbidity, and perioperative complication were analyzed. During the study period, the number of spinal metastasis patients who underwent operative treatment was significantly increased from 0.30 to 0.59 per 100000 (p&lt;0.001). More males (56.14%) underwent surgical treatment for spinal metastasis than females. The most common age group was 45-64 (55.1%). The most common primary tumor sites were the unknown origin, lung, breast, prostate, and hepatocellular\/bile duct. Interestingly, the proportion of hepatocellular\/bile duct, breast, and lung cancer was significantly increased (p&lt;0.001). The number of patients who had comorbidity or in-hospital complication significantly increased over time (p&lt;0.01); however, the in-hospital mortality rate decreased. During the last decade, operative treatment for spinal metastasis increased in Thailand. The overall in-hospital complication rate increased; however, the in-hospital mortality rate decreased. ","47":"Early descent of the diaphragm sellae (DS) during endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) for pituitary macroadenoma surgery is occasionally a troublesome event by blocking the surgical field. Here we introduce an alternative technique with the new pituitary retractor and present our clinical experiences. We designed a simple and rigid pituitary retractor with the least space occupation in the nasal cavity to be compatible in EETS. The pituitary retractor was held by external holder system to support the herniated DS stably. We retrospectively reviewed a clinical 22 cases of pituitary macroadenomas underwent EETS using the pituitary retractor. The pituitary retractor stably pushed up the herniated DS in all cases, and the surgeon proceeded the procedure with bimanual maneuver. The pituitary retractor was helpful to remove tumors around the medial cavernous sinus and behind the DS in 16 and seven cases, respectively. In four cases, the meticulous hemostasis was completed with the direct visualization by the DS elevation with this retractor. Gross total tumor resection was performed in 20\/22 patients (91%). The impaired visual function and hypopituitarism were improved in 18\/20 (90%) and 7\/14 (50%) patients after surgery, respectively. There was no complication related with the pituitary retractor. During EETS for pituitary macroadenomas, the novel pituitary retractor reported in this study is a very useful technique when the herniated DS block the surgical field and bimanual maneuver. This pituitary retractor can help to result in the excellent surgical outcomes with minimal morbidity. ","48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":"Disabilities can emerge due to traumatic spinal fractures. In terms of sacrococcygeal spine, because of its unique anatomic structure with minimal movement, the possibility for it to have a disability is relatively low. In Korea, unlike most disability criteria, private insurance companies acknowledge angular deformities caused by vertebral fractures as disabilities according to their degree, so there were several cases where patients required compensation, arguing angular deformity caused by sacrococcygeal fracture, which in some cases led to legal conflicts. Except the Act Welfare of Persons with Disabilities which recognizes only severe angular deformity affecting internal organs as disability and the industrial accident disability evaluation which does not recognize coccygeal fracture as disability but rarely recognizes sacral vertebra deformity equivalent to compressive deformation, there is little or no case where angular deformity is recognized as disability. Given the impairment evaluation standards in social insurance, McBride system, American Medical Association (AMA) guides, and newly proposed standards by the Korean Academy of Medical Sciences (KAMS), the most contentious point in the general terms and conditions of private insurance is spinal deformity. To overcome controversy over disability evaluation, the private insurance sector is now applying criteria for axial skeleton to sacrococcygeal vertebrae through revision of standards. Under these circumstances, it is fair to recognize sacrococcygeal fracture as impairment in terms of the pelvis only when the fracture leaves serious deformity and neurological symptoms with clear relevancy. Though it may not be easy to develop accurate disability evaluation standards, improvement is necessary to remove any irrationalities and make the standards as objective as possible.","52":null,"53":"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, neurointerventionists have been increasingly concerned regarding the prevention of infection and time delay in performing emergency thrombectomy procedures in patients with acute stroke. This study aimed to analyze the effects of changes in mechanical thrombectomy protocol before and after the COVID-19 pandemic on procedure time and patient outcomes and to identify factors that significantly impact procedure time. The last-normal-to-door, first-abnormal-to-door, door-to-imaging, door-to-puncture, and puncture-to-recanalization times of 88 patients (45 treated with conventional pre-COVID-19 protocol and 43 with COVID-19 protection protocol) were retrospectively analyzed. The recanalization time, success rate of mechanical thrombectomy, and modified Rankin score of patients at discharge were assessed. A multivariate analysis was conducted to identify variables that significantly influenced the time delay in the door-to-puncture time and total procedure time. The door-to-imaging time significantly increased under the COVID-19 protection protocol (p=0.0257) compared to that with the conventional pre-COVID-19 protocol. This increase was even more pronounced in patients who were suspected to be COVID-19-positive than in those who were negative. The door-to-puncture time showed no statistical difference between the conventional and COVID-19 protocol groups (p=0.5042). However, in the multivariate analysis, the last-normal-to-door time and door-to-imaging time were shown to affect the door-to-puncture time (p=0.0068 and 0.0097). The total procedure time was affected by the occlusion site, last-normal-to-door time, door-to-imaging time, and type of anesthesia (p=0.0001, 0.0231, 0.0103, and 0.0207, respectively). The COVID-19 protection protocol significantly impacted the door-to-imaging time. Shortening the door-to-imaging time and performing the procedure under local anesthesia, if possible, may be required to reduce the door-to-puncture and doorto- recanalization times. The effect of various aspects of the protection protocol on emergency thrombectomy should be further studied. ","54":"Various grading systems and surgical techniques have been developed for the treatment of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH); however, little attention has been paid to the fourth ventricle hematoma. Nonetheless, hemorrhagic dilation of the fourth ventricle may lead to catastrophic consequences for patients with massive IVH. We present two cases of massive IVH accompanied by massive fourth ventricle hematoma which was successfully removed with combination of suboccipital craniotomy for fourth ventricle hematoma and intraventricular fibrinolysis for supratentorial hematoma.","55":"Despite many advancements in endovascular treatment, the benefits of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with large infarctions remain uncertain due to hemorrhagic complications. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of recanalization via MT within 6 hours after stroke in patients with large cerebral infarction volumes (&gt;70 mL). We retrospectively reviewed the medical data of 30 patients with large lesions on initial diffusion-weighted imaging (&gt;70 mL) who underwent MT at our institution within 6 hours after stroke onset. Baseline data, recanalization rate, and 3-month clinical outcomes were analyzed. Successful recanalization was defined as a modified treatment in cerebral ischemia score of 2b or 3. The recanalization rate was 63.3%, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in six patients (20%). The proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 0-3 was significantly higher in the recanalization group than in the non-recanalization group (47.4% vs. 9.1%, p=0.049). The mortality rate was higher in the non-recanalization group, this difference was not significant (15.8% vs. 36.4%, p=0.372). In the analysis of 3-month clinical outcomes, only successful recanalization was significantly associated with mRS scores of 0-3 (90% vs. 50%, p=0.049). The odds ratio of recanalization for favorable outcomes (mRS 0-3) was 9.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.95-84.90; p=0.055).

A 52-year-old woman had hemicords within a single dural sac with a dorsal bony septum at the L5 level. A 9-year-old boy had hemicords within a single dural sac with a ventral bony septum and fibrous extension at the L3 level. Both patients underwent microsurgical treatments for removing the bony septum, detethering the spinal cord, and sectioning the filum terminale. The surgical procedure revealed an extradural partial bony septum and hemicords within an intact single dural sac in each patient. Both patients were discharged from the hospital without de novo nerve dysfunction. Published cases have validated that types I and II SCM can overlap. We recommend recent type 1.5 SCM as a normative terminology for this overlapping SCM and report two rare cases of this SCM. We propose an associated pathogenesis consisting of uneven distribution and regression to explain type 1.5 SCM. Furthermore, we postulate that the amount of condensing meninx primitiva might determine whether the left bony septum has fibrous extensions to the opposite dura in type 1.5 SCM.","58":null,"59":"Nontraumatic subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common disease, and spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is a possible etiology of unknown significance, which is commonly investigated by several invasive studies. This study demonstrates that heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance myelography (HT2W-MRM) is a safe and clinically effective imaging modality for detecting CSF leakage in patients with nontraumatic SDH. All patients who underwent HT2W-MRM for nontraumatic SDH workup at our institution were searched and enrolled in this study. Several parameters were measured and analyzed, including patient demographic data, initial modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score upon presentation, SDH bilaterality, hematoma thickness upon presentation, CSF leakage sites, treatment modalities, follow-up hematoma thickness, and follow-up mRS score. Forty patients were identified, of which 22 (55.0%) had CSF leakage at various spinal locations. Five patients (12.5%) showed no change in mRS score, whereas the remaining (87.5%) showed decreases in follow-up mRS scores. In terms of the overall hematoma thickness, four patients (10.0%) showed increased thickness, two (5.0%) showed no change, 32 (80.0%) showed decreased thickness, and two (5.0%) did not undergo follow-up imaging for hematoma thickness measurement. HT2W-MRM is not only safe but also clinically effective as a primary diagnostic imaging modality to investigate CSF leakage in patients with nontraumatic SDH. Moreover, this study suggests that CSF leakage is a common etiology for nontraumatic SDH, which warrants changes in the diagnosis and treatment strategies.

We aimed to assess the current clinical management and outcomes for CSDH patients and identify prognostic factors for CSDH recurrence. We enrolled a total of 293 consecutive patients with CSDH who underwent burr hole craniostomy at seven institutions in 2018. Clinical and surgery-related characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed. The cohort included 208 men and 85 women. The median patient age was 75 years. Antithrombotic agents were prescribed to 105 patients. History of head trauma was identified in 59% of patients. Two hundred twenty-seven of 293 patients (77.5%) had unilateral hematoma and 46.1% had a homogenous hematoma type. About 70% of patients underwent surgery under general anesthesia, and 74.7% underwent a single burr hole craniostomy surgery. Recurrence requiring surgery was observed in 17 of 293 patients (5.8%), with a median of 32 days to recurrence. The postoperative complication rate was 4.1%. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with CSDH recurrence were separated hematoma type (odds ratio, 3.906; p=0.017) and patient who underwent surgery under general anesthesia had less recurrence (odds ratio, 0.277; p=0.017). This is the first retrospective multicenter generalized cohort pilot study in the Republic of Korea as a first step towards the development of Korean clinical practice guidelines for CSDH. The type of hematoma and anesthesia was associated with CSDH recurrence. Although the detailed surgical method differs depending on the institution, the surgical treatment of CSDH was effective. Further studies may establish appropriate management guidelines to minimize CSDH recurrence. ","64":"Biodegradable poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) with a highly biocompatible surface via tantalum (Ta) ion implantation can be an innovative solution for the problems associated with current biodegradable stents. The purpose of this study is to develop a Ta-implanted PLLA stent for clinical use and to investigate its biological performance capabilities. A series of in vitro and in vivo tests were used to assess the biological performance of bare and Ta-implanted PLLA stents. The re-endothelialization ability and thrombogenicity were examined through in vitro endothelial cell and platelet adhesion tests. An in vivo swine model was used to evaluate the effects of Ta ion implantation on subacute restenosis and thrombosis. Angiographic and histologic evaluations were conducted at one, two and three months post-treatment. The Ta-implanted PLLA stent was successfully fabricated, exhibiting a smooth surface morphology and modified layer integration. After Ta ion implantation, the surface properties were more favorable for rapid endothelialization and for less platelet attachment compared to the bare PLLA stent. In an in vivo animal test, follow-up angiography showed no evidence of in-stent stenosis in either group. In a microscopic histologic examination, luminal thrombus formation was significantly suppressed in the Ta-implanted PLLA stent group according to the 2-month follow-up assessment (21.2% vs. 63.9%, p=0.005). Cells positive for CD 68, a marker for the monocyte lineage, were less frequently identified around the Ta-implanted PLLA stent in the 1-month follow-up assessments. The use of a Ta-implanted PLLA stent appears to promote re-endothelialization and anti-thrombogenicity. ","65":"Psoas and masseter muscles are known markers of sarcopenia. However, the relative superiority of either muscle as a marker is unclear. Therefore, this study analyzed the two muscles in patients with a prognosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients with TBI visiting a regional trauma center between January 2017 and December 2018 were selected, and their medical records were reviewed. TBI patients with an abbreviated injury score (AIS) of 4 or 5 were selected. Patients with an AIS of 4 or 5 at the chest, abdomen, and extremity were excluded. Patients with a hospital stay of 1 to 2 days were excluded. Both muscle areas were measured based on the initial computed tomography. The psoas muscle index (PMI) and the masseter muscle index (MMI) were calculated by dividing both muscle areas by height in meters squared (cm2\/m2). These muscle parameters along with other medical information were used to analyze mortality and the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). A total of 179 patients, including 147 males (82.1%), were analyzed statistically. The mean patient age was 58.0 years. The mortality rate was 16.8% (30 patients). The mean GOS score was 3.7. Analysis was performed to identify the parameters associated with mortality, which was a qualitative study outcome. The psoas muscle area (16.9 vs. 14.4 cm2, p=0.028) and PMI (5.9 vs. 5.1 cm2\/m2, p=0.004) showed statistical differences between the groups. The PMI was also statistically significant as a risk factor for mortality in logistic regression analysis (p=0.023; odds ratio, 0.715; 95% confidence interval, 0.535-0.954). Quantitative analyses were performed with the GOS scores. Bivariate correlation analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between PMI and GOS scores (correlation coefficient, 0.168; p=0.003). PMI (p=0.004, variation inflation factor 1.001) was significant in multiple regression analysis. The masseter muscle area and MMI did not show significance in the study. Larger PMI was associated with statistically significant improved survival and GOS scores, indicating its performance as a superior prognostic marker. Further analyses involving a larger number of patients, additional parameters, and more precise settings would yield a better understanding of sarcopenia and TBI. ","66":"The stability is an important factor to decide the treatment plan in thoracolumbar burst fracture patients. Patients with an unstable burst fracture generally need operative management. Decrease in vertebral body height, local kyphosis, involvement of posterior column, and\/or canal compromise are considered important factors to determine the treatment plan. On the other hand, in thoracolumbar injury classification system (TLICS), surgery is recommended in patients with TLICS of more than 5 points. The purpose of this study was to apply the TLICS score in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and to distinguish the differences of treatment plan on burst fracture. All patients, diagnosed as a thoracolumbar burst fracture between January 2006 and February 2019 were included in this study. Unstable thoracolumbar burst fracture was defined as burst fracture with neurologic deficit, three-column injury, kyphosis over 30 degrees, decrease of anterior body height over 40 percent and canal comprise more than 50%. TLICS score was measured with morphology, neurological involvement and posterior ligamentous complex integrity. The existence of instability was compared with TLICS score. Total 233 patients (131 men, 102 women) were included in this study. In Denis classification, 51 patients (21.9%) diagnosed as stable burst fracture while 182 patients (78.1%) had unstable burst fracture. According to TLICS, 72 patients (30.9%) scored less than 4, while 161 patients (69.1%) scored 4 or more. All the patients with stable burst fracture scored 2 in TLICS. Twenty-one patients (9.0) scored 2 in TLICS but diagnosed as unstable burst fracture. Thirteen patients had over 40% of vertebra body compression, four patients had more than 50% of canal compromise, three patients had both body compression over 40% and kyphosis over 30 degrees, one patients had both body compression and canal compromise. Fifteen patients presented kyphosis over 30 degrees, and three (20%) of them scored 2 in TLICS. Seventy-three patients presented vertebral body compression over 40% and 17 (23.3%) of them scored 2 in TLICS. Fifty-three patients presented spinal canal compromise more than 50%, and five (9.4%) of them scored 2 in TLICS. Although the instability of thoracolumbar burst fracture was regarded as a critical factor for operability, therapeutic strategies by TLICS do not exactly match with the concept of instability. According to the concept of TLICS, it should be reconsidered whether the unstable burst fracture truly unstable to do operation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of maximizing the radiation dose in GKR and the factors influencing tumor control in cases of small and medium-sized brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed 230 metastatic brain tumors less than 5 mL in volume in 146 patients with NSCLC who underwent GKR. The patients had no previous radiation therapy for brain metastases. The pathologies of the tumors were adenocarcinoma (n=207), squamous cell carcinoma (n=18), and others (n=5). The radiation doses were classified as 18, 20, 22, and 24 Gy, and based on the tumor volume, the tumors were categorized as follows : small-sized (less than 1 mL) and medium-sized (1-3 and 3-5 mL). The progression-free survival (PFS) of the individual 230 tumors and 146 brain metastases was evaluated after GKR depending on the pathology, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score (PS), tumor volume, radiation dose, and anti-cancer regimens. The radiotoxicity after GKR was also evaluated. After GKR, the restricted mean PFS of individual 230 tumors at 24 months was 15.6 months (14.0-17.1). In small-sized tumors, as the dose of radiation increased, the tumor control rates tended to increase (p=0.072). In medium-sized tumors, there was no statistically difference in PFS with an increase of radiation dose (p=0.783). On univariate analyses, a statistically significant increase in PFS was associated with adenocarcinomas (p=0.001), tumors with ECOG PS 0 (p=0.005), small-sized tumors (p=0.003), radiation dose of 24 Gy (p=0.014), synchronous lesions (p=0.002), and targeted therapy (p=0.004). On multivariate analyses, an improved PFS was seen with targeted therapy (hazard ratio, 0.356; 95% confidence interval, 0.150-0.842; p=0.019). After GKR, the restricted mean PFS of brain at 24 months was 9.8 months (8.5-11.1) in 146 patients, and the pattern of recurrence was mostly distant within the brain (66.4%). The small and medium-sized tumors treated with GKR showed radiotoxicitiy in five out of 230 tumors (2.2%), which were controlled with medical treatment. The small-sized tumors were effectively controlled without symptomatic radiation necrosis as the radiation dose was increased up to 24 Gy. The medium-sized tumors showed potential for symptomatic radiation necrosis without signifcant tumor control rate, when greater than 18 Gy. GKR combined targeted therapy improved the tumor control of GKR-treated tumors.

Sixty-four patients with recurrent TN admitted to the hospital from January 2014 to December 2017 were divided into two groups according to the surgical method. Twenty-nine patients, admitted from January 2014 to December 2015, were treated with MVD alone, whereas 35 admitted from January 2016 to December 2017 were treated with MVD+IN. The postoperative efficacy, complications, and pain recurrence rate of the two groups were analyzed. The efficacy of the MVD+IN and MVD groups were 88.6% and 86.2%, and the cure rates were 77.1% and 65.5% respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p&gt;0.05). The cure rate (83.3%) of patients in the MVD+IN group, who were only found thickened arachnoid adhesions during the operation that could not be fully released, was significantly higher than that of the MVD group (30.0%) (p&lt;0.05), while the efficacy (91.7% vs. 70%) of the two groups was not statistically different (p&gt;0.05). For patients whose arachnoid adhesions were completely released, there had no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in the efficacy (87% vs. 94.7%) and recurrence rate (5.0% vs. 11.1%). The incidence of postoperative facial numbness (88.6%) in the MVD+IN group was higher than that in the MVD group (10.3%) (p&lt;0.01). The long-term incidence of facial numbness was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). In the 18-36 months follow-up, the recurrence rate of patients in the MVD+IN group (9.7%) and in the MVD group (16%) were not statistically different (p&gt;0.05). A retrospective comparison of patients with recurrent TN showed that both MVD and MVD combined with IN can effectively treat recurrent TN. Compared with MVD alone, MVD combined with IN can effectively improve the pain cure rate of patients with recurrent TN who have only severe arachnoid adhesions. The combination does not increase the incidence of long-term facial numbness and other complications. ","70":"Vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA) is a very rare subtype of intracranial aneurysms; when ruptured, it is associated with significantly high rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite several discussions and debates, the optimal treatment for VADA has not yet been established. In the last 10 years, flow diverter devices (FDD) have emerged as a challenging and new treatment method, and various clinical and radiological results have been reported about their safety and effectiveness. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results with the use of FDD in the treatment of unruptured VADA. We retrospectively evaluated the data of all patients with unruptured VADA treated with FDD between January 2018 and February 2021 at our hybrid operating room. Nine patients with unruptured VADA, deemed hemodynamically unstable, were treated with FDD. Among other parameters, the technical feasibility of the procedure, procedure-related complications, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Successful FDD deployment was achieved in all cases, and the immediate follow-up angiography showed intra-aneurysmal contrast stasis with parent artery preservation. A temporary episode of facial numbness and palsy was noted in one patient; however, the symptoms had completely disappeared when followed up at the outpatient clinic 2 weeks after the procedure. The 3-6 months follow-up angiography (n=9) demonstrated complete\/near-complete obliteration of the aneurysm in seven patients, and partial obliteration and segmental occlusion in one patient each. In the patient who achieved only partial obliteration, there was a sac 13 mm in size, and there was no change in the 1-year follow-up angiography. In the patient with segmental occlusion, the cause could not be determined. The clinical outcome was modified Rankin Scale 0 in all patients. Our preliminary study using FDD to treat hemodynamically unstable unruptured VADA showed that FDD is safe and effective. Our study has limitations in that the number of cases is small, and it is not a prospective study. However, we believe that the study contributes to evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of FDD in the treatment of unruptured VADA. ","71":"The purpose of this review was to synthesize the research on global spinal alignment and reciprocal changes following cervical or thoracolumbar reconstruction surgery. We carried out a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for studies through May 2020, and ultimately included 11 articles. The optimal goal of a truly balanced spine is to maintain the head over the femoral heads. When spinal imbalance occurs, the human body reacts through various compensatory mechanisms to maintain the head over the pelvis and to retain a horizontal gaze. Historically, deformity correction has focused on correcting scoliosis and preventing scoliotic curve progression. Following substantial correction of a spinal deformity, reciprocal changes take place in the flexible segments proximal and distal to the area of correction. Restoration of lumbar lordosis following surgery to correct a thoracolumbar deformity induces reciprocal changes in T1 slope, cervical lordosis, pelvic shift, and lower extremity parameters. Patients with cervical kyphosis exhibit different patterns of reciprocal changes depending on whether they have head-balanced or trunk-balanced kyphosis. These reciprocal changes should be considered to in order to prevent secondary spine disorders. We emphasize the importance of evaluating the global spinal alignment to assess postoperative changes.","72":null,"73":"The aim of our study is to investigate the cytotoxic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects of newly synthesized boron compounds in U87MG glioblastoma cell treatment.

The inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) value was calculated with GraphPad Prism 5.0 program. The IC50 values were administered 48 hours on U87MG glioblastoma cell. Catalase (CAT), acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH), and total protein levels were detected using spectrophotometric methods. We determined the antimicrobial activities of BGM and BGD with the disc diffusion method. After 48 hours of BGM and BGD application to U87MG glioblastoma cells, we found the IC50 value as 6.6 mM and 26 mM, respectively. CAT and ACP enzyme activities were decreased in BGM and BGD groups. MDA which is a metabolite of lipid peroxidation was increased in both boron compounds groups. GSH level was reduced especially in BGD group. BGM and BGD have been found to be antimicrobial effects. Boron compounds, especially the BGM, can provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of glioblastoma with their anticancer, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects. ","74":"The occurrence of posterior fossa teratomas in adulthood is extremely rare. In this study, we aimed to report our experience with two cases of posterior fossa mature teratoma in adults who underwent surgical resection. We also performed a systematic review of published papers available to date. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who had onset of posterior fossa teratomas in adulthood at our institute between 1995 and 2020. We evaluated the clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of mature teratomas at the posterior fossa in adulthood. Furthermore, we searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science database and reviewed published articles. We found 507 articles on database review; of them, 102 were duplicates and 389 were excluded based on the inclusion criteria. Finally, 16 cases of posterior fossa from the web search and related articles. Subsequently, we added two cases that underwent surgery at our institute. We analyzed a total of 18 cases of mature teratomas. Headache was the most common (55.6%) symptom. The teratomas showed heterogeneous signals on magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen patients (72.2%) had lesion at midline, five patients (27.8%) had calcification. Surgical resection was performed in all patients. No studies reported recurrence after resection. The occurrence of posterior fossa teratomas in adulthood is difficult to diagnose at the initial stage. Radiographic diagnosis alone can lead to misdiagnosis. Pathological confirmation is essential. Surgical resection is a curative option for posterior fossa teratomas in adulthood.

However, its suspicious origin or paralleled occurrence with other congenital anomalies of vertebral body might be a relatively rare phenomenon. The authors present two cases, who simply presented with clinical signs of prolonged, intractable cervicalgia without any neurological deficits, revealed this rare feature of C1-2 subluxation from the unstable, orthotropic type of Os odontoideum that coincide with congenitally fused cervical vertebral bodies between C2-3. Surprisingly, in one case, when traced from the lower cervical down to the thoracic-lumbar levels during the preoperative work-up process, was also compromised with multi-level butterfly vertebrae formations. Presented cases highlight the association of various congenital vertebrae anomalies and the rationale to fuse only affected joints.","77":"Cervical surgery in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and cerebral palsy (CP) is challenging owing to the complexities of the deformity. We assessed factors affecting postoperative complications and outcomes after CSM surgery in patients with CP. Thirty-five consecutive patients with CP and CSM who underwent cervical operations between January 2006 and January 2014 were matched to 35 non-cerebral palsy (NCP) control patients. Postoperative complications and radiologic outcomes were compared between the groups. In the CP group, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; Oswestry neck disability index; modified Barthel index; and values for the grip and pinch, Box and Block, and Jebsen-Taylor hand function tests were obtained preand postoperatively and compared between those with and without postoperative complications. Sixteen patients (16\/35%) in the CP group and seven (7\/35%) in the NCP group (p=0.021) had postoperative complications. Adjacent segment degeneration (p=0.021), postoperative motor weakness (p=0.037), and revisions (p=0.003) were significantly more frequent in the CP group than in the NCP group; however, instrument-related complications were not significantly higher in the CP group (7\/35 vs. 5\/35, p=0.280). The number of preoperative fixed cervical deformities were significantly higher in CP with postoperative complications (5\/16 vs. 1\/19, p=0.037). In the CP group, clinical outcomes were almost similar between those with and without postoperative complications. The occurrence of complications during the follow-up period was high in patients with CP. However, postoperative complications did not significantly affect clinical outcomes.

We conducted a 5 years retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgical correction of metopic synostosis at two university hospitals in Egypt during the period between June 2014 and June 2019. The study is conducted to 18 children. The type of surgical procedures and postoperative outcomes were assessed in all patients. Five cases (27.8%) underwent endoscopic-assisted suturectomy, 10 cases (55.6%) underwent craniofacial reconstruction, and three cases (16.6%) underwent open burring of the metopic ridge. Fifteen patients underwent one surgery and three patients (16.6%) who need second operation. Ten patients (55.6%) had class I Whitaker classification. Regardless of type of surgery, the outcomes of surgical correction of metopic synostosis are excellent with only a few patients require revision or develop major complications. ","81":"COVID-19 has spread worldwide since the first case was reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Our institution is a regional trauma and emergency center in the northern Gyeonggi Province. The changing trend of patient care in the emergency room of this hospital likely reflects the overall trend of patients in the area. In the present study, whether changes in the surrounding social environment following the outbreak of COVID-19 changed the incidence of neurosurgical emergency patients and whether differences in practice existed were investigated. The overall trend was analyzed from January 2020 which is before the outbreak of COVID-19 to September 2020. To remove bias due to seasonal variation, the previous 2 year's records during the same period were reviewed and compared. Confirmed COVID-19 patients in the northern Gyeonggi Province were identified using data released by the government. And patients who came to the emergency department with head trauma and stroke were identified. Based on the present study results, the total number of neurosurgery emergency patients decreased over the study period. In the trauma patient group, the number of patients not involved in traffic accidents significantly decreased compared with patients involved in traffic accidents. Among the stroke cases, the rate of ischemic stroke was lower than hemorrhagic stroke, although a statistically significant difference was not observed. Meanwhile, an increase in the risk of mortality associated with trauma or stroke cases was not observed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared with the same time period in the previous year. Due to the occurrence of COVID-19, non-essential activities have decreased and trauma cases not associated with traffic accidents appeared to decrease. Due to the decrease in overall activity, the number of stroke patients has also decreased. This trend is expected to continue even in the post-COVID-19 era, and accordingly, the results from the present study are relevant especially if the current situation continues. ","82":"Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) can be occurred after acute cerebral infarction. HT can worse symptoms in severe cases and adversely affect long-term prognosis. As bone and vascular smooth muscle are composed of type 1 collagen, we aimed to identify a potential relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and HT after acute cardioembolic stroke. As an indicator of BMD, we used mean frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values on brain computed tomography (CT). Multivariative hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression analysis to identify whether the osteoporotic condition was an independent predictor of HT after acute cardioembolic stroke. This 11-year analysis enrolled 506 patients who diagnosed as acute cardioembolic infarction. The first tertile of skull HU value was an independent predictor of HT development compared to the third tertile (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.98; p=0.020). We observed no interactions between age and skull HU with respect to HT statistically. The results of this study revealed an association between osteoporotic conditions and HT development after acute cardioembolic stroke. A convenient method to measure the cancellous bone HU value of the frontal skull using brain CT images may be useful for predicting HT in patients with acute cerebral infarction. ","83":"Cerebrospinal fluid leakage related complications (CLC) occasionally occur after intradural spinal surgery. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of early ambulation after intradural spinal surgery and analyze the risk factors for CLC. For this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 314 patients who underwent intradural spinal surgery at a single institution. The early group contained 79 patients who started ambulation after 1 day of bedrest without position restrictions, while the late group consisted of 235 patients who started ambulation after at least 3 days of bed rest and were limited to the prone position after surgery. In the early group, Prolene 6-0 was used as the dura suture material, while black silk 5-0 was used as the dura suture material in the late group. The overall incidence rate of CLC was 10.8%. Significant differences between the early and late groups were identified in the rate of CLC (2.5% vs. 13.6%), surgical repair required (1.3% vs. 7.7%), and length of hospital stay (2.99 vs. 9.29 days) (p&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that CLC was associated with practices specific to the late group (p=0.011) and the revision surgery (p=0.022). Using Prolene 6-0 as a dura suture material for intradural spinal surgery resulted in lower CLC rates compared to black silk 5-0 sutures despite a shorter bed rest period. Our findings revealed that suture - needle ratio related to dura defect was the most critical factor for CLC. One-day ambulation after primary dura closure using Prolene 6-0 sutures appears to be a cost-effective and safe strategy for intradural spinal surgery.

In this study, we analyzed the efficacy and safety of the RSD technique for the treatment of large and giant ICA aneurysms relative to other conventional microsurgical techniques. The aneurysms were classified into two groups depending on whether the RSD method was used (21 in the RSD group vs. 43 in the non-RSD group). Baseline characteristics, details of the surgical procedure, angiographic outcomes, clinical outcomes, and procedure-related complications of each group were reviewed retrospectively. There was no significant difference in the rates of complete neck-clipping between the RSD (57.1%) and non-RSD (67.4%) groups. Similarly, there was no difference in the rates of good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) between the RSD (85.7%) and non-RSD (81.4%) groups. Considering the initial functional status, 19 of 21 (90.5%) patients in the RSD group and 35 of 43 (81.4%) patients in the non-RSD group showed an improvement or no change in functional status, which did not reach statistical significance. In this study, the microsurgical treatment of large and giant intracranial ICA aneurysms using the RSD technique obtained competitive angiographic and clinical outcomes without increasing the risk of procedure-related complications. The RSD technique might be a useful technical option for the microsurgical treatment of large and giant intracranial ICA aneurysms.

Due to the microvascular deterioration in peripheral nerve damage, it becomes challenging to remove free oxygen radicals. Gallic acid is a powerful antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects and a free radical scavenger. The purpose of the study is to show that gallic acid contributes to the restorative effect in mechanical nerve damage, considering its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Thirty male Sprague Dawley albino mature rats were included in the study. Ten of them constituted the control group, 10 out of 20 rats for which sciatic nerve damage was caused, constituted the saline group, and 10 formed the gallic acid group. Post-treatment motor functions, histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical parameters of the rats were evaluated. Compared to the surgery+saline group, lower compound muscle action potential (CMAP) latency, higher CMAP amplitude, and higher inclined plane test values were found in the surgery+gallic acid group. Similarly, a higher nerve growth factor (NGF) percentage, a higher number of axons, and a lower percentage of fibrosis scores were observed in the surgery+gallic acid group. Finally, lower tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and higher heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) values were determined in the surgery+gallic acid group. Gallic acid positively affects peripheral nerve injury healing due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It has been thought that gallic acid can be used as a supportive treatment in peripheral nerve damage.

The Notch-Hes pathway is known to regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. We investigated the effect of propranolol to human glioblastoma cell lines, and the role of Notch and Hes signaling in this process. We performed immunohistochemical staining on 31 surgically resected primary human glioblastoma tissues. We also used glioblastoma cell lines of U87-MG, LN229, and neuroblastoma cell line of SH-SY5Y in this study. The effect of propranolol and isoproterenol on cell proliferation was evaluated using the MTT assay (absorbance 570 nm). The impact of propranolol on gene expression (Notch and Hes) was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, whereas protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1 were measured using Western blotting (WB), simultaneously. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to suppress the Notch gene to investigate its role in the proliferation of glioblastoma. Propranolol and isoproterenol caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation (MTT assay). RT-PCR showed an increase in Notch1 and Hes1 expression by propranolol, whereas WB demonstrated increase in Notch1 protein, but a decrease in Hes1 by propranolol. The proliferation of U87-MG and LN229 was not significantly suppressed after transfection with Notch siRNA. These results demonstrated that propranolol suppressed the proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines and neuroblastoma cell line, and Hes1 was more closely involved than Notch1 was in glioblastoma proliferation. ","90":"We reported the differentially methylated genes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using bioinformatics analyses to explore the biological characteristics of the development of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DNA methylation profiles obtained from 40 SAH patients from an epigenome-wide association study were analyzed. Functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and module analyses were carried out. A total of 13 patients (32.5%) experienced DCI during the follow-up. In total, we categorized the genes into the two groups of hypermethylation (n=910) and hypomethylation (n=870). The hypermethylated genes referred to biological processes of organic cyclic compound biosynthesis, nucleobase-containing compound biosynthesis, heterocycle biosynthesis, aromatic compound biosynthesis and cellular nitrogen compound biosynthesis. The hypomethylated genes referred to biological processes of carbohydrate metabolism, the regulation of cell size, and the detection of a stimulus, and molecular functions of amylase activity, and hydrolase activity. Based on PPI network and module analysis, three hypermethylation modules were mainly associated with antigen-processing, Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport, and G alpha (i) signaling events, and two hypomethylation modules were associated with post-translational protein phosphorylation and the regulation of natural killer cell chemotaxis. VHL, KIF3A, KIFAP3, RACGAP1, and OPRM1 were identified as hub genes for hypermethylation, and ALB and IL5 as hub genes for hypomethylation. This study provided novel insights into DCI pathogenesis following SAH. Differently methylated hub genes can be useful biomarkers for the accurate DCI diagnosis.

Our aim is to investigate the efficacy and borders of percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Between May 2007 and April 2017, 156 patients with trigeminal neuralgia were treated with radiofrequency thermocoagulation. These 156 patients underwent 209 procedures. In our study, we investigated the early and late results of percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation under guiding fluoroscopic imaging in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scale was used for grading the early results. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess long-term outcomes. Of the 156 patients who underwent radiofrequency thermocoagulation for trigeminal neuralgia, 45 had additional disease. Patients with this condition were evaluated with their comorbidities. Early and late results were compared with those without comorbidity. In 193 of 209 interventions BNI pain scale I to III results were obtained. Out of the 193 successful operation 136 patients (65.07%) were discharged as BNI I, 14 (6.70%) as BNI II, 43 (20.58%) as BNI III. Sixteen patients (7.65%) remained uncontrolled (BNI IV and V). While the treatment results of trigeminal neuralgia patients with comorbidity seem more successful in the early period, this difference was not observed in follow-up examinations. Finally, we concluded that percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation of the Gasserian ganglion is a safe and effective method in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. However, over time, the effectiveness of the treatment decreases. Neverthless, the reapprability of this intervention gives it a distinct advantage.

The purpose of this study is to investigate our experiences with first line choice of covered stent implantation for TCCF at level 1 regional trauma center. From November 2004 to February 2020, 19 covered stents were used for treatment of 19 TCCF patients. Among them, 15 cases were first line treatment using covered stents. Clinical and angiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Procedures were technically successful in all 15 cases (100%). Immediate angiographic results after procedure were total occlusion in 12 patients (80%). All patients except two expired patients had image follow-up (mean 15 months). Recurred symptomatic three patients underwent additional treatments and achieved complete occlusion. Mean clinical follow-up duration was 32 months and results were modified Rankin Scale 1-2 in five, 3-4 in five, and 5 in three patients.

This study aims to compare long-term angiographic results of wide-necked aneurysms treated by stent-assisted, double-microcatheter, or single-microcatheter groups. Between January 2003 and October 2016, 108 aneurysms that were treated with endovascular coil embolization with a neck size wider than 4 mm and a follow-up period of more than 3 years were selected. We performed coil embolization with single-microcatheter, double-microcatheter, and stent-assisted techniques. Angiographic results were evaluated using the Raymond-Roy occlusion classification (RROC). All medical and angiographic records were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical and angiographic analyses were conducted in 108 wide-necked aneurysms. The immediate post-procedural results revealed RROC class I (complete occlusion) in 66 cases (61.1%), class II (residual neck) in 36 cases (33.3%), and class III (residual sac) in six cases (5.6%). The final follow-up results revealed class I in 48 cases (44.4%), class II in 49 cases (45.4%), and class III in 11 cases (10.2%). Of a total of 45 (41.6%) radiologic recurrences, there were 21 cases (19.4%) of major recurrence that required additional treatment, and 24 cases (22.2%) of minor recurrence. The final follow-up angiographic results showed statistically significant differences between the stent-assisted group and the others (p&lt;0.01).

Its onset timing is variable, and its mechanisms are unclear. We report two cases of CVS with DIND after unruptured aneurysm surgery and review the literature regarding potential mechanisms. The first case is a 51-year-old woman with non-hemorrhagic vasospasm after unruptured left anterior communicating artery aneurysm surgery. She presented with delayed vasospasm on postoperative day 14. The second case is a 45-year-old woman who suffered from oculomotor nerve palsy caused by an unruptured posterior communicatig artery (PCoA) aneurysm. DIND with non-hemorrhagic vasospasm developed on postoperative day 12. To our knowledge, this is the first report of symptomatic CVS with oculomotor nerve palsy following unruptured PCoA aneurysm surgery. CVS with DIND after unruptured aneurysm surgery is very rare and can be triggered by multiple mechanisms, such as hemorrhage, mechanical stress to the arterial wall, or the trigemino-cerebrovascular system. For unruptured aneurysm surgery, although it is rare, careful observation and treatments can be needed for postoperative CVS with DIND.","99":"Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) and hypertensive retinopathy are known end organ damage of the brain and eye respectively, with HS having deleterious consequence to the patients. This study is to correlate between hypertensive retinopathy and HS in hypertensive disease. A control group of hypertensive patients only, and an investigated group of hypertensive HS patients. Fundoscopic examination to determine the grade of retinopathy was performed and then divided into low or high severity hypertensive retinopathy. Clinical and radiological parameter included are demography, vital signs, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on admission, clot volume, site of clot, Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) score and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). Data were correlated with the severity of hypertensive retinopathy. Fifty patient in the control group and 51 patients in the investigated group were recruited. In the hypertensive HS group, 21 had low severity retinopathy (no or mild retinopathy) accounting for 41.2% and 30 patients had high severity (moderate or severe retinopathy). In the hypertensive patients 49 had low severity and one had high severity (p-value of 0.001). In HS group low severity showed better GCS score of 9-15 on admission (p-value of 0.003), clot volume less than 30 mL (p-value 0.001), and also a better 30 days mortality rate by using the ICH score (p-value 0.006), GOS score of 4 and 5 the low severity retinopathy fair better than the high severity retinopathy (p-value of 0.001), and the relative risk to develop HS in low severity and high severity retinopathy was 0.42 and 29.4, respectively.

This study explores the relationships between work intensity, work-life balance, and burnout experienced by Korean neurosurgeons. The participants (n=451) were neurosurgeons working at training hospitals throughout Republic of Korea. Data on socio-demographic characteristics (including objective and subjective work environment), work intensity, work-life balance, and burnout were gathered using self-report questionnaires completed between March 1 and December 20, 2019. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson's correlations, and multiple regression analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the analyses. The work intensity, work-life balance, and burnout levels of neurosurgeons were 3.95, 3.57 (on a scale from 1 to 5) and 4.60 (on a scale from 1 to 7); and 280 (62.1%) of 451 neurosurgeons were found to be experiencing burnout. By controlling for the socio-demographic characteristics, the effects of work intensity and work-life balance on burnout were analyzed. Work intensity (B=0.314), work-life balance-family and leisure (B=0.216), work-life balance-growth (B=0.147), job stress (B=0.133), and satisfaction with human relationships (B=-0.069) were shown to be significant (all p&lt;0.05), and they were found to affect burnout in the abovementioned order. The overall explanatory power was 58.3% (p&lt;0.05), and the explanatory power with the addition of independent variables such as work intensity and work-life balance was 14.5% (p&lt;0.05). This study showed that Korean neurosurgeons working at training hospitals experienced a high level of work intensity and job stress, and low work-life balance. Additionally, nearly half of the neurosurgeons were found to experience burnout related to factors such as work intensity, work-life balance, job stress, and satisfaction with human relationships. In particular, these factors seem to have deteriorated further after the implementation of the Special Act on Korean Medical Residents. These very high levels of burnout among Korean neurosurgeons who care for patients with both brain and spinal diseases may have a very important impact on patients' health.

Paired 1) pretreatment lumbar, 2) pretreatment ventricular, and 3) posttreatment ventricular samples and their CSF profiles were collected retrospectively from 148 LMC patients who received Ommaya reservoir installation and intraventricular chemotherapy. CSF profile changes were assessed by calculating the differences between posttreatment and pretreatment samples from the same ventricular compartment. CSF cell counts were further differentiated into total and other based on clinical laboratory reports. For the treatment response, a decreased CSF 'total' cell count tended to be associated with a 'controlled' increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) (p=0.059), but other profile changes were not associated with either the control of increased ICP or the cytology response. Among the pretreatment CSF profiles, lumbar protein level and ventricular cell count were significantly correlated with OS in univariable analysis, but they were not significant in multi-variable analysis. Among CSF profile changes, a decrease in 'other' cell count showed worse OS than 'no change' or increased groups (p=0.001). The cytological response was significant for OS, but the hazard ratio of partial remission was paradoxically higher than that of 'no response'. A decrease in other cell count of CSF after intraventricular chemotherapy was associated with poor OS in LMC patients. We suggest that more specific CSF biomarkers of cancer cell origin are needed.

The capability of constructing an implant from a series of radiographic images to provide personalized anatomical fit is what makes 3D printed implants most appealing to surgeons. Our objective is to describe the process of integration of 3DP implants into the operating room for spinal surgery, summarize the outcomes of using 3DP implants in spinal surgery, and discuss the limitations and safety concerns during pre-operative consideration. 3DP allows for customized, light weight, and geometrically complex functional implants in spinal surgery in cases of decompression, tumor, and fusion. However, there are limitations such as the cost of the technology which is prohibitive to many hospitals. The novelty of this approach implies that the quantity of longitudinal studies is limited and our understanding of how the human body responds long term to these implants is still unclear.

However, further progress in PEMF therapy has been difficult due to lack of more evidence-based understanding of its mechanism of action. Our objective was to review the current understanding of bone growth physiology, the mechanism of PEMF therapy action along with its application in spinal surgery and associated outcomes. The authors of this review examined multiple controlled, comparative, and cohort studies to compare fusion rates of patients undergoing PEMF stimulation. Examining spinal fusion rates, a rounded comparison of post-fusion outcomes with and without bone stimulator was performed. Results showed that postoperative spinal surgery PEMF stimulation had higher rates of fusion than control groups. Though PEMF therapy was proven more effective, multiple factors contributed to difficulty in patient compliance for use. Extended timeframe of treatment and cost of treatment were the main obstacles to full compliance. This review showed that PEMF therapy presented an increased rate of recovery in patients, supporting the use of these devices as an effective post-surgical aid. Given the recent advances in the development of PEMF devices, affordability and access will be much easier suited to the patient population, allowing for more readily available treatment options.","108":null,"109":null,"110":"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), which is associated with an extensive range of clinical and radiological presentations, is the one of the most challenging spinal disorders.

Sagittal vertical axis, T1 slope (T1s), T1s-cervical lordosis (CL), anterolisthesis, local kyphosis, the longitudinal distance index, and range of motion were proposed to have relationships with clinical outcomes. The relationship between loss of cervical lordosis (LCL) and T1s has been widely studied, but controversy remains. Extension function, the ratio of CL to T1s (CL\/T1s), and Sharma classification were recently proposed as LCL predictors.

The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes and complications of a reconstruction technique for immediate CSF leakage repair using multiple onlay grafts following ESS. A total of 230 consecutive patients who underwent skull base reconstruction using multiple onlay grafts with fibrin sealant patch (FSP), hydroxyapatite cement (HAC), and pedicled nasoseptal flap (PNF) for high-flow CSF leakage following ESS at three institutions were enrolled. We retrospectively reviewed the medical and radiological records to analyze the preoperative features and postoperative results. The diagnoses included craniopharyngioma (46.8%), meningioma (34.0%), pituitary adenoma (5.3%), chordoma (1.6%), Rathke's cleft cyst (1.1%) and others (n=21, 11.2%). The trans-planum\/tuberculum approach (94.3%) was the most commonly adapted surgical method, followed by the trans-sellar and transclival approaches. The third ventricle was opened in 78 patients (41.5%). Lumbar CSF drainage was not performed postoperatively in any of the patients. Postoperative CSF leakage occurred in four patients (1.7%) due to technical mistakes and were repaired with the same technique. However, postoperative meningitis occurred in 13.5% (n=31) of the patients, but no microorganisms were identified. The median latency to the diagnosis of meningitis was 8 days (range, 2-38). CSF leakage was the unique risk factor for postoperative meningitis (p&lt;0.001). The use of multiple onlay grafts with FSP, HAC, and PNF is a reliable reconstruction technique that provides immediate and complete CSF leakage repair and mucosal grafting on the skull base without the need to harvest autologous tissue or perform postoperative CSF diversion.

Complication-free patients accounted for 43.6% (12.9%, early stage 70 patients and 74.3%, late stage 70 patients). The most common complication was transient psoas paresis (n=52). Most of these complications occurred in the early stages of learning. C-reactive protein normalization was delayed in seven patients (4.89%). The operation time showed a decreasing trend with the cases; however, EBL did not show any significant change. Notable operation-induced complications were cage malposition, vertebral body fracture, injury to the ureter, and injury to the lumbar vein. According to the learning curve, the operation time and psoas paresis decreased. It is important to select an appropriately sized cage along with clear dissection of the anterior border of the psoas muscle to prevent OLIF-specific complications.

This study was designed as a prospective, multi-center, double-blind method, randomized study. All randomized subjects underwent TLIF with DBM gel with rhBMP-2 group (40 patients) as an experimental group or DBM gel group (36 patients) as a control group. Post-operative observations were performed at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. The spinal fusion rate on computed tomography scans and X-rays films, Visual analog scale pain scores, Oswestry disability index and SF-36 quality of life (QOL) scores were used for the efficacy evaluation. The incidence rate of adverse device effects (ADEs) and serious adverse device effects (SADEs) were used for safety evaluation. The spinal fusion rate at 12 weeks for the DBM gel with rhBMP-2 group was higher with 73.68% compared to 58.82% for the DBM gel group. The 24 and 48 weeks were 72.22% and 82.86% for the DBM gel with rhBMP-2 group and 78.79% and 78.13%, respectively, for the DBM gel group. However, there were no significant differences between two groups in the spinal fusion rate at 12, 24, and 48 weeks post-treatment (p=0.1817, p=0.5272, p=0.6247). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence rate of ADEs (p=0.3836). For ADEs in the experimental group, 'Pyrexia' (5.00%) was the most common ADE, followed by 'Hypesthesia', 'Paresthesia', 'Transient peripheral paralysis', 'Spondylitis' and 'Insomnia' (2.50%, respectively). ADEs reported in control group included 'Pyrexia', 'Chest discomfort', 'Pain', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Nephropathy toxic', 'Neurogenic bladder', 'Liver function analyses' and 'Urticaria' (2.86%, respectively). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence rate of SADEs (p=0.6594). For SADE in the experimental group, ''Pyrexia' and 'Spondylitis' were 2.50%. SADE reported in the control group included 'Chest discomfort', 'Osteoarthritis' and 'Neurogenic bladder'. All SADEs described above were resolved after medical treatment. This study demonstrated that the spinal fusion rates of DBM gel group and DBM gel with rhBMP-2 group were not significantly different. But, this study provides knowledge regarding the earlier postoperative effect of rhBMP-2 containing DBM gel and also supports the idea that the longer term follow-up results are essential to confirm the safety and effectiveness. ","118":"Sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is an extragonadal germ cell tumor (GCT) that develops in the fetal and neonatal periods. SCT is a type I GCT in which only teratoma and yolk sac tumors arise from extragonadal sites. SCT is the most common type I GCT and is believed to originate through epigenetic reprogramming of early primordial germ cells migrating from the yolk sac to the gonadal ridges. Fetal SCT diagnosed in utero presents many obstetrical problems. For high-risk fetuses, fetal interventions (devascularization and debulking) are under development. Most patients with SCT are operated on after birth. Complete surgical resection is the key for tumor control, and the anatomical location of the tumor determines the surgical approaches. Incomplete resection and malignant histology are risk factors for recurrence. Approximately 10-15% of patients have a tumor recurrence, which is frequently of malignant histology. Long-term surveillance with monitoring of serum alpha fetoprotein and magnetic resonance imaging is required. Survivors of SCT may suffer anorectal, urological, and sexual sequelae later in their life, and comprehensive evaluation and care are required.","119":"Every researcher wants their research to gain more recognition, and this desire is achieved by publishing their article in a journal with higher impact. It is very important to get researchers interested in the Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society (JKNS). Therefore, the first goal was to promote the publication of papers in our journal. To do this, a table of contents was sent out, and the citation ranking was announced every 2 months. Several efforts have been made to publish good papers. Foreign speakers, who were invited to a conference hosted by the Korean Neurosurgical Society were contacted and politely requested to write a paper addressing their recent research. Domestic and international researchers highly renowned in their fields were also contacted to submit their novel works to our journal. The journal impact factor of our journal has continued to rise for the last 3 years and reached 1.376 in 2019. It can be said that the JKNS is now competitive with other international neurosurgery journals. These achievements were not due to the efforts of the editorial boards alone. This was because our society members have submitted very good papers, and because many of our members have cited the papers published in our journal. We believe that this will continue in the future. The next step of evolution of the JKNS has begun, and this is the beginning of another great development.","120":"Secondary neurulation is a morphological process described since the second half of the 19th century; it accounts for the formation of the caudal spinal cord in mammals including humans. A similar process takes place in birds. This form of neurulation is caused by the growth of the tail bud region, the most caudal axial region of the embryo. Experimental work in different animal species leads to questioning dogmas widely disseminated in the medical literature. Thus, it is clearly established that the tail bud is not a mass of undifferentiated pluripotent cells but is made up of a juxtaposition of territories whose fate is different. The lumens of the two tubes generated by the two modes of neurulation are continuous. There seem to be multiple cavities in the human embryo, but discrepancies exist according to the authors. Finally, the tissues that generate the secondary neural tube are initially located in the most superficial layer of the embryo. These cells must undergo internalization to generate the secondary neurectoderm. A defect in internalization could lead to an open neural tube defect that contradicts the dogma that a secondary neurulation defect is closed by definition.","121":"Recent advancements in basic research on the process of secondary neurulation and increased clinical experience with caudal spinal anomalies with associated abnormalities in the surrounding and distal structures shed light on further understanding of the pathoembryogenesis of the lesions and led to the new classification of these dysraphic entities. We summarized the changing concepts of lesions developed from the disordered secondary neurulation shown during the last decade. In addition, we suggested our new pathoembryogenetic explanations for a few entities based on the literature and the data from our previous animal research. Disordered secondary neurulation at each phase of development may cause corresponding lesions, such as failed junction with the primary neural tube (junctional neural tube defect and segmental spinal dysgenesis), dysgenesis or duplication of the caudal cell mass associated with disturbed activity of caudal mesenchymal tissue (caudal agenesis and caudal duplication syndrome), failed ingression of the primitive streak to the caudal cell mass (myelomeningocele), focal limited dorsal neuro-cutaneous nondisjunction (limited dorsal myeloschisis and congenital dermal sinus), neuro-mesenchymal adhesion (lumbosacral lipomatous malformation), and regression failure spectrum of the medullary cord (thickened filum and filar cyst, low-lying conus, retained medullary cord, terminal myelocele and terminal myelocystocele). It seems that almost every anomalous entity of the primary neural tube may occur in the area of secondary neurulation. Furthermore, the close association with the activity of caudal mesenchymal tissue in secondary neurulation involves a wider range of surrounding structures than in primary neurulation. Although the majority of the data are from animals, not from humans and many theories are still conjectural, these changing concepts of normal and disordered secondary neurulation will provoke further advancements in our management strategies as well as in the pathoembryogenetic understanding of anomalous lesions in this area.","122":"Caudal agenesis refers to the congenital malformation with the essential feature of the agenesis of the sacrococcygeal bone. It is associated with various types of spinal cord anomaly as well as with complex anomalies of genitourinary or gastrointestinal system. The wide spectrum of the disease can be attributed to its pathoembryological origin, the secondary neurulation. This review presents the definition, etiology, classification, and clinical features of the disease.","123":"Recent case reports of junctional neural tube defect (JNTD) which is a peculiar type of spinal anomaly showing the functional disconnection of the primary and secondary neural tubes has risen interest in the process of junctional neurulation (the connection between the two neural tubes) during development. This article summarizes the clinical features of the JNTD and reviews the literature on the basic research on junctional neurulation.","124":"Secondary neurulation (SN) is a critical process to form the neural tube in the posterior region of the body including the tail. SN is distinct from the anteriorly occurring primary neurulation (PN); whereas the PN proceeds by folding an epithelial neural plate, SN precursors arise from a specified epiblast by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and undergo self-renewal in the tail bud. They finally differentiate into the neural tube through mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We here overview recent progresses in the studies of SN with a particular focus on the regulation of cell lineage, self-renewal, and EMT\/MET. Cellular mechanisms underlying SN help to understand the functional diversity of the tail in vertebrates.","125":"","126":"During the last two decades, there have been remarkable advances in knowledge regarding secondary neurulation. An increased number of cases of occult spinal dysraphism and progress in basic embryology research have provoked the continuous discovery of new disease entities and the reclassification of occult spinal dysraphic lesions. Examples of such changes are described. The characteristics of secondary neurulation compared with those of primary neurulation are listed and discussed. Our fundamental questions include what the evolutionary significance of secondary neurulation is and what the advantages of having secondary neurulation are. However, our current data and speculations are insufficient to support scientific inference. The direction of future progress of research in this field is predicted. The role of clinicians in this progress is emphasized.","127":"Humans do not have tails; however, a congenital anomaly named \"human tail\" has been recognized since old times. In contrast with its impactful name, the anomaly itself is not fatal, and thus it has not been considered as a clinically serious symptom. However, many case reports suggested that retention of \"the tail\" is closely associated with spinal cord malformation and should be treated with care by neurosurgeons. Therefore, this review summarizes our knowledge regarding the anatomy, function, and development of the tail as a general structure in mammals. Learning the basic knowledge regarding tail anatomy and development would help clinicians to understand the \"human tail\" more concisely and to select more appropriate examinations or treatments in relation to this congenital anomaly.","128":"Neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) constitute a bipotent cell population that generates a wide variety of trunk cell and tissue types during embryonic development. Derivatives of NMPs include both mesodermal lineage cells such as muscles and vertebral bones, and neural lineage cells such as neural crests and central nervous system neurons. Such diverse lineage potential combined with a limited capacity for self-renewal, which persists during axial elongation, demonstrates that NMPs are a major source of trunk tissues. This review describes the identification and characterization of NMPs across multiple species. We also discuss key cellular and molecular steps for generating neural and mesodermal cells for building up the elongating trunk tissue.","129":null,"130":null,"131":"The endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach is a widely-used method for the surgical treatment of pituitary adenomas. We aimed to evaluate the results of endoscopic surgery by comparing preoperative classification methods and investigating their relationship with postoperative resection and remission rates and complications. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 236 patients (118 males) who underwent surgery for pituitary adenomas. Preoperative Knosp classification, tumor size (TS), suprasellar extension (SSE), postoperative resection and remission rates, and complications were evaluated. The follow-up period was 3 months to 6 years. The patients' ages ranged between 16 and 84 years. Endocrinologically, 114 patients (48.3%) had functional adenoma (FA), and 122 patients (51.7%) had non-functional adenoma (NFA). Among the FA group, 92 (80.7%) showed remission. A statistically significant difference was found between patients with and without remission in terms of the Knosp, TS, and SSE classifications (p&lt;0.01). Knosp, TS, and SSE classification grades were found to be correlated with the resection rates (p&lt;0.01). Meningitis was seen in seven patients (3.0%), diabetes insipidus in 16 (6.9%; permanently in two [0.9%]), and rhinorrhea in 19 (8.1%). Thirty-six patients (15.3%) developed pituitary insufficiency and received hormone replacement therapy. The resection categories and remission rates of FAs were directly proportional to the adenoma sizes and Knosp grades, while the degree of suprasellar growth further complicated resection and remission rates. Adenoma sizes less than 2 cm and SSEs less than 1 cm are associated with favorable remission and resection rates. ","132":"When treating high-positioned anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms, pterional-transsylvian and interhemispheric approaches are both viable options, yet comparative studies of these two surgical approaches are rare. Accordingly, this retrospective study investigated the surgical results of both approaches. Twenty-four patients underwent a pterional approach (n=11) or interhemispheric approach (n=13), including a unilateral low anterior interhemispheric approach or bifrontal interhemispheric approach, for high-positioned ACoA aneurysms with an aneurysm dome height &gt;15 mm and aneurysm neck height &gt;10 mm both measured from the level of the anterior clinoid process. The clinical and radiological data were reviewed to investigate the surgical results and risk factors of incomplete clipping. The pterional patient group showed a significantly higher incidence of incomplete clipping than the interhemispheric patient group (p=0.031). Four patients (36.4%) who underwent a pterional approach showed a postclipping aneurysm remnant, whereas all the patients who experienced an interhemispheric approach showed complete clipping. In one case, the aneurysm remnant was obliterated by coiling, while follow-up of the other three cases showed the remnants remained limited to the aneurysm base. A multivariate analysis revealed that a pterional approach for a large aneurysm with a diameter &gt;8 mm presented a statistically significant risk factor for incomplete clipping. For high-positioned ACoA aneurysms with a dome height &gt;15 mm and neck height &gt;10 mm above the level of the anterior clinoid process, a large aneurysm with a diameter &gt;8 mm can be clipped more completely via an interhemispheric approach than via a pterional approach.

The study was designed retrospectively by examining the files of 58 patients with moderate to severe TBI to investigate coexistence of TBI and BPI. BPI was detected in six of 58 TBI patients (10.3%). BPI was detected after an average 116 days from the initial injury. Three patients had lower trunk BPI and three patients had panplexopathy. Diagnosis of BPI in patients with TBI is delayed in the acute period of injury. The clinicians should keep in mind that BPIs may occur and remain undiagnosed in patients with TBI. ","134":"The subaxial cervical pedicle screwing technique shows powerful biomechanical properties for posterior cervical fusion. When applying a pedicle screw using the freehand technique, it is essential to analyse cervical computed tomography and plan the surgery accordingly. Normal cervical computed tomography is usually performed in the supine position, whereas during surgery, the patient lies in a prone position. This fact leads us to suppose that radiological evaluations may yield misleading results. Our study aimed to investigate whether there is any superiority between preoperative preparation on computed tomography performed in the prone position and that performed in the supine position. This study included 17 patients (132 pedicle screws) who were recently operated on with cervical vertebral computed tomography in the prone position and 17 patients (136 pedicle screws) who were operated on by conventional cervical vertebral computed tomography as the control group. The patients in both groups were compared in terms of age, gender, pathological diagnosis, screw malposition and complications. A screw malposition evaluation was made according to the Gertzbein-Robbins scale. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding age, gender and pathological diagnosis. The screw malposition rate (from 11.1% to 6.9%, p&lt;0.05), mean malposition distance (from 2.18 mm to 1.86 mm, p &lt;0.05), and complications statistically significantly decreased in the prone position computed tomography group. Preoperative surgical planning by performing cervical vertebral computed tomography in the prone position reduces screw malposition and complications. Our surgical success increased with a simple modification that can be applied by all clinicians without creating additional radiation exposure or additional costs.

Ten adults with SEMCs in the thoracolumbar spine were surgically treated and enrolled in this study. Clinical manifestations, imaging data, intraoperative findings and postoperative outcome were recorded. Clinical manifestations of SEMCs included motor and sensory dysfunction of the lower limbs and urination and defecation disturbance. The cysts presented as intraspinal occupying lesions dorsal to the spine, ranging from the T8 to L3 level. Defects of eight cases were found on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selective hemilaminectomy or laminectomy were used to reveal the defect within the cyst, which was further sutured with microscopic technique. The final outcome was excellent or good in seven cases and fair in three cases. No recurrence was observed during follow-up. SEMCs are rare intraspinal cystic lesions. Radiography and MRI are clinically practical methods to assess defects within SEMCs. Selective hemilaminectomy or laminectomy may reduce surgical trauma. Detection and microscopic suturing of the defects are the key steps to adequately decompress the nervous tissue and prevent postoperative recurrence.

This retrospective study assessed the safety and efficacy of Neuroform Atlas stenting as a rescue treatment after failure of mechanical thrombetomy (MT) for large artery occlusion. Between June 2018 and December 2019, a total of 31 patients underwent Neuroform Atlas stenting with prior Gateway balloon angioplasty after failure of conventional MT caused by residual intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Primary outcomes were successful recanalization and patency of the vessel 24 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes were vessel patency after 14 days and 3-month modified Rankin Scale. Peri-procedural complications, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 3-month mortality were reviewed. With a 100% of successful recanalization, median value of stenosis was reduced from 79.0% to 23.5%. Twenty-eight patients (90.3%) showed tolerable vessel patency after 14 days. New infarctions occurred in three patients (9.7%) over a period of 14 days; two patient (6.5%) underwent stent occlusion at 24 hours, and the other patient (3.2%) with delayed stent occlusion had a non-symptomatic dot infarct. There were no peri-procedural complications. Two patients (6.5%) developed an ICH immediately after the procedure with one of them is symptomatic. Neuroform Atlas stenting seems to be an effective and safe rescue treatment modality for failed MT with residual ICAS, by its high successful recanalization rate with tolerable patency, and low peri-procedural complication rate. Further multicenter and randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings.

The authors aimed to analyze the treatment outcomes of PTIAs. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 27 PTIAs treated with endovascular intervention between January 1999 and March 2018. Twenty-one aneurysms were treated with intraluminal embolization (ILE), and six were treated with parent artery occlusion (PAO) with or without bypass surgery. Radiological results, clinical outcomes and risk factors for major recurrence were assessed. The initial clinical status was similar in both groups; however, the last status was better in the ILE group than in the PAO group (p=0.049). Neurological deterioration resulted from mass effect in one case and rupture in one after ILE, and mass effect in two and perforator infarction in one after PAO. Twenty cases (94.2%) in the ILE group initially achieved complete occlusion or residual neck status. However, 13 cases (61.9%) showed major recurrence, the major causes of which included coil migration or compaction. Seven cases (33.3%) ultimately achieved residual sac status after repeat treatment. In the PAO group, all initially showed complete occlusion or a residual neck, and just one case ultimately had a residual sac. Two cases showed major recurrence, the cause of which was incomplete PAO. Aneurysm wall calcification was the only significantly protective factor against major recurrence (odds ratio, 36.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.85 to 705.18; p=0.018). Complete PAO of PTIAs is the best option if treatment-related complications can be minimized. Simple fluoroscopy is a useful imaging modality because of the recurrence pattern. ","140":"Though the operating microscope (OM) has been the standard optical system in neurosurgery, a new technology called three-dimensional (3D) exoscope has emerged as an alternative. Herein, two types of 3D exoscopes for brain tumor surgery are presented. In addition, the advantages and limitations compared with the OM are discussed. In the present study, 3D exoscope VOMS-100 or VITOM 3D was used in 11 patients with brain tumor who underwent surgical resection; the Kinevo 900 OM was used only in emergency. After completion of all surgeries, the participants were surveyed with a questionnaire regarding video image quality on the display monitor, handling of equipment, ergonomics, educational usefulness, 3D glasses, and expectation as a substitute for the OM. Among 11 patients, nine patients underwent neurosurgical resection with only 3D exoscope; however, two patients required additional aid with the OM due to difficulty in hemostasis. Regarding video image quality, VITOM 3D was mostly equivalent to the OM, but VOMS-100 was not. However, both 3D exoscopes showed advantages in accessibility of instruments in the surgical field and occupied less space in the operating theater. Differences in ergonomics and educational usefulness between the exoscopes were not reported. Respondents did not experience discomfort in wearing 3D glasses and thought the exoscopes could be currently, and in the future, used as a substitute for the OM. Although many neurosurgeons are not familiar with 3D exoscopes, they have advantages compared with the OM and similar image quality. Exoscopes could be a substitute for OM in the future if some limitations are overcome. ","141":"Rapid dissolution of blood clots reduces vasospasm and hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and locally administered fibrinolytic drugs (LAFDs) could facilitate the dissolution. However, the efficacy of LAFDs remains controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of LAFDs for vasospasm and hydrocephalus and in clinical outcomes. From PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database, data were extracted by two authors. Meta-analysis was performed using a random effect model. Inclusion criteria were patients who had LAFDs with urokinase-type or recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator after SAH in comparison with medically untreated patients with fibrinolytic drugs. We only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this analysis. The outcomes of interest were vasospasm, hydrocephalus, mortality, and 90-day unfavorable functional outcome. Data from eight RCTs with 550 patients were included. Pooled-analysis revealed that the LAFDs were significantly associated with lower rates of vasospasm (LAFDs group vs. control group, 26.5% vs. 39.2%; odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.73); hydrocephalus (LAFDs group vs. control group, 26.0% vs. 31.6%; OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91); and mortality (LAFDs group vs. control group, 10.5% vs. 15.7%; OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-0.99). The proportion of 90-day unfavorable outcomes was lower in the LAFDs group (LAFDs group vs. control group, 32.7% vs. 43.5%; OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80). This meta-analysis with eight RCTs indicated that LAFDs were significantly associated with lower rates of vasospasm and hydrocephalus after SAH. Thus, LAFDs could consequently reduce mortality and improve clinical outcome after SAH. ","142":"","143":"Shunt infection is a common complication while treating hydrocephalus. The antibiotic-impregnated shunt catheter (AISC) was designed to reduce shunt infection rate. A meta-analysis was conducted to study the effectiveness of AISCs in reduction of shunt infection in terms of age, follow-up time and high-risk patient population. This study reviewed literature from three databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (from 2000 to March 2019). Clinical studies from controlled trials for shunt operation were included in this analysis. A subgroup analysis was performed based on the patient's age, follow-up time and high-risk population. The fixed effect in RevMan 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration) was used for this meta-analysis. This study included 19 controlled clinical trials including 10105 operations. The analysis demonstrated that AISC could reduce the infection rate in shunt surgery compared to standard shunt catheter (non-AISC) from 8.13% to 4.09% (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.58; p=0.01; I2=46%). Subgroup analysis of different age groups showed that AISC had significant antimicrobial effects in all three groups (adult, infant, and adolescent). Follow-up time analysis showed that AISC was effective in preventing early shunt infections (within 6 months after implant). AISC is more effective in high-risk population (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14-0.40; p=0.60; I2=0%) than in general patient population. The results of meta-analysis indicated that AISC is an effective method for reducing shunt infection. We recommend that AISC should be considered for use in infants and high-risk groups. For adult patients, the choice for AISC could be determined based on the treatment cost. ","144":null,"145":"High precision and accuracy are expected in gamma knife radiosurgery treatment. Because of the requirement of clinically applying complex radiation and dose gradients together with a rapid radiation decline, a dedicated quality assurance program is required to maintain the radiation dosimetry and geometric accuracy and to reduce all associated risk factors. This study investigates the validity of Leksell Gamma plan (LGP)10.1.1 system of 5th generation Gamma Knife Perfexion as modified variable ellipsoid modeling technique (VEMT) method. To verify LGP10.1.1 system, we compare the treatment plan program system of the Gamma Knife Perfexion, that is, the LGP, with the calculated value of the proposed modified VEMT program. To verify a modified VEMT method, we compare the distributions of the dose of Gamma Knife Perfexion measured by Gafchromic EBT3 and EBT-XD films. For verification, the center of an 80 mm radius solid water phantom is placed in the center of all sectors positioned at 16 mm, 4 mm and 8 mm; that is, the dose distribution is similar to the method used in the x, y, and z directions by the VEMT. The dose distribution in the axial direction is compared and analyzed based on Full-Width-of-Half-Maximum (FWHM) evaluation. The dose profile distribution was evaluated by FWHM, and it showed an average difference of 0.104 mm for the LGP value and 0.130 mm for the EBT-XD film. The modified VEMT yielded consistent results in the two processes. The use of the modified VEMT as a verification tool can enable the system to stably test and operate the Gamma Knife Perfexion treatment planning system.

However, the clinical and pathological features as well as the surgical indication are not well-established. This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of patients who underwent transection of the filum during the last 10 years in a single institute. A total of 82 patients underwent transection of the filum during the period. As a general rule, we performed the transection in patients who are symptomatic or have abnormality in the urologic or neuromuscular evaluations. There were exceptions as asymptomatic patients who only fit the definition of thickened filum (width greater than 2.0 mm or conus level below L3 vertebral body) were operated by parent's wish or surgeon's preference according to radiological findings, etc. Seventy-six out of 82 patients had fibrous tissue in the pathologic specimen of filum. Interestingly, patients who had glial cells were more correlated with no preoperative syrinx, and no progression of syrinx even for those who did have syrinx initially. Also, larger percentage of symptomatic patients had peripheral nerve twigs than asymptomatic patients. No difference in conus level or thickness of filum was found between patients with or without preoperative syrinx. Significantly more patients with syrinx (56%) were chosen to be operated without any symptom or abnormality in study i.e., solely based on radiological findings than those without syrinx (21%). The surgical outcome for syrinx was favorable, as all but one patient had either improved or static syrinx. The exceptional case had increase in size due to the upward displacement of the proximal end of the cut filum. This study evaluated the pathological, clinical, radiological features of patients who underwent transection of the filum. Interesting correlations between pathological findings and clinical features were found. Excellent outcome regarding preoperative syrinx was also shown.

This study aimed to assess the success rate of IONM in patients with cervical myelopathy and to investigate the factors associated with successful baseline monitoring and the effect of increasing the stimulation intensity by focusing on motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The data of 88 patients who underwent surgery for cervical myelopathy with IONM between January 2016 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The success rate of baseline MEP monitoring at the initial stimulation of 400 V was investigated. In unmonitorable cases, the stimulation intensity was increased to 999 V, and the success rate final MEP monitoring was reinvestigated. In addition, factors related to the success rate of baseline MEP monitoring were investigated using independent t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact probability test for statistical analysis. The factors included age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, smoking history, symptom duration, Torg-Pavlov ratio, space available for the cord (SAC), cord compression ratio (CCR), intramedullary increased signal intensity (SI) on magnetic resonance imaging, SI length, SI ratio, the Medical Research Council (MRC) grade, the preoperative modified Nurick grade and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score. The overall success rate for reliable MEP response was 52.3% after increasing the stimulation intensity. No complications were observed to be associated with increased intensity. The factors related to the success rate of final MEP monitoring were found to be SAC (p&lt;0.001), CCR (p&lt;0.001), MRC grade (p&lt;0.001), preoperative modified Nurick grade (p&lt;0.001), and JOA score (p&lt;0.001). The cut-off score for successful MEP monitoring was 5.67 mm for SAC, 47.33% for the CCR, 3 points for MRC grade, 2 points for the modified Nurick grade, and 12 points for the JOA score. Increasing the stimulation intensity could significantly improve the success rate of baseline MEP monitoring for unmonitorable cases at the initial stimulation in cervical myelopathy. In particular, the SAC, CCR, MRC grade, preoperative Nurick grade and JOA score may be considered as the more important related factors associated with the success rate of MEP monitoring. Therefore, the degree of preoperative neurological functional deficits and the presence of spinal cord compression on imaging could be used as new detailed criteria for the application of IONM in patients with cervical myelopathy.

We here analyzed our institutional clinical outcomes of large unruptured aneurysms of the posterior circulation. This study included 56 patients who presented with a large (&gt;10 mm) unruptured aneurysm of the posterior circulation between 2002 and 2018. There were 18 (32.1%) male and 38 (67.9%) female patients, with a mean age of 53.4 years. The most common location was the vertebral artery, followed by the basilar tip and posterior cerebral artery. The median follow-up duration was 29 months. Eighteen patients (32.1%) were treated by transcranial surgery and 38 (67.9%) were treated by endovascular treatment (EVT). Posttreatment complications occurred in 16 patients (28.6%), with there being no significant difference between the transcranial surgery and EVT groups. Complete obliteration was achieved in 30 patients (53.6%), with there being no statistically significant difference between the transcranial surgery and EVT groups. Recurrence occurred in 17 patients (30.4%), and the rate of recurrence was higher in the EVT group than in the transcranial surgery group (39.5% vs. 11.1%, p=0.03). Forty-four (84%) of 56 patients showed a favorable functional outcome. In saccular aneurysm, EVT was negative predictor of worsening of functional status. Treatment of these aneurysms harbors an inherent high risk of morbidity. No superiority was found between transcranial surgery and EVT in terms of complications and complete obliteration, but transcranial surgery showed a higher treatment durability than EVT.

However, the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment has not been established to date, although 4-8 weeks is generally advised. Moreover, some researchers have reported that bacteremia is a risk factor for failure of antibiotic treatment in SEA. In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics of SEA accompanied by bacteremia and also determined whether the conventional 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment is sufficient. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and radiological data of 23 patients with bacterial SEA who underwent open surgery from March 2010 to April 2020. All patients had bacteremia preoperatively and underwent weeks of perioperative antibiotic treatments based on their identified organisms until all symptoms of infection disappeared. All patients underwent microbiological studies of peripheral blood, specimens from SEA and concomitant infections. The mean follow-up duration was 35.2 months, excluding three patients who died. The male : female ratio was 15 : 8, and the mean age was 68.9 years. The SEA most commonly involved the lumbar spinal segment (73.9%), and the mean size was 2.9 vertebral body lengths. Mean time periods of 8.4 days and 16.6 days were required from admission to diagnosis and from admission to surgery, respectively. Concomitant infections more frequently resulted in delayed diagnosis (p=0.032), masking the symptoms of SEA. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly identified pathogen in both blood and surgical specimens. Seventeen patients (73.9%) showed no deficits at the final follow-up. The overall antibiotic treatment duration was a mean of 66.6 days, excluding three patients who died. This duration was longer than the conventionally advised 4-8 weeks (p=0.010), and psoas or paraspinal abscess required prolonged duration of antibiotic treatment (p=0.038). SEA accompanied by bacteremia required a longer duration (&gt;8 weeks) of antibiotic treatment. In addition, the diagnosis was more frequently delayed in patients with concomitant infections. The duration of antibiotic treatment should be extended for SEA with bacteremia, and a high index of suspicion is mandatory for early diagnosis, especially in patients with concomitant infections. ","154":"It has been recognised for over a century that the events of gastrulation are fundamental in determining, not only the development of the neuraxis but the organisation of the entire primitive embryo. Until recently our understanding of gastrulation was based on detailed histological analysis in animal models and relatively rare human tissue preparations from aborted fetuses. Such studies resulted in a model of gastrulation that neurosurgeons have subsequently used as a means of trying to explain some of the congenital anomalies of caudal spinal cord and vertebral development that present in paediatric neurosurgical practice. Recent advances in developmental biology, in particular cellular biology and molecular genetics have offered new insights into very early development. Understanding the processes that underlie cellular interactions, gene expression and activation\/inhibition of signalling pathways has changed the way embryologists view gastrulation and this has led to a shift in emphasis from the 'descriptive and morphological' to the 'mechanistic and functional'. Unfortunately, thus far it has proved difficult to translate this improved knowledge of normal development, typically derived from non-human models, into an understanding of the mechanisms underlying human malformations such as the spinal dysraphisms and anomalies of caudal development. A paediatric neurosurgeons perspective of current concepts in gastrulation is presented along with a critical review of the current hypotheses of human malformations that have been attributed to disorders of this stage of embryogenesis.","155":null,"156":null,"157":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are approved for treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the safety and efficacy of combined ICI and Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) treatment remain undefined. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed patients treated with ICIs with or without GKS at our institute to manage patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC treated with ICIs between January 2015 and December 2017. Of 134 patients, 77 were assessable for brain responses and categorized into three groups as follows : group A, ICI alone (n=26); group B, ICI with concurrent GKS within 14 days (n=24); and group C, ICI with non-concurrent GKS (n=27). The median follow-up duration after brain metastasis diagnosis was 19.1 months (range, 1-77). At the last follow-up, 53 patients (68.8%) died, 20 were alive, and four were lost to follow-up. The estimated median overall survival (OS) of all patients from the date of brain metastasis diagnosis was 20.0 months (95% confidence interval, 12.5-27.7) (10.0, 22.5, and 42.1 months in groups A, B, and C, respectively). The OS was shorter in group A than in group C (p=0.001). The intracranial disease progression-free survival (p=0.569), local progression-free survival (p=0.457), and complication rates did not significantly differ among the groups. Twelve patients showed leptomeningeal seeding (LMS) during follow-up. The 1-year LMS-free rate in treated with ICI alone group (69.1%) was significantly lower than that in treated with GKS before ICI treatment or within 14 days group (93.2%) (p=0.004). GKS with ICI showed no favorable OS outcome in treating brain metastasis from NSCLC. However, GKS with ICI did not increase the risk of complications. Furthermore, compared with ICI alone, GKS with ICI may be associated with a reduced incidence of LMS. Further understanding of the mechanism, which remains unknown, may help improve the quality of life of patients with brain metastasis.

A retrospective review of adult patients who underwent pedicle screw fixation in the thoracic or lumbar spine for metastatic spinal tumors between 2012 and 2018 was conducted. Breaches were assessed based on the Gertzbein and Robbins classification and only screws placed &gt;4 mm outside of the pedicle wall (lateral or medial) were considered breached. A total of 62 patients received 547 pedicle screws (average 8 per patient) - 34 patients received 298 pedicle screws in the FH group and 28 patients received 249 screws in the NV group. There were 40\/547 breaches, corresponding to a breach and accuracy rate of 7.3% and 92.7%, respectively. The breach rate was 9.7% in the FH group and 4.4% in the NV group (chi-squared test, p=0.017); this corresponded to an accuracy rate of 90.3% and 95.6%, respectively. Only one patient from the overall cohort (in the FH group) required revision surgery due to a medial breach abutting the spinal cord (1.6% of all patients; 2.9% of FH patients); no patient suffered organ, vessel, or neurological injury from screw breaches. Navigated pedicle screw placement in patients with metastatic spinal tumors has a significantly higher radiographic accuracy compared to the FH technique. However, the revision surgery was low and no patient suffered from clinically-relevant breach. Navigation also offers the advantage of real-time localization of spinal tumors and aids in targeting and resection of these lesions.

We reviewed retrospectively the endovascular procedure and clinical results for acute-stroke patients who underwent recanalization from October 2014 through December 2018. Initial imaging findings and the endovascular procedure were analyzed for patients with acute complete occlusion due to MCA dissection. We undertook first-line aspiration thrombectomy using a Penumbra catheter in 294 patients with acute occlusion of the M1 segment. Of these patients, seven were confirmed to have acute complete occlusion due to MCA dissection. All patients had angiographic findings of an intimal flap at the proximal occlusion site of the MCA. One patient complained of severe headache during microcatheter passage through the occluded lesion and died due to massive bleeding caused by rupture of the false lumen. The remaining patients underwent initial contact aspiration thrombectomy without microcatheter passage. After aspiration thrombectomy, six patients had delayed flow through the MCA. One patient underwent stenting of the MCA because of progressive symptoms. An intimal flap at the proximal portion of an occluded MCA can suggest the possibility of MCA dissection. Contrast aspiration thrombectomy without microcatheter passage can reduce the risk of false lumen rupture in cases of MCA dissection.

This study aimed to analyze the correlation among mutant IDH1 R132H, Ki-67, and PD-L1 immunoexpression in the DAT. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 30 paraffin blocks of DAT cases. Paraffin block samples consist of grade II (n=14), grade III (n=8), and grade IV (n=8). In this study, the immunohistochemistry-staining of mutant IDH1 R132H, Ki-67, and PD-L1 were carried out to determine the frequency of DAT with IDH1 mutations.

Although the classification describes many clinical features associated with the shape of the ossification, including the concept of spondylosis seems necessary because of the similarity in age distribution. Patients diagnosed with OPLL who presented with increase signal intensity (ISI) on magnetic resonance imaging were surgically treated in our department. The patients were divided into two groups (pure versus degenerative) according to the presence of disc degeneration. Of 141 patients enrolled in this study, more than half (61%) were classified into the degenerative group. The pure group showed a profound male predominance, early presentation of myelopathy, and a different predilection for ISI compared to the degenerative group. The mean canal compromise ratio (CC) of the ISI was 47% in the degenerative group versus 61% in the pure group (p&lt;0.0000). On the contrary, the global and segment motions were significantly larger in the degenerative group (p&lt;0.0000 and p=0.003, respectively). The canal diameters and global angles did not differ between groups. Classifying cervical OPLL based on the presence of combined disc degeneration is beneficial for understanding the disorder's behavior.

In this study, we analyzed the patterns of arachnoid membrane descent during or after pituitary tumor surgery and identified the factors related to this descent. Analysis was restricted to pituitary macroadenomas not extending into the third ventricle or over the internal carotid artery. To minimize confounding factors, patients who underwent revision surgery, those who had a torn arachnoid during operation or small medial diaphragma sellae (DS) opening, and subtotal resections were excluded. We enrolled 41 consecutive patients in this retrospective analysis. The degree of arachnoid descent was categorized using intraoperative videos. Preoperative magnetic resonance findings, including tumor height, suprasellar extension, and variables including DS area and medial opening size, tumor composition, and displacement of the pituitary stalk and gland were evaluated to determine their correlations with arachnoid membrane descent. Arachnoid membrane descent was significantly correlated with DS area and medial opening size. Based on T2-weighted images (T2WI) magnetic resonance (MR) images, tumor composition was significantly associated with arachnoid membrane descent. Other factors were not significantly correlated with arachnoid membrane descent. T2WI of tumor composition and preoperative MR imaging of DS area and medial opening provided valuable information regarding arachnoid membrane descent.

","171":"Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an effective surgical procedure for treating symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. Many neurosurgeons use a shunt to reduce perioperative ischemic complications. However, the use of shunting is still controversial, and the shunt procedure can cause several complications. In our institution, we used two types of modified arteriotomy suture techniques instead of using a shunt. In technique 1, to prevent ischemic complications, we sutured a third of the arteriotomy site from both ends after removing the plaque. Afterward, the unsutured middle third was isolated from the arterial lumen by placing a curved Satinsky clamp. And then, we opened all the clamped carotid arteries before finishing the suture. In technique 2, we sutured the arteriotomy site at the common carotid artery (CCA). We then placed a curved Satinsky clamp crossing from the sutured site to the carotid bifurcation, isolating the unsutured site at the internal carotid artery (ICA). After placing the Satinsky clamp, the CCA and external carotid artery (ECA) were opened to allow blood flow from CCA to ECA. By opening the ECA, ECA collateral flow via ECA-ICA anastomoses could help to reduce cerebral ischemia. The modified suture methods can reduce the cerebral ischemia directly (technique 1) or via using collaterals (technique 2). The modified arteriotomy suture techniques are simple, safe, and applicable to almost all cases of CEA. Two modified arteriotomy suture techniques could reduce perioperative ischemic complications by reducing the cerebral ischemic time. ","172":"Spinal dysraphism often causes neurological impairment from direct involvement of lesions or from cord tethering. The conus medullaris and lumbosacral roots are most vulnerable. Surgical intervention such as untethering surgery is indicated to minimize or prevent further neurological deficits. Because untethering surgery itself imposes risk of neural injury, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is indicated to help surgeons to be guided during surgery and to improve functional outcome. Monitoring of electromyography (EMG), motor evoked potential, and bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) is essential modalities in IONM for untethering. Sensory evoked potential can be also employed to further interpretation. In specific, free-running EMG and triggered EMG is of most utility to identify lumbosacral roots within the field of surgery and filum terminale or non-functioning cord can be also confirmed by absence of responses at higher intensity of stimulation. The sacral nervous system should be vigilantly monitored as pathophysiology of tethered cord syndrome affects the sacral function most and earliest. BCR monitoring can be readily applicable for sacral monitoring and has been shown to be useful for prediction of postoperative sacral dysfunction. Further research is guaranteed because current IONM methodology in spinal dysraphism is still deficient of quantitative and objective evaluation and fails to directly measure the sacral autonomic nervous system.","173":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) for adjacent segmental disease (ASD) after anterior cervical fusion (ACF).

Herein, PCF was performed for the treatment of symptomatic ASD and the feasibility of the surgery was evaluated. Forty nine patients who underwent PCF due to symptomatic ASD from August 2008 to November 2017 were identified. For demographic and perioperative data, the sex, age, types of previous surgery, ASD levels, operation times, and bleeding amount were recorded. The clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale for the neck and arm, the modified Odom's criteria as well as neck disability index. Radiologic evaluations were performed by measuring disc softness, disc height, the cervical 2-7 sagittal vertical axis, cervical cobb angle, and facet violation. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the location of the pathology; paracentral (group P) or foramina (group F). Both groups showed significant clinical improvement (p&lt;0.05). The proportion of calcified disc and facet violations was significantly larger in group F (p&lt;0.05). The minimal disc height decrease with mild improvement on sagittal alignment and cervical lordosis was radiologically measured without statistical significance in both groups (p&gt;0.05). PCF showed satisfactory clinical and radiologic outcomes for both paracentral and foraminal pathologies of ASD after ACF. Complications related to anterior revision were also avoided.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the overlooked co-occurring skeletal trauma through whole body bone scan (WBBS) in TBI. A retrospective study of 547 TBI patients admitted between 2015 and 2017 was performed to investigate their cooccurring skeletal injuries detected by WBBS. The patients were divided into three groups based on the timing of suspecting skeletal trauma confirmed : 1) before WBBS (pre-WBBS); 2) after the routine WBBS (post-WBBS) with good mental state and no initial musculoskeletal complaints; and 3) after the routine WBBS with poor mental state (poor MS). The skeletal trauma detected by WBBS was classified into six skeletal categories : spine, upper and lower extremities, pelvis, chest wall, and clavicles. The skeletal injuries identified by WBBS were confirmed to be simple contusion or fractures by other imaging modalities such as X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scans. Of the six categorizations of skeletal trauma detected as hot uptake lesions in WBBS, the lesions of spine, upper and lower extremities were further statistically analyzed to calculate the incidence rates of actual fractures (AF) and actual surgery (AS) cases over the total number of hot uptake lesions in WBBS. Of 547 patients with TBI, 112 patients (20.4 %) were presented with TBI alone. Four hundred and thirty-five patients with TBI had co-occurring skeletal injuries confirmed by WBBS. The incidences were as follows : chest wall (27.4%), spine (22.9%), lower extremities (20.2%), upper extremities (13.5%), pelvis (9.4%), and clavicles (6.3%). It is notable that relatively larger number of positive hot uptakes were observed in the groups of post-WBBS and poor MS. The percentage of post-WBBS group over the total hot uptake lesions in upper and lower extremities, and spines were 51.0%, 43.8%, and 41.7%, respectively, while their percentages of AS were 2.73%, 1.1%, and 0%, respectively. The percentages of poor MS group in the upper and lower extremities, and spines were 10.4%, 17.4%, and 7.8%, respectively, while their percentages of AS were 26.7%, 14.2%, and 11.1%, respectively.

Using CT scans obtained from patients in the prone position, we checked for retroperitoneal or visceral violations and measured the angles of approach with five conventional approach lines drawn on axial CT scans at each disc space level (L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5). We also determined the ideal entry point distance and approach angles for avoiding retroperitoneal or visceral violations. Correlation analysis was performed to identify the patient characteristics related to the ideal entry point properties. We found that the far lateral approach at the L2-3 level resulted in high rates of visceral violation. However, rates of visceral violation at the L3-4 and L4-5 levels were remarkably low or absent. The ideal angles of approach decreased moving caudally along the spine, and the ideal entry point distances increased moving caudally along the spine. Weight, body mass index (BMI), and the depth of the posterior vertebral line from the skin were positively associated with the distance of the ideal entry point from the midline. We reviewed the risk of the extreme lateral approach by analyzing rates of retroperitoneal and visceral violations during well-known methods of approach.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of specific physical activities and triggering events in the occurrence of nIPH and aSAH. We retrospectively reviewed 824 consecutive patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage between January 2010 and December 2018. Among the 824 patients, 132 patients were excluded due to insufficient clinical data and other etiologies of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. The medical records of 692 patients were reviewed, and the following parameters were assessed : age, sex, history of hypertension, smoking, history of stroke, use of antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents, season and time of onset, physical activities performed according to the metabolic equivalents, and triggering event at onset. Events that suddenly raised the blood pressure such as sudden postural changes, defecation or urination, sexual intercourse, unexpected emotional stress, sauna bath, and medical examination were defined as triggering events. These clinical data were compared between the nIPH and aSAH groups. Both nIPH and aSAH most commonly occurred during non-strenuous physical activity, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.524). Thirty-two patients (6.6%) in the nIPH group and 39 patients (8.1%) in the aSAH group experienced triggering events at onset, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.034).

The self-reported quality of life (QOL) based on the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) was assessed prospectively. Surgery was defined as \"early\", when performed within 12 hours after admission and \"late\" when performed thereafter. Conservative therapy was preferred and recommend in patients without neurological deficits and in patients denying surgical intervention. One hundred and twenty-three patients were included in this study. Forty-nine patients (39.8%) underwent early, 47 patients (38.2%) delayed surgery and 27 (21.9%) conservative therapy. No significant differences were observed regarding mean age, sex, diabetes, prior history of spinal infection, and bony destruction. Patients undergoing early surgery revealed a significant better clinical outcome before discharge than patients undergoing late surgery (p=0.001) and conservative therapy. QOL based on SF-36 were significantly better in the early surgery cohort in two of four physical items (physical functioning and bodily pain) and in one of four psychological items (role limitation) after a mean follow-up period of 58 months. Readmission to the hospital and failure of conservative therapy were observed more often in patients undergoing conservative therapy. Our data on both clinical outcome and QOL provide evidence for early surgery within 12 hours after admission in patients with SEA. ","185":"Although stent-assisted coiling (SAC) has been reported to be safe and effective in treating wide-necked aneurysms, the technique has procedure-related complications. Thus, we reported our experiences of SAC using the Neuroform Atlas stent in treating wide-necked aneurysms and evaluated the incidence of and risk factors for procedure-related complications. From March 2018 to August 2019, we treated 130 unruptured wide-necked aneurysms in 123 patients with Neuroform Atlas stents. Angiographic results and clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical and angiographic follow-up were performed in all cases (mean, 12.4 months) after the procedure. There were eight cases (6.2%) of procedure-related complications (two dissections, five thromboembolisms, and one hemorrhage) and two (1.5%) of delayed complications (one ischemia and one hemorrhage). There was one case (0.8%) of failure of stent deployment and one (0.8%) of suboptimal positioning of the stent. Follow-up angiography showed complete obliteration in 103 (79.2%), residual neck in 16 (12.3%), and residual aneurysm in 11 cases (8.5%). Aneurysm locations in the middle cerebral artery (odds ratio [OR], 2.211; p=0.046) and the anterior communicating artery (OR, 2.850; p=0.039) were associated with procedurerelated complications on univariate analysis. However, no independent risk factor for procedure-related complications was noted in multivariate analysis. The Neuroform Atlas showed a high rate of technical success. Good clinical and radiographic outcomes in early follow-up suggests that the device is feasible and safe. SAC of aneurysms on the middle cerebral artery or anterior communicating artery may require more attention to prevent possible procedure-related complications. ","186":"Hyperostosis in meningiomas can be present in 4.5% to 44% of cases. Radical resection should include aggressive removal of invaded bone. It is not clear however to what extent bone removal should be carried to achieve pathologically free margins, especially that in many cases, there is a T2 hyperintense signal that extends beyond the hyperostotic bone. In this study we try to investigate the perimeter of tumour cells outside the visible nidus of hyperostotic bone and to what extent they are present outside this nidus. This would serve as an initial step for setting guidelines on dealing with hyperostosis in meningioma surgery. This is a prospective case series that included 14 patients with convexity meningiomas and hyperostosis during the period from March 2017 to August 2018 in two university hospitals. Patients demographics, clinical, imaging characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative data were collected and analysed. In all cases, all visible abnormal bone was excised bearing in mind to also include the hyperintense diploe in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 weighted images after careful preoperative assessment. To examine bony tumour invasion, five marked bone biopsies were taken from the craniotomy flap for histopathological examinations. These include one from the centre of hyperostotic nidus and the other four from the corners at a 2-cm distance from the margin of the nidus. Our study included five males (35.7%) and nine females (64.3%) with a mean age of 43.75 years (33-55). Tumor site was parietal in seven cases (50%), fronto-parietal in three cases (21.4%), parieto-occipital in two cases (14.2%), frontal region in one case and bicoronal (midline) in one case. Tumour pathology revealed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade I in seven cases (50%), atypical meningioma (WHO II) in five cases (35.7%) and anaplastic meningioma (WHO III) in two cases (14.2%). In all grade I and II meningiomas, bone biopsies harvested from the nidus revealed infiltration with tumour cells while all other bone biopsies from the four corners (2 cm from nidus) were free. In cases of anaplastic meningiomas, all five biopsies were positive for tumour cells. Removal of the gross epicentre of hyperostotic bone with the surrounding 2 cm is adequate to ensure radical excision and free bone margins in grade I and II meningiomas. Hyperintense signal change in MRI T2 weighted images, even beyond visible hypersototic areas, doesn't necessarily represent tumour invasion. ","187":"The purpose of this study is identify the operation status of the neurosurgical care units (NCUs) in neurosurgical residency training hospitals nationwide and determine needed changes by comparing findings with those obtained from the Korean Neurosurgical Society (KNS) and Korean Society of Neurointensive Care Medicine (KNIC) survey of 2010. This survey was conducted over 1 year in 86 neurosurgical residency training hospitals and two neurosurgery specialist hospitals and focused on the following areas : 1) the current status of the infrastructure and operating systems of NCUs in Korea, 2) barriers to installing neurointensivist team systems, 3) future roles of the KNS and KNIC, and 4) a handbook for physicians and practitioners in NCUs. We compared and analyzed the results of this survey with those from a KNIC survey of 2010. Seventy seven hospitals (87.5%) participated in the survey. Nineteen hospitals (24.7%) employed a neurointensivist or faculty member; Thirty seven hospitals (48.1%) reported high demand for neurointensivists, and 62 hospitals (80.5%) stated that the mandatory deployment of a neurointensivist improved the quality of patient care. Forty four hospitals (57.1%) believed that hiring neurointensivist would increase hospital costs, and in response to a question on potential earnings declines. In terms of potential solutions to these problems, 70 respondents (90.9%) maintained that additional fees were necessary for neurointensivists' work, and 64 (83.1%) answered that direct support was needed of the personnel expenses for neurointensivists. We hope the results of this survey will guide successful implementation of neurointensivist systems across Korea. ","188":"The crossing Y-stent method is one of the indispensable techniques to achieve sufficient neck coverage during coil embolization of bifurcation aneurysms with a wide neck and\/or branch incorporation. However, the inevitable hourglass-like expansion of the second stent at the crossing point can result in insufficient vessel wall apposition, reduced aneurysm neck coverage, delayed endothelialization, and subsequent higher risks of acute or delayed thrombosis. It also interferes with engagement of the microcatheter into the aneurysm after stent installation. We expected to be able to reduce these disadvantages by installing a noncrossing type Y-stent using the Solitaire AB stent, which is fully retrievable with a tapered proximal end. Here we report the techniques and two successful cases.","189":"We attempted to compare the incidence of pyogenic spondylitis (PS) and tuberculous spondylitis (TS) between 2007 and 2016. Furthermore, we investigated the patients who underwent surgery in 2016 compared to that in 2007. We used a nationwide database managed by the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in 2007 and 2016. Total 9655 patients with a newly diagnosis of PS or TS were enrolled in PS or TS group. Among them, 1721 patients underwent either fusion or decompression surgery. We analyzed demographic distribution of patients according to gender and age and year of diagnosis. Comparing between 2007 and 2016, the incidence of PS has increased in 2016 than in 2007 (4874 vs. 2431, p&lt;0.0001). Conversely, declination of incidence of TS was discovered in 2016 compared to 2007 (594 vs. 1756, p&lt;0.0001). Females showed predominance over males regarding both PS and TS (5228 vs. 4427, p&lt;0.0001). Among them, the number of PS patients who underwent surgery increased significantly in 2016 relative to that in 2007 (979 vs. 592, p&lt;0.0001). This nationwide study suggests that PS may increase and TS may decrease in Korea. In addition, demand for surgery regarding PS may increase. ","190":"Lipofibromatous hamartoma (LFH) is a rare tumor of the peripheral nerves, which usually involves the median nerve. The authors reported on two rare cases of carpal tunnel syndrome due to LFH of the median nerve. A 49-year-old female patient complained of the mass and symptoms consistent with LFH. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed typical LFH findings. The symptoms were successfully ameliorated with carpal tunnel release and external neurolysis. A 37-year-old female patient complained of weakening thumb abduction and the mass where the MRI showed atypical findings. Opponensplasty and debulking operations were performed after which thumb abduction was improved; however, neurological sequelae remained. LFH of the median nerve is managed on a case-by-case basis as treatment guidelines are not very clearly defined yet. However, the less invasive treatment such as carpal tunnel release and external neurolysis than more aggressive surgical treatment should be recommended as a treatment option.","191":"Spinal metastases can present with varying degrees of mechanical instability. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) was developed as a tool to assess spinal neoplastic-related instability while helping to guide referrals among oncology specialists. Some previous papers suggested that the SINS was accurate and reliable, while others disagreed with this opinion. We performed a systematic review regarding the SINS to evaluate its accuracy and precision in predicting vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). The 21 included studies investigated a total of 2118 patients. Thirteen studies dealt with the accuracy of SINS to predict postradiotherapy VCFs, and eight dealt with the precision. Among 13 studies, 11 agreed that the SINS categories showed statistically significant accuracy in predicting VCF. Among eight studies, body collapse was effective for predicting VCFs in six studies, and alignment and bone lesion in two studies. Location has no statistical significance in predicting VCFs in any of the eight studies. The precision of SINS categories was substantial to excellent in six of eight studies. Among the six components of the SINS, the majority of the included studies reported that location showed near perfect agreement; body collapse, alignment, and posterolateral involvement showed moderate agreement; and bone lesion showed fair agreement. Bone lesion showed significant accuracy in predicting VCFs in half of eight studies, but displayed fair reliability in five of seven studies. Although location was indicated as having near perfect reliability, the component showed no accuracy for predicting VCFs in any of the studies and deleting or modifying the item needs to be considered. The SINS system may be accurate and reliable in predicting the occurrence of postradiotherapy VCFs for spinal metastasis. Some components seem to be substantially weak and need to be revised.","192":"The function of B7H3, a member of the B7 family of proteins, in neuroblastoma (NB) remains poorly characterized. Here we examine the expression pattern of B7H3 in clinical NB specimens and characterize the phenotype of B7H3 knock-down in NB cell line. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was carried out to assess the expression of B7H3 in clinical NB specimens. Survival association was analyzed using five Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE85047, GSE45480, GSE62564, GSE16476, GSE49710). Clonogenic survival and flow cytometry were performed after B7H3 knockdown to assess the cellular proliferation and cell survival in vitro. Impact of B7H3 silencing on NB growth was examined in vivo using the SH-SY5Y xenograft model. On IHC staining, B7H3 was widely expressed in clinical NB specimens. Analysis of the transcriptional profiles of five GEO datasets clinically annotated NB specimens revealed that decreased B7H3 expression was associated with improved overall survival. B7H3 knockdown suppressed the proliferation of the SH-SY5Y NB model in vitro and in vivo. Cell cycle analysis revealed that B7H3 silencing induced G1\/S arrest. This arrest was associated with the suppression of E2F1 expression and induction of Rb expression. Our results demonstrate that B7H3 expression correlate with clinical survival in NB patients. Preliminary studies suggest that B7H3 may mediate the G1\/S transition.

This metaanalysis was conducted to collate further evidence for the efficacy of ARP in preventing postoperative CSDH. Data of patients who underwent clipping surgery were extracted from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials by two independent reviewers. A random effects model was used to investigate the efficacy of ARP by using odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A meta-regression analysis for male sex was additionally preformed. Data from six studies with 1715 patients were consecutively included. Meta-analysis revealed that ARP was significantly associated with lower rates of CSDH development after surgical clipping for UIA (ARP group vs. control group : 3.2% vs. 7.2%; OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.93; I2 =44.3%; p=0.110). Meta-regression analysis did not highlight any modifying effect of the male sex on postoperative CSDH development (p=0.951). This meta-analysis indicated that ARP reduced the incidence rates of CSDH following clipping surgery for UIA. If feasible, ARP would be implemented as an additional surgical technique to prevent postoperative CSDH development during surgical clipping of UIA. ","196":"Infection is one of most devastating complications in ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery. Preoperative hair removal has traditionally been performed to reduce infectious complications. We performed VP shunt surgeries and evaluated the prevalence of infection in patients who were shaved and those who were unshaven. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 82 patients with hydrocephalus of various pathologies who underwent VP shunt surgery, with or without having the head shaved, between March 2010 and March 2017. For patients in the non-shaved group (n=36), absorbable suture materials were used for wound closure, and Nylon sutures or staples were used in the shaved group (n=46). We evaluated the infection outcomes of patients in the two groups. There was no difference in the average age of patients in the two groups. In the non-shaved group, there were no infections, while two patients in the shaved group required revision because of shunt infection. Non-shaved shunt surgery may be safe and effective, with no increase of infection rate. We recommend that shunt procedures could be performed without shaving the hair, which may increase patients' satisfaction without increasing infection risk. ","197":"The demineralized bone matrix (DBM) as the bone graft material to increase the fusion rate was widely used in spinal fusion. The current study aimed to compare the fusion rate of DBM to the fusion rate of autograft in lumbar spine fusion via meta-analysis of published literature. After systematic search, comparative studies were selected according to eligibility criteria. Checklist (risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomized study) was used to evaluate the risk of bias of the included nonrandomized controlled studies. The corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. We also used subgroup analysis to analyze the fusion rate of posterolateral lumbar fusion and lumbar interbody fusion. Eight studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. These eight studies included 581 patients. Among them, 337 patients underwent spinal fusion surgery using DBM (DBM group) and 204 patients underwent spinal fusion surgery with mainly autologous bone and without using DBM (control group). There was no significant differences of fusion rate between the two groups in posterolateral fusion analysis (risk ratio [RR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90-1.17; p=0.66) and interbody fusion analysis (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.91-1.39; p=0.27). Based on the available evidence, the use of DBM with autograft in posterolateral lumbar spine fusion and lumbar interbody fusion showed a slightly higher fusion rate than that of autograft alone; however, there was no statistically different between two groups.","198":"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common intracranial hemorrhages. It can be managed with a simple surgical treatment such as burr-hole trephination and drainage. However, it has a relatively high recurrence rate. The mechanisms and risk factors for the recurrence have not yet been clearly identified and studies have reported varying results. We analyzed 230 patients with CSDH who were treated with burr-hole trephination and drainage at our institution from March 2011 to March 2016. The patients were divided into recurrence and non-recurrence groups and the medical records of each group were used to analyze the risk factors associated with CSDH recurrence. After burr-hole trephination and drainage, CSDH recurrence was observed in 49 (21.3%) of the 230 patients. In univariate analysis, none of the factors showed statistical significance with respect to CSDH recurrence. In multivariate analysis, preoperative antithrombotic medication was the only independent risk factor for CSDH recurrence (odds ratio, 2.407; 95% confidence interval, 1.047-5.531). The present study found that preoperative antithrombotic medication was independently associated with CSDH recurrence. ","199":"To evaluate the effectiveness and long-term outcome predictors of percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP). This single-center study assessed 40 patients with sacral insufficiency fractures using the short-axis technique under C-arm flat-panel detector computed tomography (CT). Two radiologists reviewed the patients' magnetic resonance and CT images to obtain imaging findings before PSP and determine technical success, respectively. The short-term outcomes were visual analog scale score changes and opioid usage reductions. Long-term outcomes were determined using telephone interviews and the North American Spine Society (NASS) patient-satisfaction index at least one year after PSP. Technical success was achieved without any significant complications in 39 patients (97.5%). Telephone interviews were possible with 12 patients and failed in 10 patients; death was confirmed in 18 patients. Fifteen patients (50%) re-visited the hospital and received conservative treatment, including spinal injections. Nine patients reported positive satisfaction (NASS patient-satisfaction index 1 or 2), while the negative satisfaction group (NASS patient-satisfaction index 3 or 4, n=3) showed a higher incidence of compression fractures at the thoracolumbar spine level (66.7% vs. 22.2%) and previous spinal injection history (66.7% vs. 33.3%). The poor response group also showed higher incidences of facet joint arthrosis (100% vs. 55.6%), central canal stenosis (100% vs. 22.2%), neural foraminal stenosis (33.3% vs. 22.2%), scoliosis (100% vs. 33.3%), and sagittal malalignment (100% vs. 44.4%). PSP was effective for sacral insufficiency fractures and showed good long-term outcomes. Combined compression fractures in the thoracolumbar spine and degenerative lumbar pathologies could be possible poor outcome predictors. ","200":"Since the first discovery of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), rapid and wide spread of the disease has been reported and the World Health Organization announced that a 'pandemic' has started. Up to date there is little known regarding the impact of this outbreak on spinal specialists' daily clinical practice. We intended to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected the number of spinal disease patients we meet and operate in daily practice. The de-identified data regarding number of patients visiting the spine clinic at a tertiary referral hospital and a secondary level hospital from January, February and March of 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The number of out-patient department (OPD) visits, number of emergency room (ER) visits as well as number of surgeries performed during the reviewed period were collected and analyzed, comparing 2020 to the previous 3 years. The number of daily OPD visits showed a steady decrease starting from January, and presented a statistically significant decrease by early March 2020, compared to the previous 3 years. During the same period, decrease in number of daily ER visits was statistically significant as well. The number of elective surgeries or number of surgeries for patients admitted via ER during COVID-19 outbreak remained similar to that of 2017-2019 suggesting, despite the decrease of patients visiting the hospital for spinal diseases, those whom required surgery still visited the hospital. The results were consistant among other hospital level. The outbreak of COVID-19 affected our daily practice as OPD and ER visits reduced but did not affect the number of surgeries. We believe that this report will be informative to spinal specialists worldwide fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. ","201":"Spinal degeneration is a progressive disease, worsening over time. Lumbar degenerative disease (LDD) is a major spinal disease in elderly patients. Surgical treatment is considered for medically intractable patients with LDD and reoperation after primary surgery is not uncommon. The surgical outcome is occasionally unpredictable because of comorbidities. In the present study, the relationship between comorbidities and the incidence of reoperation for LDD over time was determined. The claims data of the health insurance national database were used to identify a cohort of patients who underwent spinal surgery for LDD in 2009. The patients were followed up until 2016. Medical comorbidity was assessed according to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Cox proportional hazard regression modeling was used to identify significant differences in sex, surgery, age, causative disease, and comorbidity. The study cohort included 78241 patients; 10328 patients (13.2%) underwent reoperation during the observation period. The reoperation rate was statistically higher (p&lt;0.01) in males, patients 55-74 years and 65-74 years of age, and patients with decompression or discectomy. Significant association was found between increasing reoperation rate and CCI score (p&lt;0.01). Based on multivariate analysis of comorbidities, the significantly higher reoperation rates were observed in patients with peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary lung disease, peptic ulcer, diabetes, and diabetes complications (p&lt;0.01). The study results indicate the reoperation rate for LDD is associated with patient comorbidities. The comorbidities identified in this study could be helpful in future LDD studies. ","202":"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital anomalies of the cerebrovascular system. AVM harbors 2.2% annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured cases and 4.5% annual hemorrhage risk of previously ruptured cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been shown excellent treatment outcomes for patients with small- to moderated sized AVM which can be achieved in 80-90% complete obliteration rate with a 2-3 years latency period. The most important factors are associated with obliteration after SRS is the radiation dose to the AVM. In our institutional clinical practice, now 22 Gy (50% isodose line) dose of radiation has been used for treatment of cerebral AVM in single-session radiosurgery. However, dose-volume relationship can be unfavorable for large AVMs when treated in a single-session radiosurgery, resulting high complication rates for effective dose. Thus, various strategies should be considered to treat large AVM. The role of pre-SRS embolization is permanent volume reduction of the nidus and treat high-risk lesion such as AVM-related aneurysm and high-flow arteriovenous shunt. Various staging technique of radiosurgery including volume-staged radiosurgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy and dose-staged radiosurgery are possible option for large AVM. The incidence of post-radiosurgery complication is varied, the incidence rate of radiological post-radiosurgical complication has been reported 30-40% and symptomatic complication rate was reported from 8.1% to 11.8%. In the future, novel therapy which incorporate endovascular treatment using liquid embolic material and new radiosurgical technique such as gene or cytokine-targeted radio-sensitization should be needed.","203":"","204":"This article recounts the author's personal views and recollections of the history, conception of embryogenetic theories, application of intraoperative electrophysiology, and development of prospective treatment recommendations of several important spinal dysraphic malformations, including limited dorsal myeloschisis, dermal sinus tract, retained medullary cord, terminal myelocystocoele, and complex spinal cord lipomas.","205":"To describe how to perform urological evaluation in children with tethered cord syndrome (TCS). Although a common manifestation of TCS is the development of neurogenic bladder in developing children, neurosurgeons often face difficulty in detecting urological problems in patients with TCS. From a urological perspective, diagnosis of TCS in developing children is further complicated due to the differentiation between neurogenic bladder dysfunctions and transient bladder dysfunctions owing to developmental problems. Due to the paucity of evidence regarding evaluation prior to and after untethering, I have shown the purpose and tools for evaluation in my own practice. This may be tailored to the types of neurogenic bladder, developmental status, and risks for deterioration. While the urodynamic study (UDS) is the gold standard test for understanding bladder function, it is not a panacea in revealing the nature of bladder dysfunction. In addition, clinicians should consider the influence of developmental processes on bladder function. Before untethering, UDS should reveal synergic urethral movement, which indicates an intact sacral reflex and lack of TCS. Postoperatively, the measurement of post-void residual urine volume is a key factor for the evaluation of spontaneous voiders. In case of elevation, fecal impaction, which is common in spinal dysraphism, should be addressed. In patients with clean intermittent catheterization, the frequency-volume chart should be monitored to assess the storage function of the bladder. Toilet training is an important sign of maturation, and its achievement should be monitored. Signs of bladder deterioration should be acknowledged, and follow-up schedule should be tailored to prevent upper urinary tract damage and also to determine an adequate timing for intervention. Neurosurgeons should be aware of urological problems related to TCS as well as urologists. Cooperation and regular discussion between the two disciplines could enhance the quality of patient care. Accumulation of experience will improve follow-up strategies.","206":"This review summarises the classification, anatomy and embryogenesis of complex spinal cord lipomas, and describes in some detail the new technique of total lipoma resection and radical reconstruction of the affected neural placode. Its specific mission is to tackle two main issues surrounding the management of complex dysraphic lipomas : whether total resection confers better long term benefits than partial resection, and whether total resection does better than conservative treatment, i.e., no surgery, for asymptomatic lipomas. Accordingly, the 24 years progression-free survival data of the author and colleagues' series of over 350 cases of total resection are compared with historical data from multiple series (including our own) of partial resection, and total resection data specifically for asymptomatic lesions are compared with the two known series of non-surgical treatment of equivalent patients. These comparisons amply support the author's recommendation of total resection for most complex lipomas, with or without symptoms. The notable exception is the asymptomatic chaotic lipoma, whose peculiar anatomical relationship with the neural tissue defies even our aggressive surgical approach, and consequently projects worse results (admittedly of small number of cases) than for the other two lipoma subtypes of dorsal and transitional lesions. Prophylactic resection of asymptomatic chaotic lipomas is therefore not currently endorsed.","207":null,"208":null,"209":"Due to recent developments and the wide application of percutaneous transforaminal discectomy (PTED) in China, we herein compare its clinical effects with microendoscopic discectomy (MED) for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation in terms of recurrence and revision rates. Six databases, namely, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Ovid, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang, were searched by computer. The literature was screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the quality of the included literature was evaluated. After extracting the data from the papers, Review Manager 5.2 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was applied to analyze these data. Finally, sensitivity and publication bias analyses of the results were conducted. A total of 12 studies consisting of 2400 patients were included in this meta-analysis. A comparison of PTED with MED revealed higher postoperative recurrence and postoperative revision rates for PTED (odds ratio [OR] recurrence, 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 2.53; p=0.05 and OR revision, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.64, p=0.006). PTED has a number of advantages because it is a minimally invasive surgery, but its recurrence and revision rates are higher than MED. Therefore, MED should not be completely replaced by PTED. ","210":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common tumors of the central nervous system, which is the most lethal brain cancer. GBM treatment is based primarily on surgical resection, combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite the positive treatment, progression free survival and overall survival were not significantly prolonged because GBM almost always recurs. We are always looking forward to some new and effective treatments. In recent years, a novel treatment method called tumor treating fields (TTFields) for cancer treatment has been proposed. TTFields devices were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjuvant treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed GBMs in 2011 and 2015, respectively. This became the first breakthrough treatment for GBM in the past 10 years after the FDA approved bevacizumab for patients with relapsed GBM in 2009. This paper summarized the research results of TTFields in recent years and elaborated the mechanism of action of TTFields on GBM, including cell and animal experimental research, clinical application and social benefits.","211":"Junctional neurulation represents the most recent adjunct to the well-known sequential embryological processes of primary and secondary neurulation. While its exact molecular processes, occurring at the end of primary and the beginning of secondary neurulation, are still being actively investigated, its pathological counterpart -junctional neural tube defect (JNTD)- had been described in 2017 based on three patients whose well-formed secondary neural tube, the conus, is widely separated from its corresponding primary neural tube and functionally disconnected from corticospinal control from above. Several other cases conforming to this bizarre neural tube arrangement have since appeared in the literature, reinforcing the validity of this entity. The cardinal clinical, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological features of JNTD, and the hypothesis of its embryogenetic mechanism, form part of this review.","212":"During the follow-up period after surgery for spinal dysraphism, a certain portion of patients show neurological deterioration and its secondary phenomena, such as motor, sensory or sphincter changes, foot and spinal deformities, pain, and spasticity. These clinical manifestations are caused by tethering effects on the neural structures at the site of previous operation. The widespread recognition of retethering drew the attention of medical professionals of various specialties because of its incidence, which is not low when surveillance is adequate, and its progressive nature. This article reviews the literature on the incidence and timing of deterioration, predisposing factors for retethering, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, surgical treatment and its complications, clinical outcomes, prognostic factors after retethering surgery and preventive measures of retethering. Current practice and opinions of Seoul National University Children's Hospital team were added in some parts. The literature shows a wide range of data regarding the incidence, rate and degree of surgical complications and long-term outcomes. The method of prevention is still one of the main topics of this entity. Although alternatives such as spinal column shortening were introduced, re-untethering by conventional surgical methods remains the current main management tool. Re-untethering surgery is a much more difficult task than primary untethering surgery. Updated publications include strong skepticism on re-untethering surgery in a certain group of patients, though it is from a minority of research groups. For all of the abovementioned reasons, new information and ideas on the early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of retethering are critically necessary in this era.","213":"","214":"Some types of spinal dysraphism can be accompanied by extraspinal cysts, including myelomeningocele, myelocystocele, myelocele, meningocele, limited dorsal myeloschisis, lipomyelomeningocele, and terminal myelocystocele. Each disease is classified according to the developmental mechanism, embryologic process, site of occurrence, or internal structure of the extraspinal cyst. In most cystic spinal dysraphisms except meningocele, part of the spinal cord is attached to the cyst dome. Most open spinal dysraphisms pose a risk of infection and require urgent surgical intervention, but when the cyst is accompanied by closed spinal dysraphism, the timing of surgery may vary. However, if the extraspinal cyst grows, it aggravates tethering by pulling the tip of the cord, which is attached to the dome of the cyst. This causes neurological deficits, so urgent surgery is required to release the tethered cord.","215":"Cases of syringomyelia associated with spinal dysraphism are distinct from those associated with hindbrain herniation or arachnoiditis in terms of the suspected pathogenetic mechanism. The symptoms of terminal syringomyelia are difficult to differentiate from the symptoms caused by spinal dysraphism. Nonetheless, syringomyelia has important clinical implications, as it is an important sign of cord tethering. The postoperative assessment of syringomyelia should be performed with caution.","216":"There has been confusion in the classification of terminal myelocystocele (TMCC) due to its diverse morphology and vague pathoembryogenesis. TMCC could be summarized as having the essential features of an elongated caudal spinal cord extruding out of the dorsal extraspinal space that fuses with the subcutaneous fat, which is in the shape of a trumpet-shaped cerebrospinal fluid-filled cyst. The extraspinal portion of the extruded spinal cord is nonfunctional. The morphological features suggest that TMCC is formed during secondary neurulation, specifically the failure of the degeneration of the secondary neural tube near the time of the terminal balloon. This review discusses the definition, as well as the clinical and surgical features, of TMCC with special emphasis on its pathoembryogenesis.","217":"Compared to any other decade, the last two decades have been the most dynamic period in terms of advances in the knowledge on spinal dysraphism. Among the several factors of rapid advancement, such as embryology during secondary neurulation and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, there is no doubt that Professor Dachling Pang stood high amidst the period. I review here the last two decades from my personal point of view on what has been achieved in the field of spinal dysraphism, focusing on occult tethered cord syndrome, lumbosacral lipomatous malformation, terminal myelocystocele, retained medullary cord, limited dorsal myeloschisis and junctional neural tube defect. There are still many issues to revise, add and extend. Profound knowledge of basic science is critical, as well as refined clinical analysis. I expect that young scholars who follow the footsteps of precedent giants will shed bright light on this topic in the future.","218":"Retained medullary cord (RMC) is a relatively recent term. Pang et al. newly defined the RMC as a late arrest of secondary neurulation leaving a non-functional vestigial portion at the tip of the conus medullaris. RMC, which belongs to the category of closed spinal dysraphism, is a cord-like structure that is elongated from the conus toward the cul-de-sac. Because intraoperative electrophysiological confirmation of a non-functional conus is essential for the diagnosis of RMC, only a tentative or an assumptive diagnosis is possible before surgery or in cases of limited surgical exposure. We suggest the term 'possible RMC' for these cases. An RMC may cause tethered cord syndrome and thus requires surgery. This article reviews the literature to elucidate the pathoembryogenesis, clinical significance and treatment of RMCs.","219":null,"220":null,"221":"To perform a systematic review of the data collected from case-control studies conducted earlier to investigate the correlation between E-selectin S128R polymorphism and ischemic stroke (IS) risk among the Chinese population.

The hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract (HHT) projects through the PS to the posterior pituitary gland. To reconstruct white matter fiber pathways, methods like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography have been widely used. In this report we attempted to predict the position of PS using DTI tractography and to assess its intraoperative correlation during surgery of pituitary adenomas. DTI tractography was used to tract the HHT in nine patients before craniotomy for pituitary adenomas. The DTI location of the HHT was compared with the PS position identified at the time of surgery. DTI fiber tracking was carried out in nine patients prior to the planned craniotomy for pituitary adenomas. In one patient, the PS could not be identified during the surgery. In the other eight patients, a comparison was made between the location of the HHT identified by DTI and the position of the PS visualized at the time of surgery. The position of the HHT identified by DTI showed consistency with the intraoperative position of the PS in seven patients (88.9% concordance). This study shows that DTI can identify the position of the HHT and thus the position of the PS with a high degree of reliability.

Thirty samples from healthy volunteers without abnormalities after head MRI examination were selected as the control group. The levels of serum microRNA155 in each group were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the correlation between microRNA155 in the serum of patients with CSVD and the increase of imaging lesions was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis. Compared with the control group, the serum microRNA155 level in the LI group, MLI combined with WML group increased, the difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05); serum microRNA155 level was positively correlated with the increase of imaging lesions (p&lt;0.05). The change of serum microRNA155 level in patients with CSVD may be one of its self-protection mechanisms, and the intensity of this self-protection mechanism is positively correlated with the number of CSVD lesions.

The CTA-ABC score was developed from 3 scales previously described in the literature: the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (0-5 points, 3; 6-10 points, 0), the clot burden score (0-3 points, 1; 4-10 points, 0), and the leptomeningeal Collateral score (0-1 points, 2; 2-3 points, 0). We evaluated the predictive value of CTA parameters associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) or malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (MMCAI) after EVT and developed the score using logistic regression coefficients. The score was then validated. Performance of the score was tested with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The derivation cohort consisted of 115 and the validation cohort consisted of 40 AIS patients. The AUC-ROC was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.99; p&lt;0.001) in the derivation cohort. The proportions of patients with sICH and\/or MMCAI in the derivation cohort were 96%, 73%, 6%, and 0% for scores of 6, 5, 1, and 0 points, respectively. In the validation group, the proportions were similar (90%, 100%, 0%, and 0%, respectively) with an AUC-ROC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00; p&lt;0.001). Our CTA-ABC score reliably assessed risk for sICH and\/or MMCAI in patients with AIS who underwent EVT. It can support clinical decision-making, especially when the need for EVT is uncertain. ","229":"Traumatic arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) involving the external carotid artery are exceedingly rare in young adults. Since an AVF is the most common life-threatening cause for pulsatile tinnitus (PT), meticulous evaluation and treatment of patients with PT is crucial. Here, we present two traumatic AVF cases treated with coil embolization leading to no residual fistulous connections followed by an immediate and complete resolution of PT. A 20-year-old man developed left ear tinnitus three months after a traumatic brain injury involving the right temporal bone fracture. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an enlarged left middle meningeal artery (MMA) and a fistular point at the posterior branch of the MMA draining to the middle meningeal vein (MMV) and the left pterygoid plexus, suggesting an AVF. Another 18-year-old girl developed left tinnitus, left exophthalmos, and conjunctival injection 6 months after a traffic accident involving no demonstrable abnormal findings in the radiologic exam. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated a markedly dilated left MMA draining to the MMV, left cavernous sinus, and left superior ophthalmic vein. In both cases, coil embolization was performed with total obliteration of the fistular point.","230":"Fixation of the C1-2 segment is challenging because of the complex anatomy in the region and the need for a high degree of accuracy to avoid complications. Preoperative 3D-computed tomography (CT) scans can help reduce the risk of complications in the vertebral artery, spinal cord, and nerve roots. However, the patient may be susceptible to injury if the patient's anatomy does not match the preoperative CT scans. The intraoperative 3D image-based navigation systems have reduced complications in instrument-assisted techniques due to greater accuracy. This study aimed to compare the radiologic outcomes of C1-2 fusion surgery between intraoperative CT image-guided operation and fluoroscopy-guided operation. We retrospectively reviewed the radiologic images of 34 patients who underwent C1-2 fusion spine surgery from January 2009 to November 2018 at our hospital. We assessed 17 cases each of degenerative cervical disease and trauma in a study population of 18 males and 16 females. The mean age was 54.8 years. A total of 139 screws were used and the surgical procedures included 68 screws in the C1 lateral mass, 58 screws in C2 pedicle, nine screws in C2 lamina and C2 pars screws, four lateral mass screws in sub-axial level. Of the 34 patients, 19 patients underwent screw insertion using intraoperative mobile CT. Other patients underwent atlantoaxial fusion with a standard fluoroscopy-guided device. A total of 139 screws were correctly positioned. We analyzed the positions of 135 screws except for the four screws that performed the lateral mass screws in C3 vertebra. Minor screw penetration was observed in seven cases (5.2%), and major pedicle screw penetration was observed in three cases (2.2%). In one case, the malposition of a C2 pedicle screw was confirmed, which was subsequently corrected. There were no complications regarding vertebral artery injury or onset of new neurologic deficits. The screw malposition rate was lower (5.3%) in patients who underwent intraoperative CT-based navigation than that for fluoroscopy-guided cases (10.2%). And we confirmed that the operation time can be significantly reduced by surgery using intraoperative O-arm device. Spinal navigation using intraoperative cone-beam CT scans is reliable for posterior fixation in unstable C1-2 pathologies and can be reduced the operative time. ","231":"Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor VIII (MFG-E8) may play a key role in inflammatory responses and has the potential to function as a neuroprotective agent for ameliorating brain injury in cerebral infarction. This study aimed to determine the role of MFG-E8 in brain injury in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia in a rat model. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by occluding the middle cerebral artery with the modified intraluminal filament technique. Twenty-four hours after ischemia induction, rats were randomly assigned to two groups and treated with either recombinant human MFG-E8 or saline. Functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), and infarct volumes were evaluated using histology. Anti-inflammation, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis were assessed using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1), and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)\/doublecortin (DCX), respectively. Our results showed that intravenous MFG-E8 treatment did not reduce the infarct volume; however, the mNSS test revealed that neurobehavioral deficits were significantly improved in the MFG-E8-treated group than in the vehicle group. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significantly lower number of Iba-1-positive cells and higher number of RECA-1 in the periinfarcted brain region, and significantly higher numbers of BrdU- and DCX-positive cells in the subventricular zone in the MFG-E8-treated group than in the vehicle group. Our findings suggest that MFG-E8 improves neurological function by suppressing inflammation and enhancing angiogenesis and neuronal proliferation in the subacute phase of cerebral infarction. ","232":"In spite of the developing endovascular era, large (15-25 mm) and giant (&gt;25 mm) wide-neck cerebral aneurysms remained technically challenging. Intracranial flow-diverting stents (FDS) were developed to address these challenges by targeting aneurysm hemodynamics to promote aneurysm occlusion. In 2011, the first FDS approved for use in the United States market. Shortly thereafter, the Pipeline of Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms (PUFS) study was published demonstrating high efficacy and a similar complication profile to other intracranial stents. The initial FDA instructions for use (IFU) limited its use to patients 22 years old or older with wide-necked large or giant aneurysms of the internal carotid artery (ICA) from the petrous segment to superior hypophyseal artery\/ophthalmic segment. Expanded IFU was tested in the Prospective Study on Embolization of Intracranial Aneurysms with PipelineTM Embolization Device (PREMIER) trial. With further post-approval clinical data, the United States FDA expanded the IFU to include patients with small or medium, wide-necked saccular or fusiform aneurysms from the petrous ICA to the ICA terminus. However, IFU is more restrictive in South Korea than in United States. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have sought to evaluate the overall efficacy of FDS for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms and consistently identify FDS as an effective technique for the treatment of aneurysms broadly with complication rates similar to other traditional techniques. A growing body of literature has demonstrated high efficacy of FDS for small aneurysms; distal artery aneurysms; non-saccular aneurysms posterior circulation aneurysms and complication rates similar to traditional techniques. In the short interval since the Pipeline Embolization Device was first introduced, FDS has been firmly entrenched as a powerful tool in the endovascular armamentarium. As new FDS are developed, established FDS are refined, and delivery systems are improved the uses for FDS will only expand further. Researchers continue to work to optimize the mechanical characteristics of the FDS themselves, aiming to optimize deploy ability and efficacy. With expanded use for small to medium aneurysms and posterior circulation aneurysms, FDS technology is firmly entrenched as a powerful tool to treat challenging aneurysms, both primarily and as an adjunct to coil embolization. With the aforementioned advances, the ease of FDS deployment will improve and complication rates will be further minimized. This will only further establish FDS deployment as a key strategy in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms.","233":"Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the main procedure in carotid surgery, as well as the most frequent vascular procedure. Two techniques of CEA are available : eversion and conventional plus patch angioplasty. Eversion CEA is anatomic procedure that reduces ischemic and total operative time. Simultaneous correction of the joined carotid kinking and coiling is possible, easy and safe, while the usage of patch is excluded. Thanks to oblique shape of anastomosis, eversion CEA is associated with low risk of long-term restenosis. The false anastomotic aneurysms occurrence is very rare, almost impossible after eversion CEA. However, the usage of carotid shunt during eversion CEA is not always simple, while proximal or distal extension of the carotid plaque can make eversion CEA more difficult and risky. Eversion CEA should be the first choice in carotid surgery. Conventional CEA is indicated in cases when carotid plaque is extended more than usual, as well as, if the usage of carotid shunt is necessary.","234":"It can be assumed that the progression of scoliosis in the juvenile period will increase the asymmetry in the rib cage, and thus will contribute to an increase in the breast asymmetry (BA) in the future. We are looking for answers to the questions; \"How will the breasts look with respect to each other and what is the possibility of developing BA in the early follow-up period following the early surgical treatment and final fusion surgery of juvenile idiopathic scoliosis (JIS)?\" For this reason, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the breast asymmetries of patients in the period after the final fusion. Following growing rod treatment, final fusion was achieved in 12 females with JIS. We used the anthropomorphic measurement of the modified BREAST-V formula to assess whether there was an asymmetry between the breasts after an average of 4.8 years (2-11) following final fusion. In comparison, the mean volume of the left breast (222.4 mL [range, 104.1-330.2]) was larger than the mean volume of the right breast volume (214.5 mL [range, 95.2-326.7]) (p=0.034). The left breast was larger in 75% of the patients. BA was observed in 50% of the patients. No correlation was detected between the Cobb angle of the patient after final fusion and BA (p=0.688). In the late follow-up period, BA was detected in 50% of the patients with JIS who achieved final fusion after treatment with growing rod. In majority of the patients, left breast was larger. The patients with JIS and their families can be informed prior to the operation about the probability of BA seen in the follow-up period after fusion. ","235":"To generate synthetic spine magnetic resonance (MR) images from spine computed tomography (CT) using generative adversarial networks (GANs), as well as to determine the similarities between synthesized and real MR images. GANs were trained to transform spine CT image slices into spine magnetic resonance T2 weighted (MRT2) axial image slices by combining adversarial loss and voxel-wise loss. Experiments were performed using 280 pairs of lumbar spine CT scans and MRT2 images. The MRT2 images were then synthesized from 15 other spine CT scans. To evaluate whether the synthetic MR images were realistic, two radiologists, two spine surgeons, and two residents blindly classified the real and synthetic MRT2 images. Two experienced radiologists then evaluated the similarities between subdivisions of the real and synthetic MRT2 images. Quantitative analysis of the synthetic MRT2 images was performed using the mean absolute error (MAE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The mean overall similarity of the synthetic MRT2 images evaluated by radiologists was 80.2%. In the blind classification of the real MRT2 images, the failure rate ranged from 0% to 40%. The MAE value of each image ranged from 13.75 to 34.24 pixels (mean, 21.19 pixels), and the PSNR of each image ranged from 61.96 to 68.16 dB (mean, 64.92 dB). This was the first study to apply GANs to synthesize spine MR images from CT images. Despite the small dataset of 280 pairs, the synthetic MR images were relatively well implemented. Synthesis of medical images using GANs is a new paradigm of artificial intelligence application in medical imaging. We expect that synthesis of MR images from spine CT images using GANs will improve the diagnostic usefulness of CT. To better inform the clinical applications of this technique, further studies are needed involving a large dataset, a variety of pathologies, and other MR sequence of the lumbar spine.

However, most clinicians treating stroke consider mechanical thrombectomy as the standard treatment rather than using IV tPA alone. This paradigm shift was based on five RCTs investigating efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke conducted from 2010 to 2015. They demonstrated that mechanical thrombectomy was effective and safe in acute ischemic stroke with anterior circulation occlusion when performed within 6 hours of stroke onset. There are four reasons underlying the different results observed between the trials conducted in 2013 and 2015. First, the three RCTs of 2013 used low-efficiency thrombectomy devices. Second, the three RCTs used insufficient image selection criteria. Third, following the initial presentation at the hospital, reperfusion treatment required a long time. Fourth, the three RCTs showed a low rate of successful recanalization. Time is the most important factor in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, current trends utilize advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging and multi-channel computer tomographic perfusion, to facilitate the detection of core infarction, penumbra, and collateral flows. These efforts demonstrate that patient selection may overcome the barriers of time in specific cases.","240":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the anterior approach following intraoperative reduction under general anesthesia in patients with cervical facet fracture and dislocation. Twenty-three patients with single level cervical facet fracture and dislocation who were subjected to the anterior approach alone following immediate intraoperative reduction under general anesthesia from March 2013 to December 2017 were enrolled in this study. Neurological status, clinical outcome, and radiological studies were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, and during the follow-up period. The cohort comprised 15 men and eight women with a mean age of 57 years (from 24 to 81). All patients were operated on within the first 8 hours following the injury. After gentle manual reduction or closed reduction with Gardner-Wells traction, under general anesthesia monitored by somatosensory-evoked potentials, all operations were successfully completed using the anterior approach alone except in two patients, who had a risk of over-distraction. In them, a satisfactory gentle manual reduction or closed reduction was not possible, and required open posterior reduction of the locked facets followed by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. In one patient, screw retropulsion was observed in 1 month after surgery. There were no reduction-related complications or neurological aggravations after surgery. All patients showed evidence of stability at the instrumented level at the final follow-up (mean follow-up, 12 months). Anterior approach following intraoperative reduction monitored by somatosensory-evoked potentials under general anesthesia for cervical dislocation and locked facets is a relatively safe and effective alternative when cervical alignment is achieved by intraoperative reduction. ","241":"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating conditions and many SCI patients suffer neurological sequelae. Stem cell therapies are expected to be beneficial for many patients with central nervous system injuries, including SCI. Adult stem cells (ASCs) are not associated with the risks which embryonic stem cells have such as malignant transformation, or ethical problems, and can be obtained relatively easily. Consequently, many researchers are currently studying the effects of ASCs in clinical trials. The environment of transplanted cells applied in the injured spinal cord differs between the phases of SCI; therefore, many researchers have investigated these phases to determine the optimal time window for stem cell therapy in animals. In addition, the results of clinical trials should be evaluated according to the phase in which stem cells are transplanted. In general, the subacute phase is considered to be optimal for stem cell transplantation. Among various candidates of transplantable ASCs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are most widely studied due to their clinical safety. MSCs are also less immunogenic than neural stem\/progenitor cells and consequently immunosuppressants are rarely required. Attempts have been made to enhance the effects of stem cells using scaffolds, trophic factors, cytokines, and other drugs in animal and\/or human clinical studies. Over the past decade, several clinical trials have suggested that transplantation of MSCs into the injured spinal cord elicits therapeutic effects on SCI and is safe; however, the clinical effects are limited at present. Therefore, new therapeutic agents, such as genetically enhanced stem cells which effectively secrete neurotrophic factors or cytokines, must be developed based on the safety of pure MSCs.","242":null,"243":"To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of lacosamide after experimental peripheral nerve injury in rats. A total of 28 male wistar albino rats weighing 300-350 g were divided into four groups.

At 7 days after the injury all animals were sacrificed after walking track analysis. A 5 mL blood sample was drawn for biochemical analysis, and sciatic nerve tissues were removed for histopathological examination. There is low tissue damage in lacosamide treated group and antioxidant anzymes and malondialdehyde levels were higher than non-treated and placebo treated group. However there was no improvement on clinical assessment. The biochemical and histological analyses revealed that lacosamide has neuroprotective effect in PNI in rats.

Herein we evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of multiple thoracolumbar fractures depending on continuous or noncontinuous status. From January 2010 to January 2016, 48 patients with acute thoracic and lumbar multiple fractures who underwent posterior fusion surgery were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups (group A : continuous; group B : noncontinuous). We investigated the causes of the injuries, the locations of the injuries, the range of fusion levels, and the functional outcomes based on the patients' general characteristics. A total of 48 patients were enrolled (group A : 25 patients; group B : 23 patients). Both groups had similar pre-surgical clinical and radiologic features. The fusion level included three segments (group A : 4; group B : 5) or four segments (group A : 19; group B : 5). Group B required more instrumented segments than did group A. Group A scored 23.5 and group B scored 33.4 on the Korean Oswestry Disability Index (KODI) at the time of last follow-up. In both groups, longer fusion was associated with worse KODI score. In this study, due to the assumption of similar initial clinical and radiologic features in both group, the mechanism of multiple fractures is presumed to be the same between continuous and noncontinuous fractures. The noncontinuous fracture group had worse KODI scores in long-term follow-up, thought to be due to long fusion level.

Autogenous bone grafts were used in 13 patients (group 1), and a metal cage with allogenic bone grafts was used in 12 patients (group 2). Clinical outcomes were assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and neurological status. Additionally, the serological results and the radiographic results using the sagittal Cobb angle were compared. Fusion was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) imaging at 24 months postoperatively. Both groups showed a significant decrease in the postoperative mean VAS scores; however, only, group 1 patients showed a significantly higher VAS score than group 2 patients, 1 month postoperatively (p=0.002). The postoperative neurological status significantly improved. Elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate values returned to normal limits at the 2-year follow-up without recurrent infection. No significant intergroup difference was observed in Cobb angle. Bony fusion was confirmed in all patients at CT 24 months postoperatively.

The mean preoperative VAS scores for back and leg pain were 6.90 and 4.23, respectively; these decreased after PEN as follows : 2.25 and 1.45, respectively, at 1 month; 2.61 and 1.68, respectively, at 3 months; 2.28 and 1.48, respectively, at 6 months; and 2.88 and 1.48, respectively, at 12 months (p&lt;0.001). The decrease in VAS scores for leg pain was significantly greater in the extrusion and sequestration groups than in the other two groups (p&lt;0.05); there were no other significant differences among groups. More than 70% patients exhibited good or excellent 12-month outcomes according to Odom's criteria. Subsequent surgery was required for 59 patients (13.7%), with a significantly higher rate in the extrusion (25.0%) and sequestration (30.0%) groups than in the bulging (7.3%) and protrusion (13.8%) groups (p&lt;0.05). Nevertheless, subsequent surgery was not required for &gt;70% patients with extrusion or sequestration. Patients with Pfirrmann grades 1-3 (14.0-21.5%) showed a significantly higher rate of subsequent surgery than those with Pfirrmann grade 0 (4.9%; p&lt;0.05). Our findings suggest that PEN is an effective treatment for back and leg pain caused by single-level LDH, with the outcomes remaining unaffected by the LDH type. ","256":"Proximal flow control achieved with a balloon guide catheter (BGC) during endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke is reviewed in this article. In clinical practice, BGCs offer a multi-faceted approach for clot retrieval by creating proximal flow arrest, reducing embolic burden, and shortening procedure time. Evaluation of frontline thrombectomy procedures with BGCs revealed advantages of combined use over the conventional guide catheter (CGC), notably in the significant reduction of distal emboli to both the affected and previously unaffected territories. Recently, new measures of early and complete reperfusion at first thrombectomy pass have been identified as independent predictors of improved outcomes, which were consistently demonstrated with use of BGC as a safe and effective option to minimize number of passes during intervention. Prior randomized controlled trials reported the positive correlation between BGC-treated patients and a lower risk of mortality as well as shortened procedure time. While BGC use is more common in stent retriever-mediated mechanical thrombectomy, preliminary data has shown the potential benefit of device application during contact aspiration thrombectomy to achieve successful recanalization. However, the question of which major endovascular strategy reigns superior as a frontline remains to be answered. Along with clinical case assessments, BGC performance during in-vitro simulation was analyzed to further understand mechanisms for optimization of thrombectomy technique.","257":"We investigated the effect of hypnotics on sleep quality, cognitive function, and depressive mood in patients with insomnia following brain tumor resection. From patients who underwent brain tumor resection, we recruited 10 patients with insomnia who received hypnotics for more than 1 week during a 3-week follow-up period (insomnia group). We also recruited 12 control patients with brain tumors but without insomnia (control group). We evaluated sleep quality at baseline and 3 weeks later using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and investigated cognitive function and depression using the Computerized Neuropsychological Test and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). At baseline, SSS, ISI, PSQI, and BDI scores were significantly higher and visual continuous performance test (VCPT) and auditory continuous performance test (ACPT) scores were significantly lower in the insomnia than in the control group. Three weeks later, the patients who had received hypnotics had significantly higher ISI, PSQI, ESS, VCPT, ACPT, visual span forward and backward, and visual recognition test scores, and significantly lower BDI scores. Quality of sleep in patients with insomnia following brain tumor resection was initially poor but improved significantly after taking hypnotic medication. Further, the hypnotic medications appeared to contribute to the amelioration of cognitive impairments and depressive moods in patients who previously underwent brain tumor resection. We thus recommend the use of hypnotics for patients with brain tumors with insomnia. ","258":"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a member of the neurotrophic factor family and plays a vital role in the physiological processes of organisms, especially in the nervous system. Many recent studies have reported that NGF is also involved in the regulation of tumourigenesis by either promoting or suppressing tumor growth, which depends on the location and type of tumor. However, little is known regarding the effect of NGF on interspinal schwannoma (IS). In the present study, we aimed to explored whether mouse nerve growth factor (mNGF), which is widely used in the clinic, can influence the growth of interspinal schwannoma cells (ISCs) isolated from IS in vitro. ISCs were isolated, cultured and identified by S-100 with immunofluorescence analysis. S-100-positive cells were divided into five groups, and separately cultured with various concentrations of mNGF (0 [phosphate buffered saline, PBS], 40, 80, 160, and 320 ng\/mL) for 24 hours. Western blot and quantantive real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were applied to detect tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) receptor and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in each group. Crystal violet staining was selected to assess the effect of mNGF (160 ng\/mL) on ISCs growth. ISCs growth was enhanced by mNGF in a dose-dependent manner. The result of crystal violet staining revealed that it was significantly strengthened the cells growth kinetics when cultured with 160 ng\/mL mNGF compared to PBS group. Western blot and quantantive real time PCR discovered that TrkA receptor and mRNA expression were both up-regualated under the condition of mNGF, expecially in 160 ng\/mL, while the exoression of p75NTR demonstrated no difference among groups. From these data, we conclude that exogenous mNGF can facilitate ISC growth by activating both TrkA receptor and p75NTR. In addition, patients who are suffering from IS should not be administered mNGF in the clinic.

The medical records were reviewed retrospectively for 856 cases. A total of 66 cases of ASD were enrolled. On preop magnetic resonance imaging, disc degeneration was measured at the upper and lower parts of surgically treated levels and confirmed by the commonly used Pfirrmann grade. Segmental flexibility in sagittal plane was embodied in segment range of motion (ROM) obtained through flexion and extension X-ray before surgery. Coronal angle was recorded as methods Cobb's angle including fusion levels preoperatively. For the comparison of categorical variables between two independent groups, the chi-square test and Fisher exact test were performed. Proximal ASD and distal ASD were 37\/856 (4.32%) and 29\/856 (3.39%), respectively. The incidence of proximal ASD was relatively high but insignificant differences. In comparison between ASD group and non ASD group, proximal Pfirmman was higher in proximal ASD and distal Pfirmman was higher in distal ASD group (p=0.005, p&lt;0.008, respectively). However, in the ROM, proximal ROM was higher in proximal ASD, but distal ROM was not different between the two groups (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.995, respectively). Coronal angle was not quite different in both groups (p=0.846). In spite of higher frequency in ASD in proximal level in spinal fusion, it is not clear that incidence of ASD in proximal level is not higher than that of distal ASD group in more than 2 level thoracolumbar fusions. Not only Pfirrmann grade but also proximal segmental ROM is risk factor for predicting the occurrence of ASD in patients more than 2 level of thoracolumbar spine fusion operation excluding L5S1. ","261":"Although surgical intervention, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), is the standard treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs), its effectiveness and safety are unclear. Therefore, this study compared the safety and efficacy of conservative treatment with that of PVP for acute OVCFs. Patients with single-level OVCFs who were treated conservatively with a transdermal fentanyl patch (TFP) or with PVP between March 2013 and December 2017 and followed-up for more than 1 year were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with pathologic fractures, fractures of more than two columns, or a history of PVP were excluded. Clinical outcomes (visual analog scale [VAS] scores) and radiographic factors were evaluated, including changes in the compression rate of the corresponding vertebral body at onset and after 12 months, sagittal Cobb angle at onset and after 6 and 12 months, and the incidence of adjacent compression fractures. Of the 131 patients evaluated, 75 were treated conservatively using TFPs and 56 underwent PVP. We divided the patients into TFP and PVP groups. Their baseline characteristics (including sex, level of fracture, and bone mineral density T-scores) were similar, but the TFP group was significantly younger. The overall VAS score for pain showed a greater decrease during the first month (1 week after PVP) in the PVP group but remained similar in the two groups thereafter. The compression rate after 12 months increased in the TFP group but decreased in the PVP group. Five patients in the PVP group, but none in the TFP group, experienced adjacent compression fractures within 12 months. We compared clinical and radiological outcomes between the TFP and PVP groups. The immediate pain reduction effect was superior in the PVP group, but the final clinical outcome was similar. Although the PVP group had a better-preserved compression rate than the TFP group for 1 year, the development of adjacent fractures was significantly higher. Although TFPs seemed to be beneficial in reducing the failure rate of conservative treatment, the possibility of side effects (22.6%, 17 out of 75 patients, in this study) should be carefully monitored.

Data from 160 patients who underwent primary LD were collected retrospectively. Demographic features, radiologic findings including Pfirrmann disc degeneration, and surgical information were analyzed to compare risks between revision and non-revision patients. The revision rate was 15% (24 patients), and the mean follow-up was 28.3 months. HLD recurrence was not related to any demographic characteristics. Primary and secondary LD were most common at the L4-5 level, but the level of operation was not significantly associated with revision. Primary LD most commonly had a Pfirrmann disc degeneration grade of 3, followed by 4. For recurrent HLD, Pfirrmann grade 4 was most common and was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). A body mass index (BMI) over 30 was considered obese and was significantly related with HLD revision (p&lt;0.05).

Twelve patients were operated using dual MCGR technique in one center, while 15 patients were operated using dual TGR technique for EOS in another center. Patients' demographic characteristics, complications and radiological measurements such as cobb angle, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, T1-S1 range (mm), proximal junctional angle, distal junctional angle, sagittal balance, coronal balance, pelvic incidence, sacral slope and pelvic tilt were assessed and compared in preoperative, postoperative and last follow-up period. Age and sex distributions were similar in both groups. The mean number of lengthening in the MCGR group was 12 (8-15) and 4.8 (3-7) in the TGR group. Two techniques were shown to be effective in controlling the curvature and in the increase of T1-S1 distance. In TGR group, four patients had rod fractures, six patients had screw pull-out and four patients had an infection, whereas three patients had screw pull-out and one patient had infection complications in the MCGR group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of cobb angle, coronal and sagittal balance and sagittal pelvic parameters. MCGR can cause hypokyphosis and proximal junctional kyphosis in a minimum 2-year follow-up period. The implant-related complications were less in the MCGR group. However, larger case groups and longer follow-up periods are required for the better understanding of the superiority of one method on other in terms of complications.

Radiological records of 362 cases of SAC during 10 years were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included in this study if they had follow-up angiogram using catheter selected angiography at least twice. All subjected were followed up from 12 months to over 30 months. Of 120 patients, 123 aneurysms were enrolled. Patient data including age, sex, aneurysm size, neck size, procedural complication, kinds of stent, ISS associated symptom, ruptured state, location of ISS, degree of ISS, radiologic prognosis of ISS, follow-up period of time, and medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and smoking were collected.Statistical comparisons of group clinical characteristics were conducted for the total population. Among 123 casesof aneurysm, 22 cases (17.9%) of ISS were revealed on follow-up angiography. Multiple stenting was performed in three cases and intra-procedural rupture occurred in two cases. Most cases were asymptomatic and symptomatic stenosis was identified in only one case. Sixteen cases were ruptured aneurysm. Mild stenosis was observed in 11 cases. Moderate stenosis was found in eight cases and severe stenosis was identified in three cases. Mean timing of identification of ISS was 8.90 months. The most common type was proximal type. Most cases were improved or not changed on follow-up angiography. Only one case was aggravated from mild stenosis to occlusion of parent artery. Mean follow-up period was 44.3 months. We compared risk factors and characteristic between ISS group and non-ISS group using univariate analysis. Multiple stenting was performed for three cases (13.6%) of the ISS group and four cases (4.0%) of the non-ISS group, showing no statistical difference between the two groups (p=0.108). Additionally, the proportion of patients who had more than two risk factors among four medical risk factors (hypertension, DM, dyslipidemia, and smoking) was higher in the ISS group than that in the non-ISS group, the difference between the two was not statistically significant either (31.8% vs. 12.9%, p=0.05). Clinical course and long-term prognosis of ISS might be benign. Most cases of ISS could be improved or not aggravated. Control of medical co-morbidity might be important.

However, the effect of the degree of physical exertion on the circadian pattern has not been studied in detail. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the effect of physical exertion on the circadian pattern of aSAH. Of the 335 patients presenting with aSAH from January 2012 to December 2017, 234 patients with identifiable onset time and metabolic equivalent (MET) values were enrolled. The onset time of aSAH was divided into 4-hour intervals. The patient's physical exertion was then assessed on a scale between 1 and 8 METs using generally accepted MET values, and categorized into two groups-light exertion (1 to 4 METs) and moderate to heavy exertion (5 to 8 METs)-to determine the effect of the degree of physical exertion on the onset time distribution of aSAH. Multivariate analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) between the two groups to determine the effect of the degree of physical exertion on each set of time periods. There was a definite bimodal onset pattern that peaked at 08:00-12:00 hours followed by 16:00-20:00 hours (p &lt;0.001). MET values at all time intervals were found to be significantly higher than the night time (00:00-04:00 hours) values (p&lt;0.031). The MET value distribution showed a unimodal pattern that slightly differed from the bimodal distribution of the onset time of aSAH. There were no significant differences in the ORs of each time interval according to the degree of the MET value. This study reaffirmed that aSAH occurs in a bimodal pattern, especially showing the highest prevalence in the morning. Although aSAH could be related to daily activity, there were no significant changes in diurnal variations affected by the degree of physical exertion.

This study was a retrospective analysis of data obtained from the national health-claim database provided by the National Health Insurance Service for 2008-2016 using the International Classification of Diseases. The crude incidence and age-standardized incidence of HLD were calculated, and additional analysis was conducted according to age and sex. Changes in trends in treatment methods and some treatments were analyzed using the Korean Classification of Diseases procedure codes. The number of patients diagnosed with HLD was 472245 in 2008 and increased to 537577 in 2012; however, it decreased to 478697 in 2016. The pattern of crude incidence and the standardized incidence were also similar. Overall, the incidence of HLD increased annually for the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 70s until 2012 and then decreased. However, the incidence of HLD for the 80s continued to increase. The crude incidence of HLD in female patients exceeded that of male patients in their middle age (30s or 40s) and was 1.5-1.6 times higher than in male patients in their 60s.

The rate of younger patients (the 20s, 30s, and 40s) who underwent OD was decreased, and the rate of younger patients who underwent percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy was increased. However, the rate of older patients (the 70s and 80s) who underwent OD was continuously increased. This nationwide data on HLD from 2008 to 2016 in the ROK demonstrated that the crude incidence and the standardized incidence increased until 2012 and then decreased. The annual crude incidence was different according to age and sex.

It often causes cervical instability like atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS), subaxial subluxation, and vertical subluxation (VS). In order to find the relation between RA and cord compression, we will evaluate the characteristics and risk factors of basilar invagination (BI) and cervicomedullary junction (CMJ) compression. From January 2007 to May 2015, 12667 patients administrated to Hanyang University Medical Center. Four thousand three hundred eighty-six patients took cervical X-ray and 250 patients took cervical computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic parameters, medication records were obtained from 242 patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with correlation of CMJ compression, basin-dental interval (BDI), basin-posterior axial line interval (BAI), pannus formation, BI, and AAS. In the point of CMJ compression, atlantodental interval (ADI), posterior-atlantodental interval, BAI, AAS, and BI are relatively highly correlated. Patients with BI have 82 times strong possibility of radiologic confirmed CMJ compression, while AAS has 6-fold and pannus formation has the 3-fold possibility. Compared to the low incidence of BI, AAS and pannus formation have more proportion in CMJ compression. Furthermore, wrist joint erosion was correlated with VS and AAS. BI has a very strong possibility of CMJ compression, while AAS and pannus formation have a high proportion in CMJ compression. Hence bilateral wrist joint erosion can be used as an indicator for the timing of screening test for cervical involvement.

The radiographic evaluation included TMC subsidence, fusion status, and interbody height. Thirty-eight patients underwent single-level and 12 patients underwent two-level corpectomy with a mean follow-up period of 16.8 months. In all, 19 patients (38%) had excellent outcomes and 25 patients (50%) had good outcomes. Two patients (4%) in whom C5 palsy occurred were categorized as poor. The fusion rate at the last follow-up was 98%, and the severe subsidence rate was 34%.

Therefore, we investigated the correlation between the carotid vasa vasorum activities and carotid plaque vulnerability using indocyanine green video angiography (ICG-VA) during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Sixty-nine patients who underwent CEA were enrolled prospectively from September 2015 to December 2017. During CEA, a bolus of ICG was injected intravenously before and after resecting the atheroma. Additionally, we performed immunohistochemistry using CD68 (a surface marker of macrophages), CD117 (a surface marker of mast cells), and CD4 and CD8 (surface markers of T-cells) antibodies to analyze the resected plaque specimens. The density of active vasa vasorum was observed in all patients using ICG-VA. The vasa vasorum externa (VVE) and interna (VVI) were seen in 11 (16%) and 57 patients (82.6%), respectively. Macroscopically, the VVE-type patterns were strongly associated with preoperative angiographic instability (81.8%, p=0.005) and carotid plaque vulnerability (90.9%, p=0.017).

Angiographic follow-ups were done immediately after placement of the device, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At last follow-up, the aneurysm and the device-implanted parent artery were harvested. Histopathologic findings of aneurysms at 4 weeks follow-up showed intra-aneurysm thrombus formation in laminating fashion, and neointimal thickening at the mid-segment of aneurysm. However, there are inhomogenous findings in aneurysms treated with the same type of FD showing same angiographic outcomes. At 12 weeks, aneurysms of complete and near-complete occlusion revealed markedly shrunken aneurysm filled with organized connective tissues with thin neointima. Aneurysms of incomplete occlusion at 12 weeks showed small amount of organized thrombus around fringe neck and large empty space with thick neointmal formation. Neointimal thickness and diameter stenosis was not significantly different between the groups of FD specification and follow-up period. Intra-aneurysmal thrombus formation and organization seem to be an important factor for the complete occlusion of aneurysms treated using the FD.

By incorporation of DTI data, the relation between tumor and adjacent white matter tracts was reconstructed and assessed in the neuronavigation system. Distance from tumor border to CST was measured. The sub-portion of CST in closest proximity to tumor was found displaced in all patients. The chief disruptive changes were classified as follows : complete interruption, partial interruption, or simple displacement. Partial interruption was evident in seven patients (41.2%) whose lesions were close to cortex. In the other 10 patients (58.8%), delineated CSTs were intact but distorted. No complete CST interruption was identified. Overall, the mean distance from resection border to CST was 6.12 mm (range, 0-21), as opposed to 8.18 mm (range, 2-21) with simple displacement and 2.33 mm (range, 0-5) with partial interruption. The clinical outcomes were analyzed in groups stratified by intervening distances (close, &lt;5 mm; moderated, 5-10 mm; far, &gt;10 mm). For the primary brain tumor patients, the proportion of completely resected tumors increased progressively from close to far grouping (42.9%, 50%, and 100%, respectively).

The present study was to demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm for assessing osteoporosis using Hounsfield units (HU) of preoperative lumbar CT coupling with data of QCT. We reviewed 70 patients undergoing both QCT and conventional lumbar CT for spine surgery. The T-scores of 198 lumbar vertebra was assessed in QCT and the HU of vertebral body at the same level were measured in conventional CT by the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) system. A multiple regression algorithm was applied to predict the T-score using three independent variables (age, sex, and HU of vertebral body on conventional CT) coupling with T-score of QCT. Next, a logistic regression algorithm was applied to predict osteoporotic or non-osteoporotic vertebra. The Tensor flow and Python were used as the machine learning tools. The Tensor flow user interface developed in our institute was used for easy code generation. The predictive model with multiple regression algorithm estimated similar T-scores with data of QCT. HU demonstrates the similar results as QCT without the discordance in only one non-osteoporotic vertebra that indicated osteoporosis. From the training set, the predictive model classified the lumbar vertebra into two groups (osteoporotic vs. non-osteoporotic spine) with 88.0% accuracy. In a test set of 40 vertebrae, classification accuracy was 92.5% when the learning rate was 0.0001 (precision, 0.939; recall, 0.969; F1 score, 0.954; area under the curve, 0.900). This study is a simple machine learning model applicable in the spine research field. The machine learning model can predict the T-score and osteoporotic vertebrae solely by measuring the HU of conventional CT, and this would help spine surgeons not to under-estimate the osteoporotic spine preoperatively.

Precise and realistic 3D printed aneurysm models may improve patients' understanding of the 3D cerebral aneurysm structure. Therefore, we created patient-specific 3D printed aneurysm models as an educational and clinical tool for patients undergoing aneurysm clipping surgery. Herein, we describe how these 3D models can be created and the effects of applying them for patient education purpose. Twenty patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm were randomly divided into two groups. We explained and received informed consent from patients in whom 3D printed models-(group I) or computed tomography angiography-(group II) was used to explain aneurysm clipping surgery. The 3D printed intracranial aneurysm models were created based on time-offlight magnetic resonance angiography using a 3D printer with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin as the model material. After describing the model to the patients, they completed a questionnaire about their understanding and satisfaction with aneurysm clipping surgery. The 3D printed models were successfully made, and they precisely replicated the actual intracranial aneurysm structure of the corresponding patients. The use of the 3D model was associated with a higher understanding and satisfaction of preoperative patient education and consultation. On a 5-point Likert scale, the average level of understanding was scored as 4.7 (range, 3.0-5.0) in group I. In group II, the average response was 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.0). The 3D printed models were accurate and useful for understanding the intracranial aneurysm structure. In this study, 3D printed intracranial aneurysm models were proven to be helpful in preoperative patient consultation. ","287":null,"288":"Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is due to the vascular compression of the facial nerve at its root exit zone (REZ). Microvascular decompression (MVD) of the facial nerve near the REZ is an effective treatment for HFS. In MVD for HFS, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (INM) has two purposes. The first purpose is to prevent injury to neural structures such as the vestibulocochlear nerve and facial nerve during MVD surgery, which is possible through INM of brainstem auditory evoked potential and facial nerve electromyography (EMG). The second purpose is the unique feature of MVD for HFS, which is to assess and optimize the effectiveness of the vascular decompression. The purpose is achieved mainly through monitoring of abnormal facial nerve EMG that is called as lateral spread response (LSR) and is also partially possible through Z-L response, facial F-wave, and facial motor evoked potentials. Based on the information regarding INM mentioned above, MVD for HFS can be considered as a more safe and effective treatment.","289":"Since less invasive endovascular treatment was introduced to South Korea in 1994, a considerable proportion of endovascular treatments have been performed by neuroradiology doctors, and endovascular treatments by vascular neurosurgeons have recently increased. However, few specific statistics are known regarding how many endovascular treatments are performed by neurosurgeons. Thus, authors compared endovascular treatments collaboratively performed by vascular neurosurgeons with all cases throughout South Korea from 2013 to 2017 to elucidate the role of neurosurgeons in the field of endovascular treatment in South Korea. The Society of Korean Endovascular Neurosurgeons (SKEN) has issued annual reports every year since 2014. These reports cover statistics on endovascular treatments collaboratively or individually performed by SKEN members from 2013 to 2017. The data was requested and collected from vascular neurosurgeons in various hospitals. The study involved 77 hospitals in its first year, and 100 in its last. National statistics on endovascular treatment from all over South Korea were obtained from the Healthcare Bigdata Hub website of the Health Insurance Review &amp; Assessment Service based on the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) codes (in the case of intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis, however, statistics were based on a combination of the EDI and I63 codes, a cerebral infarction disease code) from 2013 to 2017. These two data sets were directly compared and the ratios were obtained. Regionally, during the entire study period, endovascular treatments by SKEN members were most common in Gyeonggido, followed by Seoul and Busan. Among the endovascular treatments, conventional cerebral angiography was the most common, followed by cerebral aneurysmal coiling, endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, and finally endovascular treatments for vascular malformation and tumor embolization. The number of endovascular treatments performed by SKEN members increased every year. The SKEN members have been responsible for the major role of endovascular treatments in South Korea for the recent 5 years. This was achieved through the perseverance of senior members who started out in the midst of hardship, the establishment of standards for the training\/certification of endovascular neurosurgery, and the enthusiasm of current SKEN members who followed. To provide better treatment to patients, we will have to make further progress in SKEN.

This is a single-institute retrospective descriptive study of patients undergoing surgery for CNS tumours in a regional hospital of Hong Kong in the period from January 1996 to December 2016. The histological definition of CNS tumours was according to the World Health Organization classification, while the site definition for case ascertainment of CNS tumours was as set out by the Central Brain Tumour Registry of the United States. Patients of any age, who had NDHC CNS tumours, either primary or secondary, were included. The following parameters of the patients were retrieved : age at diagnosis, gender, tumour location, and histological diagnosis. Population data were obtained from sources provided by the Government of Hong Kong. The incident rate, estimated by the annual number of cases per 100000 population, for each histology grouping was calculated. Statistical analyses, both including and excluding brain metastases, were performed. Statistical analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel, 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Among the 2134 cases of NDHC CNS tumours, there were 1936 cases of intracranial tumours and 198 cases of spinal tumours. The annual number of cases per 100000 population of combined primary intracranial and spinal CNS tumours was 3.6 in 1996, and 11.1 in 2016. Comparing the 5-year average annual number of cases per 100000 population of primary CNS tumours from the period 1996-2000 to 2011-2015, there was an 88% increase, which represent an increase in the absolute number of cases by 4.52 cases\/100000 population. This increase was mainly contributed by benign histologies. In the aforementioned periods, meningiomas increased by 1.45 cases\/100000 population; schwannomas by 1.05 cases\/100000 population, and pituitary adenomas by 0.91 cases\/100000 population. While gliomas had a fluctuating 5-year average annual number of cases per 100000 population, it only had an absolute increase of 0.51 cases\/100000 population between the 2 periods, which was mainly accounted for by the change in glioblastomas. This retrospective study of CNS tumour epidemiology revealed increasing trends in the incidences of several common CNS tumour histologies in Hong Kong, which agrees with the findings in large-scale studies in Korea and the United States. It is important for different geographic locations to establish their own CNS tumour registry with well-defined and structured data collection and analysis system to meet the international standards. ","292":"Although magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has been used as minimally invasive and effective neurosurgical treatment, it exhibits some limitations, mainly related to acoustic properties of the skull barrier. This study was undertaken to identify skull characteristics that contribute to optimal ultrasonic energy transmission for MRgFUS procedures. For ex vivo skull experiments, various acoustic fields were measured under different conditions, using five non-embalmed cadaver skulls. For clinical skull analyses, brain computed tomography data of 46 patients who underwent MRgFUS ablations (18 unilateral thalamotomy, nine unilateral pallidotomy, and 19 bilateral capsulotomy) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' skull factors and sonication parameters were comparatively analyzed with respect to the cadaveric skulls. Skull experiments identified three important factors related skull penetration of ultrasound, including skull density ratio (SDR), skull volume, and incidence angle of the acoustic rays against the skull surface. In clinical results, SDR and skull volume correlated with maximal temperature (Tmax) and energy requirement to achieve Tmax (p&lt;0.05). In addition, considering the incidence angle determined by brain target location, less energy was required to reach Tmax in the central, rather than lateral targets particularly when compared between thalamotomy and capsulotomy (p&lt;0.05). This study reconfirmed previously identified skull factors, including SDR and skull volume, for successful MRgFUS; it identified an additional factor, incidence angle of acoustic rays against the skull surface. To guarantee successful transcranial MRgFUS treatment without suffering these various skull issues, further technical improvements are required.

Although most antibiotics do not cause problems if it used properly and serious side effects are rare, side effects can occur with any class of drugs and adverse reactions of antibiotics can range from mild allergic reactions to serious and fulminant adverse events. These side effects are also extremely variable from patient to patient and from antibiotic to antibiotic. A side effect of antibiotics may paradoxically increase inflammatory marker levels. Here, the author presents two cases of antibiotic-induced increase in inflammatory markers in cured infectious spondylitis. The patients were successfully treated after stopping the antibiotic therapy. The differential diagnosis between antibiotic side effects and infection should be considered very carefully because the treatment is completely different. Although the exact mechanisms underlying successful treatment without antibiotics are unclear, we should consider the side effects of antibiotics when following inflammatory markers during treatment of infectious spondylitis.","295":"","296":"Epilepsy has been known to humankind since antiquity. The surgical treatment of epilepsy began in the early days of neurosurgery and has developed greatly. Many surgical procedures have stood the test of time. However, clinicians treating epilepsy patients are now witnessing a huge tide of change. In 2017, the classification system for seizure and epilepsy types was revised nearly 36 years after the previous scheme was released. The actual difference between these systems may not be large, but there have been many conceptual changes, and clinicians must bid farewell to old terminology. Paradigms in drug discovery are changing, and novel antiseizure drugs have been introduced for clinical use. In particular, drugs that target genetic changes harbor greater therapeutic potential than previous screening-based compounds. The concept of focal epilepsy has been challenged, and now epilepsy is regarded as a network disorder. With this novel concept, stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) is becoming increasingly popular for the evaluation of dysfunctioning neuronal networks. Minimally invasive ablative therapies using SEEG electrodes and neuromodulatory therapies such as deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation are widely applied to remedy dysfunctional epilepsy networks. The use of responsive neurostimulation is currently off-label in children with intractable epilepsy.","297":"Epilepsy surgery that eliminates the epileptogenic focus or disconnects the epileptic network has the potential to significantly improve seizure control in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. Magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) has been an established option for epilepsy surgery since the US Food and Drug Administration cleared the use of MRgLITT in neurosurgery in 2007. MRgLITT is an ablative stereotactic procedure utilizing heat that is converted from laser energy, and the temperature of the tissue is monitored in real-time by MR thermography. Real-time quantitative thermal monitoring enables titration of laser energy for cellular injury, and it also estimates the extent of tissue damage. MRgLITT is applicable for lesion ablation in cases that the epileptogenic foci are localized and\/or deep-seated such as in the mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hypothalamic hamartoma. Seizure-free outcomes after MRgLITT are comparable to those of open surgery in well-selected patients such as those with mesial temporal sclerosis. Particularly in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma. In addition, MRgLITT can also be applied to ablate multiple discrete lesions of focal cortical dysplasia and tuberous sclerosis complex without the need for multiple craniotomies, as well as disconnection surgery such as corpus callosotomy. Careful planning of the target, the optimal trajectory of the laser probe, and the appropriate parameters for energy delivery are paramount to improve the seizure outcome and to reduce the complication caused by the thermal damage to the surrounding critical structures.","298":"Epilepsy is one of the major chronic neurological diseases affecting many patients. Resection surgery is the most effective therapy for medically intractable epilepsy, but it is not feasible in all patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive neuromodulation therapy that was approved in 1997 for the alleviation of seizures; however, efforts to control epilepsy by stimulating the vagus nerve have been studied for over 100 years. Although its exact mechanism is still under investigation, VNS is thought to affect various brain areas. Hence, VNS has a wide indication for various intractable epileptic syndromes and epilepsyrelated comorbidities. Moreover, recent studies have shown anti-inflammatory effects of VNS, and the indication is expanding beyond epilepsy to rheumatoid arthritis, chronic headaches, and depression. VNS yields a more than 50% reduction in seizures in approximately 60% of recipients, with an increase in reduction rates as the follow-up duration increases. The complication rate of VNS is 3-6%, and infection is the most important complication to consider. However, revision surgery was reported to be feasible and safe with appropriate measures. Recently, noninvasive VNS (nVNS) has been introduced, which can be performed transcutaneously without implantation surgery. Although more clinical trials are being conducted, nVNS can reduce the risk of infection and subsequent device failure. In conclusion, VNS has been demonstrated to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of epilepsy and various diseases, and more development is expected in the future.","299":"Epilepsy surgery revealed dramatically improved seizure outcomes over medical therapy in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Children with epilepsy, however, have multiple epileptic focuses which require multilobar resection for better seizure outcome. Multilobar resection has not only the several severe surgical complications, such as hydrocephalus and shunt-related craniosynostosis, due to intracranial volume reduction. Isolation method (disconnection surgery) was progressively studied over epileptic focus removal (resective surgery) for seizure control. This concept was first introduced for functional hemispherotomy, and its primary principle is to preserve the vital vascularized brain that is functionally disconnected from the contralateral healthy brain. Currently in most epilepsy centers, the predominant disconnection surgical methods, including functional hemispherotomy, are continually being refined and are showing excellent results. They allow the functional isolation of the hemisphere or multi-lobe, affected by severe epilepsy. This review describes recent findings concerning the indication, surgical technique, seizure outcome and complications in several disconnection surgeries including the functional hemispherotomy for refractory pediatric epilepsy.","300":"Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorder affecting 6-7 per 1000 worldwide. Nearly one-third of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy continue to have recurrent seizures despite adequate trial of more than two anti-seizure drugs : drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Children with DRE often experience cognitive and psychosocial co-morbidities requiring more urgent and aggressive treatment than adults. Epilepsy surgery can result in seizure-freedom in approximately two-third of children with improvement in cognitive development and quality of life. Understanding fundamental differences in etiology, co-morbidity, and neural plasticity between children and adults is critical for appropriate selection of surgical candidates, appropriate presurgical evaluation and surgical approach, and improved overall outcome.","301":"Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is the major cause of intractable focal epilepsy in childhood leading to epilepsy surgery. The overall seizure freedom after surgery ranges between 50-75% at 2 years after surgery and the long-term seizure freedom remain relatively stable. Seizure outcome after surgery depends on a various factors such as pathologic etiologies, extent of lesion, and types of surgery. Therefore, seizure outcome after surgery for FCD should be analyzed carefully considering cohorts' characteristics. Studies of pediatric epilepsy surgery emphasize the early surgical intervention for a better cognition. Early surgical intervention and cessation of seizure activity are important for children with intractable epilepsy. However, there are limited data on the cognitive outcome after surgery in pediatric FCD, requiring further investigation. This paper reviews the seizure and cognitive outcomes of epilepsy surgery for FCD in children. Several prognostic factors influencing seizure outcome after surgery will be discussed in detail.","302":"Brain tumors are the second most common type of structural brain lesion that causes chronic epilepsy. Patients with low-grade brain tumors often experience chronic drug-resistant epilepsy starting in childhood, which led to the concept of long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEATs). Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor and ganglioglioma are representative LEATs and are characterized by young age of onset, frequent temporal lobe location, benign tumor biology, and chronic epilepsy. Although highly relevant in clinical epileptology, the concept of LEATs has been criticized in the neuro-oncology field. Recent genomic and molecular studies have challenged traditional views on LEATs and low-grade gliomas. Molecular studies have revealed that lowgrade gliomas can largely be divided into three groups : LEATs, pediatric-type diffuse low-grade glioma (DLGG; astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma), and adult-type DLGG. There is substantial overlap between conventional LEATs and pediatric-type DLGG in regard to clinical features, histology, and molecular characteristics. LEATs and pediatric-type DLGG are characterized by mutations in BRAF, FGFR1, and MYB\/MYBL1, which converge on the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway. Gene (mutation)-centered classification of epilepsyassociated tumors could provide new insight into these heterogeneous and diverse neoplasms and may lead to novel molecular targeted therapies for epilepsy in the near future.","303":"Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique used during the surgical management of medically refractory epilepsy. The utility of SEEG rests in its ability to survey the three-dimensional organization of the epileptogenic zone as well as nearby eloquent cortices. Once concentrated to specialized centers in Europe and Canada, the SEEG methodology has gained worldwide popularity due to its favorable morbidity profile, superior coverage of deep structures, and ability to perform multilobar explorations without the need for craniotomy. This rapid shift in practice represents both a challenge and an opportunity for pediatric neurosurgeons familiar with the subdural grid approach. The purpose of this review is to discuss the indications, technique, and safety of long-term SEEG monitoring in children. In addition to reviewing the conceptual and technical points of the diagnostic evaluation, attention will also be given to SEEG-based interventions (e.g., radiofrequency thermo-coagulation).","304":"An epileptic seizure is defined as the transient occurrence of signs and\/or symptoms due to abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. The type of seizure is defined by the mode of onset and termination, clinical manifestation, and by the abnormal enhanced synchrony. If seizures recur, that state is defined as epilepsy. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the mainstay of treatment. Knowledge about initiating and maintaining adequate AEDs is beneficial for the clinician who treats children with epilepsy. This article will delineate the general principles for selecting, introducing, and discontinuing AEDs and outline guidelines for monitoring adverse effects. In general, AED therapy following a first unprovoked seizure in children is not recommended. However, treatment should be considered after a second seizure. In children and adolescents, if they are seizure-free for at least 2 years, attempts to withdraw medication\/s should be made, taking into account the risks vs. benefits for the individual patient. The decision on when and what AED to use should be tailored according to the patient. For optimal treatment, the selection of adequate AEDs can be achieved by considering the precise definition of the patient's seizure and epilepsy syndrome. Continuous monitoring of both therapeutic and adverse effects is critical for successful treatment with AEDs.","305":"In 2011, the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) proposed a first international consensus of the classification of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).

Especially, the basic concepts of FCD type I, such as \"radial\", \"tangential\" and \"microcolumn\" will be discussed with figures. In addition, the limitations, genetic progress and prospect of FCD will be suggested.","306":"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway coordinates the metabolic activity of eukaryotic cells through environmental signals, including nutrients, energy, growth factors, and oxygen. In the nervous system, the mTOR pathway regulates fundamental biological processes associated with neural development and neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, genes that constitute the mTOR pathway have been found to be germline and somatic mutation from patients with various epileptic disorders. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway due to said mutations has garnered increasing attention as culprits of these conditions : somatic mutations, in particular, in epileptic foci have recently been identified as a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy, such as focal cortical dysplasia. Meanwhile, epilepsy models with aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway have helped elucidate the role of the mTOR pathway in epileptogenesis, and evidence from epilepsy models of human mutations recapitulating the features of epileptic patients has indicated that mTOR inhibitors may be of use in treating epilepsy associated with mutations in mTOR pathway genes. Here, we review recent advances in the molecular and genetic understanding of mTOR signaling in epileptic disorders. In particular, we focus on the development of and limitations to therapies targeting the mTOR pathway to treat epileptic seizures. We also discuss future perspectives on mTOR inhibition therapies and special diagnostic methods for intractable epilepsies caused by brain somatic mutations.","307":"The expansion and folding of the cerebral cortex occur during brain development and are critical factors that influence cognitive ability and sensorimotor skills.

This review will start with a brief introduction describing the anatomy of the brain cortex, followed by a description of our understanding of the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neural progenitors and important genes and molecules that are involved in these processes.

We aimed to assess the effects of BGC on the outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic strokes. Studies from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library database from January 2010 to February 2018 were reviewed. Random effect model for meta-analysis was used. Analyses such as meta-regression and the \"trim-and-fill\" method were additionally carried out. A total of seven articles involving 2223 patients were analyzed. Mechanical thrombectomy with BGC was associated with higher rates of successful recanalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.632; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.293-2.059). BGC did not significantly decrease distal emboli, both before (OR, 0.404; 95% CI, 0.108-1.505) and after correcting for bias (adjusted OR, 1.165; 95% CI, 0.310- 4.382). Good outcomes were observed more frequently in the BGC group (OR, 1.886; 95% CI, 1.564-2.273). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality did not differ significantly with BGC use. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that BGC enhance recanalization rates. However, BGC use did not decrease distal emboli after mechanical thrombectomies.

Trends in the number of patients undergoing treatment according to treatment method were analyzed for each disease using the Korean Classification of Diseases procedure codes. In 2016, the total number of adults with newly diagnosed CI was 83939, reflecting a 9.4% decrease from that in 2008. The agestandardized incidence of CI in adults was 153.2 per 100000 person-years in 2016, reflecting a 37.2% decrease from that in 2008, while that of CASTN was 167.3 per 100000 person-years in 2016, reflecting a 73.3% increase from that in 2008.

The presence of comorbidities, risk factors (antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy, history of alcohol abuse, and head trauma), preoperative symptoms, mono or bilateral CSDH, maximum thickness of hematoma, surgical time and recurrence were similar and statistically not significant in both groups. In this study, we demonstrate that surgery for very old patients above 90 years of age affected by CSDH is safe and allows complete recovery. Comparing two groups of patients above and under 90 years old we found that complication rate and recovery were similar in both groups.

The proportion of elderly population in the society is markedly increasing and Korea is one of the most rapidly aging societies. Here, we analyzed the data from 904 patients older over 65 years who were registered in the Korean Neuro-Trauma Data Bank System (KNTDBS). The Korean Society of Neurotraumatology recorded data from 20 institutions between September 2010 and March 2014. This retrospective study examined the clinical epidemiology, sex difference, outcome epidemiology, sociodemographic variables, and outcomes in the geriatric population related to TBI based on data from the KNTDBS. The study included 540 men and 364 women. The age distributions in the male and female groups were statistically significantly different. The most common cause of trauma was a fall and diagnosis was acute subdural hematoma. The incidence was the highest in men aged 80-84 years and in women aged 75-79 years. The most common time of arrival to hospital after TBI was within 1 hour and 119 rescue team provided first aid earliest to patients with TBI. The mortality rate stratified according to the cause of trauma was significantly different, with mortality rates of 3.77% in fall and 11.65% in traffic accident. The mortality rates according the severity of brain injury, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and treatment were statistically significant. To our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on elderly patients with TBI in Korea and particularly investigate mortality and characteristics related to TBI-related death based on data from the KNTDBS. Although the study has some limitations, our results may be used to obtain useful information to study targeted prevention and more effective treatment options for older TBI patients and establish novel treatment guidelines and health polish for the geriatric population.

Posterior fossa epidural haematoma (PFEDH) is less frequently observed, accounting for only 1.2% to 12.9% of all EDH cases. Because of the non-specific symptoms and the potential for rapid and fatal deterioration in children, an early computed tomography (CT) scanning is necessary for all suspicious cases. The aim of the present study was to share the experience of 48 cases and review the literature concerning PFEDH. A retrospective analysis was conducted for 48 paediatric cases diagnosed with PFEDH and admitted to Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2010 to August 2015. The clinical features and outcomes were analyzed and compared with previous literature. Seventeen patients were surgically treated in this series and 31 patients received non-operative treatment. The outcomes were good in 46 patients, evaluated using the Glasgow outcome score (GOS), while mild disability was observed in one patient, and only one case showed severe disability. There were no cases of mortality in this series. Posterior fossa epidural haematoma is relatively rare compared with supratentorial epidural haematoma. Early and serial CT scans should be performed for all suspicious cases. The criteria for the surgical treatment of paediatric patients with PFEDH were concluded. The overall prognosis was excellent in paediatric patients. ","327":"We attempted to discover that Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has a comprehensive relationship with congestive heart failure and death. We used a nationwide database managed by the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2010 to 2014. Twelve thousand nine hundred eighty-eight patients with a diagnosis of AS and 64940 age- and sex- stratified matching subjects without AS were enrolled in the AS and control groups. Incidence probabilities of 6 years congestive heart failure and death in each group were calculated. The Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio. We divided the AS and control groups into subgroups according to sex, age, income, and comorbidities. During the follow-up period, 102 patients (0.79%) in the AS group and 201 patients (0.32%) in the control group developed congestive heart failure (p&lt;0.0001). In addition, 211 (1.62%) subjects in the AS group died during the follow-up period compared to 639 (0.98%) subjects in the control group (p&lt;0.0001). The adjusted hazard ratio of congestive heart failure and death in the AS group was 2.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-2.89) and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.42-1.95), respectively. The hazard ratios of congestive heart failure and death were significantly increased in all of the subgroups. The incidence rates of congestive heart failure and death were increased in AS patients.

The aim of this study is to present 12 spinal hydatid cyst cases, and propose a new type of drainage of the cyst. Twelve cases of spinal hydatid cysts, surgical operations, multiple operations, chronic recurrences, and spinal hydatic cyst excision methods are discussed in the context of the literature. Patients are operated between 2005 and 2016. All the patients are kept under routine follow up. Patient demographic data and clinicopathologic characteristics are examined. Six male and six female patients with a median age of 38.6 at the time of surgery were included in the study. Spinal cyst hydatid infection sites were one odontoid, one cervical, five thoracic, two lumbar, and three sacral. In all cases, surgery was performed, with the aim of total excision of the cyst, decompression of the spinal cord, and if necessary, stabilization of the spinal column. Mean follow up was 61.3 months (10-156). All the patients were prescribed Albendazole. Three patients had secondary hydatid cyst infection (one lung and two hepatic). The two-way drainage catheter placed inside a cyst provides post-operative chlorhexidine washing inside the cavity. Although a spinal hydatid cyst is a benign pathology and seen rarely, it is extremely difficult to achieve a real cure for patients with this disease. Treatment modalities should be aggressive and include total excision of cyst without rupture, decompression of spinal cord, flushing of the area with scolicidal drugs, and ensuring spinal stabilization. After the operation the patients should be kept under routine follow up. Radiological and clinical examinations are useful in spotting a recurrence. ","329":"In patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, collateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow has a protective role against ischemia. However, some of these patients may experience initial major neurological deficits and major worsening on following days. Thus, we investigated the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment (EVT) for ICA occlusion with collateral MCA flow by comparing clinical outcomes of medical treatment versus EVT. The inclusion criteria were as follows : 1) acute ischemic stroke with ICA occlusion and presence of collateral MCA flow on transfemoral cerebral angiography (TFCA) and 2) hospital arrival within 12 hours from symptom onset. The treatment strategy was made by the attending physician based on the patient's clinical status and results of TFCA. Eighty-one patients were included (30 medical treatment, 51 EVT). The EVT group revealed a high incidence of intracranial ICA occlusion, longer ipsilesional MCA contrast filling time, and a similar rate of favorable clinical outcome despite a higher mean baseline the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. By binary logistic regression analysis, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and EVT were independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome. In subgroup analysis based on stroke etiology, the non-atherosclerotic group showed a higher baseline NIHSS score, higher incidence of EVT, and a higher rate of distal embolization during EVT in comparison with the atherosclerotic group. In patients with ICA occlusion and collateral MCA flow, decisions regarding treatment strategy based on TFCA can help achieve favorable clinical outcomes. EVT strategy with respect to etiology of ICA occlusion might help achieve better angiographic outcomes. ","330":"Endovascular treatment (EVT) outcomes for acute M2 segment of middle cerebral artery occlusion remains unclear because most results are obtained from patients with large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. The objective of this study was to assess procedural outcomes for acute M2 occlusion and compare outcomes according to thrombus location (M1 vs. M2). A systematic review was performed for online literature published from January 2004 to December 2016. Primary outcome was successful recanalization rate and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (S-ICH) after the procedure. A fixed effect model was used if heterogeneity was less than 50%. Eight articles were included. EVT showed successful recanalization rate of 69.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.9-80.4%) and S-ICH rate of 6.1% (95% CI, 4.5-8.3%). The rates of good clinical outcome at 3 months and mortality were 59.4% (95% CI, 49.9-68.2%) and 14.9% (95% CI, 11.4-19.3%), respectively. According to thrombus location (M1 vs. M2), successful recanalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.539; 95% CI, 0.293-8.092; p=0.610) and S-ICH (OR, 1.313; 95% CI, 0.603-2.861; p=0.493) did not differ significantly. Good clinical outcome was more evident in M2 occlusion after EVT than that in M1 occlusion (OR, 1.639; 95% CI, 1.135-2.368; p=0.008). However, mortality did not differ significantly according to thrombus location (OR, 0.788; 95% CI, 0.486-1.276; p=0.332). EVT seems to be technically feasible for acute M2 occlusion. Direct comparative studies between EVT and medical treatment are needed further to find specific beneficiary group after EVT in patient with M2 occlusion. ","331":"The objective of this study was to analyze patient-specific blood flow in ruptured aneurysms using obtained non-Newtonian viscosity and to observe associated hemodynamic features and morphological effects. Five patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysms were included in the study. Patients' blood samples were measured immediately after enrollment. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was conducted to evaluate viscosity distributions and wall shear stress (WSS) distributions using a patient-specific geometric model and shear-thinning viscosity properties. Substantial viscosity change was found at the dome of the aneurysms studied when applying non-Newtonian blood viscosity measured at peak-systole and end-diastole. The maximal WSS of the non-Newtonian model on an aneurysm at peaksystole was approximately 16% lower compared to Newtonian fluid, and most of the hemodynamic features of Newtonian flow at the aneurysms were higher, except for minimal WSS value. However, the differences between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow were not statistically significant. Rupture point of an aneurysm showed low WSS regardless of Newtonian or non-Newtonian CFD analyses. By using measured non-Newtonian viscosity and geometry on patient-specific CFD analysis, morphologic differences in hemodynamic features, such as changes in whole blood viscosity and WSS, were observed. Therefore, measured non-Newtonian viscosity might be possibly useful to obtain patient-specific hemodynamic and morphologic result.

CT angiography was performed in 3460 patients between March 1, 2014 and November 30, 2015 and the results were analyzed. The origin of the ARSA, course of the vessel, possible inadvertent ARSA puncture site during subclavian vein catheterization, Kommerell diverticula, and associated vascular anomalies were evaluated. We used the literature to review the clinical importance of ARSA. Seventeen in 3460 patients had ARSA. All ARSAs in 17 patients originated from the posterior aspect of the aortic arch and traveled along a retroesophageal course to the right thoracic outlet. All 17 ARSAs were located in the anterior portion from first to fourth thoracic vertebral bodies and were located near the right subclavian vein at the medial third of the clavicle. Only one of 17 patients presented with dysphagia. It is important to be aware ARSA before surgical approaches to upper thoracic vertebrae in order to avoid complications and effect proper treatment. In patients with a known ARSA, a right transradial approach for aortography or cerebral angiography should be changed to a left radial artery or transfemoral approach.

Extracellular glutamate level changes in striatum of NL category, NL with deep brain stimulation (DBS) category, 6-HD category, and 6-HD with DBS category were examined using microdialysis and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivities in substantia nigra and striatum of the four categories were also analyzed. Extracellular glutamate levels in the striatum of NL with DBS category and 6-HD with DBS category were significantly increased by EPN stimulation compared to those in the NL category and 6-HD category. EPN stimulation had no significant effect on the expression of TH in NL or 6-HD category. Clinical results of GPi DBS are not only limited to direct inhibitory outflow to thalamus.

Surgical outcomes and radiological and endocrinological characteristics were compared. Strong female predominance was observed in the SCA group (p&lt;0.001). Cavernous sinus invasion was identified in 22 (40%) SCA patients and 72 (17.6%) HNA patients (p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in ACTH or cortisol levels between the two groups. The incidence of preoperative hypopituitarism and postoperative hormonal outcome did not differ between two groups. Total resection was achieved in 35 patients (63.7%) with SCA and 332 patients (80.8%) with HNA (p=0.007). When tumors were completely removed, recurrence rates were not statistically different between two groups (p=0.60). When complete resection was not achieved, tumors regrew from these remnants in seven patients (35.0%) with SCA and 12 patients (15.2%) with HNA (p=0.05). Total surgical resection for SCA is often challenging as these tumors frequently invade a cavernous sinus. Early remnant tumor intervention is justified, because untreated residual pituitary tumors regrow when patients were followed up for a long time.

Anomalies of the wrist muscles, encountered during endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery have rarely been described. I conducted this study to evaluate muscular anomalies of the volar aspect of the wrist, encountered during endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery. I studied a consecutive series of 1235 hands in 809 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome who underwent single-portal endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) from 2002 to 2014. Nine hundred seventy-three hands in 644 patients who had minimal 6-month postoperative follow-up were included in the study. The postoperative surgical outcome was assessed at least 6 months after surgery. In eight patients, anomalous muscles were found under the antebrachial fascia at the proximal wrist crease and superficial to the ulnar bursa, passing superficial to the transverse carpal ligament . Those anomalous muscles were presumed to be variants of the PL or accessory ADM muscle, necessitating splitting and retraction to enter the carpal tunnel during the ECTR procedure. Other muscle anomalies were not seen within the carpal tunnel on the endoscopic view. The surgical outcome for all eight wrists was successful at the 6-month postoperative follow-up. Carpal tunnel surgeons, especially those using an endoscope should be familiar with unusual findings of anomalous muscles of the wrist because early recognition of those muscles can contribute to avoiding unnecessary surgical exploration and unsuccessful surgical outcomes.

This study was supported by research funding from Korean Society for Bone and Mineral Research 2015. There were no study-specific biases related to conflicts of interest. The number of PD patients in the HIRA-NIS increased each year from 2009 to 2013. Among patients with PD, the standardized prevalence rates of OP and OVF increased from 2009 to 2013; from 23.2 to 27.8 and from 2.8 to 4.2, respectively. Among patients with PD with OP, the prevalence of OVF were 12.2% and 15.1% in 2009 and 2013, respectively. The standardized prevalence rates of PD with OP and PD with OVF were significantly higher in MA recipients than in NHI beneficiaries. The prevalence of PD both with OP and with OVF increased and the prevalence was higher in MA recipients than in NHI beneficiaries.

This study aimed to demonstrate results of temporary stent placement for coiling wide necked small intracranial aneurysms, which eliminated need for antiplatelet agents, and to discuss its feasibility and safety. Data of 156 patients who underwent stent-assisted coil embolization between 2011 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Thirteen cases of temporary stent-assisted coil embolization were included, and their clinical and radiological results were evaluated. The aneurysms treated were all unruptured except one case. All of them had wide neck with mean dome-to-neck ratio of 0.96 and were small-sized aneurysms with mean maximal diameter of 4.2 mm. There was no technical failure in retrieval of stent after completion of embolization of the target aneurysm. Immediate angiography revealed 11 complete and two partial embolization (one residual neck and one residual aneurysm). Two cases encountered thrombosis complication, and they were managed without neurological sequelae. The mean follow-up period was 43 months, angiographic follow-up revealed two cases with minor recurrence, and clinical outcome was good with modified Rankin scale score of 0.

MRgFUS-mediated stereotactic ablation is non-invasive, incision-free, and confers immediate therapeutic effects. Since the US Food and Drug Administration approval of MRgFUS in 2016 for unilateral thalamotomy in medication-refractory essential tremor, studies on novel indications such as Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disease, and brain tumors are underway. MRgFUS is also used in the context of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening at low intensities, in combination with intravenously-administered microbubbles. Preclinical studies show that MRgFUS-mediated BBB opening safely enhances the delivery of targeted chemotherapeutic agents to the brain and improves tumor control as well as survival. In addition, BBB opening has been shown to activate the innate immune system in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plaque clearance and promotion of neurogenesis in these studies suggest that MRgFUS-mediated BBB opening may be a new paradigm for neurodegenerative disease treatment in the future.

The most practical recommendations of up to date were identified by a review of literature. The author reviewed the literature on CSDH management from the past to now to identify the best methods. Till 1970s, craniotomy was the most commonly used method. Burr hole (BH) became the most preferred method from 1980s. In 1977, twist drill (TD) craniostomy was introduced. Closed system drainage after a BH or a TD became the most frequently used surgical method. Although nonsurgical treatment is often successful, trephination has more advantages, such as rapid resolution of the symptoms and short period of hospitalization. Nonsurgical treatment is possible in asymptomatic patients with a small CSDH. For the symptomatic patients with CSDH, trephination is the treatment of choice, either by BH or TD. In gray zone between surgery and medical treatment, shared decision making can be an ideal approach. For the recurrent CSDHs, repeated trephination is still effective for patients with a low risk of recurrence. If the risk of recurrence is high, additional management would be helpful. For the refractory CSDHs, it is necessary to obliterate the subdural space.","348":"Corpectomy of the first lumbar vertebra (L1) for the management of different L1 pathologies can be performed using either an anterior or posterior approach.

Thirty consecutive patients underwent L1 corpectomy between 2010 and 2016. The retroperitoneal extrapleural approach through the 12th rib was used in all cases to perform single-stage anterior L1 corpectomy, reconstruction and anterior instrumentation, except for in two recurrent cases in which posterior fixation was added. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for pain intensity measurement and ASIA impairment scale for neurological assessment. The mean follow-up period was 14.5 months. The sample included 18 males and 12 females, and the mean age was 40.3 years. Twenty patients (67%) had sensory or motor deficits before the surgery. The pathologies encountered included traumatic fracture in 12 cases, osteoporotic fracture in four cases, tumor in eight cases and spinal infection in the remaining six cases. The surgeries were performed from the left side, except in two cases. There was significant improvement of back pain and radicular pain as recorded by VAS. One patient exhibited postoperative neurological deterioration due to bone graft dislodgement. All patients with deficits at least partially improved after the surgery. During the follow-up, no hardware failures or losses of correction were detected. The retroperitoneal extrapleural approach through the 12th rib is a feasible approach for L1 corpectomy that can combine adequate decompression of the dural sac with effective biomechanical restoration of the compromised anterior loadbearing column.

","349":"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a progressive cerebrovascular disease with unknown etiology, characterized by bilateral stenoocclusive changes at the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and an abnormal vascular network formation at the base of the brain. MMD has an intrinsic nature to convert the vascular supply for the brain from internal carotid (IC) system to the external carotid (EC) system, as indicated by Suzuki's angiographic staging. Insufficiency of this 'IC-EC conversion system' could result not only in cerebral ischemia, but also in intracranial hemorrhage from inadequate collateral anastomosis, both of which represent the clinical manifestation of MMD. Surgical revascularization prevents cerebral ischemic attack by improving cerebral blood flow, and recent evidence further suggests that extracranial-intracranial bypass could powerfully reduce the risk of re-bleeding in MMD patients with posterior hemorrhage, who were known to have extremely high re-bleeding risk. Although the exact mechanism underlying the hemorrhagic presentation in MMD is undetermined, most recent angiographic analysis revealed the characteristic angio-architecture related to high re-bleeding risk, such as the extension and dilatation of choroidal collaterals and posterior cerebral artery involvement. We sought to update the current management strategy for hemorrhagic MMD, including the outcome of surgical revascularization for hemorrhagic MMD in our institute.

Two patients received high-dose steroid therapy and the other was treated with induced hypertension. One patient treated with induced hypertension showed almost full recovery; however, two patients who received high-dose steroid therapy remained completely paraplegic and required catheterization for bladder and bowel dysfunction despite months of rehabilitation. Our case series demonstrates the potentially devastating neurological outcome of surfer's myelopathy; however, early recovery in the initial 24-72 hours of presentation can occur in some patients, which is in accordance with previous reports. Ischemic insult to the spinal cord is thought to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of surfer's myelopathy. Treatment recommendations include hydration, induced hypertension, early spinal angiography with intra-arterial intervention, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and high-dose steroid therapy; however, there is no standardized treatment option available. Early recovery appears to be important for long-term neurological outcome.

In the higher T-DAR group, total complications (12 vs. 21, p=0.042) and late-onset complications (3 vs. 9, p=0.036) were significantly correlated with the T-DAR. The number of patients experiencing complications (9 vs. 11, p=0.029) and the total number of complications (13 vs. 20, p=0.015) were significantly correlated with the S-DAR. Worsening intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring was more frequent in the higher T-DAR group (2 vs. 4) than in the higher S-DAR group (3 vs. 3). There was no difference in neurological deterioration between the groups after surgery. Both the T-DAR and the S-DAR are risk factors for complications after PVCR. Those who had a T-DAR &gt;20.2 or S-DAR &gt;16.4 experienced a higher rate of complications after PVCR.

In total, 18 unruptured and 24 ruptured aneurysms were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Minimal, average, and maximal wall shear stress were calculated based on CFD simulations. Aneurysm height, ostium diameter, aspect ratio, and area of aneurysm were measured. Aneurysms were classified according to flow complexity (simple or complex) and inflow jet (concentrated or diffused). Statistical analyses were performed to ascertain differences between the aneurysm groups. Average wall shear stress of the ruptured group was greater than that of the unruptured group (9.42% for aneurysm and 10.38% for ostium). The average area of ruptured aneurysms was 31.22% larger than unruptured aneurysms. Simple flow was observed in 14 of 18 (78%) unruptured aneurysms, while all ruptured aneurysms had complex flow (p&lt;0.001). Ruptured aneurysms were more likely to have a concentrated inflow jet (63%), while unruptured aneurysms predominantly had a diffused inflow jet (83%, p=0.004). Ruptured aneurysms tended to have a larger geometric size and greater WSS compared to unruptured aneurysms, but the difference was not statistically significant. Flow complexity and inflow jet were significantly different between unruptured and ruptured ACoA aneurysms. ","358":"To mitigate the risk of iatrogenic instability, new posterior decompression techniques able to preserve musculoskeletal structures have been introduced but never extensively investigated from a biomechanical point of view. This study was aimed to investigate the impact on spinal flexibility caused by a unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression, in comparison to the intact condition and a laminectomy with preservation of a bony bridge at the vertebral arch. Secondary aims were to investigate the biomechanical effects of two-level decompression and the quantification of the restoration of stability after posterior fixation. A universal spine tester was used to measure the flexibility of six L2-L5 human spine specimens in intact conditions and after decompression and fixation surgeries. An incremental damage protocol was applied : 1) unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression at L3-L4; 2) on three specimens, the unilateral laminotomy was extended to L4-L5; 3) laminectomy with preservation of a bony bridge at the vertebral arch (at L3-L4 in the first three specimens and at L4-L5 in the rest); and 4) pedicle screw fixation at the involved levels. Unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression had a minor influence on the lumbar flexibility. In flexion-extension, the median range of motion increased by 8%. The bone-preserving laminectomy did not cause major changes in spinal flexibility. Two-level decompression approximately induced a twofold destabilization compared to the single-level treatment, with greater effect on the lower level. Posterior fixation reduced the flexibility to values lower than in the intact conditions in all cases. In vitro testing of human lumbar specimens revealed that unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression and bone-preserving laminectomy induced a minor destabilization at the operated level. In absence of other pathological factors (e.g., clinical instability, spondylolisthesis), both techniques appear to be safe from a biomechanical point of view.

But nowadays, more and more neurosurgeons are interested in spinal deformities as well as complex spinal disorders and are doing not a few surgeries for these kinds of disease. Nevertheless, it is mandatory to understand the course of spinal deformity, principles of treatment, and surgical outcomes and complications. Understanding of the biology, biomechanics and metallurgy of the spine and instrumentation are also required for successful spinal deformity surgery. We need senior mentors and good surgical and neurophysiologic monitoring team. Knowledge of spinal deformity may be augmented with spine fellowships and surgical experience. Step by step training such as basic knowledge, orthopedic as well as neurosurgical disciplines and surgical skills would be mandatory. Neurosurgeons can have several advantages for spinal deformity surgeries. By high-level technical ability of the spinal cord handling to preserve neurological function and familiarity with microscopic surgery, better synergistic effect could be expected.

This was a prospective observational study of patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures at 29 hospitals in South Korea from January 2017 to June 2017. The procedures included craniectomy, craniotomy, cranioplasty, burr hole, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Of the 1576 cases included, 30 showed infection, for an overall SSI rate of 1.9%. Organ\/space infection was the most common, found in 21 out of the 30 cases (70%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common (41%) of all bacteria, and Serratia marcescens (12%) was the most common among gram-negative bacteria. In univariate analyses, the p-values for age, preoperative hospital stay duration, and over T-hour were &lt;0.2. In a multivariate analysis of these variables, only preoperative hospital stay was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (p&lt;0.001), whereas age and over T-hour showed a tendency to increase the risk of SSI (p=0.09 and 0.06). Surveillance systems play important roles in the accurate analysis of SSI. The incidence of SSI after neurosurgical procedures assessed by a national surveillance system was 1.9%.

","362":"The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the safety and function of the newly developed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reservoir called the V-Port. The newly developed V-Port consists of a non-collapsible reservoir outlined with a titanium cage and a connector for the ventricular catheter to be assembled. It is designed to be better palpated and more durable to multiple punctures than the Ommaya reservoir. A total of nine patients diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis were selected for V-Port insertion. Each patient was followed up for evaluation for a month after the operation. The average operation time for V-Port insertion was 42 minutes and the average incision size was 6.6 cm. The surgical technique of V-Port insertion was found to be intuitive by all neurosurgeons who participated in the pilot study. There was no obstruction or leakage of the V-Port during intrathecal chemotherapy or CSF drainage. Also, there were no complications including post-operative intracerebral hemorrhage, infection and skin problems related to the V-Port. V-Port is a safe and an easy to use implantable CSF reservoir that addresses problems of other implantable CSF reservoirs. Further multicenter clinical trial is needed to prove the safety and the function of the V-Port.

Therefore, a lot of clinical and surgical experience is required for successful treatment; however, many neurosurgeons have difficulty accumulating this experience owing to the rarity of brachial plexus tumors. The purpose of this report is to share our surgical experience with brachial plexus tumor with other neurosurgeons. The records of 18 consecutive patients with brachial plexus tumors who underwent surgical treatment between January 2010 and December 2017 in a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. The surgical approach was determined according to the tumor location and size, and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) was used in most of cases to prevent iatrogenic nerve injury during surgery. In addition, to evaluate the differences in tumor characteristics according to pathologic diagnosis, the tumors were divided twice into two groups, based on two separate classifications, and statistical analysis was performed. The 18 brachial plexus tumors comprised 15 (83.3%) benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors including schwannoma and neurofibroma, one (5.6%) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, one (5.6%) benign tumor of non-neural sheath origin (neurogenic cyst), and one (5.6%) metastatic tumor (papillary carcinoma). The authors analyzed relationship between tumor size\/ location and tumor characteristic parameters such as age, size, right-left, and pathology. There were no statistically significant differences except a tendency of bigger tumor size in young age. For a successful surgical outcome, an appropriate surgical approach is essential, and the appropriate surgical approach is determined by the location and size of the tumor. Furthermore, applying IONM may prevent postoperative complications and it is favorable option for brachial plexus tumors surgery. ","364":"We evaluated the clinical manifestation and surgical results following operative treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome (CuTS) caused by anconeus epitrochlearis (AE) muscle. Among 142 patients who underwent surgery for CuTS from November 2007 to October 2015, 12 were assigned to the AE group based on discovery of AE muscle; 130 patients were assigned to the other group. We analyzed retrospectively; age, sex, dominant hand, symptom duration, and weakness in hand. Severity of the disease was evaluated using the Dellon classification and postoperative symptom were evaluated using disability of arm shoulder and hand (DASH) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Surgery consisted of subfascial anterior transposition following excision of AE muscle. AE muscle was present in 8.5% of all patients, and was more common in patients who were younger and with involvement of their dominant hand; the duration of symptom was shorter in patients with AE muscle. All patients showed postoperative improvement in symptoms according to DASH and VAS scores. The possibility of CuTS caused by AE muscle should be considered when younger patients have rapidly aggravated and activity-related cubital tunnel symptoms with a palpable mass in the cubital tunnel area. Excision of AE muscle and anterior ulnar nerve transposition may be considered effective surgical treatment.

This was a prospective observational study of patients who underwent spinal surgeries at 42 hospitals in South Korea from January 2017 to December 2017. The procedures included spinal fusion, laminectomy, discectomy, and corpectomy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Of the 3080 cases included, 30 showed infection, and the overall SSI rate was 1.0% (an incidence of 1.2% in spinal fusion and 0.6% in laminectomy). Deep incisional infections were the most common type of SSIs (46.7%). Gram-positive bacteria caused 80% of the infections, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, accounted for 58% of the grampositive bacteria. A longer preoperative hospital stay was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI after both spinal fusion and laminectomy (p=0.013, p&lt;0.001). A combined operation also was associated with SSI after laminectomy (p=0.032). An SSI surveillance system is important for the accurate analysis of SSI.

Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were applied to all patients preoperatively and at one month postoperatively. The postoperative PSQI total points and all the PSQI subscale points, the ODI and VAS scores were significantly reduced compared to the preoperative values. A positive correlation was determined between the preoperative ODI points and the PSQI total points and sleep duration, sleep latency and daytime functional loss subscale points. A positive correlation was also found between preoperative ODI points and VAS points. A positive correlation was determined between the preoperative VAS points and and the PSQI total points and sleep duration, and sleep latency subscale points. A negative correlation was determined between the postoperative ODI and the daytime functional loss subscale points. The results of the study showed that in patients with cervical disc hernia, sleep quality and daytime functionality were negatively affected by severity of pain that limited daily activities. Bringing the pain under control with surgical treatment was observed to increase sleep quality. It can be concluded that when planning treatment for these patients, it should be taken into consideration that there could be a sleep disorder in addition to the complaints and symptoms such as pain, hypoestesia and loss of strength. ","367":"Metastatic brain tumors (MBTs) often present with intracerebral hemorrhage. Although Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) is a valid treatment option for hemorrhagic MBTs, its efficacy is unclear. To achieve oncologic control and reduce radiation toxicity, we used a radiosurgical targeting technique that confines the tumor core within the hematoma when performing GKS in patients with such tumors. We reviewed our experience in this endeavor, focusing on local tumor control and treatment-associated morbidities. From 2007 to 2014, 13 patients with hemorrhagic MBTs were treated via GKS using our targeting technique. The median marginal dose prescribed was 23 Gy (range, 20-25). GKS was performed approximately 2 weeks after tumor bleeding to allow the patient's condition to stabilize. The primary sites of the MBTs included the liver (n=7), lung (n=2), kidney (n=1), and stomach (n=1); in two cases, the primary tumor was a melanoma. The mean tumor volume was 4.00 cm3 (range, 0.74-11.0). The mean overall survival duration after GKS was 12.5 months (range, 3-29), and three patients are still alive at the time of the review. The local tumor control rate was 92% (tumor disappearance 23%, tumor regression 46%, and stable disease 23%). There was one (8%) instance of local recurrence, which occurred 11 months after GKS in the solid portion of the tumor. No GKS-related complications were observed. Our experience shows that GKS performed in conjunction with our targeting technique safely and effectively treats hemorrhagic MBTs. The success of this technique may reflect the presence of scattered metastatic tumor cells in the hematoma that do not proliferate owing to the inadequate microenvironment of the hematoma. We suggest that GKS can be a useful treatment option for patients with hemorrhagic MBTs that are not amenable to surgery.

We retrospectively reviewed 33 patients who underwent upper thoracic pedicle screw instrumentation. In 15 patients, a total of 110 thoracic pedicle screws were inserted to the upper thoracic spine (T1-6) with classical position (anesthesiologist and monitor were placed near to patient's head. Surgeons were standing classically near to patient's body while patients were lying in prone position). In 18 patients, a total of 88 thoracic pedicle screws were inserted to the upper thoracic spine with the new standing position-surgeons stand by the head of the patient and the anesthesia monitor laterally and under patient's belt level. All the operations performed by the same senior spine surgeons with the help of C-arm. Postoperative computed tomography scans were obtained to assess the screw placement. The screw malposition and pedicle wall violations were divided and evaluated separately. Cortical penetration were measured and graded at either : 1-2 mm penetration, 2-4 mm penetration and &gt;4 mm penetration. Total 198 screws were inserted with two different standing positions. Of 198 screws 110 were in the classical positioning group and 88 were in the new positioning group. Incorrect screw placement was found in 33 screws (16.6%). The difference between total screw malposition by both standing positions were found to be statistically significant (p=0.011). The difference between total pedicle wall violations by both standing positions were found to be statistically significant (p=0.003). Right-handedness is a problem during the upper thoracic pedicle screw placement on the left side.

Prospective cohort study of 110 patients with TN recurrence who had either redo MVD (n=68) or PBC (n=42) from July 2010 until September 2016. The mean follow-up was 45.6 months. After redo MVD, 65 patients (95.6%) experienced immediate relief of pain. After PBC, 34 patients (81%) were immediately relieved of their neuralgia. After 1 month, the clinical effect of redo MVD was better than PBC (p&lt;0.01). Patients who had redo MVD more commonly were pain free off medications (93.4% at 1 year, 78.2% at 4 years) compared with the PBC patients (85.1% at 1 year, 59.3% at 4 years). However, mean length of stay was longer (p&gt;0.05). Patients after PBC who occurred developed herpes simplex (35.7%), facial numbness (76.2%), annoying dysesthesia (21.4%) more frequently compared with patients after redo MVD who occurred developed herpes simplex (14.7%), facial numbness (8.8%), hypoesthesia (5.9%) (p&lt;0.05). The symptoms recurred respectively in 15 patients (22.1%) and 19 patients (45.2%) after redo MVD and PBC within the entire 6-year follow-up period.

To prevent postoperative CSDH by reducing subdural fluid collection, we applied the modified arachnoid plasty (MAP) during the UIA clipping surgery to seal the dissected arachnoid plane. This retrospective study included 286 patients enrolled from July 2012 to May 2015. We performed arachnoid plasty in all patients, with MAP used after June 17, 2014. Patients were divided into two groups (non-MAP vs. MAP), and by using uni- and multivariate analyses, baseline characteristics, and relationships with postoperative CSDH between the two groups were analyzed. The degree of preoperative brain atrophy was estimated using the bicaudate ratio (BCR) index. Ten patients (3.5%) among 286 patients had postoperative CSDH after clipping. Nine (3.1%) were in the non-MAP group, and one (0.9%) was in the MAP group. The higher BCR index showed statistical significance with occurrence of postoperative CSDH in both uni- (p=0.018) and multivariate (p=0.012, odds ratio [OR] 8.547, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.616-45.455) analyses. MAP was associated with a lower risk of postoperative CSDH (p=0.022, OR 0.068, 95% CI 0.007-0.683). This study shows that the degree of preoperative brain atrophy is associated with an increased occurrence of CSDH after clipping and that MAP could help reduce the risk of postoperative CSDH after unruptured aneurysm clipping via a lateral supraorbital approach.

","375":"We investigated the outcomes of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for metastatic brain tumors that locally recurred despite previous SRS, focusing on the tumor control. A total of 114 patients with 176 locally recurring metastatic brain tumors underwent repeat SRS after previous SRS. The mean age was 59.4 years (range, 33 to 85), and there were 68 male and 46 female patients. The primary cancer types were non-small cell lung cancer (n=67), small cell lung cancer (n=12), gastrointestinal tract cancer (n=15), breast cancer (n=10), and others (n=10). The number of patients with a single recurring metastasis was 95 (79.8%), and another 19 had multiple recurrences. At the time of the repeat SRS, the mean volume of the locally recurring tumors was 5.94 mL (range, 0.42 to 29.94). We prescribed a mean margin dose of 17.04 Gy (range, 12 to 24) to the isodose line at the tumor border primarily using a 50% isodose line. After the repeat SRS, we obtained clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up data for 84 patients (73.7%) with a total of 108 tumors. The tumor control rate was 53.5% (58 of the 108), and the median and mean progression-free survival (PFS) periods were 246 and 383 days, respectively. The prognostic factors that were significantly related to better tumor control were prescription radiation dose of 16 Gy (p=0.000) and tumor volume less than both 4 mL (p=0.001) and 10 mL at the repeat SRS (p=0.008). The overall survival (OS) periods for all 114 patients after repeat SRS varied from 1 to 56 months, and median and mean OS periods were 229 and 404 days after the repeat SRS, respectively. The main cause of death was systemic problems including pulmonary dysfunction (n=58, 51%), and the identified direct or suspected brain-related death rate was around 20%. The tumor control following repeat SRS for locally recurring metastatic brain tumors after a previous SRS is relatively lower than that for primary SRS. However, both low tumor volume and high prescription radiation dose were significantly related to the tumor control following repeat SRS for these tumors after previous SRS, which is a general understanding of primary SRS for metastatic brain tumors.

","387":null,"388":"The aims in the management of thoracolumbar spinal fractures are not only to restore vertebral column stability, but also to obtain acceptable alignment of the thoracolumbar junction (T-L junction) to prevent complications. However, insufficient surgical correction of the thoracolumbar spine would be likely to cause late progression of abnormal kyphosis. Therefore, we identified the surgical factors that affected unfavorable radiologic outcomes of the thoracolumbar spine after surgery. This study was conducted in a single institution from January 2007 to December 2013. A total of 98 patients with unstable thoracolumbar spine fracture were included. In these patients, fixation was done through transpedicular screws with rods by three surgical patterns. We reviewed digital radiographs and analyzed the images preoperatively and postoperatively during follow-up visits to compare the change of the thoracolumbar Cobb angle with radiologic parameters and clinical outcomes. The unfavorable radiologic group was defined as the patients who were measured as having greater than 20 degrees of thoracolumbar Cobb angle on the last follow-up, or who underwent kyphotic progression of thoracolumbar Cobb angle greater than 10 degrees from the immediate postoperative state to final follow-up, or who had overt instrument failure with\/without additional surgery. We assessed the risk factors that affected the unfavorable radiologic outcomes. We had 43 patients with unfavorable radiologic outcomes, including 35 abnormal thoracolumbar alignments and 14 instrumental failures with\/without additional surgery. The multivariate logistic regression test showed that immediate postoperative T-L junction Cobb angle less than 10.5 degrees was a statistically significant risk factor, as well as the presence of osteoporosis (p=0.017 and 0.049, respectively). Insufficient correction of thoracolumbar kyphosis was considered to be a major factor of an unfavorable radiological outcome. The spinal surgeon should consider that having a T-L junction Cobb angle larger than 10.5 degrees immediately after surgery could result in an unfavorable radiological outcome, which is related to a poor clinical outcome. ","389":null,"390":"","391":"Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) utilizes electrophysiological techniques as a surrogate test and evaluation of nervous function while a patient is under general anesthesia. They are increasingly used for procedures, both surgical and endovascular, to avoid injury during an operation, examine neurological tissue to guide the surgery, or to test electrophysiological function to allow for more complete resection or corrections. The application of IOM during pediatric brain tumor resections encompasses a unique set of technical issues. First, obtaining stable and reliable responses in children of different ages requires detailed understanding of normal ageadjusted brain-spine development. Neurophysiology, anatomy, and anthropometry of children are different from those of adults. Second, monitoring of the brain may include risk to eloquent functions and cranial nerve functions that are difficult with the usual neurophysiological techniques. Third, interpretation of signal change requires unique sets of normative values specific for children of that age. Fourth, tumor resection involves multiple considerations including defining tumor type, size, location, pathophysiology that might require maximal removal of lesion or minimal intervention. IOM techniques can be divided into monitoring and mapping. Mapping involves identification of specific neural structures to avoid or minimize injury. Monitoring is continuous acquisition of neural signals to determine the integrity of the full longitudinal path of the neural system of interest. Motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials are representative methodologies for monitoring. Free-running electromyography is also used to monitor irritation or damage to the motor nerves in the lower motor neuron level : cranial nerves, roots, and peripheral nerves. For the surgery of infratentorial tumors, in addition to free-running electromyography of the bulbar muscles, brainstem auditory evoked potentials or corticobulbar motor evoked potentials could be combined to prevent injury of the cranial nerves or nucleus. IOM for cerebral tumors can adopt direct cortical stimulation or direct subcortical stimulation to map the corticospinal pathways in the vicinity of lesion. IOM is a diagnostic as well as interventional tool for neurosurgery. To prove clinical evidence of it is not simple. Randomized controlled prospective studies may not be possible due to ethical reasons. However, prospective longitudinal studies confirming prognostic value of IOM are available. Furthermore, oncological outcome has also been shown to be superior in some brain tumors, with IOM. New methodologies of IOM are being developed and clinically applied. This review establishes a composite view of techniques used today, noting differences between adult and pediatric monitoring.","392":null,"393":"Recent discoveries of brain tumor-related genes and fast advances in genomic testing technologies have led to the era of molecular diagnosis of brain tumor. Molecular profiling of brain tumor became the significant step in the diagnosis, the prediction of prognosis and the treatment of brain tumor. Because traditional molecular testing methods have limitations in time and cost for multiple gene tests, next-generation sequencing technologies are rapidly introduced into clinical practice. Targeted sequencing panels using these technologies have been developed for brain tumors. In this article, focused on pediatric brain tumor, key discoveries of brain tumor-related genes are reviewed and cancer panels used in the molecular profiling of brain tumor are discussed.","394":"Intracranial germ cell tumors (iGCTs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with peculiar characteristics clearly distinguished from other brain tumors of neuroepithelial origin. Diverse histology, similarity to gonadal GCT, predilection to one sex, and geographic difference in incidence all present enigmas and fascinating challenges. The treatment of iGCT has advanced for germinoma to date; thus, clinical attention has shifted from survival to long-term quality of life. However, for non-germinomatous GCT, current protocols provide only modest improvement and more innovative therapies are needed. Recently, next-generation sequencing studies have revealed the genomic landscape of iGCT. Novel mutations in the KIT-RAS-MAPK and AKT-MTOR pathways were identified. More importantly, methylation profiling revealed a new method to assess the pathogenesis of iGCT. Molecular research will unleash new knowledge on the origin of iGCT and solve the many mysteries that have lingered on this peculiar neoplasm for a long time.","395":"In contrast to many of the malignant tumors that occur in the central nervous system in adults, the management, responses to therapy, and future perspectives of children with malignant lesions of the brain hold considerable promise. Within the past 5 years, remarkable progress has been made with our understanding of the basic biology of the molecular genetics of several pediatric malignant brain tumors including medulloblastoma, ependymoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour, and high grade glioma\/diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. The recent literature in pediatric neuro-oncology was reviewed, and a summary of the major findings are presented. Meaningful sub-classifications of these tumors have arisen, placing children into discrete categories of disease with requirements for targeted therapy. While the mainstay of therapy these past 30 years has been a combination of central nervous system irradiation and conventional chemotherapy, now with the advent of high resolution genetic mapping, targeted therapies have emerged, and less emphasis is being placed on craniospinal irradiation. In this article, the present and future perspective of pediatric brain malignancy are reviewed in detail. The progress that has been made offers significant hope for the future for patients with these tumours.","396":"Gliomas are the most common pediatric tumors of the central nervous system. In this review, we discuss the clinical features, treatment paradigms, and evolving concepts related to two types of pediatric gliomas affecting two main locations: the optic pathway and thalamus. In particular, we discuss recently revised pathologic classification, which adopting molecular parameter. We believe that our review contribute to the readers' better understanding of pediatric glioma because pediatric glioma differs in many ways from adult glioma according to the newest advances in molecular characterization of this tumor. A better understanding of current and evolving issues in pediatric glioma is needed to ensure effective management decision.","397":"The prognosis of brain tumors in children has improved for last a few decades. However, the prognosis remains dismal in patients with recurrent brain tumors. The outcome for infants and young children in whom the use of radiotherapy (RT) is very limited because of unacceptable long-term adverse effect of RT remains poor. The prognosis is also not satisfactory when a large residual tumor remains after surgery or when leptomeningeal seeding is present at diagnosis. In this context, a strategy using high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT\/auto-SCT) has been explored to improve the prognosis of recurrent or high-risk brain tumors. This strategy is based on the hypothesis that chemotherapy dose escalation might result in improvement in survival rates. Recently, the efficacy of tandem HDCT\/auto-SCT has been evaluated in further improving the outcome. This strategy is based on the hypothesis that further dose escalation might result in further improvement in survival rates. At present, the number of studies employing tandem HDCT\/auto-SCT for brain tumors is limited. However, results of these pilot studies suggest that tandem HDCT\/auto-SCT may further improve the outcome. In this review, we will summarize our single center experience with tandem HDCT\/auto-SCT for recurrent or high-risk brain tumors.","398":"Germline mutations in cancer causing genes result in high risk of developing cancer throughout life. These cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) are especially prevalent in childhood brain tumors and impact both the patient's and other family members' survival. Knowledge of specific CPS may alter the management of the cancer, offer novel targeted therapies which may improve survival for these patients, and enables early detection of other malignancies. This review focuses on the role of CPS in pediatric high grade gliomas (PHGG), the deadliest group of childhood brain tumors. Genetic aspects and clinical features are depicted, allowing clinicians to identify and diagnose these syndromes. Challenges in the management of PHGG in the context of each CPS and the promise of innovative options of treatment and surveillance guidelines are discussed with the hope of improving outcome for individuals with these devastating syndromes.","399":"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood and remains a major cause of cancer related mortality in children. Significant scientific advancements have transformed the understanding of medulloblastoma, leading to the recognition of four distinct clinical and molecular subgroups, namely wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog, group 3, and group 4. Subgroup classification combined with the recognition of subgroup specific molecular alterations has also led to major changes in risk stratification of medulloblastoma patients and these changes have begun to alter clinical trial design, in which the newly recognized subgroups are being incorporated as individualized treatment arms. Despite these recent advancements, identification of effective targeted therapies remains a challenge for several reasons. First, significant molecular heterogeneity exists within the four subgroups, meaning this classification system alone may not be sufficient to predict response to a particular therapy. Second, the majority of novel agents are currently tested at the time of recurrence, after which significant selective pressures have been exerted by radiation and chemotherapy. Recent studies demonstrate selection of tumor sub-clones that exhibit genetic divergence from the primary tumor, exist within metastatic and recurrent tumor populations. Therefore, tumor resampling at the time of recurrence may become necessary to accurately select patients for personalized therapy.","400":"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a deadly paediatric brain cancer. Transient response to radiation, ineffective chemotherapeutic agents and aggressive biology result in rapid progression of symptoms and a dismal prognosis. Increased availability of tumour tissue has enabled the identification of histone gene aberrations, genetic driver mutations and methylation changes, which have resulted in molecular and phenotypic subgrouping. However, many of the underlying mechanisms of DIPG oncogenesis remain unexplained. It is hoped that more representative in vitro and preclinical models-using both xenografted material and genetically engineered mice-will enable the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents and strategies for targeted drug delivery. This review provides a clinical overview of DIPG, the barriers to progress in developing effective treatment, updates on drug development and preclinical models, and an introduction to new technologies aimed at enhancing drug delivery.","401":"Radiation therapy is highly effective for the management of pediatric malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors including embryonal tumors. With the increment of long-term survivors from malignant CNS tumors, the radiation-related toxicities have become a major concern and we need to improve the treatment strategies to reduce the late complications without compromising the treatment outcomes. One of such strategies is to reduce the radiation dose to craniospinal axis or radiation volume and to avoid or defer radiation therapy until after the age of three. Another strategy is using particle beam therapy such as proton beams instead of photon beams. Proton beams have distinct physiologic advantages over photon beams and greater precision in radiation delivery to the tumor while preserving the surrounding healthy tissues. In this review, I provide the treatment principles of pediatric CNS embryonal tumors and the strategic improvements of radiation therapy to reduce treatment-related late toxicities, and finally introduce the increasing availability of proton beam therapy for pediatric CNS embryonal tumors compared with photon beam therapy.","402":"Surgery and radiotherapy are mainstays of treatment for ependymomas (EPNs). Recent molecular subgrouping could be superior to histopathological grading for predicting the prognosis of patients with EPNs. Gross total resection is an effective treatment approach regardless of its locations or pathologic grades. Adjuvant therapeutic strategies could be decided based on molecular subgrouping with risk-stratification. Information of histologic-molecular biology is now providing clues to therapeutic insights.","403":null,"404":null,"405":"The purpose of this study was to find an optimal delivery route for clinical trials of intrathecal cell therapy for spinal cord injury in preclinical stage. We compared in vivo distribution of Cy5.5 fluorescent dye in the spinal cord region at various time points utilizing in vivo optical imaging techniques, which was injected into the lateral ventricle (LV) or cisterna magna (CM) of rats. Although CM locates nearer to the spinal cord than the LV, significantly higher signal of Cy5.5 was detected in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord region at all time points tested when Cy5.5 was injected into the LV. In the LV injection Cy5.5 signal in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord was observed within 12 hours after injection, which was maintained until 72 hours after injection. In contrast, Cy5.5 signal was concentrated at the injection site in the CM injection at all time points. These data suggested that the LV might be suitable for preclinical injection route of therapeutics targeting the spinal cord to test their treatment efficacy and biosafety for spinal cord diseases in small animal models. ","406":"Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) was the third most common cause of death in South Korea in 2014. Evidence from abroad suggests that comprehensive stroke centers play an important role in improving the mortality rate of stroke. However, surgical treatment for CVD is currently slightly neglected by national policy, and there is still regional imbalance in this regard. For this reason, we conducted a survey on the necessity of, and the requirements for, establishing regional comprehensive cerebrovascular surgery centers (CCVSCs). This investigation was performed using the questionnaire survey method. The questionnaire was consisted with two sections. The first concerned the respondent's opinion regarding the current status of demand and the regional imbalance of cerebrovascular surgery in South Korea. The second section asked about the requirements for establishing regional CCVSCs. We sent the questionnaire to 100 board members of the Korean Society of Cerebrovascular Surgeons. Most experts agreed that cerebrovascular surgery patients were concentrated in large hospitals in the capital area, and 83.6% of respondents agreed that it was necessary to alleviate the regional imbalance of cerebrovascular surgery. With regards to personnel, over 90% of respondents answered that at least two neuro-vascular surgeons and two neuro-interventionists are necessary to establish a CCVSC. Regarding facilities, almost all respondents stated that each CCVSC would require a neuro-intensive care unit and hybrid operating room. The survey asked the respondents about 13 specific neurovascular surgical procedures and whether they were necessary for a regional CCVSC. In the questions about the necessity of cerebrovascular surgical equipment, all seven pieces of equipment were considered essential by all respondents. A further five pieces of equipment were considered necessary on site: computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, conventional angiography, surgical microscope, and surgical navigation. Our results may provide a basis for future policy regarding treatment of cerebrovascular disease, including surgery. Raising the comprehensiveness of treatment at a regional level would lower the national disease burden. Policies should be drafted regarding comprehensive treatment including surgery for cerebrovascular disease, and related support plans should be implemented.

A great portion of the obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) patients are managed successfully with psychiatric treatment such as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy, but more than 10% of patients are remained as nonresponder who needs neurosurgical treatments. These patients are potential candidates for the neurosurgical management. There had been various kind of operation, lesioning such as leucotomy or cingulotomy or capsulotomy or limbic leucotomy, and with advent of stereotaxic approach and technical advances, deep brain stimulation was more chosen by neurosurgeon due to its characteristic of reversibility and adjustability. Gamma knife radiosurgery are also applied to make lesion targeting based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, but the complication of adverse radiation effect is not predictable. In the neurosurgical field, MR guided focused ultrasound has advantage of less invasiveness, real-time monitored procedure which is now growing to attempt to apply for various brain disorder. In this review, the neurosurgical treatment modalities for the treatment of OCD will be briefly reviewed and the current state of MR guided focused ultrasound for OCD will be suggested.","408":"To compare peri-operative any symptomatic stroke after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), based on the application or absence of a cerebral protection device. A systematic literature review using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central was done across an online data base from January 1995 to October 2016. Procedures which were performed due to carotid dissection or aneurysm, procedures using covered stents or conducted in an emergency, were excluded. The primary endpoint was perioperative any symptomatic stroke within 30 days after the procedure. A fixed effect model was used in cases of heterogeneity less than 50%. In the 25 articles included in this study, the number of stroke events was 326 (2.0%) in protected CAS and 142 (3.4%) in unprotected CAS. The use of cerebral protection device significantly decreased stroke after CAS (odds ratio [OR] 0.633, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.479-0.837, p=0.001). In the publication bias analysis, Egger's regression test disclosed that the intercept was -0.317 (95% CI -1.015-0.382, p=0.358). Regarding symptomatic patients (four studies, 539 CAS procedures), the number of stroke was six (1.7%) in protected CAS and 11 (5.7%) in unprotected CAS. The protective effect against stroke events by cerebral protection device did not have a statistical significance (OR 0.455, 95% CI 0.151-1.366, p=0.160). The use of protection device significantly decreased stroke after CAS. However, its efficacy was not demonstrated in symptomatic patients. Routine use of protection device during CAS should be critically assessed before mandatory use.

Mediation will start automatically without agreements of the defendant, when the outcome of the patient was death, coma more than a month or severe disability. Cerebral aneurysm has a definite risk of bad outcome, especially in the worst condition. Any surgical intervention to this lesion has its own high risk of complications. Recently, Seoul central district court decided 50% responsibility of the doctors who made a rupture of the aneurysm during coiling (2015Ga-Dan5243104). We reviewed judicial precedents related to cerebral aneurysms in lawsuit using a web search. We searched judicial precedents at a web search of the Supreme Court, using the key words, &amp;quot;cerebral aneurysm&amp;quot;. There were 15 precedents, six from the Supreme Court, seven from the High Court, and two from district courts. Seven precedents were related to the causation analysis, such as work-relationship. Five precedents were malpractice suits related bad results or complications. Remaining three precedents were related to the insurance payment. In five malpractice precedents, two precedents of the Supreme Court reversed former two precedents of the High Court. Judicial precedents on the cerebral aneurysm included not only malpractice suits, but also causation analysis or insurance payment. Attention to these subjects is needed. We also need education of the independent medical examination. To avoid medical disputes, shared decision making seems to be useful, especially in cases of high risk condition or procedures. ","410":"To identify the perioperative factors associated with instrument failure in patients undergoing a partial corpectomy with instrumentation (PCI) for spinal metastasis. We assessed the one hundred twenty-four patients with who underwent PCI for a metastatic spine from 1987 to 2011. Outcome measure was the risk factor related to implantation failure. The preoperative factors analyzed were age, sex, ambulation, American Spinal Injury Association grade, bone mineral density, use of steroid, primary tumor site, number of vertebrae with metastasis, extra-bone metastasis, preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and preoperative spinal radiotherapy. The intraoperative factors were the number of fixed vertebrae, fixation in osteolytic vertebrae, bone grafting, and type of surgical approach. The postoperative factors included postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and spinal radiotherapy. This study was supported by the National Research Foundation grant funded by government. There were no study-specific biases related to conflicts of interest. There were 15 instrumentation failures (15\/124, 12.1%). Preoperative ambulatory status and primary tumor site were not significantly related to the development of implant failure. There were no significant associations between insertion of a bone graft into the partial corpectomy site and instrumentation failure. The preoperative and operative factors analyzed were not significantly related to instrumentation failure. In univariable and multivariable analyses, postoperative spinal radiotherapy was the only significant variable related to instrumentation failure (p=0.049 and 0.050, respectively). When performing PCI in patients with spinal metastasis followed by postoperative spinal radiotherapy, the surgeon may consider the possibility of instrumentation failure and find other strategies for augmentation than the use of a bone graft for fusion.

A systemic literature review was performed using online database from January 2004 to January 2017. Primary outcomes were successful recanalization seen on finial angiography and good outcome at three months. Secondary outcomes were mortality and the development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (S-ICH) after the procedure. A fixed effect model was used when heterogeneity was less than 50%. Egger's regression test was used to assess publication bias. Five studies were included for final analysis. Between EVT with IVT and EVT alone group, successful recanalization (odds ratio [OR] 1.467, p=0.216), good clinical outcome at three months (OR 1.199, p=0.385), mortality (OR 0.776, p=0.371), and S-ICH (OR 1.820, p=0.280) did not differ significantly.

These patients experienced severe cervicalgia mostly related to their neck motion even after standard cervical operations. In both cases, the restored disc heights after the operations were prominently greater than the preoperative disc heights. The patients had not responded to any of the conservative treatments, and unloading of these excessively distracted segments through ultimate revision surgery led to dramatic pain relief. This report emphasizes the increase in distractional forces that takes place after a standard ACDF or ADR, as well as the importance of a proper sized implant. It also includes the reviews of other biomechanical or clinical reports dealing with this issue, thereby cautioning the surgeons not to disregard these factors, which might have an adverse effect in patients with cervicalgia even after radiographically successful cervical procedures.","413":"The purpose of the present study was to describe an OrBitoZygomatic (OBZ) surgical variant that implies the drilling of the orbital roof and lateral wall of the orbit without orbitotomy. Design : cross-sectional study. Between January 2010 and December 2014, 18 patients with middle fossa lesions underwent the previously mentioned OBZ surgical variant. Gender, age, histopathological diagnosis, complications, and percentage of resection were registered. The detailed surgical technique is described. Of the 18 cases listed in the study, nine were males and nine females. Seventeen cases (94.5%) were diagnosed as primary tumoral lesions, one case (5.5%) presented with metastasis of a carcinoma, and an additional one had a fibrous dysplasia. Age ranged between 27 and 73 years. Early complications were developed in four cases, but all of these were completely resolved. None developed enophthalmos. The present study illustrates a novel surgical OBZ approach that allows for the performance of a simpler and faster procedure with fewer complications, and without increasing surgical time or cerebral manipulation, for reaching lesions of the middle fossa. Thorough knowledge of the anatomy and surgical technique is essential for successful completion of the procedure. ","414":"Surgical obliteration of ruptured aneurysm of the proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is challenging because of limited surgical accessibility. In recent years, coil embolization is the first-choice treatment for these lesions. However, coil embolization is not always easy in ruptured PICA aneurysm owing to the variable anatomical diversity of its shapes, its relationship to the parent artery, its low incidence, and accordingly, lesser neurointerventionist experience. The parent artery and microcatheter for easier navigation and the embolization technique for stable coiling were identified. This study aimed to identify the more appropriate approach route, microcatheter, and strategies for an easier and safer, and more durable coil embolization in the treatment of lesions in the proximal PICA. Coil embolization for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured proximal PICA remains a challenge, but with the appropriate coiling plan, it can be treated successfully.

Neck pain, a pulsatile mass and murmur at auscultation are the most common symptoms. ECCAs may exhibit severe clinical manifestations due to complications. Cases of rupture can be fatal. There is a risk of distal embolization and stroke in thrombosed cases. We discuss two cases of enlarged ECCA treated surgically in the light of the most recent literature.","417":"Craniovertebral junctional anomalies constitute a technical challenge. Surgical opening of atlantoaxial joint region is a complex procedure especially in patients with nuchal deformity like basilar invagination. This region has actually very complicated anatomical and functional characteristics, including multiple joints providing extension, flexion, and wide rotation. In fact, it is also a bottleneck region where bones, neural structures, and blood vessels are located. Stabilization surgery regarding this region should consider the fact that the area exposes excessive and life-long stress due to complex movements and human posture. Therefore, all options should be considered for surgical stabilization, and they could be interchanged during the surgery, if required. A 53-year-old male patient applied to outpatients' clinic with complaints of head and neck pain persisting for a long time. Physical examination was normal except increased deep tendon reflexes. The patient was on long-term corticosteroid due to an allergic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography findings indicated basilar invagination and atlantoaxial dislocation. The patient underwent C0-C3-C4 (lateral mass) and additional C0-C2 (translaminar) stabilization surgery. In routine practice, the sites where rods are bound to occipital plates were placed as paramedian. Instead, we inserted lateral mass screw to the sites where occipital screws were inserted on the occipital plate, thereby creating a site where extra rod could be bound. When C2 translaminar screw is inserted, screw caps remain on the median plane, which makes them difficult to bind to contralateral system. These bind directly to occipital plate without any connection from this region to the contralateral system. Advantages of this technique include easy insertion of C2 translaminar screws, presence of increased screw sizes, and exclusion of pullout forces onto the screw from neck movements. Another advantage of the technique is the median placement of the rod; i.e., thick part of the occipital bone is in alignment with axial loading. We believe that this technique, which could be easily performed as adjuvant to classical stabilization surgery with no need for special screw and rod, may improve distraction force in patients with low bone density.

We aimed to classify sacral insufficiency fractures according to the position of cortical break and possible need for intervention. Between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2014, all patients with a proven fracture of the sacrum following a low-energy or an even unnoticed trauma were prospectively registered : 117 females and 13 males. All patients had a computer tomography of the pelvic ring, two patients had a magnetic resonance imaging additionally : localization and involvement of the fracture lines into the sacroiliac joint, neural foramina or the spinal canal were identified. Patients were aged between 46 and 98 years (mean, 79.8 years). Seventy-seven patients had an unilateral fracture of the sacral ala, 41 bilateral ala fractures and 12 patients showed a fracture of the sacral corpus : a total of 171 fractures were analyzed. The first group A included fractures of the sacral ala which were assessed to have no or less mechanical importance (n=53) : fractures with no cortical disruption (\"bone bruise\") (A1; n=2), cortical deformation of the anterior cortical bone (A2; n=4), and fracture of the anterolateral rim of ala (A3; n=47). Complete fractures of the sacral ala (B; n=106) : parallel to the sacroiliac joint (B1; n=63), into the sacroiliac joint (B2; n=19), and involvement of the sacral foramina respectively the spinal canal (B3; n=24).

Sixty-eight fractures proceeded into the sacroiliac joint, 34 fractures showed an injury of foramina or canal. The new classification allowes the differentiation of fractures of less mechanical importance and a risk assessment for possible polymethyl methacrylate leaks during sacroplasty in the direction of the neurological structures.

Pedicle, lateral mass (LM), and vertebral foramen were evaluated using computed tomography (CT) imaging. Pedicle diameter, LM height, thickness, width and vertebral foramen asymmetry (VFA) were measured and compared between the two groups. Cervical dynamic motion, disc and facet joint degeneration were investigated. Additionally, we compared the morphology of LM between convex side and concave side with cervical scoliotic CP patients. LM height was smaller in CP group. LM thickness and width were larger in CP group at mid-cervical level. In 40 CP patients with cervical scoliosis, there were no height and width differences between convex and concave side. Pedicle outer diameter was not statistically different between two groups. Pedicle inner diameter was significantly smaller in CP group. Pedicle sclerosis was more frequent in CP patients. VFA was larger in CP group at C3, C4, and C5. Disc\/facet degeneration grade was higher in the CP group. Cervical motion of CP group was smaller than those of the control group. LM morphology of CP patients was different from normal population. Sclerotic pedicles and vertebral foramen asymmetry were more commonly identified in CP patients. CP patients were more likely to demonstrate progressive disc\/facet degeneration.

It is radiologically similar to a spinal cord ependymoma, but surgical findings and outcomes differ. Gross total resection of the tumor is not always feasible. The present study was done to determine the clinical, radiological and pathological characteristics of spinal cord subependymomas. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of ten spinal cord subependymoma patients (M : F=4 : 6; median 38 years; range, 21-77) from four institutions. The most common symptoms were sensory changes and\/or pain in eight patients, followed by motor weakness in six. The median duration of symptoms was 9.5 months. Preoperative radiological diagnosis was ependymoma in seven and astrocytoma in three. The tumors were located eccentrically in six and were not enhanced in six. Gross total resection of the tumor was achieved in five patients, whereas subtotal or partial resection was inevitable in the other five patients due to a poor dissection plane. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed in two patients. Neurological deterioration occurred in two patients; transient weakness in one after subtotal resection and permanent weakness after gross total resection in the other. Recurrence or regrowth of the tumor was not observed during the median 31.5 months follow-up period (range, 8-89). Spinal cord subependymoma should be considered when the tumor is located eccentrically and is not dissected easily from the spinal cord. Considering the rather indolent nature of spinal cord subependymomas, subtotal removal without the risk of neurological deficit is another option.

The purpose of this study was to research the management of the recurrent cerebral aneurysm after a surgical clipping and how to overcome them. From January 1996 to December 2015, medical records and radiologic findings of 14 patients with recurrent aneurysm after surgical clipping were reviewed retrospectively. Detailed case-by-case analysis was performed based on preoperative, postoperative and follow-up radiologic examinations and operative findings. All clinical variables including age, sex, aneurysm size and location, type and number of applied clips, prognosis, and time to recurrence are evaluated. All patients are classified by causes of the recurrence. Possible risk factors that could contribute to those causes and overcoming ways are comprehensively discussed. All recurrent aneurysms after surgical clipping were 14 of 2364 (0.5%). Three cases were males and 11 cases were females. Mean age was 52.3. At first treatment, nine cases were ruptured aneurysms, four cases were unruptured aneurysms, and one case was unknown. Locations of recurrent aneurysm were determined; anterior communicating artery (A-com) (n=7), posterior communicating artery (P-com) (n=3), middle cerebral artery (n=2), anterior cerebral artery (n=1) and basilar artery (n=1). As treatment of the recurrence, 11 cases were treated by surgical clipping and three cases were treated by endovascular coil embolization. Three cases of all 14 cases occurred in a month after the initial treatment. Eleven cases occurred after a longer interval, and three of them occurred after 15 years. By analyzing radiographs and operative findings, several main causes of the recurrent cerebral aneurysm were found. One case was incomplete clipping, five cases were clip slippage, and eight cases were fragility of vessel wall near the clip edge. This study revealed main causes of the recurrent aneurysm and contributing risk factors to be controlled. To manage those risk factors and ultimately prevent the recurrent aneurysm, neurosurgeons have to be careful in the technical aspect during surgery for a complete clipping without a slippage. Even in a perfect surgery, an aneurysm may recur at the clip site due to a hemodynamic change over years. Therefore, all patients must be followed up by imaging for a long period of time. ","426":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the variability of clopidogrel responses according to duration of a clopidogrel drug regimen after stent-assisted coil embolization (SAC), and to determine the correlation between the variability of clopidogrel responses and thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications. A total of 47 patients who underwent SAC procedures to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms were enrolled in the study. Preoperatively, patients received more than seven days of aspirin (100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg), daily. P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) was checked with the VerifyNow test one day before the procedure (pre-PRU) and one month after the procedure (post-PRU). PRU variability was calculated as the difference between the initial response and the follow-up response. Patients were sorted into two groups based on their response to treatment : responsive and hypo-responsive. PRU variability was significantly greater in the hypo-responsive group when compared to the responsive group (p=0.019). Pre-PRU and serum platelets counts were significantly correlated with PRU variation (p=0.005 and p=0.004, respectively). Although thromboembolic complication had no significant correlated factors, hemorrhagic complication was correlated with pre-PRU (p=0.033). In conclusion, variability of clopidogrel responses during clopidogrel medication was correlated to serum platelet counts and the initial clopidogrel response. Thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications did not show correlation with the variability of clopidogrel response, or the clopidogrel response after one month of medication; however, hemorrhagic complication was associated with initial clopidogrel response. Therefore, it is recommended to test patients for an initial clopidogrel response only, as further tests would be insignificant. ","427":"Sometimes a vertebral artery (VA) enters the spinal canal via the C1-2 intervertebral space, a variation regarded as a C2 segmental-type VA. This paper describes the anatomy of the C2 segmental-type VA and reviews its clinical importance. Between March 2014 and November 2015, 3386 patients underwent computed tomographic angiography. I identified C2 segmental-type VAs, associated vascular variation, the origin of ipsilateral posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (PICAs), and the clinical symptoms associated with C2 segmental-type VAs. The origin of an ipsilateral PICA is divided into 5 types. A type 1 PICA originates from ipsilateral VAs coursing suboccipitally (IVASO), a type 2 originates from ipsilateral proximal C2 segmental-type VAs, a type 3 originates from ipsilateral distal C2 segmental-type VAs. For type 4, the PICA does not originate from an ipsilateral VA. For type 5, the PICA is the terminal end of an ipsilateral C2 segmental-type VA. One hundred thirteen patients had 121 C2 segmental-type VAs; 47 were associated with an IVASO, and 74 were not. Four type 1, 13 type 2, 60 type 3, 42 type 4, and two type 5 PICAs were identified. Only one patient showed symptoms associated with a C2 segmental-type VA, being a 71-year-old man presenting with a C2 segmental-type VA infarction. For C2 segmental-type VAs, the ipsilateral IVASO and origin of the PICA are important for predicting the outcome of this type of VA infarction. ","428":null,"429":null,"430":"The prevalence of patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) has been reported as high as 68%. ASD often leads to significant pain and disability. Recent emphasis has been placed on sagittal plane balance and restoring normal sagittal alignment with regards to the three dimensional deformity of ASD. Optimal sagittal alignment has been known to increase spinal biomechanical efficiency, reduce energy expenditure by maintaining a stable posture with improved load absorption, influence better bony union, and help to decelerate adjacent segment deterioration. Increasingly positive sagittal imbalance has been shown to correlate with poor functional outcome and poor self-image along with poor psychological function. Compensatory mechanisms attempt to maintain sagittal balance through pelvic rotation, alterations in lumbar lordosis as well as knee and ankle flexion at the cost of increased energy expenditure. Restoring normal spinopelvic alignment is paramount to the treatment of complex spinal deformity with sagittal imbalance. Posterior osteotomies including posterior column osteotomies, pedicle subtraction osteotomies, and posterior vertebral column resection, as well anterior column support are well known to improve sagittal alignment. Understanding of whole spinal alignment and dynamics of spinopelvic alignment is essential to restore sagittal balance while minimizing the risk of developing sagittal decompensation after surgical intervention.","431":"Despite advancements in treating ruptured cerebral aneurysms, an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is still a grave cerebrovascular disease associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Based on the literature published to date, worldwide academic and governmental committees have developed clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to propose standards for disease management in order to achieve the best treatment outcomes for aSAHs. In 2013, the Korean Society of Cerebrovascular Surgeons issued a Korean version of the CPGs for aSAHs. The group researched all articles and major foreign CPGs published in English until December 2015 using several search engines. Based on these articles, levels of evidence and grades of recommendations were determined by our society as well as by other related Quality Control Committees from neurointervention, neurology and rehabilitation medicine. The Korean version of the CPGs for aSAHs includes risk factors, diagnosis, initial management, medical and surgical management to prevent rebleeding, management of delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm, treatment of hydrocephalus, treatment of medical complications and early rehabilitation. The CPGs are not the absolute standard but are the present reference as the evidence is still incomplete, each environment of clinical practice is different, and there is a high probability of variation in the current recommendations. The CPGs will be useful in the fields of clinical practice and research.","432":"Intraparenchymal meningiomas without dural attachment are extremely rare, especially when they occur in basal ganglia region in child. An 8-year-old boy was admitted at our hospital, complaining of recurrent headache and vomiting for 3 months. Neurological examination showed impaired vision and mild paresis of the left extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lesion located in the right basal ganglia region extending to superasellar cistern with solid, multiple cystic and necrotic components. Computed tomography revealed calcification within the mass. Due to the anterior cerebral artery involvement, a subtotal resection was achieved and postoperative radiotherapy was recommended. Histopathological examination indicated that the lesion was an atypical meningioma. The postoperative rehabilitation was uneventful. Mildly impaired vision and motor weakness of left extremities improved significantly and the patient returned to normal life after surgery. To our knowledge, intraparenchymal atypical meningioma in basal ganglia extending to superasellar cistern was never reported. The significance in differential diagnosis of lesions in basal ganglia should be emphasized.","433":"The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of screw fixation in previously augmented vertebrae with bone cement. We also investigated the influence of cement distribution pattern on the surgical technique. Fourteen patients who required screw fixation at the level of the previous percutaneous vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty were enrolled in this study. The indications for screw fixation in the previously augmented vertebrae with bone cement included delayed complications, such as cement dislodgement, cement leakage with neurologic deficits, and various degenerative spinal diseases, such as spondylolisthesis or foraminal stenosis. Clinical outcomes, including pain scale scores, cement distribution pattern, and procedure-related complications were assessed. Three patients underwent posterior screw fixation in previously cemented vertebrae due to cement dislodgement or progressive kyphosis. Three patients required posterior screw fixation for cement leakage or displacement of fracture fragments with neurologic deficits. Eight patients underwent posterior screw fixation due to various degenerative spinal diseases. It was possible to insert screws in the previously augmented vertebrae regardless of the cement distribution pattern; however, screw insertion was more difficult and changed directions in the patients with cemented vertebrae exhibiting a solid pattern rather than a trabecular pattern. All patients showed significant improvements in pain compared with the preoperative levels, and no patient experienced neurologic deterioration as seen at the final follow-up. For patients with vertebrae previously augmented with bone cement, posterior screw fixation is not a contraindication, but is a feasible option. ","434":"In respect of the health and safety of the public, universal access to health care is an issue of the greatest importance. The geographic distribution of doctors is one of the important factors contributing to access to health care. The aim of this study is to assess the imbalances in the geographic distribution of neurosurgeons across Korea. Population data was obtained from the National Statistical Office. We classified geographic groups into 7 metropolitan cities, 78 non-metropolitan cities, and 77 rural areas. The number of doctors and neurosurgeons per 100000 populations in each county unit was calculated using the total number of doctors and neurosurgeons at the country level from 2009 to 2015. The density levels of neurosurgeon and doctor were calculated and depicted in maps. Between 2009 and 2015, the number of neurosurgeons increased from 2002 to 2557, and the ratio of neurosurgeons per 100000 populations increased from 4.02 to 4.96. The number of neurosurgeons per 100000 populations was highest in metropolitan cities and lowest in rural areas from 2009 to 2015. A comparison of the geographic distribution of neurosurgeons in 2009 and 2015 showed an increase in the regional gap. The neurosurgeon density was affected by country unit characteristics (p=0.000). Distribution of neurosurgeons throughout Korea is uneven. Neurosurgeons are being increasingly concentrated in a limited number of metropolitan cities. This phenomenon will need to be accounted when planning for a supply of neurosurgeons, allocation of resources and manpower, and the provision of regional neurosurgical services. ","435":"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has proven useful in the study of the natural history of ischemic stroke. However, the potential of DW-MRI for the evaluation of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has not been established. In this study, we investigated DW-MRI findings of CSDH and evaluated the impact of the image findings on postoperative outcomes of CSDH. We studied 131 CSDH patients who had undergone single burr hole drainage surgery. The images of the subdural hematomas on preoperative DW-MRI and computed tomography (CT) were divided into three groups based on their signal intensity and density: 1) homogeneous (iso or low) density on CT and homogeneous low signal intensity on DW-MRI; 2) homogeneous (iso or low) density on CT and mixed signal intensity on DW-MRI; and 3) heterogeneous density on CT and mixed signal intensity on DW-MRI. On the basis of postoperative CT, we also divided the patients into 3 groups of surgical outcomes according to residual hematoma and mass effect. Analysis showed statistically significant differences in surgical (A to B: p&lt;0.001, A to C: p&lt;0.001, B to C: p=0.129) and functional (A to B: p=0.039, A to C: p&lt;0.001, B to C: p=0.108) outcomes and treatment failure rates (A to B: p=0.037, A to C: p=0.03, B to C: p=1) between the study groups. In particular, group B and group C showed worse outcomes and higher treatment failure rates than group A. CSDH with homogeneous density on CT was characterized by signal intensity on DW-MRI. In CSDH patients, performing DW-MRI as well as CT helps to predict postoperative treatment failure or complications. ","436":"Morphometric data for the lumbar posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was investigated to identify whether there is a difference in the morphometry of the PLL of the lumbar spine at each level with respect to the pattern of intervertebral disc displacement. In 14 formalin-fixed adult cadavers (12 males and 2 females), from L1 to L5, the authors measured the width and height of the PLL and compared them with other landmarks such as the disc and the pedicle. Horizontally, at the upper margin of the disc, the central portion of the superficial PLL covered 17.8-36.9% of the disc width and the fan-like portion of the PLL covered 63.9-76.7% of the disc width. At the level of the median portion of the disc, the PLL covered 69.1-74.5% of the disc width. Vertically, at the level of the medial margin of the pedicle, the fan-like portion of the PLL covered 23.5-29.9% of the disc height. In general, a significant difference in length was not found in the right-left and male-female comparisons. This study presents the morphometric data on the pattern of intervertebral disc displacement and helps to improve the knowledge of the surgical anatomy of the lumbar PLL. ","437":"Spondylitis is often chemotherapy resistant and requires long-term treatment. Without adequate chemotherapy, the outcome can be fatal or result in severe neurologic damage. Therefore, differentiating the etiology of spondylitis is very important, particularly in spontaneous cases. As the prevalence of tuberculosis in Korea has decreased in recent years, updated clinical research about spondylitis is warranted. From April 2010 to March 2016, data from spondylitis patients were collected retrospectively. In total, 69 patients (51 with pyogenic spondylitis and 18 with tuberculous spondylitis) were included. Clinical data, laboratory findings including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, measurements of Cobb angles at the initial and final follow-up, and radiologic features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated. To test differences between the pyogenic and tuberculous groups, numerical data were compared using the student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical data were compared using the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. The patients' mean age was 60.0 years. Male sex was slightly predominant (56.5%). There was no difference in mean age and sex between the two groups. The pyogenic group had a relatively higher proportion of immunocompromised patients. The peak CRP value was higher in the pyogenic group than in the tuberculous group (14.08 mg\/dL and 8.50 mg\/dL, respectively, p=0.009), whereas the ESR was not significantly different between the groups (81.5 mm\/h and 75.6 mm\/h, respectively, p=0.442). Radiologically, the presence of disc space sparing and vertebral body collapse differed between the groups. In the tuberculous group, the disc was more commonly preserved on contrast-enhanced MRI (50% and 23.5%, respectively, p=0.044), and vertebral body collapse was more common (66.6% and 15.7%, respectively, p&lt;0.001). The mean length of hospitalization was longer in the pyogenic group (56.5 days and 41.2 days, respectively, p=0.001). Four mortality cases were observed only in the pyogenic group. The most commonly isolated microorganism in the pyogenic group was Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (methicillin susceptible S. aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus [MRSA] in 8 and 4 cases, respectively). The clinical and radiological manifestations of spontaneous spondylitis differ based on the causative organism. Pyogenic spondylitis patients tend to have a higher CRP level and a more severe clinical course, whereas tuberculous spondylitis patients present with destruction of the vertebral body with disc sparing more frequently. The presence of MRSA is increasing in community-acquired spondylitis cases. ","438":"Among the various sacropelvic fixation methods, S2 alar-iliac (S2AI) screw fixation has several advantages compared to conventional iliac wing screw. However, the placement of S2AI screw still remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe a novel technique of free hand S2AI screw insertion using a K-wire and cannulated screw, and to evaluate the accuracy of the technique. S2AI screw was inserted by free hand technique in sixteen consecutive patients without any fluoroscopic guidance. The gearshift was advanced to make a pilot hole passing through the sacroiliac joint and directing the anterior inferior iliac spine. A K-wire was placed through the pilot hole. After introducing a cannulated tapper along with the K-wire, a cannulated S2AI screw was installed over the K-wire. Thirty-three S2AI screws were placed in sixteen consecutive patients. Thirty-two screws were cannulated screws, and one screw was a conventional non-cannulated screw. Thirty out of 32 (93.8%) cannulated screws were accurately positioned, whereas two cannulated screws and one non-cannulated screw violated lateral cortex of the ilium. The technique using K-wire and cannulated screw can provide accurate placement of free hand S2AI screw. ","439":null,"440":"Choroidal metastases (CMs) are the most common intraocular tumor. Management is mainly radiation therapy with goals of pain control and visual improvement. However, many radiation-related complications are reported. Since gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for CM was first reported in 1995, few cases have been reported. We report 7 cases of CMs treated with GKS. From April 2011 to November 2014, 7 patients with CM underwent GKS. Their median age at treatment was 64 years (range, 51-71 years). Four males and three females were treated. Lung cancer was the most common primary pathology, followed by renal cell carcinoma and stomach cancer. Four patients had multiple cerebral lesions and were treated simultaneously for choroidal lesions. The median marginal dose of 20 Gy (range, 15-25 Gy) was administered at the 50% isodose line. Median follow-up period after GKS was 8 months (range, 2-38.3 months). Four patients expired due to underlying malignancy progression. Except for two patients who were not followed with magnetic resonance image after GKS, all patients showed size reduction in the treated lesions, but a new choroidal lesion appeared in one patient and one recurred. Six of seven patients reported subjectively improved visual symptoms. Visual acuity improved in 2 patients, and 2 were stable upon objective examination. One patient showed no improvement in visual acuity, but ocular pain was relieved; another patient showed improved vision and tumor remission, but visual deterioration recurred. GKS was shown to be safe and effective and should be considered for CM treatment.

The aim of the present study was to assess independent predictors of rehemorrhage and find the possibility of preventing rehemorrhage in postoperative patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Medical records of 263 postoperative patients with sICH from our Hospital were reviewed. The relationships between rehemorrhage and parameters were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. The parameters include time from onset to surgery, hematologic paremeters, neuroimaging characteristics, level and variability of systolic blood pressure, medical histories, operation duration, and blood loss. In addition, relationship between rehemorrhage and clinical outcome were analyzed by using multivariate analyses. Thirty-five (13.31%) patients experienced rehemorrhage after operation. Multivariate analyses indicated that the following factors were independently associated with rehemorrhage : history of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 2.717; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.005-7.346; p=0.049), and midline shift (for every 1 mm increase, OR, 1.117; 95% CI, 1.029-1.214; p=0.009). Rehemorrhage was an independent risk factor of poor functional outcome (OR, 3.334; 95% CI, 1.094-10.155; p=0.034). Our finding revealed that history of diabetes mellitus and admission midline shift were possibly associated with rehemorrhage in postoperative patients with sICH. ","443":"Duplication of the vertebral artery (VA) is a rare vascular variant. This paper describes the anatomy and embryological development of duplicated VAs and reviews the clinical significance. Computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed in 3386 patients (1880 females, 1506 males) between March 2014 and November 2015. We defined duplication of the VA as a condition in which the VA has two origins that fused at different levels of the neck. Ten of the 3386 patients (0.295%) who received CT angiography had a dual origin of the VA; three on the left side, and seven on the right side. In all seven with right dual origin of the VA, both limbs of the VA origin originated from the right subclavian artery. In all three patients with left dual origin of the VA, both limbs of the VA originated from the left subclavian artery and aortic arch. In all 10 patients, the medial limb of the duplicated VA was located posteriorly and medially to the common carotid artery (CCA) and anteriorly and laterally to the vertebral transverse foramen. In two patients, the medial limb of the duplicated VA was located in close proximity to the CCA. In another two patients, the medial limb of the duplicated VA was located in close proximity to the CCA, carotid bifurcation, and proximal internal carotid artery. Although duplication of the VA is asymptomatic in most patients, clinicians should consider this anomaly during diagnosis and treatment. ","444":"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the immediate and long-term efficacy and safety of coil embolization for large or giant aneurysms. One hundred and fifty large or giant aneurysm cases treated with endovascular coil embolization between January 2005 and February 2014 at a single institute were included in this study. Medical records and imaging findings were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate prognostic factors associated with major recurrence (major recanalization or rupture) and delayed thromboembolism after selective coil embolization. Procedure-related symptomatic complications occurred in five (3.3%) patients. The mean clinical and radiological follow-up periods were 38 months (range, 2-110) and 26 months (range, 6-108), respectively. During the follow-up period, the estimated recurrence rate was 4.6% per year. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed the degree of occlusion to be the only factor associated with recurrence (p=0.008, hazard ratio 3.15, 95% confidence interval 1.34-7.41). The patient's history of rupture in addition to the size and location of the aneurysm were not associated with recurrence in this study. Delayed infarction occurred in eight cases, and all were incompletely occluded. Although immediate postprocedural safety profiles were reasonable, longterm results showed recanalization and thromboembolic events to occur continuously, especially in patients with incomplete occlusion. In addition, incomplete occlusion was associated with delayed thromboembolic complications. Patients with incomplete occlusions should be followed carefully for delayed recurrence or delayed thromboembolic events. ","445":"To investigates the effect of curcumin on proliferation of spinal cord neural stem\/progenitor cells (SC-NSPCs) and functional outcome in a rat spinal cord injury (SCI) model. Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and blindly allocated into three groups (sham control group; curcumin treated group after SCI; vehicle treated group after SCI). Functional recovery was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale during 6 weeks after SCI. The expression of SC-NSPC proliferation and astrogliosis were analyzed by nestin\/Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. The injured spinal cord was then examined histologically, including quantification of cavitation. The BBB score of the SCI-curcumin group was better than that of SCI-vehicle group up to 14 days (p&lt;0.05). The co-immunoreactivity of nestin\/BrdU in the SCI-curcumin group was much higher than that of the SCI-vehicle group 1 week after surgery (p&lt;0.05). The GFAP immunoreactivity of the SCI-curcumin group was remarkably lower than that of the SCI-vehicle group 4 weeks after surgery (p&lt;0.05). The lesion cavity was significantly reduced in the curcumin group as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). These results indicate that curcumin could increase the expression of SC-NSPCs, and reduce the activity of reactive astrogliosis and lesion cavity. Consequently curcumin could improve the functional recovery after SCI via SC-NSPC properties.

However, the anatomical change in the catheterized radial artery (RA) is not well understood. Herein, we present the results of ultrasonographic observation of the RA after routine transradial cerebral angiography (TRCA). Patients who underwent routine TRCA with pre- and post-procedure Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) of the catheterized RA were enrolled. We then recorded and retrospectively reviewed the diameter and any complicated features of the RA observed on DUS, and the factors associated with the diameter and complications were analyzed. A total of 223 TRCAs across 181 patients were enrolled in the current study. The mean RA diameter was 2.48 mm and was positively correlated with male gender (p&lt;0.001) and hypertension (p&lt;0.002). The median change in diameter after TRCA was less than 0.1 mm (range, -1.3 to 1.2 mm) and 90% of changes were between -0.8 and +0.7 mm. Across 228 procedures, there were 12 cases (5.3%) of intimal hyperplasia and 22 cases (9.6%) of asymptomatic local vascular complications found on DUS. Patients with abnormal findings on the first procedure had a smaller pre-procedural RA diameter than that of patients without findings (2.26 vs. 2.53 mm, p=0.0028). There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal findings for the first versus subsequent procedures (p=0.68). DUS identified the pre- and post-procedural diameter and local complications of RA. Routine TRCA seems to be acceptable with regard to identifying local complications and changes in RA diameter.

The medical and radiological records were retrospectively reviewed. The surgery was indicated in 10 consecutive patients with rostral adjacent segment stenosis and instability. After the insertion of the interbody cage, lateral screws were inserted into the cranial and caudal vertebra using the MISF through the same LLIF trajectory. The radiological and clinical outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The median follow-up period was 13 months (range, 3-48 months). Transient sensory changes in the left anterior thigh occurred in 3 patients, and 1 patient experienced subjective weakness; however, these symptoms normalized within 1 week. Back and leg pain were significantly improved (p&lt;0.05). In the radiological analysis, both the segmental angle at the operated segment and anterior disc height were significantly increased. At 6 months postoperatively, solid bony fusion was confirmed in 7 patients. Subsidence and mechanical failure did not occur in any patients.

In total, 30 patients with intractable primary typical GPN who underwent MVD without rhizotomy and were followed for more than 2 years were included in the analysis. Each MVD was performed using one of four different surgical techniques: interposition of Teflon pieces, transposition of offending vessels using Teflon pieces, transposition of offending vessels using a fibrin-glue-coated Teflon sling, and removal of offending veins. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery was responsible for neurovascular compression in 27 of 30 (90%) patients, either by itself or in combination with other vessels. The location of compression on the glossopharyngeal nerve varied; the root entry zone (REZ) only (63.3%) was most common, followed by both the REZ and distal portion (26.7%) and the distal portion alone (10.0%). In terms of detailed surgical techniques during MVD, the offending vessels were transposed in 24 (80%) patients, either using additional insulation, offered by Teflon pieces (15 patients), or using a fibrin glue-coated Teflon sling (9 patients). Simple insertion of Teflon pieces and removal of a small vein were also performed in five and one patient, respectively. During the 2 years following MVD, 29 of 30 (96.7%) patients were asymptomatic or experienced only occasional pain that did not require medication. Temporary hemodynamic instability occurred in two patients during MVD, and seven patients experienced transient postoperative complications. Neither persistent morbidity nor mortality was reported. This study demonstrates that MVD without rhizotomy is a safe and effective treatment option for GPN. ","451":"Postoperative hydrocephalus is a common complication following craniectomy in patients with traumatic brain injury, and affects patients' long-term outcomes. This study aimed to verify the risk factors associated with the development of hydrocephalus after craniectomy in patients with acute traumatic subdural hemorrhage (tSDH). Patients with acute traumatic SDH who had received a craniectomy between December 2005 and January 2016 were retrospectively assessed by reviewing the coexistence of other types of hemorrahges, measurable variables on computed tomography (CT) scans, and the development of hydrocephalus during the follow-up period. Data from a total of 63 patients who underwent unilateral craniectomy were analyzed. Postoperative hydrocephalus was identified in 34 patients (54%) via brain CT scans. Preoperative intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was associated with the development of hydrocephalus. Furthermore, the thickness of SDH (p=0.006) and the extent of midline shift before craniectomy (p=0.001) were significantly larger in patients with postoperative hydrocephalus. Indeed, multivariate analyses showed that the thickness of SDH (p=0.019), the extent of midline shift (p&lt;0.001) and the coexistence of IVH (p=0.012) were significant risk factors for the development of postoperative hydrocephalus. However, the distance from the midline to the craniectomy margin was not an associated risk factor for postoperative hydrocephalus. In patients with acute traumatic SDH with coexisting IVH, a large amount of SDH, and a larger midline shift, close follow-up is necessary for the early prediction of postoperative hydrocephalus. Furthermore, craniectomy margin need not be limited in acute traumatic SDH patients for the reason of postoperative hydrocephalus.

However, some patients initially receive conservative treatment, a subset of whom require surgical intervention later. This study aimed to evaluate the predictors of delayed surgical intervention in ASDH patients who are initially managed conservatively. From January 2007 to December 2015, 842 patients diagnosed with ASDH were treated at our institution. Among them, 158 patients with convexity ASDH were initially treated conservatively. Patients were divided into a delayed surgery group and a conservative group. Demographic characteristics, past medication and medical histories, and radiological and laboratory data were collected by retrospective chart review. Independent risk factors were identified with univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-eight patients (17.7%) underwent delayed surgical intervention. Their mean age was 69.0 years, and 82.1% were male. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease prevalence and use of anti-platelet agents did not significantly differ from the conservative group. However, age (p=0.024), previous cerebral infarction history (p=0.026), increased maximal hematoma thickness (p&lt;0.001), midline shifting (p=0.001) and accompanying subarachnoid hemorrhage (p=0.022) on initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan, low hemoglobin level (p&lt;0.001), high leukocyte count (p=0.004), and low glucose level (p=0.002) were significantly associated with delayed surgical intervention. In multivariate analysis, increased maximal hematoma thickness (odds ratio [OR]=1.279, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.075-1.521; p=0.006), low hemoglobin level (OR=0.673, 95% CI 0.467-0.970; p=0.034), and high leukocyte count (OR=1.142, 95% CI 1.024-1.272; p=0.017) were independent risk factors for delayed surgical intervention. Due to the high likelihood of delayed surgical intervention among minimal ASDH patients with a thicker hematoma on initial brain CT, lower hemoglobin level, and higher leukocyte count, these patients should receive more careful observation.

However, recurrence is common after surgical treatment, and the recurrence rate varies from 5% to 33%. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive factors for recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma. We analyzed data from 248 patients with chronic subdural hematoma who were treated by burr-hole craniostomy with a closed drainage system for hematoma evacuation in this five-year retrospective study. Thirty-one (12.6%) patients underwent re-operation for recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma. Univariate analysis revealed that anticoagulation (p=0.0279), headache (p=0.0323), and preoperative midline shifting (p=0.0321) showed significant differences with respect to recurrent chronic subdural hematoma. We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis and found that diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 2.618; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0899-6.2898; p=0.0314), anticoagulation (OR, 6.739; 95% CI, 1.1287-40.2369; p=0.0364), headache (OR, 2.951; 95% CI, 1.1464-7.5964; p=0.0249), and preoperative midline shifting (OR, 1.0838; 95% CI, 1.0040-1.1699; p=0.0391) were independent predictive factors for recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma. We showed that diabetes mellitus, anticoagulation, headache, and preoperative midline shifting were independent predictors of recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma. ","456":"The authors prospectively analyzed the effect of one-level or two-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), comparing stand-alone cages and cage-with-plate fixation constructs with respect to clinical outcomes and radiologic changes. A total of 84 patients who underwent one-level (n=52) or two-level ACDF (n=32) for cervical disc disease and who completed 2 years of follow-up were included in this study. The patients were divided by cervical level and grouped into ACDF-Cage-only and ACDF-Cage-with-plate groups. The following parameters were assessed using radiographs: subsidence, C2-C7 lordosis angle, fusion segment angle, adjacent disc space narrowing, and fusion status. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the neck disability index (NDI) and visual analog scale scores for arm pain. In the comparison of one-level ACDF-cage-only and ACDF-cage-with-plate groups, the NDI score was better in the cage-only group at the 3-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups: however, no significant difference in clinical outcomes was observed. In the comparison of two-level ACDF-cage-only and ACDF-cage-with-plate groups, no difference in any clinical outcome was observed between the two groups. At the 24-month follow-up, subsidence was observed in 45.8% of patients in the one-level cage-only group and 32.1% of patients in the one-level cage-with-plate fixation group. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate between the two groups (p=0.312). Subsidence in the two-level cage-only group (66.6%) was significantly more frequent than in the two-level cage-with-plate fixation group (30%; p=0.049). The fusion rate for patients in the one-level cage-only group was not significantly different from that in the one-level cage-with-plate fixation group (cage-only, 87.5%; cage-with-plate fixation, 92.9%; p=0.425); fusion rate in the two-level patients were also similar between groups (cage-only, 83.3%; cage-with-plate fixation, 95%; p=0.31). Our clinical results showed that for single-level cases, plate fixation had no additional benefit versus cage-only; for two-level ACDF cases, the fusion rate and clinical outcomes were similar, although the cage-with-plate fixation group had a lower incidence of cage subsidence than did the cage-only group. We conclude that physicians should be aware of this possible disadvantage associated with using cervical plates in one-level ACDF. However, in two-level ACDF, subsidence is more likely to occur without plate fixation, and thus the addition of plate fixation should be considered. ","457":"As increasing the size of the geriatric population, the number of elderly patients, who need the surgery for painful degenerative spinal stenosis has been increasing. The geriatric population may be relatively high complications, because of age and age-associated medical conditions. However, there is a lack of studies addressing the perioperative complications and outcomes in elderly patients with posterior lumbar inter body fusion with screw augmentation (PLIF). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and radiographic studies of geriatric patients who had spine surgery of PLIF due to spinal stenosis for 11 years. We divided into 2 groups (A; 70-75 years, B; over then 76 years) according to the age. Surgical level of each groups, hospital day and postoperative day, co-morbidities, complications, clinical outcomes were analyzed. Operative reports, hospital and outpatient clinic charts, and radiographic studies were reviewed. Group A was composed of 80 patients, their mean age was 72.21 and female dominant (n=46), and their mean surgically fused level was 1.52 level. Group B was 36 patients, their mean age was 78.83 and female dominant (n=20), and their mean surgically fused level was 1.36 level. Comparing between two groups, complications, postoperative hospital stay were slightly increase in group B and co-morbidity was statistically high in group B, however clinical outcomes were similar between two groups. Increasing age might be an important risk factor for complications in patients undergoing PLIF, however, we would like to recommend that if the situation of spine of extreme geriatric patients need PLIF, it should be in the surgeon's consideration after careful selection and clinical judgement. ","458":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3-level hybrid surgery (HS), which combines fusion and cervical disc replacement (CDR), compared to 3-level fusionin patient with cervical spondylosis involving 3 levels. Patients in the anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) group (n=30) underwent 3-level fusion and the HS group (n=19) underwent combined surgery with fusion and CDR. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analogue scale for the arm, the neck disability index (NDI), Odom criteria and postoperative complications. The cervical range of motion (ROM), fusion rate and adjacent segments degeneration were assessed with radiographs. Significant improvements in arm pain relief and functional outcome were observed in ACDF and HS group. The NDI in the HS group showed better improvement 6 months after surgery than that of the ACDF group. The ACDF group had a lower fusion rate, higher incidence of device related complications and radiological changes in adjacent segments compared with the HS group. The better recovery of cervical ROM was observed in HS group. However, that of the ACDF group was significantly decreased and did not recover. The HS group was better than the ACDF group in terms of NDI, cervical ROM, fusion rate, incidence of postoperative complications and adjacent segment degeneration. ","459":"Total resection without consecutive postoperative whole brain radiation therapy is indicated for patients with a single or two sites of brain metastasis, with close follow-up by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we explored the effectiveness, usefulness, and safety of this follow-up regimen. From January 2006 to December 2015, a total of 109 patients (76 males, 33 females) underwent tumor resection as the first treatment for brain metastases (97 patients with single metastases, 12 with two metastases). The mean age was 59.8 years (range 27-80). The location of the 121 tumors in the 109 patients was supratentorial (n=98) and in the cerebellum (n=23). The origin of the primary cancers was lung (n=45), breast (n=17), gastrointestinal tract (n=18), hepatobiliary system (n=8), kidney (n=7), others (n=11), and unknown origin (n=3). The 121 tumors were totally resected. Follow-up involved regular clinical and MRI assessments. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after tumor resection were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methods based on clinical prognostic factors. During the follow-up, MRI scans were done for 85 patients (78%) with 97 tumors. Fifty-six of the 97 tumors showed no recurrence without adjuvant local treatment, representing a numerical tumor recurrence-free rate of 57.7%. Mean and median RFS was 13.6 and 5.3 months, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed the cerebellar location of the tumor as the only statistically significant prognostic factor related to RFS (p=0.020). Mean and median OS was 15.2 and 8.1 months, respectively. There were no significant prognostic factors related to OS. The survival rate at one year was 8.2% (9 of 109). With close and regular clinical and image follow-up, initial postoperative observation without prompt postoperative radiation therapy can be applied in patients of brain metastasi(e)s when both the tumor(s) are completely resected. ","460":"Atypical meningioma is rare tumor and there is no accurate guide line for optimal treatment. This retrospective study analyzed the prognostic factors, the effect of different methods of treatments and the behavior of atypical meningioma. Thirty six patients were diagnosed as atypical meningioma, among 273 patients who were given a diagnosis of meningioma in the period of 2002 to 2015. Age, gender, tumor location, Ki 67, Simpson grade and treatment received were analyzed. We studied the correlation between these factors with recurrence, overall survival rate and progression free survival. Median overall survival time and progression free survival time are 60 and 53 (months). Better survival rate was observed for patients less than 50 years old but with no statistical significance (p=0.322). And patients with total resection compared with subtotal resection also showed better survival rate but no statistical significance (p=0.744). Patients with a tumor located in skull base compared with patients with a tumor located in brain convexity and parasagittal showed better progression free survival (p=0.048). Total resection is associated with longer progression-free survival than incomplete resection (p=0.018). We confirmed that Simpson grade was significant factor for statistically affect to progression free survival in univariate analysis. In case of skull base atypical tumor, it is analyzed that it has more recurrence than tumor located elsewhere. Overall survival was not affected statistically by patient age, gender, tumor location, Ki 67, Simpson grade and treatment received in this study.

Due to a high incidence of small, wide-necked aneurysms in this zone, it is often challenging to achieve complete occlusion when solely using detachable coils, thus stent placement is often required. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of stent placement in endovascular treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms. Data of 98 paraclinoid aneurysms treated by endovascular approach in our center from August 2005 to June 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into two groups: simple coiling and stent-assisted coiling. Differences in the recurrence and progressive occlusion between the two groups were mainly analyzed. The recurrence was defined as more than one grade worsening according to Raymond-Roy Classification or major recanalization that is large enough to permit retreatment in the follow-up study compared to the immediate post-operative results. Complete occlusion was achieved immediately after endovascular treatment in eight out of 37 patients (21.6%) in the stent-assisted group and 18 out of 61 (29.5%) in the simple coiling group. In the follow-up imaging studies, the recurrence rate was lower in the stent-assisted group (one out of 37, 2.7%) compared to the simple coiling group (13 out of 61, 21.3%) (p=0.011). Multivariate logistic regression model showed lower recurrence rate in the stent-assisted group than the simple coiling group (odds ratio [OR] 0.051, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.005-0.527). Furthermore there was also a significant difference in the rate of progressive occlusion between the stent-assisted group (16 out of 29 patients, 55.2%) and the simple coiling group (10 out of 43 patients, 23.3%) (p=0.006). The stent-assisted group also exhibited a higher rate of progressive occlusion than the simple coiling group in the multivariate logistic regression model (OR 3.208, 95% CI 1.106-9.302). Use of stents results in good prognosis not only by reducing the recurrence rate but also by increasing the rate of progressive occlusion in wide-necked paraclinoid aneurysms. Stent-assisted coil embolization can be an important treatment strategy for paraclinoid aneurysms when considering the superiority of long term outcome. ","463":"Acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is associated with severe neurological dysfunction and high mortality rates. The benefits of mechanical thrombectomy in BAO have not been explored in recent clinical trials. Therefore, we analyzed outcomes of stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy for BAO, and compared with anterior circulation occlusions (ACO). In total, 161 consecutive patients (24 BAO, 137 ACO) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with the stent retriever between January 2013 and August 2016 enrolled in our study. All patients underwent clinical assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin scale (mRS). Radiological results were used to evaluate thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scores and successful recanalization was defined by TICI 2b or 3. Mean NIHSS scores at 24 hours and 30 days were significantly higher in the BAO group than the ACO group (p=0.021, p=0.001). mRS at 90 days was significantly higher in the BAO group (4.2) compared with the ACO group (3.0) (p=0.003). The BAO group (2.0) performed fewer stent retriever passages than the ACO group (2.7) (p=0.049). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of complications, but the BAO patients experienced a higher mortality (16.6%) rate than ACO patients (5.8%) (p=0.001). In subgroup analysis of BAO, patients with short procedure times achieved successful recanalization (p=0.001) and successfully recanalized patients exhibited more favorable mRS at 90 days (p=0.027). In our study, mechanical thrombectomy of BAO patients showed worse clinical outcome and higher mortality rate than ACO patients. However, mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in BAO is an effective treatment, because successfully recanalized patients showed good clinical outcome in BAO patients.

This study investigated whether dehydration, as measured by blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\/creatinine (Cr) ratio, influences the occurrence of VTE in patients with AIS. This is a retrospective study of patients with AIS between January 2012 and December 2013. Patients with newly diagnosed AIS who experienced prolonged hospitalization for at least 4 weeks were included in this study. Of 182 patients included in this study, 17 (9.3%) suffered VTE during the follow-up period; in two cases, VTE was accompanied by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Patients with VTE were more frequently female and had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, more lower limb weakness, and elevated blood urea nitrogen BUN\/Cr ratio on admission. In a multivariate analysis, BUN\/Cr ratio &gt;15 (odds ratio [OR] 8.75) and severe lower limb weakness (OR 4.38) were independent risk factors for VTE.

","466":"In addition to bone bridging inside a cage or graft (intragraft bone bridging, InGBB), extragraft bone bridging (ExGBB) is commonly observed after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with a stand-alone cage. However, solid bony fusion without the formation of ExGBB might be a desirable condition. We hypothesized that an insufficient contact area for InGBB might be a causative factor for ExGBB. The objective was to determine the minimal area of InGBB by finite element analysis. A validated 3-dimensional, nonlinear ligamentous cervical segment (C3-7) finite element model was used. This study simulated a single-level ACDF at C5-6 with a cylindroid interbody graft. The variables were the properties of the incorporated interbody graft (cancellous bone [Young's modulus of 100 or 300 MPa] to cortical bone [10000 MPa]) and the contact area between the vertebra and interbody graft (Graft-area, from 10 to 200 mm2). Interspinous motion between the flexion and extension models of less than 2 mm was considered solid fusion. The minimal Graft-areas for solid fusion were 190 mm2, 140 mm2, and 100 mm2 with graft properties of 100, 300, and 10000 MPa, respectively. The minimal Graft-areas were generally unobtainable with only the formation of InGBB after the use of a commercial stand-alone cage. ExGBB may be formed to compensate for insufficient InGBB. Although various factors may be involved, solid fusion with less formation of ExGBB may be achieved with refinements in biomaterials, such as the use of osteoinductive cage materials; changes in cage design, such as increasing the area of polyetheretherketone or the inside cage area for bone grafts; or surgical techniques, such as the use of plate\/screw systems.

Despite rapid innovation of instruments and techniques for spinal surgery, the postoperative outcomes are not always favorable. This article reports a minimally invasive anterior decompression technique without instrumented fusion, which was modified from the conventional procedure. The authors present 2 cases of huge beak-type OPLL. Patients underwent minimally invasive anterior decompression without fusion. This method created a space on the ventral side of the OPLL without violating global thoracic spinal stability. Via this space, the OPLL and anterior lateral side of the dural sac can be seen and manipulated directly. Then, total removal of the OPLL was accomplished. No orthosis was needed. In this article, we share our key technique and concepts for treatment of huge thoracic OPLL. Case 1. 51-year-old female was referred to our hospital with right lower limb radiating pain and paresis. Thoracic OPLL at T6-7 had been identified at our hospital, and conservative treatment had been tried without success. Case 2. This 54-year-old female with a 6-month history of progressive gait disturbance and bilateral lower extremity radiating pain (right&gt;left) was admitted to our institute. She also had hypoesthesia in both lower legs. Her symptoms had been gradually progressing. Computed tomography scans showed massive OPLL at the T9-10 level. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated ventral bony masses with severe anterior compression of the spinal cord at the same level. We used this surgical method in 2 patients with a huge beaked-type OPLL in the thoracic level. Complete removal of the OPLL via anterior decompression without instrumented fusion was accomplished. The 1st case had no intraoperative or postoperative complications, and the 2nd case had 1 intraoperative complication (dural tear) and no postoperative complications. There were no residual symptoms of the lower extremities. This surgical technique allows the surgeon to safely and effectively perform minimally invasive anterior decompression without instrumented fusion via a transthoracic approach for thoracic OPLL. It can be applied at the mid and lower level of the thoracic spine and could become a standard procedure for treatment of huge beak-type thoracic OPLL.

Postoperative hematoma enlargement, however, can be a serious complication of intracranial surgery that frequently results in severe neurological deficit and even death. Therefore, it is important to identify the risk factors of postoperative hematoma growth. During a 13-year period, 101 patients underwent minimally invasive frameless stereotactic aspiration for basal ganglia hematoma. Patients were classified into two groups according to whether or not they had postoperative hematoma enlargement in a computed tomography scan. Baseline demographic data and several risk factors, such as hypertension, preoperative hematoma growth, antiplatelet medication, presence of concomitant intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), were analysed via a univariate statistical study. Nine of 101 patients (8.9%) showed hematoma enlargement after frameless stereotactic aspiration. Among the various risk factors, concomitant IVH and antiplatelet medication were found to be significantly associated with postoperative enlargement of hematomas. In conclusion, our study revealed that aspirin use and concomitant IVH are factors associated with hematoma enlargement subsequent to frameless stereotactic aspiration for basal ganglia hematoma.

Moreover, children this age are completely dependent on their parents. We analyzed the demographic data and risk factors for outcomes in TBI patients in this age group to elucidate their clinical characteristics. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and radiological films of children under 24 months who were admitted to Kyungpook National University Hospital from January 2004 to December 2013 for TBI. Specifically, we analyzed age, cause of injury, initial Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, radiological diagnosis, seizure, hydrocephalus, subdural hygroma, and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score, and we divided outcomes into good (GOS 4-5) or poor (GOS 1-3). We identified the risk factors for post-traumatic seizure (PTS) and outcomes using univariate and multivariate analyses. The total number of patients was 60, 39 males and 21 females. Most common age group was between 0 to 5 months, and the median age was 6 months. Falls were the most common cause of injury (n=29, 48.3%); among them, 15 were falls from household furniture such as beds and chairs. Ten patients (16.7%) developed PTS, nine in one week; thirty-seven patients (61.7%) had skull fractures. Forty-eight patients had initial GCS scores of 13-15, 8 had scores of 12-8, and 4 had scored 3-7. The diagnoses were as follows: 26 acute subdural hematomas, 8 acute epidural hematomas, 7 focal contusional hemorrhages, 13 subdural hygromas, and 4 traumatic intracerebral hematomas larger than 2 cm in diameter. Among them, two patients underwent craniotomy for hematoma removal. Four patients were victims of child abuse, and all of them had PTS. Fifty-five patients improved to good-to-moderate disability. Child abuse, acute subdural hematoma, and subdural hygroma were risk factors for PTS in univariate analyses. Multivariate analysis found that the salient risk factor for a poor outcome was initial GCS on admission. The most common cause of traumatic head injury in individuals aged less than 24 months was falls, especially from household furniture. Child abuse, moderate to severe TBI, acute subdural hematoma, and subdural hygroma were risk factors for PTS.

The degree of nerve root compression on MRI and CTM was classified into four grades. The results of each imaging modality as assessed by two different observers were compared. Visual analog scale score for pain and electromyography result were the clinical parameters used to evaluate the relationships between clinical features and nerve root compression grades on both MRI and CTM. These relationships were quantified by calculating the receiver-operating characteristic curves, and the degree of relationship was compared between MRI and CTM. McNemar's test revealed that the two diagnostic modalities did not show diagnostic concurrence (p&lt;0.0001). Electromyography results did not correlate with grades on either MRI or CTM. The visual analog pain scale score results were correlated better with changes of the grades on CTM than those on MRI (p=0.0007). The present study demonstrates that CTM could better define the pathology of degenerative lumbar spine diseases with radiculopathy than MRI. CTM can be considered as a useful confirmative diagnostic tool when the exact cause of radicular pain in a patient with lumbar radiculopathy cannot be identified by using MRI.

However, there is still lack of knowledge on their epidemiology and clinical courses. The purpose of this article is to review clinical presentations and surgical results for spinal involvement of hematologic malignancies. From January 2011 to September 2014, 195 patients (98 males and 97 females) suffering from hematological malignancies combined with spinal problems were retrospectively analyzed for clinical and radiological characteristics and their clinical results. The most common diagnosis of hematological malignancy was multiple myeloma (96 patients, 49.7%), followed by chronic myeloid leukemia (30, 15.2%), acute myeloid leukemia (22, 11.2%), and lymphoma (15, 7.56%). The major presenting symptoms were mechanical axial pain (132, 67.7%) resulting from pathologic fractures, and followed by radiating pain (49, 25.1%). Progressive neurologic deficits were noted in 15 patients (7.7%), which revealed as cord compression by epidural mass or compressive myelopathy combined with pathologic fractures. Reconstructive surgery for neurologic compromise was done in 16 patients. Even though surgical intervention was useful for early paralysis (Frankel grade D or E), neurologic recovery was not satisfactory for the progressed paralysis (Frankel grade A or B). Hematological malignancies may cause various spinal problems related to disease progression or consequences of treatments. Conservative and palliative treatments are mainstay for these lesions. However, timely surgical interventions should be considered for the cases of pathologic fractures with progressive neurologic compromise.

A retrospective analysis was performed for patients with high-grade meningioma, World Health Organization grade 2 or 3, in a single center between 2003 and 2014. The patients were reviewed according to age at diagnosis, sex, the location of meningioma, degree of tumor resection, histological features, and type of adjuvant treatment. These factors were analyzed by Firth logistic regression analyses. Fifty-three patients with high-grade meningioma were enrolled. Thirty-four patients received adjuvant treatment; conventional radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Clinical follow-up ranged from 13-113 months with a median follow-up of 35.5 months. Gross total removal (GTR), Simpson grade 1 or 2, was achieved in 29 patients and, among them, 13 patients received adjuvant treatment. In the other 24 patients with non-GTR, conventional adjuvant radiotherapy and radiosurgery were performed in 11 and 10 patients, respectively. The other 3 patients did not receive any adjuvant treatment. Radiation-related complications did not occur. Of the 53 patients, 19 patients had suffered from recurrence. The recurrence rate in the adjuvant treatment group was 23.5% (8 out of 34). On the other hand, the rate for the non-adjuvant treatment group was 57.9% (11 out of 19) (odds ratio [OR]=0.208, p=0.017). In the GTR group, the recurrence rate was 7.5% (1 out of 13) for patients with adjuvant treatment and 50% (8 out of 16) for patients without adjuvant treatment (OR=0.121, p=0.04). Adjuvant treatment appears to be safe and effective, and could lead to a lower recurrence rate in high-grade meningioma, regardless of the extent of removal.

With improvements in the optics, high resolution camera, light source, high speed burr, irrigation pump etc, minimally invasive spine surgeries can be performed with various endoscopic techniques for lumbar, cervical and thoracic regions. Advantages of endoscopic spine surgeries are less tissue dissection and muscle trauma, reduced blood loss, less damage to the epidural blood supply and consequent epidural fibrosis and scarring, reduced hospital stay, early functional recovery and improvement in the quality of life &amp; better cosmesis. With precise indication, proper diagnosis and good training, the endoscopic spine surgery can give equally good result as open spine surgery. Initially, endoscopic technique was restricted to the lumbar region but now it also can be used for cervical and thoracic disc herniations. Previously endoscopy was used for disc herniations which were contained without migration but now days it is used for highly up and down migrated disc herniations as well. Use of endoscopic technique in lumbar region was restricted to disc herniations but gradually it is also used for spinal canal stenosis and endoscopic assisted fusion surgeries. Endoscopic spine surgery can play important role in the treatment of adolescent disc herniations especially for the persons who engage in the competitive sports and the athletes where less tissue trauma, cosmesis and early functional recovery is desirable.

Only 2 cases of meningitis have been reported so far in the literature. So far, no previous reports of culture proliferation have been reported in patients with external ventricular drains, as was the case in our patient. Therefore, our case is the first to have S. paucimobilis proliferation in cerebrospinal fluid culture during intensive care unit stay for an external ventricular drain.","484":"The main aim of the present study is to examine the electrode configurations used to record the muscle motor evoked potential (mMEP) in the upper extremities during surgery with the goal of producing a high and stable mMEP signal, in particular among the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), and across the APB-ADM muscles, which have been widely used for the mMEP in the upper extremities. Thirty right-handed patients were recruited in this prospective study. No patients showed any adverse events in their mMEP signals of the upper extremities during surgery. The mMEPs were recorded independently from the signals for the APB and ADM and for those across the APB-ADM. The mMEP amplitude from across the APB-ADM was statistically higher than those recorded from the APB and ADM muscles. Moreover, the coefficient of variation of the mMEP amplitude from across the APB-ADM was smaller than those of mMEP amplitude recorded from the APB and ADM muscles. The mMEP from across the APB-ADM muscles showed a high yield with high stability compared to those in each case from the APB and ADM muscles. The configuration across the APB-ADM muscles would be best for mMEP recordings from the upper extremities for intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring purposes. ","485":"The thromboembolic events during neuroendovascular therapy (NET) are the major complications of concern that can be occasionally fatal. The thrombotic occlusion of the guide catheter for NET is thought to be the risk of the thromboembolic events. We have developed an idea for inventing the monitoring system of the continuous irrigation through the guide catheter. We herein present a unique invention of the guide catheter irrigation monitoring device. We have developed ideas for preventing the thrombotic occlusion of the guide catheter. In order to design a convenient device working in the practical use, we have consulted and shared the ideas with the electrical engineers about putting the invention. The guide catheter irrigation monitoring device (GCIMD) consisted of three parts of optical sensor, main body and electric adapter. In brief, the basic principles of working of the GCIMD are as follows. The optical sensor is attached to the dripping chamber of the line to irrigation solution. The main body had the small light and speaker to make an alarm sounds. The sensor monitors the dripping of flush solution. If the dripping stops more than three seconds, a warning alarm has been activated. So, the operating physicians can concentrate and check the guide catheter irrigation. After the use of the GCIMD, there was no major thromboembolic complication in conjunction with the thrombotic occlusion of the guide catheter in our institute. We have developed a brilliant invention of the GCIMD for NET. ","486":null,"487":"Although little is known about its origins, neck pain may be related to several associated anatomical pathologies. We aimed to characterize the incidence and features of chronic neck pain and analyze the relationship between neck pain severity and its affecting factors. Between March 2012 and July 2013, we studied 216 patients with chronic neck pain. Initially, combined tramadol (37.5 mg) plus acetaminophen (325 mg) was administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.) to all patients over a 2-week period. After two weeks, patients were evaluated for neck pain during an outpatient clinic visit. If the numeric rating scale of the patient had not decreased to 5 or lower, a cervical medial branch block (MBB) was recommended after double-dosed previous medication trial. We classified all patients into two groups (mild vs. severe neck pain group), based on medication efficacy. Logistic regression tests were used to evaluate the factors associated with neck pain severity. A total of 198 patients were included in the analyses, due to follow-up loss in 18 patients. While medication was successful in reducing pain in 68.2% patients with chronic neck pain, the remaining patients required cervical MBB. Lateral cervical curvature, such as a straight or sigmoid type curve, was found to be significantly associated with the severity of neck pain. We managed chronic neck pain with a simple pharmacological management protocol followed by MBB. We should keep in mind that it may be difficult to manage the patient with straight or sigmoid lateral curvature only with oral medication.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of sensory-motor nerve bridging on the denervated dermatomal area, in rats with sensory nerve defects, using a neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). We compared the efficacy of end-to-side (ETS) coaptation of the tibial nerve for sural nerve defect repair, in 32 Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: group A was the sham operated group, group B rats had sural nerves sectioned and buried in neighboring muscles, group C experienced nerve sectioning and end-to-end (ETE) anastomosis, and group D had sural nerves sectioned and ETS anastomosis was performed using atibial nerve bridge. Neurological evaluation included the skin pinch test and histological evaluation was performed by assessing NCAM expression in nerve terminals. Rats in the denervated group yielded negative results for the skin pinch tests, while animals in the surgical intervention groups (group C and D) demonstrated positive results. As predicted, there were no positively stained skin specimens in the denervated group (group B); however, the surgery groups demonstrated significant staining. NCAM expression was also significantly higher in the surgery groups. However, the mean NCAM values were not significantly different between group C and group D. Previous research indicates that ETE nerve repair is the gold standard for peripheral nerve defect repair. However, ETS repair is an effective alternative method in cases of sensorial nerve defect when ETE repair is not possible. ","493":"Functional and neural tissue recovery has been reported in many animal studies conducted with stem cells. However, the combined effect of cytokines and stem cells has not yet been adequately researched. Here, we analyzed the additive effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) on adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) infusion in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Four days after intrathecal infusion tubes implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, SCI was induced with an infinite horizon impactor. In the Sham group (n=5), phosphate-buffered saline was injected 3, 7, and 14 days after SCI. GCSF, ADSCs, and ADSCs with GCSF were injected at the same time in the GCSF (n=8), ADSC (n=8), and ADSC+GCSF groups (n=7), respectively. The ADSC and ADSC+GCSF groups, but not the GCSF group, showed significantly higher Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores than the Sham group during 8 weeks (p&lt;0.01), but no significant difference between the ADSC and ADSC+GCSF groups. In the ladder rung test, all four groups were significantly different from each other, with the ADSC+GCSF group showing the best improvement (p&lt;0.01). On immunofluorescent staining (GAP43, MAP2), western blotting (GAP43), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (GAP43, nerve growth factor), the ADSC and ADSC+GCSF groups showed higher levels than the Sham and GCSF groups. Our analyses suggest that the combination of GCSF and ADSCs infusions in acute SCI in the rat does not have a significant additive effect. Hence, when combination agents for SCI stem cell therapy are considered, molecules other than GCSF, or modifications to the methodology, should be investigated.

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation\/reoxygenation (OGD\/R)-treated N2a cells were used to explore the neuroprotective effects of GB. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected via Western blot and qRT-PCR. GB treatment (4 mg\/kg, i. p., bid) significantly reduced neurological deficits, water content, and cerebral infarct volume in tMCAO mice. GB also significantly increased Bcl-2\/Bax ratio, reduced the expression of caspase-3, and protected against OGD\/R-induced neuronal apoptosis. Meanwhile, GB caused the up-regulation of BDNF protein in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest that GB might protect the brain against ischemic insult partly via modulating BDNF expression. ","496":"The doctrine of informed consent, as opposed to medical paternalism, is intended to facilitate patient autonomy by allowing patient participation in the medical decision-making process. However, regrettably, the surgical informed consent (SIC) process is invariably underestimated and reduced to a documentary procedure to protect physicians from legal liability. Moreover, residents are rarely trained in the clinical and communicative skills required for the SIC process. Accordingly, to increase professional awareness of the SIC process, a brief history and introduction to the current elements of SIC, the obstacles to patient autonomy and SIC, benefits and drawbacks of SIC, planning of an optimal SIC process, and its application to cases of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm are all presented. Optimal informed consent process can provide patients with a good comprehension of their disease and treatment, augmented autonomy, a strong therapeutic alliance with their doctors, and psychological defenses for coping with stressful surgical circumstances.","497":null,"498":"Midbrain gliomas are relatively rare neoplasms with a generally benign prognosis, with dissemination or metastasis not previously reported. We describe here a woman, in whom magnetic resonance imaging scans showed hydrocephalus and a tegmental lesion in the upper aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy and biopsy were performed; during surgery, a second small lesion was observed in the infundibular recess. Histologically, the two lesions had the characteristics of low grade astrocytoma, suggesting that the midbrain astrocytoma may have been disseminated via the cerebral spinal fluid to the infundibular recess. Postoperatively this patient received radiotherapy for nearly one month. Although patients with these tumors are not usually administered adjunctive therapy, radiation and, combined modality therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, may be beneficial in patients with midbrain gliomas with dissemination.","499":"Ganglioneuroma (GN) is a rare benign tumor of neural crest origin usually found in the abdomen, but may occasionally present at uncommon sites including the cervical, lumbar, or sacral spine. However, GNs of thoracic spine are extremely rare. In this report, we describe a 12-year-old girl with giant GN in the thoracic spine, who underwent successful resection (T1-4 level) of the tumor. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. GN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any paraspinal mass. A high index of suspicion and correlation of clinico-radiological findings is necessary in differentiating a large benign tumor from a malignant growth. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice; however tumor size and location need to be considered for the surgical approach (one-step or multiple surgeries). Close follow-up after surgery is mandatory.","500":"Dural injury during spinal surgery can subsequently give rise to a remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH). Although the incidence of such injury is low, the resulting hemorrhage can be life threatening. The mechanism underlying the formation of the hemorrhage is not known, but it is mostly thought to develop after venous infarction. Cerebellar mutism (CM) is a frequent complication of posterior fossa operations in children, but it is rarely seen in adults. The development of CM after an RCH has not been described. We describe the case of a 65-year old female who lost cerebrospinal fluid after inadvertent opening of the dura during surgery. Computerized tomography performed when the patient became unable to speak revealed a bilateral cerebellar hemorrhage.","501":"Vascular compromise is a well-known consequence of brain herniation syndromes. Transtentorial brain herniation most often involves posterior cerebral arteries. However, isolated involvement of contralateral superior cerebellar artery (SCA) during unilateral impending brain herniation is reported only once and we present another case of this exceedingly rare entity. A 24-year-old man was referred to us with impending herniation due to a multiloculated hydrocephalus, and during the course of illness, he developed an isolated SCA ischemia in the opposite side of the most dilated entrapped horn. In the current article we discuss the probable pathophysiologic mechanisms of this phenomenon, as well as recommending more inclusive brain studies in cases suspected of Kernohan-Woltman notch phenomenon in unilateral brain herniation. The rationale for this commentary is that contralateral SCA transient ischemia or infarct might be the underdiagnosed underlying pathomechanism of ipsilateral hemiparesis occurring in many cases of this somehow vague phenomenon.","502":"The aim of this study to investigate the normal values of erythropoietin (EPO) and neuroprotective effects of quercetin and mannitol on EPO and hematocrit levels after acute severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rat model. A weight-drop impact acceleration model of TBI was used on 40 male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into sham (group I), TBI (group II), TBI+quercetin (50 mg\/kg intravenously) (group III), and TBI+mannitol (1 mg\/kg intravenously) (group IV) groups. The malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, EPO, and hematocrit levels were measured 1 and 4 hour after injury. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey's test were used for statistical analysis. The malondialdehyde levels decreased significantly after administration of quercetin and mannitol compared with those in group II. Catalase and glutathione peroxidase levels increased significantly in groups III and IV. Serum EPO levels decreased significantly after mannitol but not after quercetin administration. Serum hematocrit levels did not change significantly after quercetin and mannitol administration 1 hour after trauma. However, mannitol administration decreased serum hematocrit levels significantly after 4 hour. This study suggests that quercetin may be a good alternative treatment for TBI, as it did not decrease the EPO levels. ","503":"To identify and investigate differences in spinal fusion between the normal and osteopenic spine in a rat model. Female Sprague Dawley rats underwent either an ovariectomy (OVX) or sham operation and were randomized into two groups: non-OVX group and OVX group. Eight weeks after OVX, unilateral lumbar spinal fusion was performed using autologous iliac bone. Bone density (BD) was measured 2 days and 8 weeks after fusion surgery. Microcomputed tomography was used to evaluate the process of bone fusion every two weeks for 8 weeks after fusion surgery. The fusion rate, fusion process, and bone volume parameters of fusion bed were compared between the two groups. BD was significantly higher in the non-OVX group than in the OVX group 2 days and 8 weeks after fusion surgery. The fusion rate in the non-OVX group was higher than that in the OVX group 8 weeks after surgery (p=0.044). The bony connection of bone fragments with transverse processes and bone formation between transverse processes in non-OVX group were significantly superior to those of OVX group from 6 weeks after fusion surgery. The compactness and bone maturation of fusion bed in non-OVX were prominent compared with the non-OVX group. The fusion rate in OVX group was inferior to non-OVX group at late stage after fusion surgery. Bone maturation of fusion bed in the OVX group was inferior compared with the non-OVX group. Fusion enhancement strategies at early stage may be needed to patients with osteoporosis who need spine fusion surgery. ","504":"Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator had been the only approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke since its approval in 1995. However, the restrictive time window, numerous contraindications, and its low recanalization rate were all limitations of this modality. Under those circumstances, endovascular stroke therapy went through a great evolution during the past two decades of intravenous thrombolysis. The results of the 2013 randomized trials for endovascular stroke therapy were neutral, although they were limited by insufficient imaging screening at enrollment, early-generation devices with less efficacy, and treatment delays. Huge progress was made in 2015, as there were five randomized clinical trials which all demonstrated the safety and efficacy of endovascular stroke treatment. Despite differences in detail patient enrollment criteria, all 5 trials employed key factors for good functional recovery; (1) screening with non-invasive imaging to identify the proximal occlusion and exclude a large infarct core, (2) using highly effective modern thrombectomy devices mainly with stent retriever, and (3) establishment of a fast workflow to achieve effective reperfusion. The results of those trials indicate that modern thrombectomy devices can allow for faster and more effective reperfusion, which can lead to improved clinical outcomes compared to intravenous thrombolysis alone. These advances in mechanical thrombectomy are promising in the global fight against ischemic stroke-related disability and mortality. Two current mainstreams among such mechanical thrombectomy techniques, \"stent retriever thrombectomy\" and \"direct clot aspiration\", are the topic of this review. Stent retriever thrombectomy using Solitaire and Trevo retriever will be firstly discussed. And, the commonalities and the differences between two major clot aspiration thrombectomy techniques; a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) and forced arterial suction thrombectomy (FAST), will be additionally explained. Finally, details regarding the combination of direct clot aspiration and stent retriever thrombectomy, the switching strategy and the Solumbra technique, will be described.","505":"To review recent advances in endoscopic techniques for treating intraventricular lesions via transcortical passage. Articles in PubMed published since 2000 were searched using the keywords 'endoscopy,' 'endoscopic,' and 'neuroendoscopic.' Of these articles, those describing intraventricular lesions were reviewed. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SACs) can be treated with ventriculo-cystostomy (VC) or ventriculo-cysto-cisternostomy (VCC). VCC showed better results compared to VC. Procedure type, fenestration size, stent placement, and aqueductal patency may affect SAC prognosis. Colloid cysts can be managed using a transforaminal approach (TA) or a transforaminal-transchoroidal approach (TTA). However, TTA may result in better exposure compared to TA. Intraventricular cysticercosis can be cured with an endoscopic procedure alone, but if pericystic inflammation and\/or ependymal reaction are seen, third ventriculostomy may be recommended. Tumor biopsies have yielded successful diagnosis rates of up to 100%, but tumor location, total specimen size, endoscope type, and vigorous coagulation on the tumor surface may affect diagnostic accuracy. An ideal indication for tumor excision is a small tumor with friable consistency and little vascularity. Tumor size, composition, and vascularity may influence a complete resection. SACs and intraventricular cysticercosis can be treated successfully using endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic procedures may represent an alternative to surgical options for colloid cyst removal. Solid tumors can be safely biopsied using endoscopic techniques, but endoscopy for tumor resection still results in considerable challenges.","506":"Neuroendoscopic surgery is performed because it causes minimal damage to normal structures, carries a lower rate of complications, and achieves excellent outcomes. Surgeons using an endoscope and related instruments can perform complex operations through very small incisions, which is especially useful for minimally invasive procedures for the brain and spine. Neuroendoscopic surgery is now performed in cases of obstructive hydrocephalus, various intraventricular lesions, hypothalamic hamartomas, craniosynostosis, skull base tumors, and spinal lesions. This review discusses the brief history of neuroendoscopy and the current state and future perspectives of endoscopic surgery.","507":"The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been popularized in adults and has been applied to an expanding range of surgical modules and indications in this population. However, its clinical application in pediatric neurosurgery has been impeded by the differences in anatomical features and the relatively low incidence of diseases to which it is applicable. In this review article, we mainly discuss the surgical indications, feasibility, and complications of EEA for suprasellar lesions in children based on a review of the literature, focusing especially on the age-related anatomical features of the nasal cavity, various pathologic entities, and the impact of EEA on long-term craniofacial growth.","508":"Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has now become an accepted mode of hydrocephalus treatment in children. Varying degrees of success for the procedure have been reported depending on the type and etiology of hydrocephalus, age of the patient and certain technical parameters. Review of these factors for predictability of success, complications and validation of success score is presented.","509":"Multiloculated hydrocephalus (MLH) is a condition in which patients have multiple, separate abnormal cerebrospinal fluid collections with no communication between them. Despite technical advancements in pediatric neurosurgery, neurological outcomes are poor in these patients and the approach to this pathology remains problematic especially given individual anatomic complexity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics. A uniform surgical strategy has not yet been developed. Current treatment options for MLH are microsurgical fenestration of separate compartments by open craniotomy or endoscopy, shunt surgery in which multiple catheters are placed in the compartments, and combinations of these modalities. Craniotomy for fenestration allows better visualization of the compartments and membranes, and it can offer easy fenestration or excision of membranes and wide communication of cystic compartments. Hemostasis is more easily achieved. However, because of profound loss of CSF during surgery, open craniotomy is associated with an increased chance of subdural hygroma and\/or hematoma collection and shunt malfunction. Endoscopy has advantages such as minimal invasiveness, avoidance of brain retraction, less blood loss, faster operation time, and shorter hospital stay. Disadvantages are also similar to those of open craniotomy. Intraoperative bleeding can usually be easily managed by irrigation or coagulation. However, handling of significant intraoperative bleeding is not as easy. Currently, endoscopic fenestration tends to be performed more often as initial treatment and open craniotomy may be useful in patients requiring repeated endoscopic procedures.","510":"Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a benign indolent lesion despite the presentation of refractory epilepsy. Behavioral disturbances and endocrine problems are additional critical symptoms that arise along with HHs. Due to its nature of generating epileptiform discharge and spreading to cortical region, various management strategies have been proposed and combined. Surgical approaches with open craniotomy or endoscopy, stereotactic approaches with radiosurgery and gamma knife surgery or radiofrequency thermos-coagulation, and laser ablation have been introduced. Topographical dimension and the surgeon's preference are key factors for treatment modalities. Endoscopic disconnection has been one of the most favorable options performed in treating HHs. Here we discuss presurgical evaluation, patient selection, surgical procedures, and complications.","511":"An exoscope, high-definition video telescope operating monitor system to perform microsurgery has recently been proposed an alternative to the operating microscope. It enables surgeons to complete the operation assistance by visualizing magnified images on a display. The strong points of exoscope are the wide field of view and deep focus. It minimized the need for repositioning and refocusing during the procedure. On the other hand, limitation of magnifying object was an emphasizing weak point. The procedures are performed under 2D motion images with a visual perception through dynamic cue and stereoscopically viewing corresponding to the motion parallax. Nevertheless, stereopsis is required to improve hand and eye coordination for high precision works. Consequently novel 3D high-definition operating scopes with various mechanical designs have been developed according to recent high-tech innovations in a digital surgical technology. It will set the stage for the next generation in digital image based neurosurgery.","512":"A variety of complications in endoscopic third ventriculostomy have been reported, including neurovascular injury, hemodynamic alterations, endocrinologic abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, fever and infection. Even though most complications are transient, the overall rate of permanent morbidity is 2.38% and the overall mortality rate is 0.28%. To avoid these serious complications, we should keep in mind potential complications and how to prevent them. Proper decisions with regard to surgical indication, choice of endoscopic entry and trajectory, careful endoscopic procedures with anatomic orientation, bleeding control and tight closure are emphasized for the prevention of complications.","513":"Treating diseases in the field of neurosurgery has progressed concomitantly with technical advances. Here, as a surgical armamentarium for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms, the history and present status of the keyhole approach and the use of neuroendoscopy are reviewed, including our clinical data. The major significance of keyhole approach is to expose an essential space toward a target, and to minimize brain exposure and retraction. Among several kinds of keyhole approaches, representative keyhole approaches for anterior circulation aneurysms include superciliary and lateral supraorbital, frontolateral, mini-pterional and mini-interhemispheric approaches. Because only a fixed and limited approach angle toward a target is permitted via the keyhole, however, specialized surgical devices and preoperative planning are very important. Neuroendoscopy has helped to widen the indications of keyhole approaches because it can supply illumination and visualization of structures beyond the straight line of microscopic view. In addition, endoscopic indocyanine green fluorescence angiography is useful to detect and correct any compromise of the perforators and parent arteries, and incomplete clipping. The authors think that keyhole approach and neuroendoscopy are just an intermediate step and robotic neurosurgery would be realized in the near future.","514":"","515":"We report a patient with a wooden foreign body granuloma in the intervertebral disc space being symptomatic 17 years after a paraspinal penetrant trauma. According to the our result of the search for wooden foreign body granulomas, this is the first case suffered from a wooden foreign body granuloma in the intervertebral disc space that reported in the literature. In this report, we emphasized the importance of rigorous examination and follow up in paraspinal wooden penetrant traumas.","516":"Stents are widely used in coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, but on occasion, a microcatheter must traverse a stented segment of artery (so-called trans-cell technique) to select an aneurysm, or double stenting may necessary. In such situations, microguidewire passage and microcatheter delivery through a tortuous stented parent artery may pose a technical challenge. Described herein is a microguidewire looping technique to facilitate endovascular navigation in these circumstances. To apply this technique, the microguidewire tip is looped before entering the stented parent artery and then advanced distally past the stented segment, with the loop intact. Rounding of the tip prevents interference from stent struts during passage. A microcatheter is subsequently passed into the stented artery for positioning near the neck of aneurysm, with microguidewire assistance. The aneurysm is then selected, steering the microcatheter tip (via inner microguidewire) into the dome. This technique proved successful during coil embolization of nine saccular intracranial aneurysms (internal carotid artery [ICA], 6; middle cerebral artery, 2; basilar tip, 1), performing eight trans-cell deliveries and one additional stenting. Selective endovascular embolization was enabled in all patients, resulting in excellent clinical and radiologic outcomes, with no morbidity or mortality directly attributable to microguidewire looping. Microguidewire looping is a reasonable alternative if passage through a stented artery is not feasible by traditional means, especially at paraclinoid ICA sites. ","517":"This study was conducted to assess the surgical results of one-stage posterior minimal laminectomy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for the treatment of thoracic dumbbell tumor and to describe its precise technique. In addition, we investigated the technique's usefulness and limitations. Seven cases of thoracic dumbbell tumor (two men and five women, mean age, 43 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Pathological findings included schwannoma in four patients, neurofibroma in two patients, and hemangioma in one patient. The location of tumors varied from T2\/3 to T12\/L1. Dumbbell tumors were resected by one-stage operation using posterior laminectomy followed by VATS without instrumentation. Clinical data were reviewed. The mean follow-up period was 25 months (range, 3-58 months), and the operative time ranged from 255 to 385 min (mean, 331 min), with estimated blood loss ranging from 110 to 930 mL (mean, 348 mL). The tumor was completely resected without instrumentation and postoperative instability in all cases. Postoperative complications included atelectasis and facial anhydrosis in one case each. One-stage posterior minimal laminectomy and VATS may be a safe and less invasive technique for removal of thoracic dumbbell tumor without instability. This method has the advantage of early ambulation and rapid recovery because it reduces blood loss and postoperative pain. ","518":"Cases of a ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysm with a high risk of intraoperative premature rupture and technical difficulties for proximal vascular control require a technique for the early and safe establishment of proximal vascular control. A combined pterional or subfrontal approach exposes the bilateral A1 segments or the origin of the ipsilateral A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) for proximal vascular control. Proximal control far from the ruptured aneurysm facilitates tentative clipping of the rupture point of the aneurysm without a catastrophic premature rupture. The proximal control is then switched to the pericallosal artery just proximal to the aneurysm and its intermittent clipping facilitates complete aneurysm dissection and neck clipping. Three such cases are reported: a ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysm with a contained leak of the contrast from the proximal side of the aneurysm, a low-lying ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysm with irregularities on its proximal wall, and a multilobulated ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysm with the parasagittal bridging veins hindering surgical access to the proximal parent artery. In each case, the proposed combined pterional-interhemispheric or subfrontal-interhemispheric approach was successfully performed to establish proximal vascular control far from the ruptured aneurysm and facilitated aneurysm clipping via the interhemispheric approach. When using an anterior interhemispheric approach for a ruptured pericallosal artery aneurysm with a high risk of premature rupture, a pterional or subfrontal approach can be combined to establish early proximal vascular control at the bilateral A1 segments or the origin of the A2 segment. ","519":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the associations between 30-day mortality and various radiological and clinical factors in patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma (SDH). During the 11-year study period, young patients who underwent surgery for SDH were followed for 30 days. Patients who died due to other medical comorbidities or other organ problems were not included in the study population. From January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2014, 318 consecutive surgically-treated traumatic acute SDH patients were registered for the study. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze 30-day survival rates. We also estimated the hazard ratios of various variables in order to identify the independent predictors of 30-day mortality. We observed a negative correlation between 30-day mortality and Glasgow coma scale score (per 1-point score increase) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.70; p&lt;0.001). In addition, use of antithrombotics (HR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.27-4.33; p=0.008), history of diabetes mellitus (HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.20-4.32; p=0.015), and accompanying traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.27-3.58; p=0.005) were positively associated with 30-day mortality. We found significant associations between short-term mortality after surgery for traumatic acute SDH and lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, use of antithrombotics, history of diabetes mellitus, and accompanying traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage at admission. We expect these findings to be helpful for selecting patients for surgical treatment of traumatic acute SDH, and for making accurate prognoses.

Recently, as several minimally invasive spinal surgeries have developed, a need of artificial bone substitutes such as demineralized bone matrix (DBM), has arisen. We investigated the in vivo bone growth rate of DBM as a bone void filler compared to a local autologous bone grafts. From April 2014 to August 2015, 20 patients with a one or two-level spinal stenosis were included. A posterior lumbar interbody fusion using two cages and pedicle screw fixation was performed for every patient, and each cage was packed with autologous local bone and DBM. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of leg pain and back pain and the Korean Oswestry Disability Index (K-ODI). Clinical outcome parameters and range of motion (ROM) of the operated level were collected preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Computed tomography was performed 1 year after fusion surgery and bone growth of the autologous bone grafts and DBM were analyzed by ImageJ software. Eighteen patients completed 1 year of follow-up, including 10 men and 8 women, and the mean age was 56.4 (32-71). The operated level ranged from L3\/4 to L5\/S1. Eleven patients had single level and 7 patients had two-level repairs. The mean back pain NRS improved from 4.61 to 2.78 (p=0.003) and the leg pain NRS improved from 6.89 to 2.39 (p&lt;0.001). The mean K-ODI score also improved from 27.33 to 13.83 (p&lt;0.001). The ROM decreased below 2.0 degrees at the 3-month assessment, and remained less than 2 degrees through the 1 year postoperative assessment. Every local autologous bone graft and DBM packed cage showed bone bridge formation. On the quantitative analysis of bone growth, the autologous bone grafts showed significantly higher bone growth compared to DBM on both coronal and sagittal images (p&lt;0.001 and p=0.028, respectively). Osteoporotic patients showed less bone growth on sagittal images. Though DBM alone can induce favorable bone bridging in lumbar interbody fusion, it is still inferior to autologous bone grafts. Therefore, DBM is recommended as a bone graft extender rather than bone void filler, particularly in patients with osteoporosis. ","522":"This study aimed to unravel the putative mechanism underlying the neurologic deficits contralateral to the side with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and to elucidate the treatment for this condition. From January 2009 to June 2015, 8 patients with LDH with predominantly contralateral neurologic deficits underwent surgical treatment on the side with LDH with or without decompressing the symptomatic side. A retrospective review of charts and radiological records of these 8 patients was performed. The putative mechanisms underlying the associated contralateral neurological deficits, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), and the adequate surgical approach are discussed here. MRI revealed a similar laterally skewed paramedian disc herniation, with the apex deviated from the symptomatic side rather than directly compressing the nerve root; this condition may generate a contralateral traction force. EMG revealed radiculopathies in both sides of 6 patients and in the herniated side of 2 patients. Based on EMG findings and the existence of suspicious lateral recess stenosis of the symptomatic side, 6 patients underwent bilateral decompression of nerve roots and 2 were subjected to a microscopic discectomy to treat the asymptomatic disc herniation. No specific conditions such as venous congestion, nerve root anomaly or epidural lipomatosis were observed, which may be considered the putative pathomechanism causing the contralateral neurological deficits. The symptoms resolved significantly after surgery. The traction force generated on the contralateral side and lateral recess stenosis, rather than direct compression, may cause the contralateral neurologic deficits observed in LDH. ","523":"This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with subaxial cervical injury who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with autologous iliac bone graft or polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cages using demineralized bone matrix (DBM). From January 2005 to December 2010, 70 patients who underwent one-level ACDF with plate fixation for post-traumatic subaxial cervical spinal injury in a single institution were retrospectively investigated. Autologous iliac crest grafts were used in 33 patients (Group I), whereas 37 patients underwent ACDF using a PEEK cage filled with DBM (Group II). Plain radiographs were used to assess bone fusion, interbody height (IBH), segmental angle (SA), overall cervical sagittal alignment (CSA, C2-7 angle), and development of adjacent segmental degeneration (ASD). Clinical outcome was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Frankel grade. The mean follow-up duration for patients in Group I and Group II was 28.9 and 25.4 months, respectively. All patients from both groups achieved solid fusion during the follow-up period. The IBH and SA of the fused segment and CSA in Group II were better maintained during the follow-up period. Nine patients in Group I and two patients in Group II developed radiologic ASD. There were no statistically significant differences in the VAS score and Frankel grade between the groups. This study showed that PEEK cage filled with DBM, and plate fixation is at least as safe and effective as ACDF using autograft, with good maintenance of cervical alignment. With advantages such as no donor site morbidity and no graft-related complications, PEEK cage filled with DBM, and plate fixation provide a promising surgical option for treating traumatic subaxial cervical spine injuries. ","524":"This study was performed to evaluate and compare the efficacies of caudal epidural injections performed at prone and lateral decubitus positions. A total of 120 patients suffering from low back pain and radicular leg pain were included and patients were randomly distributed into 2 groups according to the position during injection. In Group 1 (n=60; 32 women, 28 men), caudal epidural injection was performed at prone position, whereas it was implemented at lateral decubitus position in Group 2 (n=60; 33 women, 27 men). Visual analogue scale, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), walking tolerance (WT) and standing tolerance (ST) were compared in 2 groups before and after injection. In Group 1, ODI values were higher at 30th minute (p=0.007), 3rd week (p=0.043) and 6th month (p=0.013). In Group 1, ODI, VAS and ST values were improved significantly at all follow-up periods compared to initial values. In Group 1, WT scores were better than initial values at 30th minute, 3rd week and 3rd month. In Group 2, ODI scores at 30th minute, 3rd week, 3rd month and 6th month were improved while VAS and ST scores were improved at all periods after injection. WT scores were better at 30th minute, 3rd week and 3rd month compared to initial WT scores. Our results indicated that application of injection procedure at lateral decubitus position allowing a more concentrated local distribution may provide better relief of pain.

Between 2011 and 2015, 14 patients (eight men and six women) who underwent bone cement-augmented percutaneous screw fixation for malignant spinal metastases were enrolled in this study. Their life expectancy was considered to be more than one month and less than one year, based on the revised Tokuhashi scoring system. Clinical findings including the back pain scale score, functional outcome, procedure related complications, and survival were assessed preoperatively, postoperatively, and then six months after the procedure. Twelve of the patients (86%) survived up to six months after the procedure. Three required mini-open decompressive laminectomy for severe epidural compression. Bone cement-augmented percutaneous screw fixation was performed one level above, one level below, and at the pathologic level itself. The mean operation time was 60 minutes (45-180) and blood loss was less than 100 mL. Prior to surgery, the mean pain score on the visual analogue scale was 8.8, while one month after the procedure, it had reduced to 3.0; this improvement was maintained until the six-month assessment in the surviving patients. All patients were able to sit within the first two days after surgery, and no patient experienced neurological deterioration at the one-month follow up after the surgery. No patient experienced screw loosening during the six months of follow-up. Asymptomatic cement leakage into the epidural space was observed in two patients, but no major complications were observed. For selected patients with malignant spinal metastases, bone cement-augmented percutaneous screw fixation can provide significant pain relief and improve quality of life.

Sixty-two patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke were treated with thrombectomy using a Solitaire stent from 2011 to 2016. Patients were divided into the BGC group (n=24, 39%) and the non-BGC group (n=38, 61%). The number of retrievals, procedure time, thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grade, presence of distal emboli, and clinical outcomes at 3 months were evaluated. Successful recanalization was more frequent in BGC than in non-BGC (83% vs. 66%, p=0.13). Distal emboli occurred less in BGC than in non-BGC (23.1% vs. 57.1%, p=0.02). Good clinical outcome was more frequent in BGC than in non-BGC (50% vs. 16%, p=0.03). The multivariate analysis showed that use of BGC was the only independent predictor of good clinical outcome (odds ratio, 5.19: 95% confidence interval, 1.07-25.11). More patients in BGC were successfully recanalized in internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with small retrieval numbers (&lt;3) than those in non-BGC (70% vs. 24%, p=0.005). In successfully recanalized ICA occlusion, distal emboli did not occur in BGC, whereas nine patients had distal emboli in non-BGC (0% vs. 75%, p=0.001) and good clinical outcome was superior in BGC than in non-BGC (55.6% vs. 8.3%, p=0.01). A BGC significantly reduces the number of retrievals and the occurrence of distal emboli, thereby resulting in better clinical outcomes in patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke, particularly with ICA occlusion. ","531":"The semi-jailing technique (SJT) provides stent-assisted remodeling of the aneurysm neck during coil embolization without grasping the coil delivery microcatheter. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of SJT using a Neuroform3 stent for coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. We collected the clinical and radiological data between January 2009 and June 2015 of the wide-necked aneurysms treated with SJT using a Neuroform3 stent. SJT using a Neuroform3 stent was attempted in 70 wide-necked aneurysms (68 patients). There were 56 unruptured and 14 ruptured aneurysms. The size of aneurysm ranged from 1.7 to 28.1 mm (mean 6.1 mm). The immediate angiographic results were complete occlusion in 55 aneurysms (78.6%), neck remnant in 7 (10.0%), and aneurysm remnant in 8 (11.4%). Overall, periprocedural complications occurred in 13 patients (19.1%), including asymptomatic thromboembolism in 7 (10.3%), symptomatic thromboembolism in 4 (5.9%), and symptomatic hemorrhagic complications in 2 (2.9%). Conventional angiography follow-up was obtained in 55 (78.6%) of 70 aneurysms (mean, 10.9 months). The result showed progressive occlusion in 7 aneurysms (12.7%) and recanalization in 1 aneurysm (1.8%). At the end of the observation period (mean, 17.5 months), all 54 patients without subarachnoid hemorrhage showed excellent clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0), except two (mRS 1 or 2) and seven of 14 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage remained symptom-free (mRS 0). In this report of 70 aneurysms, SJT using a Neuroform3 stent for coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms showed good technical safety, as well as favorable clinical and angiographic outcomes. ","532":"High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is recognized as an effective treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. However, the neurochemical basis of its effects remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of STN HFS in intact and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned hemiparkinsonian rat model on changes of principal neurotransmitters, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the striatum. The authors examined extracellular glutamate and GABA change in the striatum on sham group, 6-OHDA group, and 6-OHDA plus deep brain stimulation (DBS) group using microdialysis methods. High-pressure liquid chromatography was used to quantify glutamate and GABA. The results show that HFS-STN induces a significant increase of extracellular glutamate and GABA in the striatum of 6-OHDA plus DBS group compared with sham and 6-OHDA group. Therefore, the clinical results of STN-HFS are not restricted to the direct STN targets but involve widespread adaptive changes within the basal ganglia. ","533":"Autophagy is one of the key responses of cells to programmed cell death. Memantine, an approved anti-dementia drug, has an antiproliferative effect on cancer cells but the mechanism is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to test the possibility of induction of autophagic cell death by memantine in glioma cell lines. Glioma cell lines (T-98 G and U-251 MG) were used for this study. The antiproliferative effect of memantine was shown on T-98 G cells, which expressed N-methyl-D-aspartate 1 receptor (NMDAR1). Memantine increased the autophagic-related proteins as the conversion ratio of light chain protein 3-II (LC3-II)-\/LC3-I and the expression of beclin-1. Memantine also increased formation of autophagic vacuoles observed under a transmission electron microscope. Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down NMDAR1 in the glioma cells induced resistance to memantine and decreased the LC3-II\/LC3-I ratio in T-98 G cells. Our study demonstrates that in glioma cells, memantine inhibits proliferation and induces autophagy mediated by NMDAR1. ","534":"Lumbar degenerative kyphosis (LDK) is a subgroup of the flat-back syndrome and is most commonly caused by unique life styles, such as a prolonged crouched posture during agricultural work and performing activities of daily living on the floor. Unfortunately, LDK has been used as a byword for degenerative sagittal imbalance, and this sometimes causes confusion. The aim of this review was to evaluate the exact territory of LDK, and to introduce another appropriate term for degenerative sagittal deformity. Unlike what its name suggests, LDK does not only include sagittal balance disorder of the lumbar spine and kyphosis, but also sagittal balance disorder of the whole spine and little lordosis of the lumbar spine. Moreover, this disease is closely related to the occupation of female farmers and an outdated Asian life style. These reasons necessitate a change in the nomenclature of this disorder to prevent misunderstanding. We suggest the name \"primary degenerative sagittal imbalance\" (PDSI), which encompasses degenerative sagittal misalignments of unknown origin in the whole spine in older-age patients, and is associated with back muscle wasting. LDK may be regarded as a subgroup of PDSI related to an occupation in agriculture. Conservative treatments such as exercise and physiotherapy are recommended as first-line treatments for patients with PDSI, and surgical treatment is considered only if conservative treatments failed. The measurement of spinopelvic parameters for sagittal balance is important prior to deformity corrective surgery. LDK can be considered a subtype of PDSI that is more likely to occur in female farmers, and hence the use of LDK as a global term for all degenerative sagittal imbalance disorders is better avoided. To avoid confusion, we recommend PDSI as a newer, more accurate diagnostic term instead of LDK.","535":"Brain abscess commonly occurs secondary to an adjacent infection (mostly in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses) or due to hematogenous spread from a distant infection or trauma. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are abnormal direct communications between the pulmonary artery and vein. We present two cases of brain abscess associated with asymptomatic pulmonary AVF. A 65-year-old woman was admitted with a headache and cognitive impairment that aggravated 10 days prior. An magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a brain abscess with severe edema in the right frontal lobe. We performed a craniotomy and abscess removal. Bacteriological culture proved negative. Her chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple AVFs. Therapeutic embolization of multiple pulmonary AVFs was performed and antibiotics were administered for 8 weeks. A 45-year-old woman presented with a 7-day history of progressive left hemiparesis. She had no remarkable past medical history or family history. On admission, blood examination showed a white blood cell count of 6290 cells\/uL and a high sensitive C-reactive protein of 2.62 mg\/L. CT and MR imaging with MR spectroscopy revealed an enhancing lesion involving the right motor and sensory cortex with marked perilesional edema that suggested a brain abscess. A chest CT revealed a pulmonary AVF in the right upper lung. The pulmonary AVF was obliterated with embolization. There needs to consider pulmonary AVF as an etiology of cerebral abscess when routine investigations fail to detect a source.","536":"Craniopharyngiomas exhibiting histologic malignancy are extremely rare. Herein, we report the case of a 26-year-old male patient who underwent suprasellar mass excision via an interhemispheric transcallosal approach. Histopathological examination indicated that the craniopharyngioma was of the adamantinomatous subtype. The patient received postoperative medical treatment for endocrine dysfunction and diabetes mellitus without radiation treatment. Two years after the operation, he presented with progressive visual disturbance and altered mentality. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a huge mass in the suprasellar cistern and third ventricle. He underwent a second operation via the same approach. The histopathological examination showed an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma with sheets of solid proliferation in a spindled pattern, indicating malignant transformation. Malignant transformation of craniopharyngioma in the absence of radiation therapy has been reported in only five cases, including this one.

At 12 months, vertebral metastasis was suspected, and 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (FDG-PET\/CT) showed multiple extracranial metastases. She died at 13 months after surgery. Although extracranial metastases of PIMM are extremely rare, we should carefully follow up extracranial metastases together with intracranial ones, especially by FDG-PET\/CT, even at an early asymptomatic stage.","539":"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare, but are the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common sites of metastasis are liver and peritoneum, while bone metastasis is rare.

She underwent metastasectomy consisting of craniectomy with excision of the mass, and cranioplasty and continued treatment with imatinib and sunitinib, without evidence of cranial recurrence. She died of pneumonia sepsis one year after metastasectomy. Skull metastasis of GIST is a very rare presentation, and an aggressive multidisciplinary approach should be considered whenever possible.","540":"Infratentorial cerebral hemorrhage due to a direct carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is very rare. To our knowledge, only four such cases have been reported. Cerebellar hemorrhage due to a direct CCF has not been reported. We describe a 63-year-old female who presented with reduced consciousness 3 days after undergoing a maxillectomy for maxillary cancer. Computed tomography showed a cerebellar hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance angiography showed a left-sided direct CCF draining into the left petrosal and cerebellar veins through the left superior petrosal sinus (SPS). Her previous surgery had sacrificed the pterygoid plexus and facial vein. Increased blood flow and reduced drainage could have led to increased venous pressure in infratentorial veins, including the petrosal and cerebellar veins. The cavernous sinus has several drainage routes, but the SPS is one of the most important routes for infratentorial venous drainage. Stenosis or absence of the posterior segment of the SPS can also result in increased pressure in the cerebellar and pontine veins. We emphasize that a direct CCF with cortical venous reflux should be precisely evaluated to determine the hemodynamic status and venous drainage from the cavernous sinus.","541":null,"542":null,"543":null,"544":null,"545":"The Korean Resource Based Relative Value Scale (K-RBRVS) was introduced in 2001 as an alternative of the previous medical fee schedule.

We summarize the K-RBRVS in brief, and discuss on how the relative value (RV) of the spinal neurosurgical procedures have changed since the introduction in 2001. We analyzed the change of spinal procedure RVs since 2001, and compared it with the change of values in the brain neurosurgical procedures. RVs of 88 neurospinal procedures on the list of K-RBRVS were analyzed, while 24 procedures added during annual revisions were excluded. During the past 15 years, RVs for spinal procedures have increased 62.8%, which is not so different with the cumulative increase of consumer prices during this time period or the increase rate of 92.3% for brain surgeries. When comparing the change of RVs in more complex procedures between spinal and brain neurosurgery, the increase rate was 125.3% and 133%, respectively. More effort of the society of spinal surgeons seems to be needed to get adequate reimbursement, as there have been some discrimination compared to brain surgeons in the increase of RVs. And considering the relative underestimation of spinal neurosurgeons' labor, more objective measures of neurospinal surgeons' work and productivity should be developed for impartial reimbursement.

The 19 patients' intervertebral disc specimens obtained from the primary procedures and reoperations were evaluated. Expression of IL-6, TGF-1, IGF-1, and BAX were examined immunohistochemically in the 38 biopsy tissues obtained from the primary and recurrent herniated intervertebral discs during the operation. For IL-6 expression in the intervertebral disc specimens, there was no difference between the groups. The immunohistochemical study showed that the intervertebral disc specimens in the primary group were stained intensely by TGF-1 compared with the recurrent group. Expression of IGF-1 in the primary group was found moderate. In contrast, in the recurrent group of patients was mild expression of IGF-1. The primary group intervertebral disc specimens were stained moderately by BAX compared with the recurrent group.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 134 patients who underwent GKS for brain metastases due to NSCLC between January 2002 and December 2012. Representative biomarkers including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, K-ras mutation, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation status were investigated. The median overall survival after GKS was 22.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.8-35.1 months). During follow-up, 63 patients underwent salvage treatment after GKS. The median salvage treatment-free survival was 7.9 months (95% CI, 5.2-10.6 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that lower recursive partition analysis (RPA) class, small number of brain lesions, EGFR mutation (+), and ALK mutation (+) were independent positive prognostic factors associated with longer overall survival. Patients who received target agents 30 days after GKS experienced significant improvements in overall survival and salvage treatment-free survival than patients who never received target agents and patients who received target agents before GKS or within 30 days (median overall survival: 5.0 months vs. 18.2 months, and 48.0 months with p-value=0.026; median salvage treatment-free survival: 4.3 months vs. 6.1 months and 16.6 months with p-value=0.006, respectively). To assess the influence of target agents on the pattern of progression, cases that showed local recurrence and new lesion formation were analyzed according to target agents, but no significant effects were identified. The prognosis of patients with brain metastases of NSCLC after GKS significantly differed according to specific biomarkers (EGFR and ALK mutations). Our results show that target agents combined with GKS was related to significantly longer overall survival, and salvage treatment-free survival. However, target agents were not specifically associated with improved local control of the lesion treated by GKS either development of new lesions. Therefore, it seems that currently popular target agents do not affect brain lesions themselves, and can prolong survival by controlling systemic disease status.

However, no consensus has been reached on the optimal technique to discriminate tumor progression. We sought to investigate the role of magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) to evaluate tumor progression in glioma patients. An institutional retrospective review of glioma patients undergoing MRP with concurrent clinical follow up visit was performed. MRP was evaluated in its ability to predict tumor progression, defined clinically or radiographically, at concurrent clinical visit and at follow up visit. The data was then analyzed based on glioma grade and subtype. A total of 337 scans and associated clinical visits were reviewed from 64 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were reported for each tumor subtype and grade. The sensitivity and specificity for high-grade glioma were 60.8% and 87.8% respectively, compared to low-grade glioma which were 85.7% and 89.0% respectively. The value of MRP to assess future tumor progression within 90 days was 46.9% (sensitivity) and 85.0% (specificity). Based on our retrospective review, we concluded that adjunct imaging modalities such as MRP are necessary to help diagnose clinical disease progression. However, there is no clear role for stand-alone surveillance MRP imaging in glioma patients especially to predict future tumor progression. It is best used as an adjunctive measure in patients in whom progression is suspected either clinically or radiographically.

Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and his referring physician thought the likely diagnosis was spondylodiscitis at the L4-5 spinal segment with a small epidural abscess. At admission to our department, the patient reported aggravated low back pain. Blood test results, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, were slightly elevated. Biopsy samples of the L4, L5 vertebral bodies and disk were obtained. The material underwent aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, mycobacterial cultures and histologic examination. Results of all cultures were negative. Histologically, necrosis of the bone was evident from the number of empty osteocyte lacunae. In addition, there was no evidence of infection based on biopsy results. No antibiotic treatment was administered on discharge. Repeat computed tomography and MRI performed 12 months after IDET showed a bony defect in the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies, and a decrease in the size of the L4-5 intervertebral disc lesion.

Given that both the BRCA1 and NF-1 genes are located on the same long arm of chromosome 17, one would expect concurrence of neurofibromatosis and breast cancer. However, incidence of such co-disorders is very rare in the literature. Here, the authors report a case of a 50-year-old female patient with NF-1 and concurrent cancer of the left breast, who had a huge bilobulated intrathoracic meningocele with thoracic dystrophic scoliosis, treated surgically via a posterior-only approach for the meningocele and spinal deformity in the same setting.","556":"The device for intervertebral assisted motion (DIAM) is a dynamic implant that consists of a silicone bumper enveloped by a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber sack. Silicone and PET were used because of their biological inertness, but repetitive motion of the spine can cause wear on the implant nonetheless. The purpose of this study is to report a case of foreign body reaction (FBR) against a DIAM. A 72-year-old female patient presented with lower back pain and both legs radiating pain. She had undergone DIAM implantation at L4-5 for spinal stenosis 5 years previously. The intervertebral disc space of L4-5, where the DIAM was inserted, had collapsed and degenerative scoliosis had developed due to left-side collapse. MRI showed L3-4 thecal sac compression and left L4-5 foraminal stenosis. The patient underwent removal of the DIAM and instrumented fusion from L3 to L5. During surgery, fluid and granulation tissue were evident around the DIAM. Histopathology showed scattered wear debris from the DIAM causing chronic inflammation due to the resulting FBR. A FBR due to wear debris of a DIAM can induce a hypersensitivity reaction and bone resorption around the implant, causing it to loosen.","557":"Chordoid glioma of the third ventricle is a rare and challenging tumor to surgery because of its unique anatomical location and its close juxtaposition to the neurovascular structures and hypothalamus. The authors report a case of chordoid glioma of the third ventricle in a 43-year-old woman, who presented with headache and somnolence. The tumor was approached by endoscopic transnasal technique with a favorable result. Histopathologic examination disclosed a neoplastic tissue composed of eosinophilic epithelioid cells, mucinous, periodic acid Schiff-diastase positive, extracellular matrix, and scattered lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. The best treatment option remains controversial. Customarily, the surgical route to remove chordoid glioma is transcranial; however, the undersurface of the optic chiasm and optic nerves preclude an adequate surgical visualization. In contrast, an expanded endoscopic transnasal approach provides a direct midline corridor to this region without any brain retraction.","558":"Although many treatment modalities have been introduced for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), the long-term clinical results remain unsatisfactory. It has been particularly challenging to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for patients who have responded poorly to initial therapies. We analyzed the surgical outcomes in TN patients who failed prior treatments. We performed a retrospective analysis of 37 patients with recurrent or persistent TN symptoms who underwent surgery at our hospital between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients with follow-up data of at least one year were included. The prior treatment modalities of the 37 patients included microvascular decompression (MVD), gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), and percutaneous procedures such as radiofrequency rhizotomy (RFR), balloon compression, and glycerol rhizotomy (GR). The mean follow-up period was 69.9 months (range : 16-173). The mean interval between the prior treatment and second surgery was 26 months (range : 7-123). We evaluated the surgical outcomes using the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity scale. Among the 37 recurrent or persistent TN patients, 22 underwent MVD with partial sensory rhizotomy (PSR), 8 received MVD alone, and 7 had PSR alone. Monitoring of the surgical treatment outcomes via the BNI pain intensity scale revealed 8 (21.6%) patients with a score of I, 13 (35.1%) scoring II, 13 (35.1%) scoring III, and 3 (8.2%) scoring IV at the end of the follow-up period. Overall, 91.8% of patients had good surgical outcomes. With regard to postoperative complications, 1 patient had transient cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (2.7%), another had a subdural hematoma (2.7%), and facial sensory changes were noted in 8 (21.1%) patients after surgery. Surgical interventions, such as MVD and PSR, are safe and very effective treatment modalities in TN patients who failed initial or prior treatments. We presume that the combination of MVD with PSR enabled us to obtain good short- and long-term surgical outcomes. Therefore, aggressive surgical treatment should be considered in patients with recurrent TN despite failure of various treatment modalities. ","559":"Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is common condition in neurosurgical field. It is difficult to select the treatment modality between the surgical method and the conservative method when patients have no or mild symptoms. The purpose of this study is to provide a suggestion that the patients could be cured with conservative treatment modality. We enrolled 16 patients who had received conservative treatment for cSDH without special medications which could affect hematoma resolution such as mannitol, steroids, tranexamic acid and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The patients were classified according to the Markwalder's Grading Scale. Among these 16 patients, 13 (81.3%) patients showed spontaneously resolved cSDH and 3 (18.7%) patients received surgery due to symptom aggravation and growing hematoma. They were categorized into two groups based on whether they were cured with conservative treatment or not. The first group was the spontaneous resolution group. The second group was the progression-surgery group. The mean hematoma volume in the spontaneous resolution group was 43.1 mL. The mean degree of midline shift in the spontaneous resolution group was 5.3 mm. The mean hematoma volume in the progression-surgery group was 62.0 mL. The mean degree of midline shift in the second group was 6 mm. We suggest that the treatment modality should be determined according to the patient's symptoms and clinical condition and close observation could be performed in patients who do not have any symptoms or in patients who have mild to moderate headache without neurological deterioration. ","560":"Although a high incidence of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) following traumatic subdural hygroma (SDG) has been reported, no study has evaluated risk factors for the development of CSDH. Therefore, we analyzed the risk factors contributing to formation of CSDH in patients with traumatic SDG. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to Hallym University Hospital with traumatic head injury from January 2004 through December 2013. A total of 45 patients with these injuries in which traumatic SDG developed during the follow-up period were analyzed. All patients were divided into two groups based on the development of CSDH, and the associations between the development of CSDH and independent variables were investigated. Thirty-one patients suffered from bilateral SDG, whereas 14 had unilateral SDG. Follow-up computed tomography scans revealed regression of SDG in 25 of 45 patients (55.6%), but the remaining 20 patients (44.4%) suffered from transition to CSDH. Eight patients developed bilateral CSDH, and 12 patients developed unilateral CSDH. Hemorrhage-free survival rates were significantly lower in the male and bilateral SDG group (log-rank test; p=0.043 and p=0.013, respectively). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed male (OR, 7.68; 95% CI 1.18-49.78; p=0.033) and bilateral SDG (OR, 8.04; 95% CI 1.41-45.7; p=0.019) were significant risk factors for development of CSDH. The potential to evolve into CSDH should be considered in patients with traumatic SDG, particularly male patients with bilateral SDG.

From January 2006 to July 2014, 79 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament underwent cervical laminoplasty. The radiologic parameters were obtained from plain radiography and three-dimensional computed tomography. All images were taken before and after surgery. Cervical lordosis, spinal canal dimension, fusion between lamina and spacer, and resorption of spacer were checked. Clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analog scale and Japanese Orthopedic Association. Double-door laminoplasty was performed on 280 levels : 182 in the HA group and 98 in the AB group. The mean follow-up was 23.1 months (range : 4-69 months). Similar fusion rates were found in these groups (p=0.3). The resorption rate between lamina and spacer was lower in the HA group (p&lt;0.001). During the immediate postoperative period, the canal dimension of both groups increased compared with the results in the preoperative period. However, the canal dimension of the AB group decreased over time compared with that of the HA group (p&lt;0.001). Double-door laminoplasty improved the clinical outcomes of both groups. However, the spinal canal dimension in the AB group showed a greater degree of reduction than in the HA group at the final postoperative follow-up. Therefore, we suggest that surgeons consider the use of larger-sized AB spacers in double-door laminoplasties. ","564":"Perioperative irradiation is often combined with spine tumor surgery. Radiation is known to be detrimental to healing process of bone fusion. We tried to investigate bone fusion rate in spine tumor surgery cases with perioperative radiation therapy (RT) and to analyze significant factors affecting successful bone fusion. Study cohort was 33 patients who underwent spinal tumor resection and bone graft surgery combined with perioperative RT. Their medical records and radiological data were analyzed retrospectively. The analyzed factors were surgical approach, location of bone graft (anterior vs. posterior), kind of graft (autologous graft vs. allograft), timing of RT (preoperative vs. postoperative), interval of RT from operation in cases of postoperative RT (within 1 month vs. after 1 month) radiation dose (above 38 Gy vs. below 38 Gy) and type of radiation therapy (conventional RT vs. stereotactic radiosurgery). The bone fusion was determined on computed tomography images. Bone fusion was identified in 19 cases (57%). The only significant factors to affect bony fusion was the kind of graft (75% in autograft vs. 41 in allograft, p=0.049). Other factors proved to be insignificant relating to postoperative bone fusion. Regarding time interval of RT and operation in cases of postoperative RT, the time interval was not significant (p=0.101). Spinal fusion surgery which was combined with perioperative RT showed relatively low bone fusion rate (57%). For successful bone fusion, the selection of bone graft was the most important.

Sclerosing meningioma is often misdiagnosed to other non-benign meningioma or malignant neoplasm, so it is important to diagnose sclerosing type correctly. We analyzed the radiological and clinical characteristics of a series of sclerosing meningiomas. Twenty-one patients who underwent surgery in one institute with a histopathologically proven sclerosing meningioma were included from 2006 to 2014. Eighteen tumors were diagnosed as a pure sclerosing-type meningioma, and 3 as mixed type. Magnetic resonance image was taken for all patients including contrast enhancement image. Computed tomography (CT) scan was taken for 16 patients. One neuroradiologist and 1 neurosurgeon reviewed all images retrospectively. In the all 16 patients with preoperative CT images, higher attenuation was observed in the meningioma than in the brain parenchyma, and calcification was observed in 11 (69%). In 15 of the 21 patients (71%), a distinctive very low signal intensity appeared as a dark color in T2-weighted images. Nine of these 15 tumors (60%) exhibited heterogeneous enhancement, and 6 (40%) exhibited homogeneous enhancement that was unlike the homogeneous enhancing pattern shown by conventional meningiomas. Ten patients had a clear tumor margin without peritumoral edema. Although these peculiar radiological characteristics are not unique to sclerosing meningioma, we believe that they are distinctive features that may be helpful for distinguishing sclerosing meningioma from other subtypes. ","567":"The inter-rater reliability of the modified Knosp's classification was measured before the analysis. The clinical validity of the parasellar extension grading system was evaluated by investigating the extents of resection and complication rates among the grades in the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) for pituitary adenomas. From November 2008 to August 2015, of the 286 patients who underwent EETS by the senior author, 208 were pituitary adenoma cases (146 non-functioning pituitary adenomas, 10 adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenomas, 31 growth hormone-secreting adenomas, 17 prolactin-secreting adenomas, and 4 thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting adenomas; 23 microadenomas, 174 macroadenomas, and 11 giant adenomas). Two neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist independently measured the degree of parasellar extension on the preoperative sellar MRI according to the modified Knosp's classification. Inter-rater reliability was statistically assessed by measuring the intraclass correlation coefficient. The extents of resection were evaluated by comparison of the pre- and post-operative MR images; the neurovascular complications were assessed by reviewing the patients' medical records. The extent of resection was measured in each parasellar extension grade; thereafter, their statistical differences were calculated. The intraclass correlation coefficient value of reliability across the three raters amounted to 0.862. The gross total removal (GTR) rates achieved in each grade were 70.0, 69.8, 62.9, 21.4, 37.5, and 4.3% in Grades 0, 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4, respectively. A significant difference in the extent of resection was observed only between Grades 2 and 3A. In addition, significantly higher complication rates were observed in the groups above Grade 3A. Although the modified Knosp's classification system appears to be complex, its inter-rater reliability proves to be excellent. Regarding the clinical validity of the parasellar extension grading system, Grades 3A, 3B, and 4 have a negative predictive value for the GTR rate, with higher complication rates. ","568":"Elevated cell counts and protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) result from disease activity in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC). Previous studies evaluated the use of CSF profiles to monitor a treatment response or predict prognosis. CSF profiles vary, however, according to the sampling site and the patient's systemic condition. We compared lumbar and ventricular CSF profiles collected before intraventricular chemotherapy for LMC and evaluated the association of these profiles with patients' systemic factors and LMC disease activity. CSF profiles were retrospectively collected from 228 patients who underwent Ommaya reservoir insertion for intraventricular chemotherapy after a diagnosis of LMC. Lumbar samples taken via lumbar puncture were used for the diagnosis, and ventricular samples were obtained later at the time of Ommaya reservoir insertion. LMC disease activity was defined as the presence of LMC-related symptoms such as increased intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, cranial neuropathy, and cauda equina syndrome. Cell counts (median : 8 vs. 1 cells\/mL) and protein levels (median : 68 vs. 17 mg\/dL) significantly higher in lumbar CSF than in ventricular CSF (p&lt;0.001). Among the evaluated systemic factors, concomitant brain metastasis and previous radiation were significantly correlated with higher protein levels in the lumbar CSF (p=0.01 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Among the LMC disease activity, patients presenting with hydrocephalus or cauda equina syndrome showed higher lumbar CSF protein level compared with that in patients without those symptoms (p=0.049 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). The lumbar CSF cell count was significantly lower in patients with cranial neuropathy (p=0.046). The ventricular CSF cell counts and protein levels showed no correlation with LMC symptoms. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which was measured from ventricular CSF after the diagnosis in 109 patients, showed a significant association with the presence of hydrocephalus (p=0.01). The protein level in lumbar CSF indicated the localized disease activity of hydrocephalus and cauda equina syndrome. In the ventricular CSF, only the CEA level reflected the presence of hydrocephalus.

Identification of genes related to motility is important for understanding the molecular biological behavior of invasive gliomas. According to our previous studies, Metallothionein 1E (MT1E) was identified to enhance migration of human malignant glioma cells. The purpose of this study was to confirm that MT1E could modulate glioma invasion in vivo. Firstly we established 2 cell lines; MTS23, overexpressed by MT1E complementary DNA construct and pV12 as control. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, -9 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 were increased in MTS23 compared with pV12. Furthermore it was confirmed that MT1E could modulate MMPs secretion and translocation of NFkB p50 and B-cell lymphoma-3 through small interfering ribonucleic acid knocked U87MG cells. Then MTS23 and pV12 were injected into intracranial region of 5 week old male nude mouse. After 4 weeks, for brain tissues of these two groups, histological analysis, and immunohistochemical stain of MMP-2, 9 and Nestin were performed. As results, the group injected with MTS23 showed irregular margin and tumor cells infiltrating the surrounding normal brain, while that of pV12 (control) had round and clear margin. And regrowth of tumor cells in MTS23 group was observed in another site apart from tumor cell inoculation. MT1E could enhance tumor proliferation and invasion of malignant glioma through regulation of activation and expression of MMPs.","572":"Cerebral endothelial cells have unique biological features and are fascinating candidate cells for stroke therapy. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of human cerebral endothelial cell (hCMEC\/D3) transplantation in a rat stroke model, we performed proteomic analysis using 2-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Protein expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Several protein spots were identified by gel electrophoresis in the sham, cerebral ischemia (CI), and CI with hCMEC\/D3 treatment cerebral ischemia with cell transplantation (CT) groups, and we identified 14 differentially expressed proteins in the CT group. Proteins involved in mitochondrial dysfunction (paraplegin matrix AAA peptidase subunit, SPG7), neuroinflammation (peroxiredoxin 6, PRDX6), and neuronal death (zinc finger protein 90, ZFP90) were markedly reduced in the CT group compared with the CI group. The expression of chloride intracellular channel 4 proteins involved in post-ischemic vasculogenesis was significantly decreased in the CI group but comparable to sham in the CT group. These results contribute to our understanding of the early phase processes that follow cerebral endothelial cell treatment in CI. Moreover, some of the identified proteins may present promising new targets for stroke therapy.

Several treatments, including bed rest, medication, and numerous nerve blocks were attempted, but the pain persisted. We finally tried injection of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) solution at the left L5 transverse process fracture site because we knew of the anti-inflammatory effect of PDRN. One day after this treatment, her symptoms had almost disappeared and three days later, she was discharged.

We report the case of a patient whose optic nerve was penetrated by a tuberculum sellae meningioma. During surgery, a bulging tumor was found to penetrate the right optic nerve. The tumor was gross totally removed, including tumors bulging through the optic nerve. Two trunks of the split optic nerve were preserved. The penetrated shape of the optic nerve may lead to misjudgment and its damage. Divided trunks of optic nerves are difficult to recognize and may be confused for the tumor capsule, because they may be thinned and seem to contain tumors. In addition, a single trunk may be confused for the whole nerve; thus, the other trunk may be easily damaged if not dissected cautiously.

A 55-year old woman was admitted due to left medullary infarction, and angiography showed a fusiform dilatation in the left vertebral artery that was suspicious for dissecting aneurysm. Endovascular treatment with PED was planned. Under general anesthesia, the procedure was performed without significant problems and a PED was deployed in an appropriate position.

The radiologic data, intra-operative findings with detailed introduction of the procedure, and the clinical outcomes of each patient were reviewed and analyzed. The 42 patients included in the analysis consisted of 22 females and 20 males, with an average follow-up duration of 76 months (range 24-132 months). Intraoperative investigation revealed that an artery other than the VA was responsible for the neurovascular compression in all cases : posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in 23 patients (54.7%) and anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) in 11 patients (26.2%). All patients became symptom-free after MVD. Neither recurrence nor postoperative neurological deficit was noted during the 2-year follow-up, except in one patient who developed permanent deafness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in three patients, and one required dural repair. Transposition of the VA using a bioglue-coated Teflon sling is a safe and effective surgical technique for HFS involving the VA.

The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors associated with recurrence of SDH that requires burr hole surgery in the late subacute or chronic stage. We also identified the appropriate timing of surgery for reducing the recurrence. We retrospectively reviewed 274 patients with SDH in the late subacute or chronic stage treated with burr hole surgery in our hospital between January 2007 and December 2014. Excluding patients with acute intracranial complications or unknown time of trauma onset left 216 patients included in the study. Of 216 patients with SDH in the late subacute or chronic stage, recurrence was observed in 36 patients (16.7%).

Otherwise, no significant risk factors were associated with recurrences including comorbidities and surgical details. The results indicated that time from trauma onset to burr hole surgery may be important for decreasing the risk of recurrence.

From 2010 to 2014, we analyzed the data of 2617 patients registered in the KNTDBS. The demographic characteristics of patients with TBI were investigated. We divided patients into 2 groups, survivors and nonsurvivors, and compared variables between the groups to investigate variables that are related to death after TBI. We also analyzed variables related to the interval between TBI and death, mortality by region, and cause of death in the nonsurvivor group. The frequency of TBI in men was higher than that in women. With increasing age of the patients, the incidence of TBI also increased. Among 2617 patients, 688 patients (26.2%) underwent surgical treatment and 125 patients (4.7%) died. The age distributions of survivors vs. nonsurvivor groups and mortality rates according the severity of the brain injury, surgical treatment, and initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were statistically significantly different. Among 125 hospitalized nonsurvivors, 70 patients (56%) died within 7 days and direct brain damage was the most common cause of death (80.8%). The time interval from TBI to death differed depending on the diagnosis, surgical or nonsurgical treatment, severity of brain injury, initial GCS score, and cause of death, and this difference was statistically significant.

Two groups of patients with single level LDH (L4-5) requiring treatment were retrospectively studied. The surgery group (SG) included 34 patients, and 30 patients who initially refused the surgery were included in the nerve blocks group (NG). A visual analogue scale (VAS) for leg and back pain and motor deficit were initially evaluated before procedures, and repeated at 1, 6, and 12 months. Radiological factors including the disc herniation length, disc herniation area, canal length-occupying ratio, and canal area-occupying ratio were measured and compared. Predicting factors of successful outcomes were determined with multivariate logistic regression analysis after the optimal cut off values were established with a receiver operating characteristic curve. There was no significant demographic difference between two groups. A multivariate logistic regression analysis with radiological and clinical (12 months follow-up) data revealed that the high disc herniation length with cutoff value 6.31 mm [odds ratio (OR) 2.35; confidence interval (CI) 1.21-3.98] was a predictor of successful outcomes of leg pain relief in the SG. The low disc herniation length with cutoff value 6.23 mm (OR 0.05; CI 0.003-0.89) and high baseline VAS leg (OR 12.63; CI 1.64-97.45) were identified as predictors of successful outcomes of leg pain relief in the NG. The patients with the disc herniation length larger than 6.31 mm showed successful outcomes with surgery whereas the patients with the disc herniation length less than 6.23 mm showed successful outcomes with nerve block.

Radiological parameters (C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, SVA; C2-7 Cobb angle; C2-7 range of motion, ROM; OPLL occupying ratio; and compression angle) were compared. Compression angle of OPLL was defined as the angle between the cranial and caudal surfaces of OPLL at the maximum level of cord compression. The occupying ratio of the spinal canal, C2-7 Cobb angle, C2-7 SVA, types of OPLL, and C2-7 ROM of the cervical spine were not statistically different between the two groups. However, the OPLL compression angle was significantly greater (p=0.003) in the severe myelopathy group than in the mild myelopathy group and was inversely correlated with JOA score (r=-0.533, p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the compression angle (B=-0.069, p&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with JOA scores (R=0.647, p&lt;0.005).

Of the 38 craniopharyngiomas, 30 were adamantinomatous type and 8 were papillary type. On CT scans, calcification was present in 25 of 38 tumors. All calcified tumors were adamantinomatous type. Twenty four of 38 tumors had bright signal intensity on T1 weighted images. Of these 24 tumors, 22 (91.7%) were adamantinomatous and 2 were papillary type. Cystic change on T2 weighted images was noted in 37 of 38 tumors; only 1 tumor with papillary type did not show cystic change. T1 bright signal intensity and calcification on CT scans uniformly favor the adamantinomatous type over papillary type of craniopharyngioma in children.

Thrombosed lumbar epidural varices may mimic lumbar disc herniations both radiologically and clinically. Therefore, must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of lumbar disc herniations. Microsurgical techniques are mandatory for the treatment of these pathologies and decompression with thermocoagulation and excision is an efficient method. ","596":"Meningiomas are typically diagnosed by their characteristic appearance on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, detailed image findings regarding peri- and intra-tumoral anatomical structures, tumor consistency and vascularity are very important in pre-surgical planning and surgical outcomes. At the 7.0 T MRI achieving ultra-high resolution, it could be possible to obtain more useful information in surgical strategy. Four patients who were radiologically diagnosed with intracranial meningioma in 1.5 T MRI underwent a 7.0 T MRI. Three of them underwent surgery afterwards, and one received gamma knife radiosurgery. In our study, the advantages of 7.0 T MRI over 1.5 T MRI were a more detailed depiction of the peri- and intra-tumoral vasculature and a clear delineation of tumor-brain interface. In the safety issues, all patients received 7.0 T MRI without any adverse event. One disadvantage of 7.0 T MRI was the reduced image quality of skull base lesions. 7.0 T MRI in patients with meningiomas could provide useful information in surgical strategy, such as the peri-tumoral vasculature and the tumor-brain interface. ","597":"We report a case of acute ischemic stroke involving both the anterior and posterior circulation associated with a persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA), treated by endovascular revascularization for acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion via the PPTA. An otherwise healthy 67-year-old man experienced sudden loss of consciousness and quadriplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an extensive acute infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere, and magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and BA. Because the volume of infarction in the territory of the right MCA was extensive, we judged the use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator to be contraindicated. Cerebral angiography revealed hypoplasia of both vertebral arteries and the presence of a PPTA from the right internal carotid artery. A microcatheter was introduced into the BA via the PPTA and revascularization was successfully performed using a Merci Retriever with adjuvant low-dose intraarterial urokinase. After treatment, his consciousness level and right motor weakness improved. Although persistent carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomoses such as a PPTA are relatively rare vascular anomalies, if the persistent primitive artery is present, it can be an access route for mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke. ","598":"Brain metastases in gynecologic cancer (ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer) patients are rare, and the efficacy of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) to treat these had not been evaluated. We assessed the efficacy of GKRS and prognostic factors for tumor control and survival in brain metastasis from gynecologic cancers. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. From May 1995 to October 2012, 26 women (mean age 51.3 years, range 27-70 years) with metastatic brain tumors from gynecologic cancer were treated with GKRS. We reviewed their outcomes, radiological responses, and clinical status. In total 24 patients (59 lesions) were available for follow-up imaging. The median follow-up time was 9 months. The mean treated tumor volume at the time of GKRS was 8185 mm(3) (range 10-19500 mm(3)), and the median dose delivered to the tumor margin was 25 Gy (range, 10-30 Gy). A local tumor control rate was 89.8% (53 of 59 tumors). The median overall survival was 9.5 months after GKRS (range, 1-102 months). Age-associated multivariate analysis indicated that the Karnofsky performance status (KPS), the recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification, and the number of treated lesions were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (HR=0.162, p=0.008, HR=0.107, p=0.038, and HR=2.897, p=0.045, respectively). GKRS is safe and effective for the management of brain metastasis from gynecologic cancers. The clinical status of the patient is important in determining the overall survival time. ","599":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term follow-up radiologic\/clinical outcomes of patients who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and inter-body fusion (ACDF) with stand-alone cages (SAC) in a single academic institution. Total 99 patients who underwent ACDF with SAC between February 2004 and December 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. A total of 131 segments were enrolled in this study. Basic demographic information, radiographic [segmental subsidence rate, fusion rate, C2-7 global angle, and segmental angle changes)\/clinical outcomes (by Odom's criteria and visual analog score (VAS)] and complications were evaluated to determine the long-term outcomes. The majority were males (55 vs. 44) with average age of 53.2. Mean follow-up period was 62.9 months. The segmental subsidence rate was 53.4% and fusion rate was 73.3%. In the subsidence group, anterior intervertebral height (AIH) had more tendency of subsiding than middle or posterior intervertebral height (p=0.01). The segmental angle led kyphotic change related to the subsidence of the AIH. Adjacent segmental disease was occurred in 18 (18.2%) patients. Total 6 (6%) reoperations were performed at the index level. There was no statistical significance between clinical and radiological outcomes. But, overall long-term clinical outcome by Odom's criteria was unsatisfactory (64.64%). The neck and arm VAS score were increased by over time. Long-term outcomes of ACDF with SAC group were acceptable but not satisfactory. For optimal decision making, more additional comparative long-term outcome data is needed between ACDF with SAC and ACDF with plating. ","600":"Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is often complicated by difficult revascularization and non-involved territory embolization possibly related with larger clot-burden. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of proximal aspiration thrombectomy (PAT) using a balloon-tipped guide catheter for clot-burden reduction in such cases with period-to-period analysis (period 1 : standard MT without PAT; period 2 : PAT first, then standard MT for the remaining occlusion). Eighty-six patients who underwent MT for acute intracranial ICA occlusion were included in this analysis from the prospectively maintained stroke registry (33 patients in period 1 and 53 in period 2). In period 2, 'responder' was defined as a case where some amount of clot was retrieved by PAT and the following angiography showed partial or full recanalization. Fifteen of fifty-three patients in period 2 (28.3%) were 'responders' to PAT. There was a significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation in the 'responder' subgroup. Period 2 showed a significantly shorter puncture-to-reperfusion time (94.5 minutes vs. 56.0 minutes; p=0.002), a significantly higher Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction of 2b-3 reperfusion (45.5% vs. 73.6%; p=0.009), but only a trend for better 3-month favorable outcome (mRS 0-2; 36.4% vs. 54.7%; p=0.097). There was no increase in the incidence of procedure-related complications or intracranial hemorrhage in period 2. A strategy of PAT before standard MT may result in shorter puncture-to-reperfusion time and better angiographic outcome than a strategy of standard MT for acute intracranial ICA occlusion. ","601":null,"602":"Delayed hinge fracture (HF) that develops after cervical open door laminoplasty can be a source of postoperative complications such as axial pain. However, risk factors related to this complication remain unclear. We performed a retrospective clinical series to determine risk factors for delayed HF following plate-only open-door cervical laminoplasty. Patients who underwent plate-only open-door laminoplasty and had available postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans (80 patients with 270 laminae) were enrolled. Hinge status, hinge gutter location, open location, hinge width, number of screws used, operation level, and open angle were observed in the CT to determine radiographic outcome. Demographic data were collected as well. Radiographic and clinical parameters were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the risk factors for HF. Univariate logistic regression analysis results indicated poor initial hinge status, medially placed hinge gutter, double screw fixation on the elevated lamina, upper surgical level, and wide open angle as predictors for HF (p&lt;0.05). Initial hinge status seemed to be the most powerful risk factor for HF (p=0.000) and thus was collinear with other variables. Therefore, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed excluding initial hinge status, and the results indicated that medially placed hinge gutter, double screw fixation on the elevated lamina, and upper surgical level were risk factors for HF after adjustment for other confounding factors. To prevent HF and to draw a successful postoperative outcome after cervical laminoplasty, surgical and clinical precautions should be considered. ","603":"To compare the fusion rate of a hydroxyapatite demineralized bone matrix (DBM) with post-laminectomy acquired autograft in lumbar interbody fusion surgery and to evaluate the correlation between fusion rate and clinical outcome. From January 2013 to April 2014, 98 patients underwent lumbar interbody fusion surgery with hydroxyapatite DBM (HA-DBM group) in our institute. Of those patients, 65 received complete CT scans for 12 months postoperatively in order to evaluate fusion status. For comparison with autograft, we selected another 65 patients who underwent lumbar interbody fusion surgery with post-laminectomy acquired autograft (Autograft group) during the same period. Both fusion material groups were matched in terms of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and bone mineral density (BMD). To evaluate the clinical outcomes, we analyzed the results of visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). We reviewed the CT scans of 149 fusion levels in 130 patients (HA-DBM group, 75 levels\/65 patients; Autograft group, 74 levels\/65 patients). Age, sex, BMI, and BMD were not significantly different between the groups (p=0.528, p=0.848, p=0.527, and p=0.610, respectively). The HA-DBM group showed 39 of 75 fused levels (52%), and the Autograft group showed 46 of 74 fused levels (62.2%). This difference was not statistically significant (p=0.21). In the HA-DBM group, older age and low BMD were significantly associated with non-fusion (61.24 vs. 66.68, p=0.027; -1.63 vs. -2.29, p=0.015, respectively). VAS and ODI showed significant improvement after surgery when fusion was successfully achieved in both groups (p=0.004, p=0.002, HA-DBM group; p=0.012, p=0.03, Autograft group). The fusion rates of the hydroxyapatite DBM and Autograft groups were not significantly different. In addition, clinical outcomes were similar between the groups.

","613":"Posterior fossa is a site next to the middle fossa where arachnoid cyst frequently occurs. Generally, most arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic and are found incidentally in most cases. Although arachnoid cysts are benign and asymptomatic lesions, patients with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts often complain of headaches, gait disturbance, and ataxia due to the local mass effects on the cerebellum. We observed a patient with a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst who had visual symptoms and a headache, but did not have gait disturbance and ataxia. We recommended an emergency operation for decompression, but the patient refused for personal reasons. After 7 days, the patient revisited our hospital in a state of near-blindness. We suspected that the arachnoid cyst induced the hydrocephalus and thereby the enlarged third ventricle directly compressed optic nerves. Compressed optic nerves were rapidly aggravated during the critical seven days; consequently, the patient's vision was damaged despite the operation. Considering the results of our case, it is important to keep in mind that the aggravation of symptoms cannot be predicted; therefore, symptomatic arachnoid cysts should be treated without undue delay. ","614":"Intracranial tuberculous subdural empyema (ITSE) is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only four cases of microbiologically confirmed ITSE have been reported in the English literature to date. Most cases have arisen in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis regardless of trauma. A 46-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a fall. On arrival, he complained of pain in his head, face, chest and left arm. He was alert and oriented. An initial neurological examination was normal. Radiologic evaluation revealed multiple fractures of his skull, ribs, left scapula and radius. Though he had suffered extensive skull fractures of his cranium, maxilla, zygoma and orbital wall, the sustained cerebral contusion and hemorrhage were mild. Eighteen days later, he suddenly experienced a general tonic-clonic seizure. Radiologic evaluation revealed a subdural empyema in the left occipital area that was not present on admission. We performed a craniotomy, and the empyema was completely removed. Microbiological examination identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). After eighteen months of anti-tuberculous treatment, the empyema disappeared completely. This case demonstrates that tuberculosis can induce empyema in patients with skull fractures. Thus, we recommend that M. tuberculosis should be considered as the probable pathogen in cases with posttraumatic empyema.

Two patients (patient 1 and patient 2) with ICH and six age-matched control patients who have ICH on the left corona radiata and basal ganglia without subfalcine herniation were recruited for this study. DTT was performed at one month after onset in patient 1 and patient 2. AFs of both hemispheres in both patients were disrupted between Wernicke's and Broca's areas. The fractional anisotropy value and tract numbers of the right AFs in both patients were found to be more than two standard deviations lower than those of control patients. In contrast, the apparent diffusion coefficient value was more than two standard deviations higher than those of control patients. Using the configuration and parameters of DTT, we confirmed injury of the AF in the nondominant hemisphere in two patients with subfalcine herniation following ICH in the dominant hemisphere. Therefore, DTT would be a useful tool for detection of underlying injury of the AF in the nondominant hemisphere in patients with subfalcine herniation.

The exact biological behavior of the tumor is not fully understood. Therefore, it is not listed as a distinct entity in the current World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors. Here, we describe a rare case of gliofibroma, which was located on the medial temporal lobe in a 61-year-old woman. Preoperatively, we misdiagnosed it as a meningioma because it was a well-demarcated and well-enhanced extra-axial mass with calcification and bony destruction. On the histopathological and immunohistochemical examination, the tumor consisted of a mixture of glial tissue and mesenchymal tissue and it was finally diagnosed as a gliofibroma.

Angiography revealed AVF between the occipital artery and the transverse sinus. The second, a 2 years old female child, complained of left exophthalmos. Imaging studies showed bilateral direct AVFs of the transverse sinus with bilateral dysmaturation of the sigmoid sinus. Transarterial embolization was done in both cases. Clinical and radiological follow up revealed complete cure.This report suggests that DAVF of the transverse sinus supplied by the external carotid branches can present with ophthalmic manifestations especially if there is distal venous stenosis or obliteration involving sigmoid sinus.

Many neurosurgeons are unfamiliar with the obturator nerve anatomy. The purpose of this study was to define obturator nerve landmarks around the obturator foramen. Fourteen cadavers were studied bilaterally to measure the distances from the nerve root to relevant anatomical landmarks near the obturator nerve, including the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), the pubic tubercle, the inguinal ligament, the femoral artery, and the adductor longus. The obturator nerve exits the obturator foramen and travels infero-medially between the adductors longus and brevis. The median distances from the obturator nerve exit zone (ONEZ) to the ASIS and pubic tubercle were 114 mm and 30 mm, respectively. The median horizontal and vertical distances between the pubic tubercle and the ONEZ were 17 mm and 27 mm, respectively. The shortest median distance from the ONEZ to the inguinal ligament was 19 mm. The median inguinal ligament lengths from the ASIS and the median pubic tubercle to the shortest point were 103 mm and 24 mm, respectively. The median obturator nerve lengths between the ONEZ and the adductor longus and femoral artery were 41 mm and 28 mm, respectively. The obturator nerve exits the foramen 17 mm and 27 mm on the horizontal and sagittal planes, respectively, from the pubic tubercle below the pectineus muscle.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the correlation between trunk muscles cross sectional area (MCSA) and fusion rate after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using stand-alone cages. A total of 89 adult patients with degenerative lumbar disease who were performed PLIF using stand-alone cages at L4-5 were included in this study. The cross-sectional area of the psoas major (PS), erector spinae (ES), and multifidus (MF) muscles were quantitatively evaluated by preoperative lumbar magnetic resonance imaging at the L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 segments, and bone union was evaluated by dynamic lumbar X-rays. Of the 89 patients, 68 had bone union and 21 did not. The MCSAs at all segments in both groups were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) for the PS muscle, those at L3-4 and L4-5 segments between groups were significantly different (p=0.048, 0.021) for the ES and MF muscles. In the multivariate analysis, differences in the PS MCSA at the L4-5 and L5-S1 segments remained significant (p=0.048, 0.043 and odds ratio=1.098, 1.169). In comparison analysis between male and female patients, most MCSAs of male patients were larger than female's. Fusion rates of male patients (80.7%) were higher than female's (68.8%), too. For PLIF surgery, PS muscle function appears to be an important factor for bone union and preventing back muscle injury is essential for better fusion rate. ","622":"Although middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms are less amenable to coil embolization, an increasing number of studies support favorable endovascular treatment for them. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of two different treatments (surgery versus coiling) and evaluate the benefits of surgical clipping for MCA aneurysms. Here we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 178 ruptured and unruptured MCA aneurysms treated in patients between September 2008 and April 2012. Parameters assessing treatment outcomes include degree of aneurysm occlusion, presence of regrowth, clinical status, and complications. Among 178 MCA aneurysms, 153 were treated surgically. After a mean follow-up of 12 months, the surgery group showed a clinically significant complete occlusion rate (98%) compared with the coiling group (56%) (p&lt;0.001). Follow-up radiologic evaluation showed a higher regrowth rate (four of 16 cases) in the coiling group than in the surgery group (one of 49 cases) (p=0.003). There was no statistically significant difference in favorable clinical outcome rate between the two groups. The procedure-related permanent morbidity and mortality rates were 2% (three of 153 cases) in the surgery group and 0% (0 of 25 cases) in the coiling group. Compared to endovascular treatment, surgical neck clipping for both ruptured and unruptured MCA aneurysms results in a significantly higher complete obliteration rate and less regrowth. Therefore, even in this endovascular era, we still recommend surgical clipping as the primary treatment option for MCA aneurysms rather than coil embolization. ","623":"Accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) and mitochondrial glycation is importantly implicated in the pathological changes of the brain associated with diabetic complications, Alzheimer disease, and aging. The present study was undertaken to determine whether sildenafil, a type 5 phosphodiesterase type (PDE-5) inhibitor, has beneficial effect on neuronal cells challenged with AGE-induced oxidative stress to preserve their mitochondrial functional integrity. HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells were exposed to AGE and changes in the mitochondrial functional parameters were determined. Pretreatment of cells with sildenafil effectively ameliorated these AGE-induced deterioration of mitochondrial functional integrity. AGE-treated cells lost their mitochondrial functional integrity which was estimated by their MTT reduction ability and intracellular ATP concentration. These cells exhibited stimulated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of mitochondrial permeability transition, and release of the cytochrome C, activation of the caspase-3 accompanied by apoptosis. Western blot analyses and qRT-PCR demonstrated that sildenafil increased the expression level of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). CoPP and bilirubin, an inducer of HO-1 and a metabolic product of HO-1, respectively, provided a similar protective effects. On the contrary, the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP IX blocked the effect of sildenafil. Transfection with HO-1 siRNA significantly reduced the protective effect of sildenafil on the loss of MTT reduction ability and MPT induction in AGE-treated cells. Taken together, our results suggested that sildenafil provides beneficial effect to protect the HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cells against AGE-induced deterioration of mitochondrial integrity, and upregulation of HO-1 is involved in the underlying mechanism. ","624":null,"625":"Craniosynostosis has a varied clinical spectrum, ranging from isolated single suture involvement to multi-sutural fusions. Greater understanding of the pathogenesis of craniosynostosis has led to the development of practical treatment protocols. Three stages of growth have determined the approach to managing craniosynostosis : the early period, up to 12 months; the intermediate period, from 1 to 10 years; and the late period, beginning at 10 years. This review discusses current surgical management and future perspectives in craniosynostosis. ","626":"Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of calvarial sutures, resulting in deformed craniofacial appearance. Hence, for a long time, it has been considered an aesthetic disorder. Fused sutures restrict growth adjacent to the suture, but compensatory skull growth occurs to accommodate the growing brain. The primary goal for the management of this craniofacial deformity has been to release the constricted skull and reform the distorted shape of the skull vault. However, the intellectual and behavioral prognosis of affected children has also been taken into consideration since the beginning of the modern era of surgical management of craniosynostosis. A growing body of literature indicates that extensive surgery, such as the whole-vault cranioplasty approach, would result in better outcomes. In addition, the age at treatment is becoming a major concern for optimal outcome in terms of cosmetic results as well as neurodevelopment. This review will discuss major concerns regarding neurodevelopmental issues and related factors. ","627":"In this review, we discuss in detail our current procedure for treating craniosynostosis using multidirectional cranial distraction osteogenesis (MCDO). The MCDO method allows all phenotypes of skull deformity to be reshaped by distraction osteogenesis, except in patients who are 5 months of age or younger and patients with posterior cranial vault problems. We report the results of clinical data of 36 children with craniosynostosis who underwent MCDO between 2005 and 2014 in our institute. This method has the following benefits, such as a high flexibility of reshaping, shorter treatment period and less invasive secondary intervention. We also discuss the other distraction osteogenesis techniques that are used to treat craniosynostosis and compare them with MCDO. The preferred procedure for correction of craniosynostosis may depend on the patient's age, the extent of deformity, and the extent of correction achievable by surgery. We can arrange the combinations of various methods according to the advantage and disadvantage of each technique. ","628":"Various operative techniques are available for the treatment of craniosynostosis. The patient's age at presentation is one of the most important factors in the determination of the surgical modality. Minimally invasive suturectomy and postoperative helmet therapy may be performed for relatively young infants, whose age is younger than 6 months. It relies upon the potential for rapid brain growth in this age group. Its minimal invasiveness is also advantageous. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of minimally invasive suturectomy followed by helmet therapy for the treatment of craniosynostosis. ","629":"The purpose of this article is to review imaging findings and to discuss the optimal imaging methods for craniosynostosis. The discussion of imaging findings are focused on ultrasonography, plain radiography, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography with 3-dimensional reconstruction. We suggest a strategy for imaging work-up for the diagnosis, treatment planning and follow-up to minimize or avoid ionized radiation exposure to children by reviewing the current literature. ","630":"Most craniosynostoses are sporadic, but may have an underlying genetic basis. Secondary and syndromic craniosynostosis accompanies various systemic diseases or associated anomalies. Early detection of an associated disease may facilitate the interdisciplinary management of patients and improve outcomes. For that reason, systematic evaluation of craniosynostosis is mandatory. The authors reviewed systematic evaluation of craniosynostosis with an emphasis on genetic analysis. ","631":"Syndromic craniosynostosis has severe cranial stenosis and deformity, combined with hypoplastic maxillary bone and other developmental skeletal lesions. Among these various lesions, upper air way obstruction by hypoplastic maxillary bone could be the first life-threatening condition after birth. Aggressive cranial vault expansion for severely deformed cranial vaults due to multiple synostoses is necessary even in infancy, to normalize the intracranial pressure. Fronto-orbital advancement (FOA) is recommended for patients with hypoplastic anterior part of cranium induced by bicoronal and\/or metopic synostoses, and posterior cranial vault expansion is recommended for those with flattening of the posterior part of the cranium by lambdoid synostosis. Although sufficient spontaneous reshaping of the cranium can be expected by expansive cranioplasty, keeping the cranial bone flap expanded sufficiently is often difficult when the initial expansion is performed during infancy. So far distraction osteogenesis (DO) is the only method to make it possible and to provide low rates of re-expansion of the cranial vault. DO is quite beneficial for both FOA and posterior cranial vault expansion, compared with the conventional methods. Associated hydrocephalus and chronic tonsillar herniation due to lambdoid synostosis can be surgically treatable. Abnormal venous drainages from the intracranial space and air way obstruction should be always considered at any surgical procedures. Neurosurgeons have to know well about the managements not only of the deformed cranial vault and the associated brain lesions but also of other multiple skeletal lesions associated with syndromic craniosynostosis, to improve treatment outcome. ","632":"Craniosynostosis is defined as the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures resulting in skull deformity. Characteristically, this disorder can cause diverse neurosurgical problems, as well as abnormal skull shape. Intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation and neuropsychological dysfunction are the major neurosurgical concerns in children with craniosynostosis. In this review article, we investigate pathophysiology, characteristics and proper neurosurgical management of these neurosurgical issues, respectively. ","633":"Understanding the development of a skull deformity requires an understanding of the normal morphogenesis of the cranium. Craniosynostosis is the premature, pathologic ossification of one or more cranial sutures leading to skull deformities. A review of the English medical literature using textbooks and standard search engines was performed to gather information about the prenatal development and growth of the cranial vault of the neurocranium. A process of morphogenic sequencing begins during prenatal development and growth, continues postnatally, and contributes to the basis for the differential manner of growth of cranial vault bones. This improved knowledge might facilitate comprehension of the pathophysiology of craniosynostosis. ","634":"Craniosynostosis is defined as the premature fusion of one or more of the cranial sutures. It leads not only to secondary distortion of skull shape but to various complications including neurologic, ophthalmic and respiratory dysfunction. Craniosynostosis is very heterogeneous in terms of its causes, presentation, and management. Both environmental factors and genetic factors are associated with development of craniosynostosis. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis accounts for more than 70% of all cases. Syndromic craniosynostosis with a certain genetic cause is more likely to involve multiple sutures or bilateral coronal sutures. FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR1, TWIST1 and EFNB1 genes are major causative genes of genetic syndromes associated with craniosynostosis. Although most of syndromic craniosynostosis show autosomal dominant inheritance, approximately half of patients are de novo cases. Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Antley-Bixler syndrome are related to mutations in FGFR family (especially in FGFR2), and mutations in FGFRs can be overlapped between different syndromes. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Muenke syndrome, and craniofrontonasal syndrome are representative disorders showing isolated coronal suture involvement. Compared to the other types of craniosynostosis, single gene mutations can be more frequently detected, in one-third of coronal synostosis patients. Molecular diagnosis can be helpful to provide adequate genetic counseling and guidance for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.

The authors report a case of growing and hemorrhagic choroidal fissure cyst which was treated surgically. A 22-year-old female presented with headache. Cranial MRI showed a left-sided choroidal fissure cyst. Follow-up MRI showed that the size of the cyst had increased gradually. Twenty months later, the patient was admitted to our emergency department with severe headache. MRI and CT showed an intracystic hematoma. Although such cysts usually have a benign course without symptoms and progression, they may rarely present with intracystic hemorrhage, enlargement of the cyst and increasing symptomatology.

Here we present the case of a 13-year-old girl with LCH wherein CT and MRI results led us to an initially incorrect diagnosis of meningioma. The diagnosis was corrected to LCH based on pathology findings. An intracranial mass was found mainly in the dura mater, with thickening of the surrounding dura. It appeared to be growing downward from the calvaria, pressing on underlying brain tissue, and had infiltrated the inner skull, causing a bone defect. The lesion was calcified with the typical dural tail sign. The dural origin of the lesion was verified upon surgical dissection. There are no previous reports in the literature describing LCH of dural origin presenting in young patients with typical dural tail signs and meningioma-like imaging findings. The current case report underscores the need for thorough histological and immunocytochemical examinations in LCH differential diagnosis.

We reported a 38-year-old man complaining of nausea, malaise and transient loss of consciousness who was found to have severe hyponatremia. Neurologic deficits including altered mental status, behavioral disturbances, dysarthria and dysphagia developed despite slow correction of hyponatremia. Endocrine and imaging studies revealed hypopituitarism, nonfunctional pituitary macroadenoma and extrapontine myelinolysis. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed after three weeks of supportive therapy, when neurological symptoms improved significantly. The patient recovered function completely 3 months after surgery. Our case indicates that outcome of EPM can be good even with prolonged periods of severe neurologic impairment.

A 20-year-old male patient with pain of neck, who also had a previously known neuroendocrine tumor of lung, was operated for mass found in the cervicomedullary junction with a presumptive diagnosis of metastases. Only partial resection could be performed. Pathological diagnosis had been reported as gangliocytoma. Only ten cases of intramedullary gangliocytoma have been reported in the literature. Although association with scoliosis and Von Recklinghausen's disease were previously reported in the literature, no gangliocytoma case concomitant with endocrine tumor of lung have been published. Pathological study is the most important diagnostic method for gangliocytomas.

A 50-year-old woman without any significant medical history presented with a severe bifrontal headache due to acute SAH with a ruptured aneurysm on the anterior communicating artery (Fisher grade 3). On bleed day 6, she developed a sudden onset of global aphasia and left hemiparesis preceded by cEEG changes consistent with vasospasm. A stat chemical dilator therapy was performed and she recovered without significant neurological deficits. A real-time and protocol-based cEEG can be utilized in order to avoid any delay in detection of vasospasm in aneurysmal SAH and thereby improve clinical outcomes.

We collected data of head injury estimated from traffic accident statistics and seven hospital based reports to see incidence trends between 1970 and 2012. We also investigated the population structure and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of Korea over the same period. The age specific data were investigated from 1992 to 2012. The incidence of head injury gradually rose in the 1970s and the 1980s but stabilized until the 1990s with transient rise and then started to decline slowly in the 2000s. The mortality grew until 1991 but gradually declined ever since. However, the old age groups showed rather slight increase in both rates. The degree of decrease in the mortality has been more rapid than the incidence on head injury. In Korea during the low income stage, rapid industrialization cause considerable increase in the mortality and the incidence of head injury. During the high income stage, the incidence of head injury gradually declined and the mortality dropped more rapidly than the incidence due to preventive measures and satisfactory medical care. Nevertheless, the old age groups revealed rather slight increase in both rates owing to the large population structure and the declining birth rate.

A total of 234 patients were selected for this study. Pre- and post-operative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Korean version Oswestry Disability Index (KODI) were evaluated and the changes of both score were calculated. Outcome was defined as excellent, good, fair, and poor based on Mcnab classification. The percentage of superior facetectomy was calculated by using the Maro-view 5.4 Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS). Paramedian lumbar discectomy was performed in 180 patients and combined lumbar discectomy was performed in 54 patients. Paramedian lumbar discectomy group showed better outcome compared with combined discectomy group. p value of VAS change was 0.009 and KODI was 0.013. The average percentage of superior facetectomy was 33% (range, 0-79%) and it showed negative correlation with VAS and KODI changes (Pearson coefficient : -0.446 and -0.498, respectively). Excellent or good outcome cases (Group I) were 136 (58.1%) and fair or poor outcome cases (Group II) were 98 (41.9%). The percentage of superior facetectomy was 26.5% at Group I and 42.5% at Group II. There was significant difference in superior facetectomy percentage between Group I and II (p=0.000). This study demonstrated that paramedian lumbar discectomy with preservation of facet joints is an effective and good procedure for FELDH. At least 60% of facet should be preserved for excellent or good outcomes. ","645":"To evaluate whether an early bone marrow edema pattern predicts vertebral deformity types and prognosis in osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF). This retrospective study enrolled 64 patients with 75 acute OVCFs who underwent early MRI and followed up MRI. On early MRI, the low SI pattern of OVCF on T1WI were assessed and classified into 3 types (diffuse, globular or patchy, band-like). On followed up MRI, the vertebral deformity types (anterior wedge, biconcave, crush), degree of vertebral body height loss, incidence of vertebral osteonecrosis and spinal stenosis were assessed for each vertebral fracture types. According to the early bone marrow edema pattern on T1WI, 26 vertebrae were type 1, 14 vertebrae were type 2 and 35 vertebrae were type 3. On followed up MRI, the crush-type vertebral deformity was most frequent among the type 1 OVCFs, the biconcave-type vertebral deformity was most frequent among the type 2 OVCFs and the anterior wedge-type vertebral deformity was most frequent among the type 3 OVCFs (p&lt;0.001). In addition, type 1 early bone marrow edema pattern of OVCF on T1WI were associated with higher incidence of severe degree vertebral body height loss, vertebral osteonecrosis and spinal stenosis on the follow up MRI. Early bone marrow edema pattern of OVCF on T1WI, significant correlated with vertebral deformity types on the follow up MRI. The severe degree of vertebral height loss, vertebral osteonecrosis, and spinal stenosis were more frequent in patients with diffuse low SI pattern.

A retrospective matched comparative study was performed for 64 patients who underwent single-level ACDF with a cage and plate. Radiologic parameters, including upper segment range of motion (USROM), lower segment range of motion (LSROM), upper segment disc height (UDH), and lower segment disc height (LDH), clinical outcomes assessed with neck and arm visual analogue scale (VAS), and risk factors were analyzed. Patients were categorized into the ASD (32 patients) and non-ASD (32 patients) group. The decrease of UDH was significantly greater in the ASD group at each follow-up visit. At 36 months postoperatively, the difference for USROM value from the preoperative one significantly increased in the ASD group than non-ASD group. Preoperative other segment degeneration was significantly associated with the increased incidence of ASD at 36 months. However, pain intensity for the neck and arm was not significantly different between groups at any post-operative follow-up visit. The main factor affecting ASD is preoperative other segment degeneration out of the adjacent segment. In addition, patients over the age of 50 are at higher risk of developing ASD. Although there was definite radiologic degeneration in the ASD group, no significant difference was observed between the ASD and non-ASD groups in terms of the incidence of symptomatic disease.

The aims of this study are to investigate the anti-migration effect of bacitracin, which is an inhibitor of PDI, and the associated factor in this process. U87-MG glioma cells were treated with bacitracin in 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5.0 mM concentrations. Western blot with caspase-3 was applied to evaluate the cytotoxicity of bacitracin. Adhesion, morphology, migration assays, and organotypic brain-slice culture were performed to evaluate the effect of bacitracin to the tumor cell. Western blot, PCR, and gelatin zymography were performed to investigate the associated factors. Thirty glioma tissues were collected following immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Bacitracin showed a cytotoxicity in 3rd (p&lt;0.05) and 4th (p&lt;0.001) days, in 5.0 Mm concentration. The cell adhesion significantly decreased and the cells became a round shape after treated with bacitracin. The migration ability, the expression of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) decreased in a bacitracin dose- and time-dependent manner. The U87-MG cells exhibited low-invasiveness in the 2.5 mM, compared with the untreated in organotypic brain-slice culture. PDI was expressed in the tumor margin, and significantly increased with histological glioma grades (p&lt;0.001).

A three dimensional finite element model of intact lumbar spine was constructed and two spinal fusion models using pedicle screw fixation system and a new type of interspinous devices, IPC, were developed. The biomechanical effects such as range of motion (ROM) and facet contact force were analyzed at surgical level (L3\/4) and adjacent levels (L2\/3, L4\/5). In addition, the stress in adjacent intervertebral discs (D2, D4) was investigated. The entire results show biomechanical parameters such as ROM, facet contact force, and stress in adjacent intervertebral discs were similar between PLIF and IPC models in all motions based on the assumption that the implants were perfectly fused with the spine. The newly proposed fusion device, IPC, had similar fusion effect at surgical level, and biomechanical effects at adjacent levels were also similar with those of pedicle screw fixation system.

","652":"Ependymomas occur in both the brain and spine. The prognosis of these tumors sometimes differs for different locations. The genetic landscape of ependymoma is very heterogeneous despite the similarity of histopathologic findings. In this review, we describe the genetic differences between spinal ependymomas and their intracranial counterparts to better understand their prognosis. From the literature review, many studies have reported that spinal cord ependymoma might be associated with NF2 mutation, NEFL overexpression, Merlin loss, and 9q gain. In myxopapillary ependymoma, NEFL and HOXB13 overexpression were reported to be associated. Prior studies have identified HIC-1 methylation, 4.1B deletion, and 4.1R loss as common features in intracranial ependymoma. Supratentorial ependymoma is usually characterized by NOTCH-1 mutation and p75 expression. TNC mutation, no hypermethylation of RASSF1A, and GFAP\/NeuN expression may be diagnostic clues of posterior fossa ependymoma. Although MEN1, TP53, and PTEN mutations are rarely reported in ependymoma, they may be related to a poor prognosis, such as recurrence or metastasis. Spinal ependymoma has been found to be quite different from intracranial ependymoma in genetic studies, and the favorable prognosis in spinal ependymoma may be the result of the genetic differences. A more detailed understanding of these various genetic aberrations may enable the identification of more specific prognostic markers as well as the development of customized targeted therapies.

We conducted a retrospective review of operations performed by the senior author from 2004-2011 identified collagen matrix (DuraGen) use in 84 posterior fossa operations. Wound complications such as CSF leak, infection, pseudomeningocele, and aseptic meningitis were noted. Fisher's exact test was performed to assess risk factor association with specific complications. Incisional CSF leak rate was 8.3% and non-incisional CSF leak rate was 3.6%. Incidence of aseptic meningitis was 7.1% and all cases resolved with steroids alone. Incidence of palpable and symptomatic pseudomeningocele in follow-up was 10.7% and 3.6% respectively. Postoperative infection rate was 4.8%. Previous surgery was associated with pseudomeningocele development (p&lt;0.05). When primary dural closure after posterior fossa surgery is undesirable or not feasible, non-watertight dural reconstruction with collagen matrix resulted in incisional CSF leak in 8.3%.

We reviewed the medical records of 18 patients diagnosed as MGwNM at our institute between January 2006 and December 2012. Macroscopic total resection was performed in 11 patients (61%). We evaluated the methylation status of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) in all cases, and deletions of 1p and 19q in available cases. The estimated median overall survival was 21.2 months. The median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. Six patients (33%) had MGMT methylation but IDH1 mutation was found in only one patient (6%). Gene analysis for 1p19q performed in nine patients revealed no deletion in six, 19q deletion only in two, and 1p deletion only in one. The extent of resection was significantly correlated with progression free survival on both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis (p=0.002 and p=0.013, respectively). In this study, the overall survival of MGwNM was not superior to glioblastoma. The extent of resection has a significant prognostic impact on progression-free survival.

CSH frequently occur after a trauma, however, it cannot occur when there is no enough subdural space even after a severe head injury. CSH may occur without trauma, when there is sufficient subdural space. The author tried to investigate trends in the causation of CSH. By a review of literature, the author suggested a different view on the causation of CSH. CSH usually originated from either a subdural hygroma or an acute subdural hematoma. Development of CSH starts from the separation of the dural border cell (DBC) layer, which induces proliferation of DBCs with production of neomembrane. Capillaries will follow along the neomembrane. Hemorrhage would occur into the subdural fluid either by tearing of bridge veins or repeated microhemorrhage from the neomembrane. That is the mechanism of hematoma enlargement. Trauma or bleeding tendency may precipitate development of CSH, however, it cannot lead CSH, if there is no sufficient subdural space. The key determinant for development of CSH is a sufficient subdural space, in other words, brain atrophy. The most common and universal cause of brain atrophy is the aging. Modifying Virchow's description, CSH is sometimes traumatic, but most often caused by degeneration of the brain. Now, it is reasonable that degeneration of brain might play pivotal role in development of CSH in the aged persons.

The operation time, failure rate, blood loss, complication rate, re-herniation rate, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for back and leg were checked. The alteration of dural sac cross-sectional area (DSCSA) between the preoperative and the postoperative MRI was checked. Operative time was rapidly reduced in the early phase, and then tapered to a steady state for the 35 cases receiving the PELD. After surgery, VAS scores for the back and leg were decreased significantly in both groups. Complications occurred in 2 patients in group A and 2 patients in group B. Between the two groups, there were significant differences in operative time, improvement of leg VAS, and expansion of DSCSA. PELD learning curve seems to be acceptable with sufficient preparation. However, because of their high tendency to delayed operation time, operation failure, and re-herniation, caution should be exercised at the early phase of the procedure.

Cervical 3D CT was performed between November 2011 and August 2014. Arcuate foramina were classified as partial or complete and left and\/or right. Occipitalization of the atlas was classified in accordance with criteria specified by Mudaliar et al. Posterior arch defects of the atlas were classified in accordance with criteria specified by Currarino et al. One hundred and eight vertebrae (108\/1029, 10.5%) showed an arcuate foramen. Bilateral arcuate foramina were present in 41 of these vertebrae and the remaining 67 arcuate foramina were unilateral (right 31, left 36). Right-side arcuate foramina were partial on 18 sides and complete on 54 sides. Left-side arcuate foramina were partial on 24 sides and complete on 53 sides. One case of atlas assimilation was found. Twelve patients (12\/1029, 1.17%) had a defect of the atlantal posterior arch. Nine of these patients (9\/1029, 0.87%) had a type A posterior arch defect. We also identified one type B, one type D, and one type E defect. Preoperative diagnosis of occipitalization of the atlas and arcuate foramina using 3D CT is of paramount importance in avoiding neurovascular injury during surgery. It is important to be aware of posterior arch defects of the atlas because they may be misdiagnosed as a fracture.

Apoptosis, a genetically programmed cellular event which occurs after ischemia and leads to biochemical and morphological changes in cells. There are some useful markers for apoptosis like Bcl-2, bax, and p53. The last reports, researchers verify the apoptosis with early markers like Annexin V. We preferred in this experimental study a model of global cerebral infarction which was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion method. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups : sham, ischemia-reperfusion (I\/R), I\/R plus 20 mg\/kg resveratrol and I\/R plus 40 mg\/kg resveratrol. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigmastat 3.5 ve IBM SPSS Statistics 20. We considered a result significant when p&lt;0.001. After administration of resveratrol, Bcl-2 and Annexin levels were significantly increased (p&lt;0.001). Depending on the dose of resveratrol, Bcl2 levels increased, p53 levels decreased but Annexin V did not effected. P53 levels were significantly increased in ishemia group, so apoptosis is higher compared to other groups. In the acute period, Annexin V levels misleading us because the apoptotic cell counts could not reach a certain level. Therefore we should support our results with bcl-2 and p53. ","682":"Our aim was to evaluate the histopathological effects of tissue adhesives on peripheral nerve regeneration after experimental sciatic nerve transection in rats and to search whether these tissue adhesives may possess a therapeutic potential in peripheral nerve injuries. This experimental study was performed using 42 female Wistar-Albino rats distributed in 6 groups subsequent to transection of right sciatic nerves. Group I underwent external circumferential neurolysis; Group II received suture repair; Group III had local polymeric hydrogel based tissue adhesive administration; Group IV received suture repair and polymeric hydrogel based tissue adhesive application together; Group V had gelatin based tissue adhesive application and Group VI had suture repair and gelatin based tissue adhesive together. After a 6-week follow-up period, biopsies were obtained from site of neural injury and groups were compared with respect to histopathological scoring based on inflammatory, degenerative, necrotic and fibrotic changes. There were remarkable differences between control group and study groups with respect to inflammation (p=0.001), degeneration (p=0.002), necrosis (p=0.007), fibrosis (p&lt;0.001) and vascularity (p=0.001). Histopathological scores were similar between study groups and the only noteworthy difference was that Group V displayed a lower score for necrosis and higher score in terms of vascularization. Our results imply that tissue adhesives can be useful in repair of peripheral nerve injuries by decreasing the surgical trauma and shortening the duration of intervention. Results with gelatin based tissue adhesive are especially promising since more intense vascularity was observed in tissue after application. However, trials on larger series with longer durations of follow-up are essential for reaching more reliable conclusions.

The spinous process was split, the area of the facet lamina junction was drilled, and en bloc hemilaminectomy was then performed. After removing intradural and posterior epidural lesions, we fitted the previously en bloc-removed bone to the pre-surgery same shape, and held it in place with non-absorbable sutures. Surgery was performed on 16 laminas from a total of nine patients between 2011 and 2014. Bony union of the reconstructed lamina was assessed using computed tomography (CT) at 6 months after surgery. Spinous process-slitting hemilaminoplasty was performed for intradural extramedullary tumors in eight patients and for ossification of the ligament flavum in one patient. Because we were able to visualize the margin of the ipsilateral and contralateral dura, we were able to secure space for removal of the lesion and closure of the dura. None of the cases showed spinal deformity or other complications. Bone fusion and maintenance of the spinal canal were found to be perfect on CT scans. The spinous process-splitting hemilaminoplasty technique presented here was successful in creating sufficient space to remove intradural and posterior epidural lesions and to close the dura. Furthermore, we were able to maintain the physiological barrier and integrity after surgery because the posterior musculature and bone structures were restored.

Epidural cervical transforaminal injections are usually well-tolerated with mild side effects such as transient decreased sensory and motor function, or headache due to dural puncture. Although there are a few case reports about adverse effects of cervical epidural injection in the literature, it can cause severe complications such as large hematoma, infarction by spinal vascular injury. Subdural hematoma has been occurred much less common rather than epidural hematoma in the spinal cord.

The patient presented with severe headache and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a heterogeneously enhanced tumor in the pineal region with obstructive hydrocephalus. After an urgent ventricular-peritoneal shunt, she was treated by subtotal resection and chemotherapy concomitant with radiotherapy. Two months after surgery, MRI showed no changes in the residual tumor but leptomeningeal dissemination surrounding the brainstem. One month later, she exhibited severe lumbago and bilateral leg pain. Thoracico-lumbar MRI showed drop like metastasis in the lumbar region. Finally she died five months after the initial diagnosis. Neurosurgeons should pay attention to GBM in the pineal region, not only as an important differential diagnosis among the pineal tumors, but due to the aggressive features of leptomeningeal dissemination and spinal metastasis.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T2(*)-gradient echo (T2(*)-GE) sequence showed long cord sign at the right frontal cortex. The patient was treated with low molecular weight heparin, followed by oral warfarin for 6 months. The 3-month follow-up MR imaging showed recanalization of the previously thrombosed cortical vein. She was completely recovered without neurological deficits after 6 months.

","690":"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is common among various types of storkes; however, it is rare in young patients and patients who do not have any risk factors. In such cases, ICH is generally caused by vascular malformations, tumors, vasculitis, or drug abuse. Basal ganglia ICH is rarely related with distal lenticulostriate artery (LSA) aneurysm. Since the 1960s, a total of 29 distal LSA aneurysm cases causing ICH have been reported in the English literature. Despite of the small number of cases, various treatment methods have been attempted : surgical clipping, endovascular treatment, conservative treatment, superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis, and gamma-knife radiosurgery. Here, we report two additional cases and review the literature. Thereupon, we discerned that young patients with deep ICH are in need of conventional cerebral angiography. Moreover, initial conservative treatment with follow-up cerebral angiography might be a good treatment option except for cases with a large amount of hematoma that necessitates emergency evacuation. If the LSA aneurysm still persists or enlarges on follow-up angiography, it should be treated surgically or endovascularly.

Because perforators to the medulla arose both proximal and distal to the dissecting segment, revascularization for distal flow was essential. However, several previously reported methods for anastomosis, such as an occipital artery-PICA bypass or resection with PICA end-to-end anastomosis could not be used. Ultimately, we performed an in situ side-to-side anastomosis of the proximal loop of the PICA with distal caudal loops within a single artery, as a \"closing omega,\" followed by trapping of the dissected segment. The aneurysm was obliterated successfully, with intact patency of the revascularized PICA. ","692":"Post-craniotomy seizure (PCS) is reported only rarely. However, our department noted a 433% increase in PCS for a year beginning September 2010, especially after cerebrovascular surgery. Our goal was to identify the cause of our unusual outbreak of PCS. For almost one year after September 2010, cases of PCS increased significantly in our department. We analyzed 973 patients who had received a major craniotomy between January 2009 and November 2011. We included seizures that occurred only in the first 24 postoperative hours, which we defined as early PCS. After verifying the presence of PCS, we analyzed multiple seizure-provoking factors and their relation to the duration and character of seizure activity. Overall PCS incidence was 7.2% (70\/973). Cefazolin (2 g\/L saline) was the antibiotic drug used for intraoperative irrigation in 88.4% of the operations, and no PCS occurred without intraoperative cefazolin irrigation. When analyzed by operation type, clipping surgery for unruptured aneurysms was the most frequently associated with PCS (80%). Using logistic regression, only 2 g cefazolin intraoperative irrigation (p=0.024) and unruptured aneurysm clipping surgery (p&lt;0.001) were associated with early PCS. The seizure rate of unruptured aneurysm clipping surgery using 2 g cefazolin intraoperative irrigation was 32.9%. Intraoperative cefazolin irrigation must be avoided in patients undergoing craniotomy, especially for clipping of unruptured aneurysms, because of the increased risk of early PCS.

Consequently, spine metastases from HCC are being diagnosed more frequently. The accurate prediction of prognosis plays a critical role in determining a patient's treatment plan, including surgery for patients with spinal metastases of HCC. We investigated the clinical features, surgical outcomes, and prognostic factors of HCC presenting with spine metastases, in patients who underwent surgery. A retrospective review was conducted on 33 HCC patients who underwent 36 operations (three patients underwent surgical treatment twice) from February 2006 to December 2013. The median age of the patients was 56 years old (range, 28 to 71; male : female=30 : 3). Overall survival was not correlated with age, sex, level of metastases, preoperative Child-Pugh classification, preoperative ambulatory function, preoperative radiotherapy, type of operation, administration of Sorafenib, or the Tokuhashi scoring system. Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Comparing the Child-Pugh classification and ambulatory ability, there were no statistically differences between patients pre- and post-operatively. The Tomita scoring system represents a practicable and highly predictive prognostic tool. Even though surgical intervention may not restore ambulatory function, it should be considered to prevent deterioration of the patient's overall condition. Additionally, aggressive management may be needed if there is any ambulatory ability remaining.

Previous literatures reported the correlation between OLN and cervical spondylosis. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical significance of OLN with relation to cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). We retrospectively compared the prevalence of OPLL in 105 patients with OLN and without OLN and compared the prevalence of OLN in 105 patients with OPLL and without OPLL. We also analyzed the relationship between the morphology of OLN and involved OPLL level. The OPLL level was classified as short (1-3) or long (4-6), and the morphologic subtype of OLN was categorized as round, rod, or segmented. The prevalence of OPLL was significantly higher in the patients with OLN (64.7%) than without OLN (16.1%) (p=0.0001). And the prevalence of OLN was also higher in the patients with OPLL (54.2%) than without OPLL (29.5%) (p=0.0002). In patients with round type OLN, 5 of 26 (19.2%) showed long level OPLL, while in patients with larger type (rod and segmented) OLN, 22 of 42 (52.3%) showed long level OPLL (p=0.01). There was significant relationship between OLN and OPLL prevalence. This correlation indicates that there might be common systemic causes as well as mechanical causes in the formation of OPLL and OLN. The incidentally detected OLN in cervical lateral radiograph, especially larger type, might be helpful to predict the possibility of cervical OPLL.

We retrospectively analyzed 82 patients with CP who were surgically treated by the same neurosurgeon at our institution between January 1994 and December 2012. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 71 patients (86.6%), near total resection (NTR) in 7 patients (8.5%), and subtotal resection (STR) in 3 patients (3.7%). The disease-specific overall survival rate was 100% with the exclusion of 2 surgery-related mortalities. The overall recurrence rate was 12.2% (10 of 82 patients), however the recurrence rate according to extent of resection (EOR) was 9.9% (7 of 71 patients) after GTR, 14.3% (1 of 7 patients) after NTR, and 66.7% (2 of 3 patients) after STR. The overall recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates at 5 and 10 years were 87.0% and 76.8%, respectively. Postoperatively, most patients (86.3%) needed hormone replacement for at least 1 hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Vision improved in 56.4% of the patients with preoperative abnormal vision, but deteriorated in 27.4% of patients. Hypothalamic dysfunction developed in 32.9% of patients. There were no significant differences in the risks of pituitary dysfunction, visual deterioration, or hypothalamic dysfunction between the groups with complete vs. incomplete removal. The overall rate of postoperative complications was 22.0%, which did not differ between groups (p=0.053).

One of the most important factors affecting favorable clinical outcome is early recanalization. Mechanical thrombectomy is an emerging treatment strategy for achieving a high recanalization rates. However, thrombectomy alone can be insufficient to complete recanalization, especially for acute stroke involving large artery atheromatous disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in AVBAO. Fourteen consecutive patients with AVBAO were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Additional multimodal treatments were intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty, or permanent stent placement. Recanalization by thrombectomy alone and multimodal treatments were assessed by the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score. Clinical outcome was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 7 days and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Thrombectomy alone and multimodal treatments were performed in 10 patients (71.4%) and 4 patients (28.6%), respectively. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3) was achieved in 11 (78.6%). Among these 11 patients, 3 (27.3%) underwent multimodal treatment due to underlying atherosclerotic stenosis. Ten (71.4%) of the 14 showed NIHSS score improvement of &gt;10. Overall mortality was 3 (21.4%) of 14. We suggest that mechanical thrombectomy is safe and effective for improving recanalization rates in AVBAO, with low complication rates. Also, in carefully selected patients after the failure of recanalization by thrombectomy alone, additional multimodal treatment such as IA thrombolysis, balloons, or stents can be needed to achieve successful recanalization.

Five human lumbar spinal specimens (L3 to S1) were obtained and checked for abnormalities. The fresh specimens were stripped of muscle tissue, with care taken to preserve the spinal ligaments and facet joints. Pedicle screws were implanted in the L4 and L5 vertebrae of each specimen. Specimens were tested under 0 N and 400 N axial loading. Five different posterior rods of various elastic moduli (intact, rubber, low-density polyethylene, aluminum, and titanium) were tested. Segmental range of motion (ROM), center of rotation (COR) and intervertebral disc pressure were investigated. As the rigidity of the posterior rods increased, both the segmental ROM and disc pressure at L4-5 decreased, while those values increased at adjacent levels. Implant stiffness saturation was evident, as the ROM and disc pressure were only marginally increased beyond an implant stiffness of aluminum. Since the disc pressures of adjacent levels were increased by the axial loading, it was shown that the rigidity of the implants influenced the load sharing between the implant and the spinal column. The segmental CORs at the adjacent disc levels translated anteriorly and inferiorly as rigidity of the device increased. These biomechanical findings indicate that the rigidity of the dynamic stabilization implant and physiological loading play significant roles on spinal kinematics at adjacent disc levels, and will aid in further device development.

It seems like the right time to sum up the relevant results in order to understand where LTDR stands on now, and is heading forward to. The pathogenesis of DDD has been currently settled, but diagnosis and managements are still controversial. Fusion is recognized as golden standard of surgical managements but has various kinds of shortcomings. Lately, LTDR has been expected to replace fusion surgery. A great deal of LTDR reports has come out. Among them, more than 5-year follow-up prospective randomized controlled studies including USA IDE trials were expected to elucidate whether for LTDR to have therapeutic benefit compared to fusion. The results of these studies revealed that LTDR was not inferior to fusion. Most of clinical studies dealing with LTDR revealed that there was no strong evidence for preventive effect of LTDR against symptomatic degenerative changes of adjacent segment disease. LTDR does not have shortcomings associated with fusion. However, it has a potentiality of the new complications to occur, which surgeons have never experienced in fusion surgeries. Consequently, longer follow-up should be necessary as yet to confirm the maintenance of improved surgical outcome and to observe any very late complications. LTDR still may get a chance to establish itself as a substitute of fusion both nominally and virtually if it eases the concerns listed above.

Brain computed tomography showed bilateral chronic SDH with an acute component. The patient underwent an emergency burr-hole trephination and hematoma removal. She exhibited good recovery after the operation. On the fourth postoperative day, she complained of low-back pain radiating to both lower limbs, and subjective weakness of the lower limbs. Spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thoracolumbosacral SDH.

Most of the patients with the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism present with kidney stones or isolated hypercalcemia. However, nearly one third of patients are asymptomatic and hypercalcemia is found incidentally. Skeletal involvement such as generalized osteopenia, bone resorption, bone cysts and Brown tumors are seen on the late phase of hyperparathyroidism. The symptoms include axial pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy and myeloradiculopathy according to their locations. Plasmocytoma, lymphoma, giant cell tumors and metastates should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of Brown tumors.

The median tumor volume was 2.7 cc (range 0.2-10.5 cc) and the median follow-up was 48 months (range 24-168 months). Volumetric data sets for tumors and PTE on serial MRIs were analyzed. The edema index (EI) was defined as the ratio of the volume of PTE including tumor to the tumor volume, and the relative edema indices (rEIs) were calculated from serial EIs normalized against the baseline EI. Risk factors for PTE were analyzed using logistic regression. Newly developed or increased PTE was noted in 49 patients (15.3%), among whom it was symptomatic in 28 patients (8.8%). Tumor volume larger than 4.2 cc (p&lt;0.001), hemispheric tumor location (p=0.005), and pre-treatment PTE (p&lt;0.001) were associated with an increased risk of PTE. rEI reached its maximum value at 11 months after SRS and decreased thereafter, and symptoms resolved within 24 months in most patients (85.7%). Caution should be exercised in decision-making on SRS for asymptomatic meningiomas of large volume (&gt;4.2 cc), of hemispheric location, or with pre-treatment PTE.

We divided patients into two groups : group A had burr holes in the parietal bone and group B had burr holes at Kocher's point. The hematoma volume, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, and modified Barthel Index (mBI) score were calculated. At discharge, we evaluated the patients' Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, motor grade, and hospitalization duration. We evaluated the patients' mBI scores and motor grades at 6 months after surgery. The hematoma volume in group A was significantly less than that in group B on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21. Group A had significantly higher GCS scores than did group B on postoperative days 1 and 3. Group A had higher mBI scores postoperatively than did group B, but the scores were not significantly different. No differences were observed for the GOS score, mRS score, motor grade at discharge, or duration of hospitalization. The mBI score of group A at 6 months after surgery was significantly higher, and more patients in group A showed muscle strength improvement. In oval-shaped ICH with expansion to the parietal region, the parietal approach is considered to improve the clinical symptoms at the acute phase by removing the hematoma more effectively in the early stages.

We did retrospective study with 546 patients who underwent a unilateral TLIF, and used CT and MRI to study the causes of contralateral radicular symptoms that appeared within a week postoperatively. Clinical and radiological results were compared by dividing the patients into the symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Contralateral symptoms occurred in 32 (5.9%) of the patients underwent unilateral TLIF. The most common cause of contralateral symptoms was a contralateral foraminal stenosis in 22 (68.8%), screw malposition in 4 (12.5%), newly developed herniated nucleus pulposus in 3 (9.3%), hematoma in 1 (3.1%), and unknown origin in 2 patients (6.3%). 16 (50.0%) of the 32 patients received revision surgery. There was no difference in visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index between the two groups at discharge. Both preoperative and postoperative contralateral foraminal areas were significantly smaller, and postoperative segmental angle was significantly greater in the symptomatic group comparing to those of the asymptomatic group (p&lt;0.05). The incidence rate is not likely to be small (5.9%).

This study was designed as a prospective observational cohort study. Its subjects were aneurysmal SAH patients who had undergone aneurysm clipping or coiling. They were assigned to 1 of 3 groups : the 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg simvastatin groups. The primary end-point was the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm. The clinical outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score after 1 month and 3 months.

Serious neck swelling was observed and lateral neck X-ray showed severe widening of the prevertebral space. Due to dyspnea progression, emergency endotracheal intubation was performed. Although there was no primary cause of the retropharyngeal hematoma on preoperative examination, ALL tearing was intraoperatively confirmed during early surgery. The in-hospital evolutions of the patients were favorable after surgery. We should bear in mind the possibility of ALL injury and perform early surgery where possible given the earlier convalescence and good prognosis. ","719":"We report on a case of an 87-year-old woman who showed spontaneous resolution of a large chronic subdural hematoma which required surgical decompression. She had suffered from confused mentality and right side weakness of motor grade II for 10 days. The initial brain CT scan showed a 22 mm thick low density lesion located in the left fronto-temporo-parietal region with midline shift (12 mm) which required emergency decompression. However, because she and her family did not want surgery, she was followed up in the outpatient clinic. Five months later, follow up brain CT showed that the CSDH had disappeared and the patient became neurologically normal. The reasons for spontaneous resolution of CSDH remain unclear. We discuss the possible relation between mechanisms of physio-pathogenesis and spontaneous resolution of a large chronic subdural hematoma (CSH) in an elderly patient. ","720":"Arteriovenous fistula of the scalp is relatively rare disease. We report a traumatic arteriovenous fistula of the scalp treated with complete surgical excision and review the literature with regard to etiology, pathogenesis, and management of these unusual lesions. ","721":"Spinal cord herniation is a rare condition that has become increasingly recognised in the last few years. The authors report a case of idiopathic spinal cord herniation in a 33 year old woman performed with progressive Brown-Sequard syndrome. The diagnosis was made on MR imaging. After repairing the herniation, the patient made a gradual improvement. Potential causes are discussed, including a possible role of dural defect. In conclusion, idiopathic spinal cord herniation is a potentially treatable condition that should be more readily diagnosed that increasing awareness and improved imaging techniques.

After resection of tumor, there are evoked thermal changes on pre- and post-operative infrared (IR) thermographic images. A 52-year-old female presented with low back pain, sciatica, and sensory change on the dorsal side of the right foot and big toe that has lasted for 9 months. She also presented with right tibial mass sized 1.2 cm by 1.4 cm. Ultrasonographic imaging revealed a peripheral nerve sheath tumor arising from the peroneal nerve. IR thermographic image showed hyperthermia when the neurilemoma induced sensory change with compression test on the fibular area, dorsum of foot, and big toe. After surgery, the symptoms and thermographic changes were relieved and disappeared. The clinical, surgical, radiographic, and thermographic perspectives regarding this case are discussed. ","724":"Myxomas are rare benign tumors that originate from mesenchymal tissue. They usually develop in the atrium of the heart, the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or bone. Involvement of the skull base with an intracranial extension is very rare and not well-described in the literature. We report a rare case of primary intracranial ossifying myxoma arising from the anterior skull base and mimicking a huge chondrosarcoma, and we review the relevant literature. ","725":"Tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is a rare vascular disease, which has high risk of intracranial hemorrhage. We present two cases of tentorial DAVF which were successfully treated with single trial of transarterial embolization using Onyx. We briefly reviewed the types of the tentorial DAVF and strategies of treatment. ","726":"This study was designed to evaluation the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT) in patients with spinal infection, compare to the classical biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell (WBC) count. All patients who were diagnosed as a spinal infection between January, 2013 and July, 2014 were included in this study. Serum PCT, CRP, ESR, and WBC count were checked at initial hospital visit and once a week serially until they were discharged. Patient's medical history, causes and pathogens of spinal infection were reviewed. Total 34 (16 men, 18 women) patients were included in this study. Mean age of the patients was 65.6 year-old. Causes of spinal infection were pain block procedure (14, 41.2%) and post-operation (5, 14.7%). Out of 25 patients who showed elevated initial serum PCT level, 20 patients (80%) had a combined systemic infection. 14 patients (6.7%) had a sepsis, 3 patients (14.2%) had a urinary tract infection and 2 (9.6%) had a pneumonia. 14 patients (41.2%) showed elevation of serum PCT level during treatment. Among them, 9 patients (64.3%) had a combined infection such as sepsis and urinary tract infection. Serum CRP showed more sensitivity compared to serum PCT in patients with spinal infection. Patients with spinal infection who showed elevated serum PCT level should be investigated for combined infection and proper antibiotics should be applied. ","727":"Long-term oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy has been used with increasing frequency in the elderly. These patients are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from expansion of intracranial hemorrhage. We conducted a single-center retrospective case control study to evaluate risk factors associated with outcomes and to identify the differences in outcome in traumatic brain injury between preinjury anticoagulation use and without anticoagulation. A retrospective study of patients who underwent craniotomy or craniectomy for acute traumatic cerebral hemorrhage, between January 2005 and December 2014 was performed. A consecutive series of 50 patients were evaluated. The factors significantly differed between the two groups were initial Prothrombin Time-International Normalized Ratio, initial platelet count, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, and postoperative intracranial bleeding. Mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score were similar between the two groups. In the patient with low-energy trauma only, no significant differences in GOS score, postoperative bleeding and many other factors were observed. The contributing factors to postoperative bleeding was preinjury anticoagulation and its adjusted odds ratio was 12 [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 12.242; p=0.0070]. The contributing factors to low GOS scores, which mean unfavorable neurological outcomes, were age (adjusted OR, 1.073; p=0.039) and Rotterdam scale score for CT scans (adjusted OR, 3.123; p=0.0020). Preinjury anticoagulation therapy contributed significantly to the occurrence of postoperative bleeding. However, preinjury anticoagulation therapy in the patients with low-energy trauma did not contribute to the poor clinical outcomes or total hospital stay. Careful attention should be given to older patients and severity of hemorrhage on initial brain CT. ","728":"The present study aims to investigate 1) the risk factors for hydrocephalus and subdural hygroma (SDG) occurring after decompressive craniectomy (DC), and 2) the association between the type of SDG and hydrocephalus. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological features of 92 patients who underwent DC procedures after severe head injuries. The risk factors for developing post-traumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) and SDG were analyzed. Types of SDGs were classified according to location and their relationship with hydrocephalus was investigated. Ultimately, 26.09% (24\/92) of these patients developed PTH. In the univariate analyses, hydrocephalus was statically associated with large bone flap diameter, large craniectomy area, bilateral craniectomy, intraventricular hemorrhage, contralateral or interhemisheric SDGs, and delayed cranioplasty. However, in the multivariate analysis, only large craniectomy area (adjusted OR=4.66; p=0.0239) and contralateral SDG (adjusted OR=6.62; p=0.0105) were significant independent risk factors for developing hydrocephalus after DC. The incidence of overall SDGs after DC was 55.43% (51\/92). Subgroup analysis results were separated by SDG types. Statistically significant associations between hydrocephalus were found in multivariate analysis in the contralateral (adjusted OR=5.58; p=0.0074) and interhemispheric (adjusted OR=17.63; p=0.0113) types. For patients who are subjected to DC following severe head trauma, hydrocephalus is associated with a large craniectomy area and contralateral SDG. For SDGs after DC that occur on the interhemispherical or controlateral side of the craniectomy, careful follow-up monitoring for the potential progression into hydrocephalus is needed. ","729":"The treatment of giant cell tumor (GCT) is mainly performed surgically. However, GCT in spine seems difficult to treat because of the limited surgical accessibility and proximity. In this report, we analyzed the outcome of GCT treatment in spine. Between 2000 and 2012, 19 patients received treatment for GCT in spine. Median age at their first diagnosis was 31 years, 10 patients were male, and 9 female. Fourteen tumors were located in the sacrum, 1 in cervical, 1 in thoracic and 3 in lumbar spine. As primary treatment, gross total removal (GTR) was done in 6 patients, and subtotal removal (STR) in 13 patients. Radiation therapy (RT) as an adjuvant therapy was performed in 2 cases in GTR group and 10 cases in STR group. During the follow-up, 7 patients had local recurrence (36.8%). The average period until recurrence after primary treatment was 14 months. No recurrence was detected in GTR group. Recurrence was noted in 7 out of 13 patients who underwent STR. These differences were statistically significant (p=0.024). A median of recurrence free period (RFP) was 84 months. Also average RFP of the RT group was 112 months, and non-RT group was 65 months. These differences were statistically significant (p=0.041). Treatment of choice for GCT in spine is a complete removal of tumor without neurological deficits. In case of incomplete removal, radiation therapy may be a useful adjuvant treatment modality. ","730":"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the changes of contralateral sensorimotor cortical activation on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can predict the neurological outcome among spinal cord injury (SCI) patients when the great toes are stimulated without notice. This study enrolled a total of 49 patients with SCI and investigated each patient's preoperative fMRI, postoperative fMRI, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score, and neuropathic pain occurrence. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the change of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response on perioperative fMRI during proprioceptive stimulation with repetitive passive toe movements : 1) patients with a response of contralateral sensorimotor cortical activation in fMRI were categorized; 2) patients with a response in other regions; and 3) patients with no response. Correlation between the result of fMRI and each parameter was analyzed. In fMRI data, ASIA score was likely to show greater improvement in patients in group A compared to those belonging to group B or C (p&lt;0.001). No statistical significance was observed between the result of fMRI and neuropathic pain (p=0.709). However, increase in neuropathic pain in response to the signal change of the ipsilateral frontal lobe on fMRI was statistically significant (p=0.030). When there was change of BOLD response at the contralateral sensorimotor cortex on perioperative fMRI after surgery, relief of neurological symptoms was highly likely for traumatic SCI patients. In addition, development of neuropathic pain was likely to occur when there was change of BOLD response at ipsilateral frontal lobe. ","731":"We report on the technical feasibility and limitations of the transmanubrial approach for cervicothoracic junction (CTJ) lesions and emphasize the advantage of bisecting the upper part of the manubrium in an inverted Y-shape. Thirteen patients who underwent the fourteen transmanubrial approach for various CTJ lesions were enrolled during 2005-2014. For the evaluation of the accessibility for the CTJ lesion, we analyzed the two parallel line defined as a straight line parallel to the inferior and superior plateau of the upper and lower healthy vertebrae, the angle of the two parallel lines and the distance from the sternal notch to lines at the sternum on preoperative magnetic resonance images. Surgical limitations and perspectives, as well as postoperative clinical outcomes were evaluated retrospectively. The CTJ lesions were six metastases, three primary bone tumors, two herniated discs, and one each of a traumatic dislocation with syrinx formation and tuberculous spondylitis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. If two parallel lines pass below the sternal notch, the manubriotomy should be inevitably performed. The mean preoperative Visual analogue scale score was 8 (range, 5-10), which improved to 4 (range, 0-6) postoperatively. Seven cases showed an increase in Frankel score postoperatively. The spatial relationship between the sternal notch and the two parallel lines to the lesion was rational to determine the feasibility of manubriotomy. The transmanubrial approach for CTJ lesions can achieve favorable clinical outcomes by providing direct decompression of lesion and effective reconstruction. ","732":"Degenerative changes in the cervical spine are commonly accompanied by cervical kyphosis which can cause neck pain. This study examined the relationship between neck pain and cervical alignment. A total of 323 female nursing staff from our hospital were enrolled. Sagittal radiographs of the cervical spine, Body Mass Index (BMI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measures of neck and arm pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36 scores) were obtained and reviewed retrospectively. Global lordosis (GL) of the cervical spine was measured on radiograph images. Correlations between GL and questionnaire scores were investigated using the following three methods : 1) correlation between GL and questionnaire scores among the entire sample; 2) subgroup analysis of patients with \"kyphosis (KYP) : GL scores&lt;0\" vs. those with \"lordosis (LOR) : GL scores&gt;0\" on questionnaire measures; and 3) subgroup analysis of patients with pain vs. those without pain, on GL and questionnaire measures. There was no significant correlation between GL and any questionnaire measure. There was a significant difference between the mean GLs of the KYP and LOR groups, but there were no group differences in BMI, age or any questionnaire measures. There was no difference between the pain (n=92) and pain-free (n=231) groups in age, BMI or GL, but there were differences in neck, and arm pain, and physical function and NDI scores. Our data suggest that kyphotic deformity was not associated with neck pain.

Between June 2011 and December 2013, a total of 38 large BMs &gt;3.0 cm in 37 patients were treated with fractionated Cyberknife radiosurgery. These patients comprised 16 men (43.2%) and 21 women, with a median age of 60 years (range, 38-75 years). BMs originated from the lung (n=19, 51.4%), the gastrointestinal tract (n=10, 27.0%), the breast (n=5, 13.5%), and other tissues (n=3, 8.1%). The median tumor volume was 17.6 cc (range, 9.4-49.6 cc). For Cyberknife treatment, a median peripheral dose of 35 Gy (range, 30-41 Gy) was delivered in 3 to 5 fractions. With a median follow-up of 10 months (range, 1-37 months), the crude local tumor control (LTC) rate was 86.8% and the estimated LTC rates at 12 and 24 months were 87.0% and 65.2%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 16 and 11 months, respectively. The estimated OS and PFS rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 81.1% and 65.5%, 56.8% and 44.9%, and 40.7% and 25.7%, respectively. Patient performance status and preoperative focal neurologic deficits improved in 20 of 35 (57.1%) and 12 of 17 patients (70.6%), respectively. Radiation necrosis with a toxicity grade of 2 or 3 occurred in 6 lesions (15.8%). These results suggest a promising role of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in treating large BMs in terms of both efficacy and safety. ","735":"Although surgical resection is used to treat meningeal hemangiopericytoma (MHPC), there is a high risk of subsequent recurrence. This study investigated factors associated with treatment outcomes and recurrence in patients who had undergone surgical resection of intracranial MHPC. Fifteen patients underwent surgical treatments performed by one senior neurosurgeon between 1997 and 2013. Clinical data, radiologic images, surgical outcomes, recurrence, and other relevant characteristics were reviewed and analyzed. Fifteen patients were included in the analysis, 12 (80%) of whom had tumors in the supratentorial region, and 3 (20%) of whom had tumors in the infratentorial region. Complete resection was achieved in all 15 patients, and 3 (20%) patients were administered radiosurgery and conventional radiotherapy after surgery as adjuvant radiotherapy. Three patients developed recurrence, 2 of whom had not received adjuvant radiotherapy. In 1 of the patients who had not received adjuvant radiotherapy, recurrence developed at the original tumor site, 81 months after surgery. The other 2 recurrences occurred at other sites, 78 and 41 months after surgery. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 88.3%, while the 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 83% and 52%, respectively. Additionally the mean Ki-67 index differed significantly between patients who did and did not develop recurrence (43% vs. 14%; p=0.001). Because of the high risk of MHPC recurrence, MHPC tumors should be completely resected, whenever feasible. However, even when complete resection is achieved, adjuvant radiotherapy might be necessary to prevent recurrence. ","736":"This study was aimed at optimizing the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases and harbor activating epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records from 2005 to 2010 of NSCLC patients with brain metastases harboring an activating EGFR mutation. Patients who received a combination therapy of SRS and EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for brain metastases and those who received SRS without EGFR-TKI were compared. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) of the brain metastases. Thirty-one patients were eligible for enrolment in this study (SRS with TKI, 18; SRS without TKI, 13). Twenty-two patients (71.0%) were women and the median overall age was 56.0 years. PFS of brain lesions was not significantly prolonged in SRS with TKI treatment group than in SRS without TKI group (17.0 months vs. 9.0 months, p=0.45). Local tumor control rate was 83.3% in the combination therapy group, and 61.5% in the SRS monotherapy group (p=0.23). There were no severe adverse events related with treatment in both groups. Therapeutic outcome of concurrent SRS and TKI treatment was not superior to SRS monotherapy, however, there was no additive adverse events related with combined treatment. ","737":"Aneurysms arising from the pericallosal artery (PA) are uncommon and challenging to treat. The aim of this study was to report our experiences of the endovascular treatment of ruptured PA aneurysms. From September 2003 to December 2013, 30 ruptured PA aneurysms in 30 patients were treated at our institution via an endovascular approach. Procedural data, clinical and angiographic results were retrospectively reviewed. Regarding immediate angiographic control, complete occlusion was achieved in 21 (70.0%) patients and near-complete occlusion in 9 (30.0%). Eight procedure-related complications occurred, including intraprocedural rupture and early rebleeding in three each, and thromboembolic event in two. At last follow-up, 18 patients were independent with a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2, and the other 12 were either dependent or had expired (mRS score, 3-6). Adjacent hematoma was found to be associated with an increased risk of poor clinical outcome. Seventeen of 23 surviving patients underwent follow-up conventional angiography (mean, 16.5 months). Results showed stable occlusion in 14 (82.4%), minor recanalization in two (11.8%), and major recanalization, which required recoiling, in one (5.9%). Our experiences demonstrate that endovascular treatment for a ruptured PA aneurysms is both feasible and effective. However, periprocedural rebleedings were found to occur far more often (20.0%) than is generally suspected and to be associated with preoperative contrast retention. Analysis showed existing adjacent hematoma is predictive of a poor clinical outcome.

The present study aimed to establish an endovascular therapeutic strategy that focuses specifically on the angioarchitecture of ruptured VADAns. Twenty-three patients with ruptured VADAn received endovascular treatment (EVT) over 7 years. The patient group included 14 women (60.9%) and 9 men (39.1%) between the ages of 39 and 72 years (mean age 54.2 years). Clinical data and radiologic findings were retrospectively analyzed. Four patients had aneurysms on the dominant vertebral artery. Fourteen (61%) aneurysms were located distal to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Six (26%) patients had an extracranial origin of the PICA on the ruptured VA, and 2 patients (9%) had bilateral VADAns. Eighteen patients (78%) were treated with internal coil trapping. Two patients (9%) required an adjunctive bypass procedure. Seven patients (30%) required stent-supported endovascular procedures. Two patients experienced intra-procedural rupture during EVT, one of which was associated with a focal medullary infarction. Two patients (9%) exhibited recanalization of the VADAn during follow-up, which required additional coiling. No recurrent hemorrhage was observed during the follow-up period. EVT of ruptured VADAns based on angioarchitecture is a feasible and effective armamentarium to prevent fatal hemorrhage recurrence with an acceptable low risk of procedural complications. Clinical outcomes depend mainly on the pre-procedural clinical state of the patient. Radiologic follow-up is necessary to prevent hemorrhage recurrence after EVT. ","741":"This study investigates the role of a burr hole and calvarial bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) in a transient ischemic brain injury model in the rat and postulates a possible mechanism for the efficacy of multiple cranial burr hole (MCBH) surgery in moyamoya disease (MMD). Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g, male) were divided into four groups : normal control group (n=5), burr hole group (n=5), ischemia group (n=5), and ischemia+burr hole group (n=5). Focal ischemia was induced by the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). At one week after the ischemic injury, a 2 mm-sized cranial burr hole with small cortical incision was made on the ipsilateral (left) parietal area. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg\/kg) was injected intraperitoneally, 2 times a day for 6 days after the burr hole trephination. At one week after the burr hole trephination, brains were harvested. Immunohistochemical stainings for BrdU, CD34, VEGF, and Doublecortin and Nestin were done. In the ischemia+burr hole group, BrdU (+), CD34 (+), and Doublecortin (+) cells were found in the cortical incision site below the burr hole. A number of cells with Nestin (+) or VEGF (+) were found in the cerebral parenchyma around the cortical incision site. In the other groups, BrdU (+), CD34 (+), Doublecortin (+), and Nestin (+) cells were not detected in the corresponding area. These findings suggest that BrdU (+) and CD34 (+) cells are bone marrow-derived stem cells, which may be derived from the calvarial bone marrow through the burr hole. The existence of CD34 (+) and VEGF (+) cells indicates increased angiogenesis, while the existence of Doublecortin (+), Nestin (+) cells indicates increased neurogenesis. Based on these findings, the BMSCs through burr holes seem to play an important role for the therapeutic effect of the MCBH surgery in MMD. ","742":"The prophylactic use of phenytoin during and after brain surgery and cranial irradiation is a common measure in brain tumor therapy. Phenytoin has been associated with variety of adverse skin reactions including urticaria, erythroderma, erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. EM associated with phenytoin and cranial radiation therapy (EMPACT) is a rare specific entity among patients with brain tumors receiving radiation therapy while on prophylactic anti-convulsive therapy. Herein we report a 41-year-old female patient with left temporal glial tumor who underwent surgery and then received whole brain radiation therapy and chemotherapy. After 24 days of continous prophylactic phenytoin therapy the patient developed minor skin reactions and 2 days later the patient returned with generalized erythamatous and itchy maculopapuler rash involving neck, chest, face, trunk, extremities. There was significant periorbital and perioral edema. Painful mucosal lesions consisting of oral and platal erosions also occurred and prevented oral intake significantly. Phenytoin was discontinued gradually. Systemic admistration of corticosteroids combined with topical usage of steroids for oral lesions resulted in complete resolution of eruptions in 3 weeks. All cutaneous lesions in patients with phenytoin usage with the radiotherapy must be evoluated with suspicion for EM. ","743":"Neurological deficits after brain surgery are not uncommon, and correct and prompt differential diagnosis is essential to initiate appropriate treatment. We describe a patient suffering from loss of consciousness due to hyperammonemia, following valproic acid treatment after surgery for an unruptured cerebral aneurysm. A 57-year-old female patient underwent successful aneurysmal neck clipping to correct an unruptured aneurysm. Her postoperative course was good, and she received anti-epileptic therapy (valproic acid) and a soft diet. Within a few days the patient experienced mental deterioration. Her serum valproic acid reached toxic levels (149.40 mg\/L), and serum ammonia was fifteen times the upper normal limit (553 mmol\/L; normal range, 9-33 mmol\/L). After discontinuation of valproic acid and with conservative treatment, the patient recovered without any complications. Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy is an unusual but serious neurosurgical complication, and should not be disregarded as a possible cause of neurological deficits after neurovascular surgery. Early diagnosis is crucial, as discontinuation of valproic acid therapy can prevent serious complications, including death.

The development of 3.0 Tesla MRI has enabled high-resolution imaging of the intracranial vessel wall. High-resolution MRI (HRMRI) can yield excellent visualization of both the arterial wall and lumen, thus facilitating the detection of the primary and secondary features of intracranial arterial dissection. In the present report, we describe the manner in which HRMRI affected our endovascular treatment planning strategy in 2 cases with unruptured intracranial vertebral artery dissection aneurysm. HRMRI provides further information about the vessel wall and the lumen of the unruptured intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm, which was treated by an endovascular approach in the 2 current cases. ","745":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) following a closed head injury in pediatric patients is a rare condition, and an early spontaneous recanalization of this condition is extremely rare. A 10-year-old boy was admitted with a mild, intermittent headache and nausea five days after a bicycle accident. The brain computed tomography showed an epidural hematoma at the right occipital area with pneumocephalus due to a fracture of the occipital skull bone. The brain magnetic resonance imaging and the magnetic resonance venography demonstrated a flow signal loss from the right sigmoid sinus to the right jugular vein. The diagnosis was sigmoid sinus thrombosis, so close observations were selected as a treatment for the patient because of his gradually improving symptoms; however, he complained of vomiting 14 days the after conservative treatment. The patient was readmitted for a further examination of his symptoms. The laboratory and the gastroenterological examinations were normal. Due to concern regarding the worsening of the sigmoid sinus thrombosis, the brain magnetic resonance venography was rechecked and it revealed the recanalization of the venous flow in the sigmoid sinus and in the jugular vein.

Although Schmorl's nodes have been considered clinically insignificant, they might indicate an active symptomatic process or cause serious complications. In this study, we report an interesting case of complete separation of a vertebral body caused by an untreated Schmorl's node accompanying severe osteoporosis. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report in the published literature to evaluate the complete separation of a vertebral body associated with a Schmorl's node. ","747":"Postdural punctural headache (PDPH) following spinal anesthesia is due to intracranial hypotension caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, and it is occasionally accompanied by an intracranial hematoma. To the best of our knowledge, an intracranial chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) presenting with an intractable headache after a cervical epidural steroid injection (ESI) has not been reported. A 39-year-old woman without any history of trauma underwent a cervical ESI for a herniated nucleus pulposus at the C5-6 level. One month later, she presented with a severe headache that was not relieved by analgesic medication, which changed in character from being positional to non-positional during the preceding month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a CSDH along the left convexity. Emergency burr-hole drainage was performed and the headache abated. This report indicates that an intracranial CSDH should be considered a possible complication after ESI. In addition, the event of an intractable and changing PDPH after ESI suggests further evaluation for diagnosis of an intracranial hematoma. ","748":"Among the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysms, a unique aneurysm at the meatal loop inside the internal auditory meatus is extremely rare. The authors report a case of surgically treated total intrameatal AICA aneurysm. A 62-year-old female patient presenting with sudden bursting headache and neck pain was transferred to our department. Computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage at the basal, prepontine cistern and an aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery inside the internal auditory meatus. Surgery was performed by retrosigmoid craniotomy with unroofing of the internal auditory meatus. The aneurysm was identified between the seventh and eighth cranial nerve in the meatus and was removed from the canal and clipped with a small straight Sugita clip. After operation the patient experienced transient facial paresis and tinnitus but improved during follow up. ","749":"The most common neurologic manifestations of polycythemia vera (PV) are cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attacks, while cerebral hemorrhage or intracranial dissection has been rarely associated with PV. Here we report the first case of a 59-year-old patient with intracranial supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection causing cerebral infarction and concomitant subarachnoid hemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm rupture as clinical onset of PV. This case report discusses the possible mechanism and treatment of this extremely rare condition. ","750":"To investigate the incidence of corpus callosum injury (CCI) in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) using brain MRI. We also performed a review of the clinical characteristics associated with this injury. A total of 356 patients in the study were diagnosed with TBI, with 94 patients classified as having mild TBI. We included patients with mild TBI for further evaluation if they had normal findings via brain computed tomography (CT) scans and also underwent brain MRI in the acute phase following trauma. As assessed by brain MRI, CCI was defined as a high-signal lesion in T2 sagittal images and a corresponding low-signal lesion as determined by axial gradient echo (GRE) imaging. Based on these criteria, we divided patients into two groups for further analysis : Group I (TBI patients with CCI) and Group II (TBI patients without CCI). A total of 56 patients were enrolled in this study (including 16 patients in Group I and 40 patients in Group II). Analysis of clinical symptoms revealed a significant difference in headache severity between groups. Over 50% of patients in Group I experienced prolonged neurological symptoms including dizziness and gait disturbance and were more common in Group I than Group II (dizziness : 37 and 12% in Groups I and II, respectively; gait disturbance : 12 and 0% in Groups I and II, respectively). The incidence of CCI in patients with mild TBI was approximately 29%. We suggest that brain MRI is a useful method to reveal the cause of persistent symptoms and predict clinical prognosis. ","751":"Repeated computed tomography (CT) follow up for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is often performed. But there is debate the indication for repeated CT scans, especially in pediatric patients. Purpose of our study is to find risk factors of progression on repeated CT and delayed surgical intervention based on the repeated head CT. Between March, 2007 and December, 2013, 269 pediatric patients (age 0-18 years) had admitted to our hospital for head trauma. Patients were classified into 8 subgroups according to mechanisms of injury. Types, amount of hemorrhage and amount changes on repeated CT were analyzed as well as initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores. Within our cohort of 269 patients, 174 patients received repeat CT. There were progression in the amount of hemorrhage in 48 (27.6%) patients. Among various hemorrhage types, epidural hemorrhage (EDH) more than 10 cc measured in initial CT was found to be at risk of delayed surgical intervention significantly after routine repeated CT with or without neurological deterioration than other types of hemorrhage. Based on initial GCS, severe head trauma group (GCS 3-8) was at risk of delayed surgical intervention after routine repeated CT without change of clinical neurologic status. We suggest that the patients with EDH more than 10 cc or GCS below 9 should receive repeated head CT even though absence of significant clinical deterioration. ","752":"We compared the clinical and radiographic outcomes of stand-alone polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage and Zero-Profile anchored spacer (Zero-P) for single level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). We retrospectively reviewed 121 patients who underwent single level ACDF within 2 years (Jan 2011-Jan 2013) in a single institute. Total 50 patients were included for the analysis who were evaluated more than 2-year follow-up. Twenty-nine patients were allocated to the cage group (m : f=19 : 10) and 21 for Zero-P group (m : f=12 : 9). Clinical (neck disability index, visual analogue scale arm and neck) and radiographic (Cobb angle-segmental and global cervical, disc height, vertebral height) assessments were followed at pre-operative, immediate post-operative, post-3, 6, 12, and 24 month periods. Demographic features and the clinical outcome showed no difference between two groups. The change between final follow-up (24 months) and immediate post-op of Cobb-segmental angle (p=0.027), disc height (p=0.002), vertebral body height (p=0.033) showed statistically better outcome for the Zero-P group than the cage group, respectively. The Zero-Profile anchored spacer has some advantage after cage for maintaining segmental lordosis and lowering subsidence rate after single level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. ","753":"Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a relatively rare disease. Because of ambiguous clinical symptom, it is difficult for early diagnosis of OLF and subsequent treatment can be delayed or missed. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess the prevalence and distribution of thoracic OLF by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and coexisting spinal disease in Korean patients with back pain or leg pain. The sample included 2134 Korean patients who underwent MRI evaluation for back pain. The prevalence and distribution of thoracic OLF were assessed using lumbar MRI with whole spine sagittal images. Additionally, we examined the presence of coexisting lumbar and cervical diseases. The presence of thoracic OLF as well as clinical parameters such as age, sex, and surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The prevalence of thoracic OLF in total patients was 16.9% (360\/2134). The prevalence tended to increase with aging and was higher in women than in men. The lower thoracic segment of T10-11 was the most frequently affected segment. Of the 360 patients with OLF, 31.9% had coexisting herniated thoracic discs at the same level. Approximately 74% of the patients with OLF had coexisting lumbar and cervical disease. Nine (2.5%) of 360 OLF patients underwent surgery for thoracic lesion. The prevalenceof thoracic OLF was relatively higher than those of previous reports. And coexisting lumbar and cervical disease were very frequent. Therefore, we should check coexisting spinal diseases and the exact diagnostic localization of ossification besides lumbar disease. ","754":"Patients treated with surgical clipping for anterior communicating artery (A-com) aneurysm often complain of anosmia, which can markedly impede their quality of life. We introduce a simple and useful technique to reduce postoperative olfactory dysfunction in A-com aneurysm surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgical clipping for unruptured aneurysm from 2011-2013 by the same senior attending physician. Since March 2012, olfactory protection using gelfoam and fibrin glue was applied in A-com aneurysm surgery. Therefore we categorized patients in two groups from this time-protected group and unprotected group. Of the 63 enrolled patients, 16 patients showed postoperative olfactory dysfunction-including 8 anosmia patients (protected group : unprotected group=1 : 7) and 8 hyposmia patients (protected group : unprotected group=2 : 6). Thirty five patients who received olfactory protection during surgery showed a lower rate of anosmia (p=0.037, OR 10.516, 95% CI 1.159-95.449) and olfactory dysfunction (p=0.003, OR 8.693, 95% CI 2.138-35.356). Superior direction of the aneurysm was also associated with a risk of olfactory dysfunction (p=0.015, OR 5.535, 95% CI 1.390-22.039). Superior direction of aneurysm appears associated with postoperative olfactory dysfunction. Olfactory protection using gelfoam and fibrin glue could be a simple, safe, and useful method to preserve olfactory function during A-com aneurysm surgery.

But sometimes, there are limitations in these factors. In this study, we analyzed three central nervous system biomarkers in TBI patients, will discuss the roles and clinical applications of biomarkers in TBI. From July on 2013 to August on 2014, a total of 45 patients were included. The serum was obtained at the time of hospital admission, and biomarkers were extracted with centrifugal process. It was analyzed for the level of S-100 beta (S100B), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). This study included 33 males and 12 females with a mean age of 58.5 (19-84) years. TBI patients were classified into two groups. Group A was severe TBI with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 3-5 and Group B was mild TBI with GCS score 13-15. The median serum concentration of S100B, GFAP, and UCH-L1 in severe TBI were raised 5.1 fold, 5.5 fold, and 439.1 fold compared to mild injury, respectively. The serum levels of these markers correlated significantly with the injury severity and clinical outcome (p&lt;0.001). Increased level of markers was strongly predicted poor outcomes. S100B, GFAP, and UCH-L1 serum level of were significantly increased in TBI according to severity and associated clinical outcomes. Biomarkers have potential utility as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic adjuncts in the setting of TBI.

Anterior atlantoaxial subluxation in RA patients can lead to posterior neck pain or occipital headache because of compression of the C2 ganglion or nerve. Here, we report the successful treatment of a RA patient with occipital radiating headache using pulsed radiofrequency therapy at the C2 dorsal root ganglion. ","758":"Organized hematoma is a rare complication that can develop following gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Here, we describe 5 patients with growing organized hematomas that developed from completely obliterated AVMs several years after GKS. The patients were 15, 16, 30, 36, and 38 years old at the time of GKS, respectively, and 3 patients were female. Four AVMs were located in the lobe of the brain, and the remaining AVM were in the thalamus. Between 2-12 years after GKS, patients developed progressive symptoms such intractable headache or hemiparesis and enhancing mass lesions were identified. Follow-up visits revealed the slow expansion of the hematomas and surrounding edema. Steroids were ineffective, and thus surgery was performed. Histology revealed organized hematomas with a capsule, but there was no evidence of residual AVMs or vascular malformation. After surgery, the neurological symptoms of all patients improved and the surrounding edema resolved. However, the hematoma continued to expand and intraventricular hemorrhage developed in 1 patient whose hematoma was only partially removed. GKS for cerebral AVM can be complicated by growing, organized hematomas that develop after complete obliteration. Growing hematomas should be surgically evacuated if they are symptomatic. Radical resection of the hematoma capsule is also strongly recommended.

Patients with cleidocranial dysplasia often complain about undesirable esthetic appearance of their forehead and skull. Notwithstanding many studies of molecular, genetics and skeletal abnormalities of this congenial disorder, there have been very few written reports of cranioplasty involving cleidocranial dysplasia. Thus, we report a rare case of successful cranioplasty using a modified split calvarial graft technique in patient with cleidocranial dysplasia. ","760":"This report details a case of unexpected, severe post-operative cerebral edema following cranioplasty. We discuss the possible pathological mechanisms of this complication. A 50-year-old female was admitted to our department with sudden onset of stuporous consciousness. A brain computed tomography (CT) revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage with intracranial hemorrhage and subdural hematoma. Emergency decompressive craniectomy and aneurysmal neck clipping were performed. Following recovery, the decision was made to proceed with an autologous cranioplasty. The cranioplasty procedure was free of complications. An epidural drain was placed and connected to a suction system during skin closure to avoid epidural blood accumulation. However, following the procedure, the patient had a seizure in the recovery room. An emergency brain CT scan revealed widespread cerebral edema, and the catheter drain was clamped. The increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema were controlled with osmotic diuretics, corticosteroids, and antiepileptic drugs. The edema slowly subsided, but new low-density areas were noted in the brain on follow-up CT 1 week later. We speculated that placing the epidural drain on active suction may have caused an acute decrease in intracranial pressure and subsequent rapid expansion of the brain, which impaired autoregulation and led to reperfusion injury.

A retrospective study was performed for ankylosing spondylitis patients with fixed sagittal imbalance, who had undergone corrective osteotomy (PSO or SPO) at lumbar level. 87 patients were included in this study. 55 patients underwent PSO, 32 patients underwent SPO. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 41.7 years (21-70 years). Of the 87 patients, 15 patients had intraoperative dural tears. The overall incidence of dural tears was 17.2%. The incidence of dural tears during PSO was 20.0%, SPO was 12.5%. There was significant difference in the incidence of dural tears based on surgical procedures (PSO vs. SPO) (p&lt;0.05). The dural tears ranged in size from 12 to 221 mm(2). A nine of 15 patients had the relatively small dural tears, underwent direct repair via watertight closure. The remaining 6 patients had the large dural tears, consequently direct repair was impossible. The large dural tears were repaired with an on-lay graft of muscle, fascia or fat harvested from the adjacent operation site. All patients had a successful repair with no patient requiring reoperation for the cerebrospinal fluid leak. The overall incidence of dural tears during PSO or SPO for ankylosing spondylitis with kyphotic deformity was 17.2%. The risk factor of dural tears was complexity of surgery.

Recently, the pedicled nasoseptal flap has undergone many modifications and eventually proved to be valuable and efficient. However, using these nasoseptal flaps in all patients who undergo transsphenoidal surgery, including those who had none or only minor CSF leakage, appears to be overly invasive and time-consuming. Patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal tumor surgery within a 5 year-period were reviewed. Since 2009, we classified the intraoperative CSF leakage into grades from 0 to 3. Sellar floor reconstruction was tailored to each leak grade. We did not use any tissue grafts such as abdominal fat and did not include any procedures of CSF diversions such as lumbar drainage. Among 200 cases in 188 patients (147 pituitary adenoma and 41 other pathologies), intraoperative CSF leakage was observed in 27.4% of 197 cases : 14.7% Grade 1, 4.6% Grade 2a, 3.0% Grade 2b, and 5.1% Grade 3. Postoperative CSF leakage was observed in none of the cases. Septal bone buttress was used for Grade 1 to 3 leakages instead of any other foreign materials. Pedicled nasoseptal flap was used for Grades 2b and 3 leakages. Unused septal bones and nasoseptal flaps were repositioned. Modified classification of intraoperative CSF leaks and tailored repair technique in a multilayered fashion using an en-bloc harvested septal bone and vascularized nasoseptal flaps is an effective and reliable method for the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks.

The 10 cases included two with a single lobar hemorrhage and eight with multifocal lobar hemorrhages. In all of the cases, the hemorrhage bled into the subarachnoid space. Pathological examinations of the 10 cases revealed microaneurysms in two, double barrel-like changes in four, multifocal arteriolar clusters in five, obliterative onion skin-like intimal changes in four, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessels in seven, neurofibrillary tangles in eight, and senile plaques in five cases. CAA-related CLHs were located primarily in the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.

However, there is insufficient evidence from experimental studies to conclude that pFS directly induces hippocampal injury. We studied cognitive function and histological changes in a rat model and investigated which among pFS, HIE, or a dual pathologic effect is most detrimental to the health of children. A rat model of HIE at postnatal day (PD) 7 and a pFS model at PD10 were used. Behavioral and cognitive functions were investigated by means of weekly open field tests from postnatal week (PW) 3 to PW7, and by daily testing with the Morris water maze test at PW8. Pathological changes in the hippocampus were observed in the control, pFS, HIE, and HIE+pFS groups at PW9. The HIE priming group showed a seizure-prone state. The Morris water maze test revealed a decline in cognitive function in the HIE and HIE+pFS groups compared with the pFS and control groups. Additionally, the HIE and HIE+pFS groups showed significant hippocampal neuronal damage, astrogliosis, and volume loss, after maturation. The pFS alone induced minimal hippocampal neuronal damage without astrogliosis or volume loss. Our findings suggest that pFS alone causes no considerable memory or behavioral impairment, or cellular change. In contrast, HIE results in lasting memory impairment and neuronal damage, gliosis, and tissue loss. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the developing brain concerning conditions caused by HIE or pFS.

Postoperative CT scans of 183 titanium pedicle screws (85 lumbar and 98 thoracic from T1 to L5) placed into 2 cadavers and 18 patients were assessed. A specially designed guide-pin with a marker was inserted into the pedicle to identify the correct starting point (2 mm lateral to the center of the pedicle) and aiming point (center of the pedicle isthmus) in posteroanterior and lateral X-rays. After radiographically confirming the exact starting and aiming points desired, a gearshift was inserted into the pedicle from the starting point into the vertebral body through the center of pedicle isthmus. Ninety-nine percent (181\/183) of screws were contained within the pedicle (total 183 pedicle screws : 98 thoracic pedicle screws and 85 lumbar screws). Only two of 183 (1.0%) thoracic pedicle screws demonstrated breach (1 lateral in a patient and 1 medial in a cadaver specimen). None of the pedicle breaches were associated with neurologic or other clinical sequelae.

","772":"Treatment of Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) from solid cancers has not advanced noticeably since the introduction of intra-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemotherapy in the 1970's. The marginal survival benefit and difficulty of intrathecal chemotherapy injection has hindered its wide spread use. Even after the introduction of intraventricular chemotherapy with Ommaya reservoir, frequent development of CSF flow disturbance, manifested as increased intracranial pressure (ICP), made injected drug to be distributed unevenly and thus, the therapy became ineffective. Systemic chemotherapy for LMC has been limited as effective CSF concentration can hardly be achieved except high dose methotrexate (MTX) intravenous administration. However, the introduction of small molecular weight target inhibitors for primary cancer treatment has changed the old concept of 'blood-brain barrier' as the ultimate barrier to systemically administered drugs. Conventional oral administration achieves an effective concentration at the nanomolar level. Furthermore, many studies report that a combined treatment of target inhibitor and intra-CSF chemotherapy significantly prolongs patient survival. Ventriculolumbar perfusion (VLP) chemotherapy has sought to increase drug delivery to the subarachnoid CSF space even in patients with disturbed CSF flow. Recently authors performed phase 1 and 2 clinical trial of VLP chemotherapy with MTX, and 3\/4th of patients with increased ICP got controlled ICP and the survival was prolonged. Further trials are required with newly available drugs for CSF chemotherapy.

However, the inevitable situation of vertebral artery injury or unfavorable bone structure may necessitate the use of unilateral C1LM-C2P. This study compares the fusion rates of the C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screw in the unilateral and bilateral methods. Over five years, C1LM-C2P was performed in 25 patients with AAI in our institute. Preoperative studies including cervical X-ray, three-dimensional computed tomography (CT), CT angiogram, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed. To evaluate bony fusion, measurements of the atlanto-dental interval (ADI) and CT scans were performed in the preoperative period, immediate postoperative period, and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Unilateral C1LM-C2P was performed in 11 patients (44%). The need to perform unilateral C1LM-C2P was due to anomalous course of the vertebral artery in eight patients (73%) and severe degenerative arthritis in three patients (27%).

For pediatric MMD patients, younger age or longer duration of disease is the key factor among the prognostic factors for bad neurological outcomes. Hence, 'the earlier, the better' is the most precious rule for treatment. Protection from neurological insult is very critical and foremost important to improve cognitive outcome.

However, its clinical features and outcome have only been elucidated during the last few years. In this review, the angiographic definition of PCA stenosis is summarized. The clinical features are elucidated as being either early-onset or delayed-onset, according to the time of PCA stenosis diagnosis in reference to the anterior circulation revascularization surgeries. The surgical strategy and hypothesis on the mechanism of PCA stenosis is also briefly mentioned. It appears that some MMD patients may show PCA stenosis during the early or late course of the disease and that the presenting symptoms may vary.

Studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MMD have mostly focused on mechanical stress on vessels, endothelium, and the relationship to atherosclerosis. In this review, we discuss SNPs studies targeting the genetic etiology of MMD. Genetic analyses in familial MMD and genome-wide association studies represent promising strategies for elucidating the pathophysiology of this condition. This review also discusses future research directions, not only to offer new insights into the origin of MMD, but also to enhance our understanding of the genetic aspects of MMD. There have been several SNP studies of MMD. Current SNP studies suggest a genetic contribution to MMD, but further reliable and replicable data are needed. A large cohort or family-based design would be important. Modern SNP studies of MMD depend on novel genetic, experimental, and database methods that will hopefully hasten the arrival of a consensus conclusion. ","788":"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an arteriopathy of the intracranial circulation predominantly affecting the branches of the internal carotid arteries. Heterogeneity in presentation, progression and response to therapy has prompted intense study to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Recent progress in the development of moyamoya-related biomarkers has stimulated marked interest in this field. Biomarkers can be defined as biologically derived agents-such as specific molecules or unique patterns on imaging-that can identify the presence of disease or help to predict its course. This article reviews the current categories of biomarkers relevant to MMD-including proteins, cells and genes-along with potential limitations and applications for their use. ","789":"Moyamoya-like vasculopathy develops in association with various systemic diseases and conditions, which is termed moyamoya syndrome. Relatively common diseases and conditions are related to moyamoya syndrome, including neurofibromatosis type 1, Down syndrome, thyroid disease, and cranial irradiation. Moyamoya syndrome shares phenotypical characteristics with idiopathic moyamoya disease. However, they differ in other details, including clinical presentations, natural history, and treatment considerations. The study of moyamoya syndrome can provide clinicians and researchers with valuable knowledge and insight. Although it is infrequently encountered in clinical practice, moyamoya-like vasculopathy can severely complicate outcomes for patients with various underlying diseases when the clinician fails to expect or diagnose moyamoya syndrome development. Furthermore, moyamoya syndrome could be used as a doorway to more enigmatic moyamoya disease in research. More comprehensive survey and investigation are required to uncover the secrets of all the moyamoya-like phenomena. ","790":"The nonprogressive unilateral intracranial arteriopathy known as transient (focal) cerebral arteriopathy is not a well-recognized arteriopathy among practitioners of Korea and Japan, although it cannot be easily differentiated from early moyamoya disease. This review summarizes the nomenclature, pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, clinico-radiological features, and management of nonprogressive (reversible or stable) unilateral arteriopathy based on the relevant literature and our own experiences. Nonprogressive unilateral arteriopathy should be strongly suspected in children presenting with basal ganglia infarction and arterial beading. The early identification of patients likely to have nonprogressive or progressive arteriopathy would ensure proper management and guide further research for secondary stroke prevention. ","791":"Pediatric stroke is relatively rare but may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Along with the advance of brain imaging technology and clinical awareness, diagnosis of pediatric stroke is increasing wordwide. Pediatric stroke differs from adults in variable risk factor\/etiologies, diverse and nonspecific clinical presentation depending on ages. This review will be discussed pediatric stroke focusing on their clinical presentations, diagnosis and etiologies\/risk factors. ","792":"There have been a few studies reporting the epidemiology of moyamoya disease in Korea. Previous studies revealed relatively high prevalence and incidence of moyamoya disease in Korea and Japan. This study was designed to provide the latest epidemiologic information of moyamoya disease in Korea. We analyzed a database comprising of 50 million people covered in Korea by the National Health Insurance Service to calculate the prevalence. The incidence was estimated by eliminating the duplicated records of previous 3 years. We summarized the prevalence and incidence according to age, sex, and local distribution. In addition, the chronological changes were demonstrated with direct standardization using the 2010 population structure information. The standardized prevalence was 6.5 per 100000 persons in 2005, which was increased to 18.1 in 2013. In the same period, standardized incidence was increased from 2.7 to 4.3 per 100000 persons. The prevalence for men was 4.9 and 8.3 for women in 2005. In 2013, the prevalence had increased for men and women to 13.8 and 25.3, respectively. The incidence for men and women was 2.2 and 3.2, respectively, in 2005. It had increased to 3.5 and 5.7, respectively. The mean age of patients was 33.5 in 2005 and increased to 42.5 in 2013. The peak prevalent age group had shifted slightly to the older age groups, with chronologically consistent female predominance. The prevalence was highest in Jeollabuk province and lowest in Ulsan city. ","793":"","794":"We wish to show our experiance with threating a rare congenital brain malformation-encephalocele. It is a protusion of brain matter with greater incidence in the Far East. Our case is even more curious because of the site of occurrence-frontobasal. Most of encephalocele occur in the occipital region. In this article we report a case of a 57-year-old woman, without deformations on the face, which had epileptic seizures and in spite of receiving antiepileptic drug. She was also frequently treated for sinusitis. She never had rhinoliquorrhea, nor was she diagnosed to have meningitis. In the last few years she had difficulty breathing on her right nostril. After she was diagnosed with encephalocele and treated surgically her recovery was complete and she is without the seizures. ","795":"Chronic subdural hematomas mainly occur amongst elderly people and usually develop after minor head injuries. In younger patients, subdural collections may be related to hypertension, coagulopathies, vascular abnormalities, and substance abuse. Different techniques can be used for the surgical treatment of symptomatic chronic subdural hematomas : single or double burr-hole evacuation, with or without subdural drainage, twist-drill craniostomies and classical craniotomies. Failure of the brain to re-expand, pneumocephalus, incomplete evacuation, and recurrence of the fluid collection are common complications following these procedures. Acute subdural hematomas may also occur. Rarely reported hemorrhagic complications include subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular, and remote cerebellar hemorrhages. The causes of such uncommon complications are difficult to explain and remain poorly understood. Overdrainage and intracranial hypotension, rapid brain decompression and shift of the intracranial contents, cerebrospinal fluid loss, vascular dysregulation and impairment of venous outflow are the main mechanisms discussed in the literature. In this article we report three cases of different post-operative intracranial bleeding and review the related literature. ","796":"Cervical epidural steroid injection is indicated for radicular symptoms with or without axial neck pain. Complications are rare but can be serious. Here, we report the case of a 54-year-old man with cervical radicular pain who was treated with cervical epidural steroid injection. Injection was administered twice under fluoroscopic guidance with the loss-of-resistance technique using air to confirm the epidural space. After the second procedure, the patient complained of severe persistent headache and was diagnosed with pneumocephalus on brain computed tomography. The patient returned home without any neurological complication, after a few days of conservative treatment. Though, a fluoroscopic guidance cervical epidural injection is also known to diminish the risk of complications. Physicians should always keep in mind that it does not guarantee safety, particularly in the cervical region, related to its anatomical considerations. ","797":"Spontaneous spinal subdural hematoma is reported at a rare level of incidence, and is frequently associated with underlying coagulopathy or those receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents; some cases accompany concomitant intracranial hemorrhage. The spontaneous development of spinal subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is a neurological emergency; therefore, early diagnosis, the discontinuation of anticoagulant, and urgent surgical decompression are required to enable neurological recovery. In this report, we present a simultaneous spinal subdural hematoma and cranial subarachnoid hemorrhage, which mimicked an aneurysmal origin in a female patient who had been taking warfarin due to aortic valve replacement surgery. ","798":"Bone cement augmentation procedures have been getting more position as a minimally invasive surgical option for osteoporotic spinal fractures. However, complications related to these procedures have been increasingly reported. We describe a case of bone cement dislodgement following cement augmentation procedure for osteoporotic spinal fracture by reviewing the patient's medical records, imaging results and related literatures. A 73-year-old woman suffering back and buttock pain following a fall from level ground was diagnosed as an osteoporotic fracture of the 11th thoracic spine. Percutaneous kyphoplasty was performed for this lesion. Six weeks later, the patient complained of a recurrence of back and buttock pain. Radiologic images revealed superior dislodgement of bone cement through the 11th thoracic superior endplate with destruction of the lower part of the 10th thoracic spine. Staged anterior and posterior fusion was performed. Two years postoperatively, the patient carries on with her daily living without any significant disability. Delayed bone cement dislodgement can occur as one of complications following bone cement augmentation procedure for osteoporotic spinal fracture. It might be related to the presence of intravertebral cleft, lack of interdigitation of bone cement with the surrounding trabeculae, and possible damage of endplate during ballooning procedure. ","799":"Supratentorial dermoid cysts are uncommon to develop in the cavernous sinus. We present a ruptured dermoid cyst of the cavernous sinus extending into the posterior fossa. The patient was a 32-year-old female who complained occipital headache, blurred vision, and tinnitus over 4 years. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed an enhanced tumor in the right cavernous sinus extending into the right temporal base and the posterior fossa with findings of ruptured cyst. Surgical resection was performed, and pathological findings were confirmed to be a dermoid cyst. We report a second case with ruptured dermoid cyst of the cavernous sinus extending into the posterior fossa. ","800":"Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt complication is a major obstacle in the management of hydrocephalus. To study the differences of VP shunt complications between children and adults, we analyzed shunt revision surgery performed at our hospital during the past 10 years. Patients who had undergone shunt revision surgery from January 2001 to December 2010 were evaluated retrospectively by chart review about age distribution, etiology of hydrocephalus, and causes of revision. Patients were grouped into below and above 20 years old. Among 528 cases of VP shunt surgery performed in our hospital over 10 years, 146 (27.7%) were revision surgery. Infection and obstruction were the most common causes of revision. Fifty-one patients were operated on within 1 month after original VP shunt surgery. Thirty-six of 46 infection cases were operated before 6 months after the initial VP shunt. Incidence of shunt catheter fracture was higher in younger patients compared to older. Two of 8 fractured catheters in the younger group were due to calcification and degradation of shunt catheters with fibrous adhesion to surrounding tissue. The complications of VP shunts were different between children and adults. The incidence of shunt catheter fracture was higher in younger patients. Degradation of shunt catheter associated with surrounding tissue calcification could be one of the reasons of the difference in facture rates.

For treatment of germinoma, relatively low radiation doses with or without chemotherapy show excellent 10 year survival rate of 80-100%. Past studies showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with focal radiotherapy resulted in unacceptably high rates of periventricular tumor recurrence. The use of generous radiation volume which covers the whole ventricular space with later boost treatment to primary site is considered as standard treatment of intracranial germinomas. For non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT), 10-year overall survival rate is still much inferior than that of intracranial germinoma despite intensive chemotherapy and high-dose radiotherapy. Craniospinal radiotherapy combined with cisplatin-based chemotherapy provides the best treatment outcome for NGGCT; 60-70% of overall survival rate. There is a debate on the surgical role whether surgery can contribute to improved treatment outcome of NGGCT when added to combined chemoradiotherapy. Because higher dose of radiotherapy is required for treatment of NGGCT than for germinoma, it is tested whether whole ventricular irradiation can replace craniospinal irradiation in intermediate risk group of NGGCT to minimize radiation-related late toxicity in the recent studies. To minimize the treatment-related neural deficit and late sequelae while maintaining long-term survival rate of ICGCT patients, optimized administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be selected. Use of technically upgraded radiotherapy modalities such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy or proton beam therapy is expected to bring an improved neurocognitive outcome with longitudinal assessment of the patients.

Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) revealed two rim-enhancing lesions on the pons and occipital lobe, and chest computed tomography showed randomly distributed miliary nodules. The tentative diagnosis was tuberculosis (TB) of the brain and lung. She complained of right hemiparesis and worsening general weakness after taking the anti-TB medication. On the monthly follow-up images, the enhanced lesions were enlarged with increased perfusion and choline\/creatinine ratio, suggesting a high grade glioma. A surgical resection was completed to diagnose the occipital lesion, and the tuberculoma was pathologically confirmed by a positive TB-polymerase chain reaction. The anti-TB medication was continued for 13 months. A follow-up MRI showed decreased size of the brain lesions associated with perilesional edema, and the clinical symptoms had improved. Brain tuberculoma could be aggravated mimicking brain malignancy during administration of anti-TB medication. This paradoxical response can be effectively managed by continuing the anti-TB drugs.

We report a patient who underwent bilateral DBS of the PPN and subthalamic nucleus (STN). He suffered from freezing of gait (FOG), bradykinesia, rigidity and mild tremors. The patient underwent bilateral DBS of the PPN and STN. We compared the benefits of PPN-DBS and STN-DBS using motor and gait subscores. The PPN-DBS provided modest improvements in the gait disorder and freezing episodes, while the STN-DBS failed to improve the dominant problems. This special case suggests that PPN-DBS may have a unique role in ameliorating the locomotor symptoms and has the potential to provide improvement in FOG.

It is characterized by herniation of cerebral tissue of the temporal lobe through a defect of the skull base localized in the middle fossa. At the time of first presentation the patient complained about recurrent nasal discharge of clear fluid which had begun some weeks earlier. She also reported that three months earlier she had for the first time suffered from a generalized seizure. In a first therapeutic attempt an endoscopic endonasal approach to the sphenoid sinus was performed. An attempt to randomly seal the suspicious area failed. After frontotemporal craniotomy, it was possible to localize the encephalocele and the underlying bone defect. The herniated brain tissue was resected and the dural defect was closed with fascia of the temporalis muscle. In summary, the combination of recurrent rhinorrhea and a first-time seizure should alert specialists of otolaryngology, neurology and neurosurgery of a temporo-sphenoidal encephalocele as a possible cause. Treatment is likely to require a neurosurgical approach. ","812":"We report the case of 57-year-old woman diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and lumbar disk herniation (LDH). She had left leg weakness and foot numbness, foot deformity (muscle atrophy, high arch, and clawed toes). The lumbar spine MRI showed LDH at L4-5. Additionally, electrophysiology results were consistent with chronic peripheral motor-sensory polyneuropathy (axonopathy).

Temporal bone invasion by VS is extremely rare. We report 51-year-old man who revealed temporal bone destruction beyond IAC by unilateral VS. The bony destruction extended anteriorly to the carotid canal and inferiorly to the jugular foramen. On histopathologic examination, the tumor showed typical benign schwannoma and did not show any unusual vascularity or malignant feature. Facial nerve was severely compressed and distorted by tumor, which unevenly eroded temporal bone in surgical field. Vestibular schwannoma with atypical invasion of temporal bone can be successfully treated with combined translabyrinthine and lateral suboccipiral approach without facial nerve dysfunction. Early detection and careful dissection of facial nerve with intraoperative monitoring should be considered during operation due to severe adhesion and distortion of facial nerve by tumor and eroded temporal bone.

The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence and risk factors of postoperative CSDH after surgical clipping for unruptured anterior circulation aneurysms. This retrospective study included 518 patients from a single tertiary institute from January 2008 to December 2013. CSDH was defined as subdural hemorrhage which needed surgical treatment. The degree of brain atrophy was estimated using the bicaudate ratio (BCR) index. We used uni- and multivariate analyses to identify risk factors correlated with CSDH. Sixteen (3.1%) patients experienced postoperative CSDH that required burr hole drainage surgery. In univariate analyses, male gender (p&lt;0.001), size of aneurysm (p=0.030), higher BCR index (p=0.004), and the use of antithrombotic medication (p=0.006) were associated with postoperative CSDH. In multivariate analyses using logistic regression test, male gender [odds ratio (OR) 4.037, range 1.287-12.688], high BCR index (OR 5.376, range 1.170-25.000), and the use of antithrombotic medication (OR 4.854, range 1.658-14.085) were associated with postoperative CSDH (p&lt;0.05). Postoperative subdural fluid collection and arachnoid plasty were not showed statistically significant difference in this study. The incidence of CSDH was 3.1% in unruptured anterior circulation aneurysm surgery.

We present a retrospective case series of 5 females at our institutions (age ranged 21-72 years, mean 54.6 years) diagnosed with LD of an intracranial meningioma after surgery between 1998 and 2013. A database search revealed 45 cases with LD of meningioma in the English literature. Characteristic features were analyzed and compared. The incidence rate at our institutions of LD of meningioma was 0.9% (5\/534). World Health Organization (WHO) grade was distributed as follows: I : 2, II : 2, and III : 1. Time to LD ranged from 2.5 months to 6.9 years; the patient with WHO grade III had the shortest interval to LD. The patient with an intraventricular meningioma (WHO grade II) had the second shortest interval to LD (1.7 years), and simultaneously revealed both LD and extraneuronal metastases. Four of 5 patients showed a disease progression, with the survival ranging from 1 month to 3.8 years after LD. Based on the literature, the initial tumor was an intraventricular meningioma in 9 patients, and their time to LD was shorter on average (mean 1.9 years). Histologically, 26 of 45 (58%) were initially diagnosed with a WHO grade II or III meningioma, and 6 of 19 patients (32%) with WHO grade I revealed malignant transformation. This study shows that intraventricular location and histologically aggressive features seem to increase the chance of LD of meningioma.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and long-term angiographic results of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms treated with coil embolization. Between January 2002 and December 2012, 53 wide-necked aneurysms treated with coil embolization were selected. Forty were female, and 13 were male. Twenty eight (52.8%) were ruptured aneurysms, and 25 (47.2%) were unruptured aneurysms. The patents' medical and radiological records were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 53 aneurysms, coiling alone was employed in 45 (84.9%) and stent-assisted coiling was done in 8 (15.1%). The initial angiographic results revealed Raymond class 1 (complete occlusion) in 30 (56.6%) cases, Raymond class 2 (residual neck) in 18 (34.0%) cases, and Raymond class 3 (residual sac) in 5 (9.4%) cases. The mean angiographic follow-up period was 37.9 months (12-120 months). At the last angiographies, Raymond class 1 was seen in 26 (49.1%) cases, Raymond class 2 in 16 (30.2%), and Raymond class 3 in 11 (20.8%). Angiographic recurrence occurred in 22 (41.5%) patients, with minor recurrence in 7 (13.2%) cases and major recurrence in 15 (28.3%). Retreatment was performed in 8 cases (15.1%). A suboptimal result on the initial angiography was a significant predictor of recurrence in this study (p=0.03).

","825":"Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by unilateral facial nerve dysfunction. The usual cause involves vascular compression of the seventh cranial nerve, but compression by an artery passing through the facial nerve is very unusual. A 20-year-old man presented with left facial spasm that had persisted for 4 years. Compression of the left facial nerve root exit zone by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) was revealed on magnetic resonance angiography. During microvascular decompression surgery, penetration of the distal portion of the facial nerve root exit zone by the AICA was observed. At the penetrating site, the artery was found to have compressed the facial nerve and to be immobilized. The penetrated seventh cranial nerve was longitudinally split about 2 mm. The compressing artery was moved away from the penetrating site and the decompression was secured by inserting Teflon at the operative site. Although the facial spasm disappeared in the immediate postoperative period, the patient continued to show moderate facial weakness. At postoperative 12 months, the facial weakness had improved to a mild degree. Prior to performing microvascular decompression of HFS, surgeons should be aware of a possibility for rare complex anatomy, such as compression by an artery passing through the facial nerve, which cannot be observed by modern imaging techniques.

A 63-year-old man, who had undergone decompression of L4-5 for spinal stenosis 4 days previously in the other hospital, visted the emergency department with progressive weakness in the left leg and hypoesthesia below sensory level T7 on the right side. He had been cured of lung cancer with chemotherapy and radiation therapy 10 years previously, but detailed information of radiotherapy was not available. Whole spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed fatty marrow change from T1 to T8, most likely due to previous irradiation. The T2-weighted MR image showed a high-signal T4-5 spinal cord lesion surrounded by a low signal rim, and the T1-weighted MR image showed focal high signal intensity with focal enhancement. The radiological diagnosis was vascular disorders with suspicious bleeding. Surgical removal was refused by the patient. With rehabilitation, the patient could walk independently without assistance 2 months later. Considering radiation induced change at thoracic vertebrae, vascular disorders may be induced by irradiation. If the spinal cord was previously irradiated, radiation induced vascular disorders needs to be considered. ","828":"Ganglioneuromas are benign tumors. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice with very good prognosis. However, neuroblastomatous malignant transformation of ganglioneuromas was previously reported. We report a patient with spinal neuroblastoma recurrent from a ganglioneuroblastoma after disease free survival of 13 years. This is one of the rare examples of spinal neuroblastoma and to our knowledge the second case report with malignant transformation from a ganglioneuroblastoma or a ganglioneuroma.

Metastasis involving the clivus has previously been described in only two case reports. In skull metastasis, the breast and prostate are the most common primary foci, while metastasis from gastric carcinoma is extremely rare. A review of the English literature revealed only one published case of clivus metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma. There is no literature thoroughly explaining the differential diagnosis between chordoma and metastasis.

A 30-year-old female arrived at the emergency room with a sudden headache and left sided weakness and sensory loss. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with breast cancer 1 year prior, and subsequently underwent a breast conserving mastectomy with whole breast radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with tamoxifen. At the time of admission, computed tomography showed a small acute intracerebral hemorrhage at the right parietal cortex, and magnetic resonance imaging showed that a dural AVF at the SSS with a prominent and tortuous venous enhancement along the centrum semiovale was present. Cerebral angiography showed that the dural AVF at the mid-portion of the SSS with meningeal arterial feeding vessels entering the wall of the SSS, then draining through the dilated cortical veins. Our patient had no signs of active malignancy or any abnormalities in her coagulation profile, so it can be concluded that the tamoxifen was the likely cause of the SSS thrombosis and dural AVF. The dural AVF was treated by an endovascular coil embolization for the arterialized segment of the SSS. The patient dramatically recovered favorably from left side motor and sensory deficit. The best clinical approach is to screen potential patients of tamoxifen hormonal therapy and educate them on the sign and symptoms of life threatening thromboembolic events while taking tamoxifen. ","831":"The potassium disturbance associated with thiopental continuous infusion in neurosurgical patients is well known. However, the effect of propofol continuous infusion on serum potassium levels has not been investigated extensively. We reviewed the medical records of 60 consecutive patients who received coma therapy or deep sedation for intracranial pressure control using either thiopental or propofol between January 2010 and January 2012. The overall incidence of hypokalemia (K&lt;3.5 mmol\/L) was comparable between thiopental and propofol groups (89.2% vs. 82.6%). But, the incidence of moderate to severe hypokalemia (K&lt;3.0 mmol\/L) was significantly higher in thiopental group (51.4% vs. 13.0%, p=0.003). The lowest potassium level (2.9 mmol\/L vs. 3.2 mmol\/L, p=0.020) was lower in thiopental group. The patients in the thiopental group required greater potassium replacement than the propofol group patients (0.08 mmol\/kg\/h vs. 0.02 mmol\/kg\/h, p&lt;0.001). On multivariate analysis, thiopental [odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 7.31 (1.78-27.81); p=0.005] was associated with moderate to severe hypokalemia during continuous infusion. The incidence of rebound hyperkalemia (K&gt;5.0 mmol\/L, 32.4% vs. 4.3%, p=0.010) and the peak potassium concentration (4.8 mmol\/L vs. 4.2 mmol\/L, p=0.037) after the cessation of therapy were higher in thiopental group. On multivariate analysis, thiopental [8.82 (1.00-77.81); p=0.049] and duration of continuous infusion [1.02 (1.00-1.04); p=0.016] were associated with rebound hyperkalemia once therapy was discontinued. Propofol was less frequently associated with moderate to severe hypokalemia after induction and rebound hyperkalemia following the cessation of continuous infusion than thiopental. ","832":"Tremor is a common movement disorder that interferes with daily living. Since the medication for tremor has some limitations, surgical intervention is needed in many patients. In certain patients who cannot undergo aggressive surgical intervention, Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) is a safe and effective alternative. From June 2012 to August 2013, 7 patients with an intractable tremor underwent GKT. Four of these 7 patients had medical comorbidities, and 3 patients refused to undergo traditional surgery. Each patient was evaluated with the modified Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (TRS) along with analysis of handwriting samples. All of the patients underwent GKT with a maximal dose of 130 Gy to the left ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus. Follow-up brain MRI was performed after 3 to 8 months of GKT, and evaluation with the TRS was also performed. Six patients showed objective improvement in the TRS score. Excluding one patient who demonstrated tremor progression, there was 28.9% improvement in the TRS score. However, five patients showed subjective improvement in their symptoms. On comparing the TRS scores between follow-up periods of more and less than 4 months, the follow-up TRS score at more than 4 months of GKT was significantly improved compared to that at less than 4 months of GKT. Follow-up MRI showed radiosurgical changes in 5 patients. GKT with a maximal dose of 130 Gy to the VIM is a safe procedure that can replace other surgical procedures.

Nevertheless, there is insufficient literature on retrolisthesis compared to anterolisthesis. The purpose of this study is to clarify the clinical features of retrolisthesis, and its developmental mechanism associated with a compensatory role in sagittal imbalance of the lumbar spine. From 2003 to 2012, 230 Korean patients who underwent spinal surgery in our department under the impression of degenerative lumbar spinal disease were enrolled. All participants were divided into four groups : 35 patients with retrolisthesis (group R), 32 patients with simultaneous retrolisthesis and anterolisthesis (group R+A), 76 patients with anterolisthesis (group A), and 87 patients with non-translation (group N). The clinical features and the sagittal parameters related to retrolisthesis were retrospectively analyzed based on the patients' medical records. There were different clinical features and developmental mechanisms between retrolisthesis and anterolisthesis. The location of retrolisthesis was affected by the presence of simultaneous anterolisthesis, even though it predominantly manifest in L3. The relative lower pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and lumbar lordosis compared to anterolisthesis were related to the generation of retrolisthesis, with the opposite observations of patients with anterolisthesis. Retrolisthesis acts as a compensatory mechanism for moving the gravity axis posteriorly for sagittal imbalance in the lumbar spine under low pelvic incidence and insufficient intra-spinal compensation. ","835":"For improving the drawbacks of previous thoracolumbar spine trauma classification, the Spine Trauma Study Group was developed new classification, Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS). The simplicity of this scoring system makes it useful clinical application. However, considering criteria of Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA), the usefulness of TLICS system is still controversial in the treatment decision of thoracolumbar spine injury. Total 100 patients, who admitted to our hospital due to acute traumatic thoracolumbar injury, were enrolled. In 45, surgical treatment was performed and surgical treatment was decided following the criteria of HIRA in all patients. With assessing of TLICS score and Denis's classification, the treatment guidelines of TLICS and Denis's classification were applied to the criteria of Korean HIRA. According to the Denis's three-column spine system, numbers of patients with 2 or 3 column injuries were 94. Only 45 of 94 patients (47.9%) with middle column injury fulfilled the criteria of HIRA. According to TLICS system, operation required fractures (score&gt;4) were 31 and all patients except one fulfilled the criteria of HIRA. Conservative treatment required fractures (score&lt;4) were 52 and borderline fracture (score=4) were 17. The TLICS system is very useful system for decision of surgical indication in acute traumatic thoracolumbar injury. However, the decision of treatment in TLICS score 4 should be carefully considered. Furthermore, definite criteria of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injury may be necessary because the differentiation of PLC injury between TLICS score 2 and 3 is very difficult. ","836":"Removal of blood from subarachnoid space with a lumbar drainage (LD) may decrease development of cerebral vasospasm. We evaluated the effectiveness of a LD for a clinical vasospasm and outcomes after clipping of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Between July 2008 and July 2013, 234 patients were included in this study. The LD group consisted of 126 patients, 108 patients in the non LD group. We investigated outcomes as follow : 1) clinical vasospasm, 2) angioplasty, 3) cerebral infarction, 4) Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) score at discharge, 5) GOS score at 6-month follow-up, and 6) mortality. Clinical vasospasm occurred in 19% of the LD group and 42% of the non LD group (p&lt;0.001). Angioplasty was performed in 17% of the LD group and 38% of the non LD group (p=0.001). Cerebral infarctions were detected in 29% and 54% of each group respectively (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of GOS score 5 at 6 month follow-up in the LD group was 69%, and it was 58% in the non LD group (p=0.001). Mortality rate showed 5% and 10% in each group respectively. But, there was no difference in shunt between the two groups. LD after aneurysmal SAH shows marked reduction of clinical vasospasm and need for angioplasty. With this technique we have shown favorable GOS score at 6 month follow-up. ","837":"We reviewed the feasibility, safety and efficacy as well as the clinical outcome and long-term angiographic results of endovascular treatment (EVT) of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms. A total of 429 ACoA aneurysms in 426 patients were treated using coil embolization between March 1996 and October 2010 in a single institution. Pretreatment aneurysmal features were checked using angiogram. We had usually used tailored steam shaped microcatheter according to individual angiographic architectures. Immediate postembolization outcomes were evaluated using an angiographic outcome scale and clinical evaluation was performed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Postembolization angiograms demonstrated total occlusion of aneurysm in 290 of 429 (67.6%) aneurysms, neck remnant in 80 (18.6%) and body filling in 59 (13.8%). Dome direction and aneurysm angle was not associated with initial angiographic outcomes. The procedure-related morbidity rate was 0.9% (4 of 429). Clinical and imaging follow-up more than 6 months were available in 382 (89.0%) patients with a mean of 26.2 months. Overall rate of major recanalization was 7.9% (30 of 382) and all of them were retreated without complications. At the last follow-up, 233 (99.2%) of 235 patients had GOS of 5 in unruptured group, and 152 (79.5%) of 191 patients showed good clinical outcomes (GOS of 4 or 5) in ruptured group. Tailored steam shaping of the microcatheter is vital to achieve good angiographic outcomes regardless of aneurysmal direction. EVT is feasible and safe for most ACoA aneurysms with acceptable immediate and long-term outcomes.

The aim of this project is to evaluate cytotoxic effects of melatonin (MLT) an endogen hormone and 13-cis retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) also named as isotretinoin an analogue of vitamin A on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. In this study, SH-SY5Y cell line was used. After cell culture, the cells were exposed to different doses of MLT and 13-cis-RA. 24 and 48 hours later. While the viabilities was estimated with MTT cell viability assay test, apoptotic indexes were calculated after staining with TUNEL based apoptosis kit. It was observed that MLT has very effective cytotoxic potential than 13-cis-RA on neuroblastoma cell line. At the same time, when MLT and 13-cis-RA were combined, this effect was potentiated. On the other hand, it was found that the effect of 13-cis-RA individually on neuroblastoma cells was very slight. We suggest that in the treatment of patient with neuroblastoma, MLT is very effective and also this effect can be augmented by combination with 13-cis-RA.

Cervical spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated an intradural extramedullary cystic mass at the C1-3 level without enhancement after gadolinium injection. There was no associated malformation on the MR imaging, computed tomography, and radiography. Hemilaminectomy at the C1-3 levels was performed and the lesion was completely removed through a posterior approach.

After failure of transvenous embolization, the patient underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). At one month after GKRS, she developed increasing ocular pain and occipital headache. Repeat angiography showed partial obliteration of the fistula and loss of drainage via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins with severe congestion, resulting in slow flow around the right cerebellar hemisphere. Prompt transarterial embolization relieved the patient's ocular symptoms and headache.

A 71-year-old male suffered a chronic right buttock pain of duration of 7 years which radiating to the right distal leg and foot. His pain developed gradually over one year after underwenting drainage for the gluteal abscess seven years ago. A cramping buttock and intermittently radiating pain to his right foot on sitting, walking, and voiding did not respond to conventional treatment. An MRI suggested a post-inflammatory adhesion encroaching the proximal course of the sciatic nerve beneath the piriformis as it emerges from the sciatic notch. Upon exploration of the sciatic nerve, a fibrotic tendinous scar beneath the piriformis was found and released proximally to the sciatic notch. His chronic intractable pain was completely relieved within days after the decompression. However, thigh weakness and hypesthesia of the foot did not improve.

Some studies recommended chemical prophylaxis for high-risk patients and for those after complex spinal surgeries. However, chemoprophylaxis for VTE in spinal surgery is underemployed and there is no agreement on the use of VTE prophylaxis in spinal surgery. The aim of this study was to document the incidence of VTE after an elective instrumental spinal surgery, among those receiving preoperative chemoprophylaxis as compared with patients who did not receive it. This study was carried out on eighty-nine patients allocated randomly to receive either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or no prophylaxis before elective instrumental spinal surgery. All patients received postoperative compression stockings. A compression Doppler ultrasonography was performed for all patients to detect postoperative deep vein thrombosis. In addition, further imaging studies were performed for patients suspected of VTE. Three (3.3%) patients were diagnosed with VTE. One of them had received preoperative chemoprophylaxis. There were no significant difference in incidence of VTE between the two groups (p&gt;0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.06-8.7). Laterality of gender and postsurgical recumbence duration were all independent predictors of VTE (p=0.01 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). The difference in the incidence of thromboembolic complications between the two groups was not significant.

The aim of study was to compare the incidence and character of ASD of the cephalad and L5-S1 segments after L5 floating lumbar fusion. From 2005 to 2010, 115 patients who underwent L5 floating lumber fusion were investigated. The mean follow-up period was 46.1 months. The incidence of radiological and clinical ASD of the cephalad and the L5-S1 segments was compared using survival analysis. Risk factors affecting ASD were analyzed using a log rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model. Radiological ASD of the L5-S1 segment had a statistically significant higher survival rate than that of the cephalad segment (p=0.001). However, clinical ASD of the L5-S1 segment was significantly lower survival rates than that of the cephalad segment (p=0.038). Risk factor analysis showed that disc degeneration of the cephalad segment and preoperative spinal stenosis of the L5-S1 segment were risk factors. In L5 floating fusion, radiological ASD was more common in the cephalad segment and clinical ASD was more common in the L5-S1 segment. At the L5-S1 segment, the degree of spinal stenosis appears to be the most influential risk factor in ASD incidences, unlike the cephalad segment.

This is a retrospective study of charts of patients with spinal metastases. All were older than 18 years of age and were considered to have more than 3 months of life expectancy. The patients had single or two level lesions, and compression fracture or impending fracture. Exclusion criterion was metastasis showing severe epidural compression with definite neurological symptoms. Usually spinal segments from one level above to below pathology were stabilized. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain assessment and Frankel scale for neurological deficit were used, while pre- and post-operative performance status was evaluated using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Twelve patients (nine men, three women; median age 54.29 years) underwent surgery. All patients presented with back pain with\/without radicular pain. There were no early complications and perioperative mortalities. Following surgery, a significant difference between average pre- and post-operative VAS scores was found (p=0.003). Overall, 91.8% of patients (11\/12) experienced improvement in their ECOG score post-operatively.

Carotid plaque with high signal intensity on MPRAGE of &gt;200% that of adjacent muscle was categorized as IPH. We analyzed the prevalence of IPH and its correlation with territorial acute infarction. Of 166 arteries, 39 had a carotid artery plaque. Of these arteries, 26 had carotid artery stenosis less than 50%. In all carotid arteries, MR-depicted IPH was found in 7.2% (12\/166). High-signal intensity on DWI was found in 17.5% (29\/166). Combined lesion with ipsilateral high-signal intensity on DWI and IPH on carotid MPRAGE sequence was found in 6 lesions (6\/166, 3.6%).

The unilateral 6-OHDA rat model was induced by injection of 6-OHDA into unilateral medial forebrain bundle using a stereotaxic instrument. Voluntary wheel running activity was assessed per day in successfully lesioned rats (n=10) and control rats. Each behavioral test lasted an hour. The following parameters were investigated during behavioral tests : the number of running bouts, the distance moved in the wheel, average peak speed in running bouts and average duration from the running start to the peak speed. The number of running bouts and the distance moved in the wheel were significantly decreased in successfully lesioned rats compared with control rats. In addition, average peak speed in running bouts was decreased, and average duration from the running start to the peak speed was increased in lesioned animals, which might indicate motor deficits in these rats. These behavioral changes were still observed 42 days after lesion.

The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of radiculopathy (group A : back pain only; group B : back pain with newly developed radiating pain). We categorized compression fractures into three types by the position of the fracture line. The incidence of newly developed radiculopathy was examined retrospectively for each compression fracture type. The overall incidence of newly developed leg pain (group B) was 25%, and the frequency increased with descending spinal levels (L2 : 0%, L3 : 22%, L4 : 43%, and L5 : 63%). The back pain-only group (group A) had mostly superior-type fractures. On the other hand, the back pain with radiculopathy group (group B) had mostly inferior-type fractures. Most patients in group B showed significant relief of leg pain as well as back pain after bone cement augmentation.

The medical records of patients with pituitary adenoma, who had undergone trans-sphenoidal adenectomy between January 2009 and January 2011, were reviewed. Patients underwent an ocular examination and brain MRI before and after surgery. The visual impairment score (VIS) was derived by combining the scores of best-corrected visual acuity and visual field. The relationship between VIS and tumor size\/tumor type\/position of the optic chiasm was assessed. Seventy-eight patients were included (41 male, 37 female). Thirty-two (41%) patients experienced blurred vision or visual field defect as an initial symptom. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that tumors &lt;2.2 cm tended to cause minimal or no visual impairment. Statistical analysis showed that 1) poor preoperative vision is related to tumor size, displacement of the optic chiasm in the sagittal view on MRI and optic atrophy, and 2) poorer visual prognosis is associated with greater preoperative VIS. In multivariate analysis the only factor significantly related to VIS improvement was increasing pituitary adenoma size, which predicted decreased improvement. Results from this study show that pituitary adenomas larger than 2 cm cause defects in vision while adenomas 2 cm or smaller do not cause significant visual impairment.

Access and deployment of a covered stent was successful in all patients (100%) and total occlusion of the fistula was achieved in nine (90%). Complete occlusion immediately after the procedure was obtained in five patients (50%). Endoleak persisted in five patients and the fistulae were found to be completely occluded by one month control angiography in four. The other patient underwent additional coil embolization by a transvenous approach. Balloon inflation-related arterial dissection during the procedure was noted in two cases; healing was noted at follow-up angiography. One patient suffered an asymptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion noted seven months post-treatment. Although endoleak is currently a common roadblock, our experience demonstrates that a covered stent has the potential to be used as the first choice in DCCF; this potential is likely to increase as experience with this device accumulates and the materials continue to improve. ","867":"Neuropathic pain causes patients feel indescribable pain. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one of the treatment methods in neuropathic pain but the action mechanism is still unclear. To study the effect and mechanism of analgesic effects from DBS in neuropathic pain and to enhance the analgesic effect of DBS, we stimulated the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) in rats. To observe the effect from VPL stimulation, we established 3 groups : normal group (Normal group), neuropathic pain group (Pain group) and neuropathic pain+DBS group (DBS group). Rats in DBS group subjected to electrical stimulation and the target is VPL. We observed the behavioral changes by DBS in VPL (VPL-DBS) on neuropathic pain rats. In our study, the pain score which is by conventional test method was effectively decreased. In specific, the time of showing withdrawal response from painful stimulation which is not used measuring method in our animal model was also decreased by DBS. The VPL is an effective target on pain modulation. Specifically we could demonstrate changes of pain response duration which is not used, and it was also significantly meaningful. We thought that this study would be helpful in understanding the relation between VPL-DBS and neuropathic pain.

Throughout most of history, the brain, residing in a \"closed box\" of bone, has not been vulnerable to external aggression. Recently, we encountered a serious penetrating craniocerebral injury caused by a nail gun. Total excision of the offending nail via emergency craniotomy was performed, but the patient's neurologic status was not improved in spite of aggressive rehabilitative treatment. Here, we report on this troublesome case in light of a review of the relevant literature.

Most of these patients present with major organ injuries and hypovolemic shock at the time of trauma. However, head trauma associated with sudden heart arrest is rare. Here, we report a case of ring fracture with pontomedullary laceration that led to sudden heart arrest. ","871":"We present a case of angiographically confirmed transection of the cisternal segment of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) associated with a severe head trauma in a 15-year old boy. The initial brain computed tomography scan revealed a diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and pneumocephalus with multiple skull fractures. Subsequent cerebral angiography clearly demonstrated a complete transection of the AChA at its origin with a massive extravasation of contrast medium as a jet trajectory creating a plume. We speculate that severe blunt traumatic force stretched and tore the left AChA between the internal carotid artery and the optic tract. In a simulation of the patient's brain using a fresh-frozen male cadaver, the AChA is shown to be vulnerable to stretching injury as the ipsilateral optic tract is retracted. We conclude that the arterial injury like an AChA rupture should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe traumatic SAH. ","872":"Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) can extend into the intracranial subarachnoid space, but, severe cerebral vasospasm is rare complication of the extension of intracranial SAH from a spinal subarachnoid hematoma. A 67-year-old woman started anticoagulant therapy for unstable angina. The next day, she developed severe back pain and paraplegia. MRI showed intradural and extramedullar low signal intensity at the T2-3, consistent with intradural hematoma. High signal intensity was also noted in the spinal cord from C5 to T4. We removed subarachnoid hematoma compressing the spinal cord. The following day, the patient complained of severe headache. Brain CT revealed SAH around both parietal lobes. Three days later, her consciousness decreased and left hemiplegia also developed. Brain MRI demonstrated multiple cerebral infarctions, mainly in the right posterior cerebral artery territory, left parietal lobe and right watershed area. Conventional cerebral angiography confirmed diffuse severe vasospasm of the cerebral arteries. After intensive care for a month, the patient was transferred to the rehabilitation department. After 6 months, neurologic deterioration improved partially. We speculate that surgeons should anticipate possible delayed neurological complications due to cerebral vasospasm if intracranial SAH is detected after spinal subarachnoid hematoma.

The accumulation of epidural gas compressing the dural sac and nerve root was demonstrated by CT and MRI at the distant two levels, L3-4 and L5-S1, where vacuum in disc space was observed preoperatively and both laminectomy and discectomy had been done. However, postoperative air was not identified at L4-5 level where only laminectomy had been done in same surgical field, which suggested the relationship between postoperative epidural gas and the manipulation of disc structure. Conservative treatment and needle aspiration was performed, but not effective to relieve patient's symptoms. The patient underwent revision surgery to remove the gaseous cyst. Her leg pain was improved after the second operation.

We report a 68-year-old male with a 30-year history of AS who presented a typical symptom and signs of progressive CES, urinary incontinence and neuropathic pain of the lumbosacral radiculopathy. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings showed the unique appearances of dural ectasia, multiple dural diverticula, erosion of posterior element of the lumbar spine, tethering of the conus medullaris and adhesion of the lumbosacral nerve roots to the posterior aspect of the dural ectasia. Considering the progressive worsening of the clinical signs, detethering of the conus medullaris through resection of the filum terminale was performed through a limited laminectomy. However, the urinary incontinence did not improve and there was a partial relief of the neuropathic leg pain only. The possible pathogenetic mechanism of CES-AS and the dural ectasia in this patient with longstanding AS are discussed with a literature review. ","875":"We report a case of cervicomedullary compression by an anomalous vertebral artery treated using microsurgical decompression with intraoperative monitoring. A 68-year-old woman presented with posterior neck pain and gait disturbance. MRI revealed multiple abnormalities, including an anomalous vertebral artery that compressed the spinal cord at the cervicomedullary junction. Suboccipital craniectomy with C1 laminectomy was performed. The spinal cord was found to be compressed by the vertebral arteries, which were retracted dorsolaterally. At that time, the somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) changed. After release of the vertebral artery, the SSEP signal normalized instantly. The vertebral artery was then lifted gently and anchored to the dura. There was no other procedural complication. The patient's symptoms improved. This case demonstrates that intraoperative monitoring may be useful for preventing procedural complications during spinal cord microsurgical decompression.

A 65-year-old woman presented with a 5-month history of a soft mass on the right frontal area. MR imaging revealed a 4 cm sized, multilobulated, strongly-enhancing lesion on the right frontal bone, and CT showed a destructive skull lesion. The mass was adhered tightly to the scalp and dura mater, and it extended to some part of the outer and inner dural layers without brain invasion. The extradural mass and soft tissue mass were totally removed simultaneously and we reconstructed the calvarial defect with artificial bone material. The pathological study revealed an atypical meningioma as World Health Organization grade II.

Two such rare cases are presented, along with successful surgical techniques, including the application of a C-shaped aneurysm clip parallel to the ICA and a microsuture technique to repair the arterial defect. The patency of the AChA and ICA was successfully preserved without recurrence or rebleeding of the BBA during a 1-year follow-up after the operation.

Unfortunately, the definitive treatment modality of such highly risky aneurysm has not yet been demonstrated. Upon encountering the complex intracranial pathophysiology of such a highly precarious aneurysm, a neurosurgeon would be faced with a challenge to decide on an optimal approach. This is a case of multiple paraclinoid aneurysms including the ICA dorsal wall aneurysm, presented with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage. With respect to treatment, direct clipping with a Sundt graft clip was performed after multiple endovascular interventions had failed. This surgical approach can be a treatment modality for a blood blister-like aneurysm after failed endovascular intervention(s).

We used the guinea pig chronic placental insufficiency model to investigate the effect of hypoxia on fetal brain development. We ligated unilateral uterine artery at 30-32 days of gestation (dg : with term defined as -67 dg). At 50 dg, 60 dg, fetuses were sacrificed and assigned to either the growth-restricted (GR) or control (no ligation) group. After fixation, dissection, and sectioning of cerebral tissue from these animals, immunohistochemistry was performed with NeuN antibody, which is a mature neuronal marker in the cerebral cortex. The number of NeuN-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the cerebral cortex did not differ between the GR and control groups at 50 dg. However, the number of NeuN-IR cells was lesser in GR fetuses than in controls at 60 dg (p&lt;0.05). These findings show that chronic prenatal hypoxia affect the number of neuron in the cerebral cortex of guinea pig fetus at 60 dg. The approach used in this study is helpful for extending our understanding of neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex, and the findings may be useful for elucidating the brain injury caused by prenatal hypoxia.

We also evaluated the relationship between lumbar spinal lesions and their health related quality-of-life (HRQOL). A cross-sectional, self-reported survey was conducted in Korean males (aged 19-year-old) who underwent physical examinations for the conscript. We examined 3331 examinees in November 2014. We included 2411 subjects, who accepted to participate this study without any comorbidities. We interviewed using simple binary questions for their LBP experience and chronicity. HRQOL was assessed by Short-Form Health-Survey-36 (SF-36) in chronic LBP and healthy control groups. Radiological assessment was performed in chronic LBP group to determine whether there were any pathological causes of their symptoms. The LTP of chronic LBP was 13.4%. Most (71.7%) of them didn't have any lumbar spinal lesions (i.e., non-specific chronic LBP). The SF-36 subscale and summary scores were significantly lower in subjects with chronic LBP. Between specific and non-specific chronic LBP group, all physical and mental subscale scores were significantly lower in specific chronic LBP group, except mental health (MH) subscale score. In MH subscale and mental component summary score, statistical significant differences didn't appear between two groups (p=0.154, 0.126). In Korean males 19 years of age, the LTP of chronic LBP was 13.4%, and more than two-thirds were non-specific chronic LBP. Chronic LBP had a significant impact on HRQOL. The presence of lumbar spinal pathoanatomical lesions affected mainly on the physical aspect of HRQOL. It influenced little on the mental health.

A total of 37 cervical spine computerized tomography scans (24 boys and 13 girls) were included in this study. All patients were younger than 10 years of age at the time of evaluation for the period of 2007-2011. For the C1 screw placement, entry point height (EPH) was the most restrictive factor (47.3% patients were larger than 3.5 mm). All C2 lamina had a height larger than 3.5 mm and 68.8% (51\/74) of C2 lamina had a width thicker than 3.5 mm. For C2 pedicle width, 55.4% (41\/74) of cases were larger than 3.5 mm, while 58.1% (43\/74) of pedicle heights were larger than 3.5 mm. For pedicle width of subaxial spine, 75.7% (C3), 73% (C4), 82.4% (C5), 89.2% (C6), and 98.1% (C7, 1\/54) were greater than 3.5 mm. Mean lamina width of subaxial cervical spine was 3.1 (C3), 2.7 (C4), 2.9 (C5), 3.8 (C6), and 4.0 mm (C7), respectively. Only 34.6% (127\/370) of subaxial (C3-7) lamina thickness were greater than 3.5 mm. Mean length of lateral mass for the lateral mass screw placement was 9.28 (C3), 9.08 (C4), 8.81 (C5), 8.98 (C6), and 10.38 mm (C7). C1 lateral mass fixation could be limited by the morphometrics of lateral mass height. C2 trans-lamina approach is preferable to C2 pedicle screw fixation.

","884":"The use of direct lumbar interbody fusion (DLIF) has gradually increased; however, no studies have directly compared DLIF and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). We compared DLIF and TLIF on the basis of clinical and radiological outcomes. A retrospective review was performed on the medical records and radiographs of 98 and 81 patients who underwent TLIF and DLIF between January 2011 and December 2012. Clinical outcomes were compared with a visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The preoperative and postoperative disc heights, segmental sagittal\/coronal angles, and lumbar lordosis were measured on radiographs. Fusion rates, operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay, and complications were assessed. DLIF was superior to TLIF regarding its ability to restore disc height, foraminal height, and coronal balance (p&lt;0.001). As the extent of surgical level increased, DLIF displayed significant advantages over TLIF considering the operative time and EBL. However, fusion rates at 12 months post-operation were lower for DLIF (87.8%) than for TLIF (98.1%) (p=0.007). The changes of VAS and ODI between the TLIF and DLIF were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05). Both DLIF and TLIF are less invasive and thus good surgical options for treating degenerative lumber diseases. DLIF has higher potential in increasing neural foramina and correcting coronal balance, and involves a shorter operative time and reduced EBL, in comparison with TLIF. However, DLIF displayed a lower fusion rate than TLIF, and caused complications related to the transpsoas approach.

The proposed new measure (hereafter, a slope-measure) was defined as the relative slope of the amplitude and latency at each EP peak compared to the baseline value, which is sensitive to the change in the amplitude and latency simultaneously. We used the slope-measure for EP and single trials and compared the significant change detection time with that of the conventional peak-to-peak method. When applied to single trials, each single trial signal was processed with optimal filters before using the slope-measure. In this retrospective data analysis, 7 patients who underwent cerebral aneurysm clipping surgery for unruptured aneurysm middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation were included. We found that this simple slope-measure has a detection time that is as early or earlier than that of the conventional method; furthermore, using the slope-measure in optimally filtered single trials provides warning signs earlier than that of the conventional method during MCA clipping surgery. Our results have confirmed the feasibility of the slope-measure for intraoperative SEP monitoring. This is a novel study that provides a useful measure for either EP or single trials in intraoperative SEP monitoring. ","887":"Nefopam, a centrally acting analgesic, has been used to control postoperative pain. Reported adverse effects are anticholinergic, cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric. Neurologic adverse reactions to nefopam are confusion, hallucinations, delirium and convulsions. There are several reports about fatal convulsive seizures, presumably related to nefopam. A 71-year-old man was admitted for surgery for a lumbar spinal stenosis. He was administered intravenous analgesics : ketorolac, tramadol, orphenadrine citrate and nefopam HCl. His back pain was so severe that he hardly slept for several days; he even needed morphine and pethidine. At 4 days of administration of intravenous analgesics, the patient suddenly started generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 15 seconds, and subsequently, status epilepticus; these were not responsive to phenytoin and midazolam. After 3 days of barbiturate coma therapy the seizures were controlled. Convulsive seizures related to nefopam appear as focal, generalized, myoclonic types, or status epilepticus, and are not dose-related manifestations. In our case, the possibility of convulsions caused by other drugs or the misuse of drugs was considered. However, we first identified the introduced drugs and excluded the possibility of an accidental misuse of other drugs.

A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of upper extremity pain and gait disturbance. The patient had undergone laminoplasty for compressive cervical myelopathy 3 months previously. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large solitary intramedullary lesion with associated extensive cord swelling, signal changes, and heterogeneous enhancement of spinal cord from C2 to C7. Spinal cord biopsy revealed non-necrotizing granulomas with signs of chronic inflammation.

After this primary survey, the condition of the patient suddenly deteriorated. Conventional angiography confirmed the contrast extravasation resulted from pseudoaneurysm formation, which was successfully treated with endovascular coil embolization. Decompressive craniectomy and coma therapy with propofol were also performed. However, the patient died on the 7th hospital day because of the poor initial clinical condition. The current case is the first report of acute pseudoaneurysm rupture arising from the basilar artery within the first day after trauma.

Stroke, either hemorrhagic or ischemic, is a relatively frequent presentation in RCVS, but progressive manifestations of subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction in a patient is seldom described. We report a rare case of a 56-year-old woman with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome consecutively presenting as cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction. When she complained of severe headache with subtle cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, her angiography was non-specific. But, computed tomographic angiography showed typical angiographic features of this syndrome after four days. Day 12, she suffered mental deterioration and hemiplegia due to contralateral intracerebral hematoma, and she was surgically treated. For recurrent attacks of headache, medical management with calcium channel blockers has been instituted. Normalized angiographic features were documented after 8 weeks.

This study aimed to identify the predictive factors for the development of EFC as a complication of cranioplasty, and its outcomes. From January 2004 to December 2012, 117 cranioplasty were performed in our institution. One-hundred-and-six of these patients were classified as either having EFC, or not having EFC. The two groups were compared to identify risk factors for EFC. Statistical significance was tested using the t-test and chi-square test, and a logistic regression analysis. Of the 117 patients undergoing cranioplasty, 59 (50.4%) suffered complications, and EFC occurred in 48 of the patients (41.0%). In the t-test and chi-test, risk factors for EFC were size of the skull defect (p=0.003) and postoperative air bubbles in the epidural space (p&lt;0.001). In a logistic regression, the only statistically significant factor associated with development of EFC was the presence of postoperative air bubbles. The EFC disappeared or regressed over time in 30 of the 48 patients (62.5%), as shown by follow-up brain computed tomographic scan, but 17 patients (35.4%) required reoperation. EFC after cranioplasty is predicted by postoperative air bubbles in the epidural space. Most EFC can be treated conservatively. However, reoperation is necessary to resolve about a third of the cases. During cranioplasty, special attention is required when the skull defect is large, since EFC is then more likely.

Patients were followed up for a range of 3-48 months. The radiological remission, biochemical remission and complication were evaluated. A total of 110 (82.7%) patients achieved radiological complete resection, 11 (8.2%) subtotal resection, and 12 (9.0%) partial resection. Eighty-eight (66.2%) patients showed nadir GH level less than 1 ng\/mL after oral glucose administration. No mortality or severe disability was observed during follow up. Preoperative long-acting SSA successfully improved left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and blood glucose in three patients who subsequently underwent success operation. Long-acting SSA (20 mg every 30 days) achieved biochemical remission in 19 out 23 (82.6%) patients who showed persistent high GH level after surgery.

This study is to analyze the parameters influencing the degree of clip artifacts. Postoperative CT scans of 60 patients with straight cobalt alloy-clipped aneurysms were analyzed for the maximal diameter of white artifacts and the angle and number of streak artifacts in axial images, and the maximal diameter of artifacts in three-dimensional (3-D) volume-rendered images. The correlation coefficient (CC) was determined between each clip artifact type and the clip blade length and clip orientation to the CT scan (angle a, lateral clip inclination in axial images; angle b, clip gradient to scan plane in lateral scout images). Angle b correlated negatively with white artifacts (r=-0.589, p&lt;0.001) and positively with the angle (r=0.636, p&lt;0.001) and number (r=0.505, p&lt;0.001) of streak artifacts. Artifacts in 3-D images correlated with clip blade length (r=0.454, p=0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that angle b was the major parameter influencing white artifacts and the angle and number of streak artifacts in axial images (p&lt;0.001), whereas clip blade length was a major factor in 3-D images (p=0.034). Use of a clip orientation perpendicular to the scan gantry angle decreased the amount of white artifacts and allowed better visualization of the clip site.

Among 871 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 11 BBAs of internal carotid artery and seven vertebral artery dissections (VADs) with a short segmental eccentric dilatation (Mizutani type 4), which is morphologically similar to a BBA, were selected. The following clinical factors were studied in each group : age, gender, risk factors, Hunt and Hess grade (HHG), Fisher grade (FG), vasospasms, hydrocephalus, perioperative rebleeding rate, and treatment outcome. The mean age was 47.9 years in the BBAs group and 46.4 years in the type 4 VADs group. All the BBA patients were female, whereas there was a slight male predominance in the type 4 VAD group (male : female ratio of 4 : 3). In the BBA and type 4 VAD groups that underwent less aggressive treatment to save the parent artery, 29% (n=2\/7) and 66.6% (n=2\/3), respectively, eventually required retreatment. Perioperative rebleeding occurred in 72.7% (n=8) and 28.6% (n=2) of patients in the BBA and type 4 VAD groups, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the other clinical factors in both groups, except for the male dominancy in the type 4 VAD group (p=0.011). BBAs and ruptured type 4 VADs have a similar morphological appearance but there is a distinct clinical feature in gender and perioperative rebleeding rates.

Single-portal ECTRs were performed in 1194 hands of 793 CTS patients from 2002 to 2011. Five-hundred seventy hands with minimal 1-year postoperative follow-up were included. We divided the 545 satisfied hands into early (group A) and delayed (group B) groups according to improvement period of 1 month. Demographic data, clinical severity and electrodiagnostic abnormality were compared between groups. Group A included 510 hands and group B included 35 hands. In group B, 11 hands improved in 2 months, 15 hands in 3 months and 9 hands in 6 months, respectively. In group A\/B, according to clinical severity, 60\/1 hands were graded to I, 345\/24 hands to II, 105\/10 hands to III. In group A\/B, based on electrodiagnostic abnormality, 57\/3 hands were classified to mild, 221\/11 hands to moderate and 222\/21 hands to severe group. Statistical analysis between groups did not reach significance but electrodiagnostic or clinical severity had a tendency to affect the delayed response.

To escape from this situation, several rescue methods have been reported. A case with undesirably stretched coil in which another rescue method was used, is presented. When the stretched coil is still located in the coil delivery microcatheter, the stretched coil can be removed safely using a snare and a handmade monorail microcatheter. After a snare is lodged in the handmade monorail microcatheter, the snare is introduced over the coil delivery micorcatheter and located in the distal part of the stretched coil. After then, the handmade monorail microcatheter captures the stretched coil and the snare as one unit. This technique using a handmade monorail microcatheter and a snare can be a good rescue modality for the undesirably stretched coil, still remained within the coil delivery microcatheter.

","909":"The coexistence of moyamoya disease (MMD) with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is exceedingly rare. We report two cases of AVM associated with MMD. The first case was an incidental AVM diagnosed simultaneously with MMD. This AVM was managed expectantly after encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) as the main feeders stemmed from the internal carotid artery, which we believed would be obliterated with the progression of MMD. However, the AVM persisted with replacement of the internal carotid artery feeders by new external carotid artery feeders from the EDAS site. The AVM was eventually treated with gamma knife radiosurgery considering an increasing steal effect. The second case was a de novo AVM case. The patient was initially diagnosed with MMD, and acquired an AVM eight years later that was slowly fed by the reconstituted anterior cerebral artery. Because the patient remained asymptomatic, the AVM is currently being closely followed for more than 2 years without further surgical intervention. Possible differences in the pathogenesis and the radiologic presentation of these AVMs are discussed with a literature review. No solid consensus exists on the optimal treatment of MMD-associated AVMs. Gamma knife radiosurgery appears to be an effective treatment option for an incidental AVM. However, a de novo AVM may be managed expectantly considering the possible risks of damaging established collaterals, low flow characteristics, and probably low risks of rupture.

The first patient presented with drowsy consciousness with blurred vision. The diffusion MRI showed an acute infarction on bilateral cerebellum and occipital lobes. The second patient presented with pulsatile tinnitus, dysarthria and a subjective weakness and numbness of extremities. In both cases, digital subtraction angiography demonstrated high-flow direct VAVFs adjacent to C1 screws. The VAVF of the second case occurred near the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery originated from the persistent first intersegmental artery of the left VA. Both cases were successfully treated by complete occlusion of the fistulous portion and the involved segment of the left VA using endovascular coil embolization.

Between October 2010 and December 2013, 52 consecutive patients had suffering from chronic low back pain had undergone endoscopic radiofrequency denervation of medial branch of dorsal ramus. The clinical outcomes of these 52 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperative and postoperative Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Korean version of Oswestry Disability Index (K-ODI), and patients' satisfaction with the procedure were assessed. The pain scores on the VAS for back pain had improved significantly from a preoperative mean of 7.1 to a postoperative mean of 2 at the last follow-up (p&lt;0.001). The clinical outcomes based on the K-ODI had also improved significantly from a preoperative mean of 26.5% to postoperative mean of 7.7% at the last follow-up (p&lt;0.001). 80% of patients were satisfied with the procedure.

Between May 2005 and March 2014, 25 patients underwent upper cervical instrumentation via a CT-based navigation system. Seven patients were excluded, while 18 patients were involved. There were 13 males and five females; resulting in four degenerative cervical diseases and 14 trauma cases. A CT-based navigation system and lateral fluoroscopy were used during the screw instrumentation procedure. Among the 58 screws inserted as C1-2 screws fixation, their precise positions were evaluated by postoperative CT scans and classified into three categories : in-pedicle, non-critical breach, and critical breach. Postoperatively, the precise positions of the C1-2 screws fixation were 81.1% (47\/58), and 8.6% (5\/58) were of non-critical breach, while 10.3% (6\/58) were of critical breach. Most (5\/6, 83.3%) of the critical breaches and all of non-critical breaches were observed in the C2 pedicle screws and there was only one case of a critical breach among the C1 lateral mass screws. There were three complications (two vertebral artery occlusions and a deep wound infection), but no postoperative instrument-related neurological deteriorations were seen, even in the critical breach cases. Although CT-based navigation systems can result in a more precise procedure, there are still some problems at the upper cervical spine levels, where the anatomy is highly variable.

We analyzed retrospective data for factors contributing to a postoperative flat back. A total of 105 patients who underwent PALIF for spondylolisthesis and stenosis were enrolled. The patients were divided according to surgical type [posterior lumbar inter body fusion (PLIF) vs. unilateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF)], number of levels (single vs. multiple), and diagnosis (spondylolisthesis vs. stenosis). We measured perioperative index level lordosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, sacral slope, pelvic incidence, and disc height in standing lateral radiographs. The change and variance in each parameter and comparative group were analyzed with the paired and Student t-test (p&lt;0.05), correlation coefficient, and regression analysis. A significant perioperative reduction was observed in index-level lordosis following TLIF at the single level and in patients with spondylolisthesis (p=0.002, p=0.005). Pelvic tilt and sacral slope were significantly restored following PLIF multilevel surgery (p=0.009, p=0.003). Sacral slope variance was highly sensitive to perioperative variance of index level lordosis in high sacral sloped pelvis. Perioperative variance of index level lordosis was positively correlated with disc height variance (R(2)=0.286, p=0.0005). Unilateral TLIF has the potential to cause postoperative flat back. PLIF is more reliable than unilateral TLIF to restore spinopelvic parameters following multilevel surgery and spondylolisthesis. A high sacral sloped pelvis is more vulnerable to PALIF in terms of a postoperative flat back.

Clinical data of patients with ICH were collected by 2 neurosurgeons blinded to the radiological data and at the 90-day follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified predictors of poor outcome; we found that hematoma location, spot sign, and intraventricular hemorrhage were independent predictors of poor outcome. In-hospital mortality was 57.4% (35 of 61) in the CTA spot-sign positive group versus 7.9% (10 of 126) in the CTA spot-sign negative group. In multivariate logistic analysis, we found that presence of spot sign and presence of volume expansion were independent predictors for the in-hospital mortality of ICH.

However, surgical outcome still remains poor, especially with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), despite the advancement of neuroimaging techniques and expansion of surgical indications. The aim of this study was to focus on surgical strategies in terms of extent of resection to improve surgical outcome in the cases of FLE with CD. A total of 11 patients of FLE were selected among 67 patients who were proven pathologically as CD, out of a total of 726 epilepsy surgery series since 1992. This study categorized surgical groups into three according to the extent of resection : 1) focal corticectomy, 2) regional corticectomy, and 3) partial functional lobectomy, based on the preoperative evaluation, in particular, ictal scalp EEG onset and\/or intracranial recordings, and the lesions in high-resolution MRI. Surgical outcome was assessed following Engel's classification system. Focal corticectomy was performed in 5 patients and regional corticectomy in another set of 5 patients. Only 1 patient underwent partial functional lobectomy. Types I and II CD were detected with the same frequency (45.45% each) and postoperative outcome was fully satisfactory (91%). The strategy of epilepsy surgery is to focus on the different characteristics of each individual, considering the extent of real resection, which is based on the focal ictal onset consistent with neuroimaging, especially in the practical point of view of neurosurgery.

For TDC, we defined the pre-coronal point to be 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture at the level of the superior temporal line. TDC was performed in patients with CSDH that extended beyond the coronal suture, as confirmed by preoperative CT scans. Medical records, radiological findings, and clinical performance were reviewed and analyzed. Of the 65 CSDH patients, 13\/17 (76.4%) with BHD and 42\/48 (87.5%) with TDC showed improved clinical performance and radiological findings after surgery. Catheter failure was seen in 1\/48 (2.4%) cases of TDC. Five patients (29.4%) in the BHD group and four patients (8.33%) in the TDC group underwent reoperations due to remaining hematomas, and they improved with a second operation, BHD or TDC.

Twenty-nine pediatric patients with supratentorial CM underwent microsurgical excision. In selected cases, transparent tubular retractor system (TTRS) was used to reduce retraction injury and intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) was held to preserve functioning cortex. Patients' demographics and symptoms were reviewed and surgical outcomes were discussed. THE MAIN INITIAL CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING : seizures (n=13, 45%), headache (n=7, 24%), focal neurological deficits (n=3, 10%), and an incidental finding (n=6, 21%). Overt hemorrhage was detected in 7 patients (24%).

This study included 42 patients, including 25 males and 17 females, who underwent SSPSF for stabilization of TLBFs between January 2003 and December 2010. For radiologic assessments, Cobb angle (CA), vertebral wedge angle (VWA), vertebral body compression ratio (VBCR), and difference between VWA and Cobb angle (DbVC) were measured. The relationships between kyphosis recurrence and radiologic parameters or demographic features were investigated. Frankel classification and low back outcome score (LBOS) were used for assessment of clinical outcomes. The mean follow-up period was 38.6 months. CA, VWA, and VBCR were improved after SSPSF, and these parameters were well maintained at the final follow-up with minimal degree of correction loss. Kyphosis recurrence showed a significant increase in patients with Denis burst type A, load-sharing classification (LSC) score &gt;6 or DbVC &gt;6 (p&lt;0.05). There were no patients who worsened to clinical outcome, and there was no significant correlation between kyphosis recurrence and clinical outcome in this series.

Patients were regularly followed for clinical and radiological assessment. Clinical outcome was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) for the neck\/shoulder and arm, and the neck disability index (NDI). Radiological outcome was measured by focal\/global angulation and disc height index (DHI). Outcomes after MI-PCF were evaluated as changes of clinical and radiological parameters from the baseline. Mixed effect model with random patients' effect was used to test for differences in the clinical and radiological parameters repeat measures. There were no complications and all patients had an uneventful recovery during the early postoperative period. VAS scores for neck\/shoulder and arm improved significantly in the early postoperative period (3 months) and were maintained with time (p&lt;0.001). NDI improved significantly post-operatively and tended to decrease gradually during the follow-up period (p&lt;0.001). There were no statistically significant changes in focal and global angulation at follow-up. Percent DHIs of the upper adjacent or operated disc were maintained without significant changes with time. During the follow-up, same site recurrence was not noted and adjacent segment disease requiring additional surgery occurred in two patients (6%) on the contra-lateral side.

Twenty patients of lumbar open discectomy (LOD) and 20 patients of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) were enrolled in this study. Preoperative and postoperative prophylactic antibiotics were administered routinely for 7 days. Blood samples were obtained one day before surgery and postoperative day (POD) 1, POD3, and POD7. Using repeated measures ANOVA, changes in effect measures over time and between groups over time were assessed. All data analysis was conducted using SAS v.9.1. Changes in CRP, within treatment groups over time and between treatment groups over time were both statistically significant F(3,120)=5.05, p=0.003 and F(1,39)=7.46, p=0.01, respectively. Most dramatic changes were decreases in the LOD group on POD3 and POD7. Changes in ESR, within treatment groups over time and between treatment groups over time were also found to be statistically significant, F(3,120)=6.67, p=0.0003 and F(1,39)=3.99, p=0.01, respectively.

The author performed surgery in 57 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis between 2006 and 2010. Data were gathered retrospectively via outpatient interviews and telephone questionnaires. The operation used in this study was named central decompressive laminoplasty (CDL), which allows thorough decompression of the lumbar spinal canal and proximal two foraminal nerve roots by undercutting the lamina and facet joint. Kyphotic prone positioning on elevated curvature of the frame or occasional use of an interlaminar spreader enables sufficient interlaminar working space. Pain was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Surgical outcome was analyzed with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Data were analyzed preoperatively and six months postoperatively. The interlaminar window provided by this technique allowed for unhindered access to the central canal, lateral recess, and upper\/lower foraminal zone, with near-total sparing of the facet joint. The VAS scores and ODI were significantly improved at six-month follow-up compared to preoperative levels (p&lt;0.001, respectively). Excellent pain relief (&gt;75% of initial VAS score) of back\/buttock and leg was observed in 75.0% and 76.2% of patients, respectively.

The mean visual analog scale score was improved from 8.6 to 3, and the mean neck disability index was improved from 27.9 to 7.3 (p&lt;0.01). Eighteen cases (75%) showed disc height (DH) decrease. The disc invasion was correlated with DH decrease (p&lt;0.05). The disc height decrease correlated with static, dynamic changes of shell angle and spur formation (p&lt;0.05). Any radiological parameters did not affect the clinical outcome. AMF is an effective technique for treating unilateral cervical radiculopathy. It showed excellent surgical outcomes even in long-term follow-ups. However, a decrease in DH occurred in a considerable number of patients.

In contrast, chordoid meningioma is rare; due to the paucity of cases, little is known about its clinical features or treatment outcomes. The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes for patients with chordoid meningioma. In total, 16 patients, with newly diagnosed chordoid meningioma who underwent surgical excision between 1999 and 2012 were included. We retrospectively evaluated the medical records, radiological findings, and pathological findings. The median follow-up period was 56.5 (range, 3-170) months. The MIB-1 labeling index ranged from 1 to 26.60% (median, 5.04). Simpson grade I, II, and III resections were performed in four, nine, and three patients, respectively. The overall recurrence rate was 37.5%. Overall progression-free survival (PFS) after resection was 94.7 months (95% CI=62.9-126.6). Of the 4 patients with Simpson grade I resection, recurrence occurred in one patient. Among the Simpson grade II and III resection groups, eight patients underwent adjuvant radiation therapy and they showed significantly longer PFS (121 months, 95% CI=82.1-159.9) than the patients who underwent surgery alone (40.5 months, 95% CI=9.6-71.3) by the log-rank test (p&lt;0.05). Chordoid meningiomas are difficult to manage and have a high rate of recurrence. Complete resection of the tumor is a key determinant of better outcomes.

In addition, the neurocognitive impairment of adults with MMD is infrequently reported and, to date, has not been well described. We attempted to determine both the neurocognitive profile of adult moyamoya disease and whether a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis can improve the neurocognitive impairment in exhibiting hemodynamic disturbance without stroke. From September 2010 through November 2012, 12 patients with angiographically diagnosed MMD underwent STA-MCA anastomosis for hemodynamic impairment. Patients with hypoperfusion and impaired cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) capacity but without evidence of ischemic stroke underwent a cognitive function test, the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery (SNSB). Five patients agreed to undergo a follow-up SNSB test. Data from preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive function tests were compared and analyzed. Five of 12 patients were enrolled. The median age was 45 years (range, 24-55 years). A comparison of preoperative to postoperative status of SNSB, memory domain, especially delayed recall showed significant improvement. Although most of the domains showed improvement after surgery, the results were not statistically significant. In our preliminary study, large proportions of adult patients with MMD demonstrate disruption of cognitive function. This suggests the possibility of chronic hypoperfusion as a primary cause of the neurocognitive impairment. When preoperative and postoperative status of cognitive function was compared, memory domain showed remarkable improvement. Although further study is needed, neurocognitive impairment may be an indication for earlier intervention with reperfusion procedures that can improve cognitive function.

The Quality Control Committee at the Korean Society of cerebrovascular Surgeons and the Writing Group at the Clinical Research Center for Stroke (CRCS) systematically reviewed relevant literature and major published guidelines between June 2007 and June 2013. Based on the published evidence, recommendations were synthesized, and the level of evidence and the grade of the recommendation were determined using the methods adapted from CRCS. A draft guideline was scrutinized by expert peer reviewers and also discussed at an expert consensus meeting until final agreement was achieved. CPGs based on scientific evidence are presented for the medical and surgical management of patients presenting with primary ICH. This CPG describes the current pertinent recommendations and suggests Korean recommendations for the medical and surgical management of a patient with primary ICH. ","943":null,"944":"Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) can manifest various neurologic symptoms. However, SDH presenting with only hand weakness has rarely been reported. We report two SDH cases with only hand weakness mimicking peripheral neuropathy. Since SDH can present with hand weakness only, we suggest the clinicians to do a careful history taking and recommend a CT scan in the elderly patients. ","945":"Idiopathic hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis (IHSP) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disorder characterized by marked fibrosis of the spinal dura mater with unknown etiology. According to the location of the lesion, it might induce neurologic deficits by compression of spinal cord and nerve root. A 58-year old female with a 3-year history of progressive weakness in both lower extremities was referred to our institute. Spinal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an osteolytic lesion involving base of the C6 spinous process with adjacent epidural mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an epidural mass involving dorsal aspect of cervical spinal canal from C5 to C7 level, with low signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images and non-enhancement on T1 weighted-enhanced images. We decided to undertake surgical exploration. At the operation field, there was yellow colored, thickened fibrous tissue over the dura mater. The lesion was removed totally, and decompression of spinal cord was achieved. Symptoms improved partially after the operation. Histopathologically, fibrotic pachymeninges with scanty inflammatory cells was revealed, which was compatible with diagnosis of idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Six months after operation, motor power grade of both lower extremities was normal on physical examination. However, the patient still complained of mild weakness in the right lower extremity. Although the nature of IHSP is generally indolent, decompressive surgery should be considered for the patient with definite or progressive neurologic symptoms in order to prevent further deterioration. In addition, IHSP can present as an osteolytic lesion. Differential diagnosis with neoplastic disease, including giant cell tumor, is important. ","946":"A 49 years old male patient who suffered from deterioration of posterior neck pain, left hand numbness, left lower limb pain and gait disturbance for 3 years visited our outpatient department. He had been diagnosed as non-dysraphic cervical intradural lipoma and operated in August 1990. On the radiologic images, we found the regrowth of non-dysraphic cervical intradural lipoma from C2 to C7 level, which surrounds and compresses the cervical spinal cord. Previous subtotal laminectomy from C2 to C7 and severe cervical lordosis were also found. Appropriate debulking of lipoma mass without duroplasty was successfully done with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM). We are following up the patient for 24 months via outpatient department, his neurologic symptoms such as hand numbness, gait disturbance, left lower limb pain and posterior neck pain have improved. We describe a rare case of regrowth of non-dysraphic cervical intradural lipoma. ","947":"Intracisternal accessory nerve schwannomas are very rare; only 18 cases have been reported in the literature. In the majority of cases, the tumor origin was the spinal root of the accessory nerve and the tumors usually presented with symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension, cerebellar ataxia, and myelopathy. Here, we report a unique case of an intracisternal schwannoma arising from the cranial root of the accessory nerve in a 58-year-old woman. The patient presented with the atypical symptom of hoarseness associated with recurrent laryngeal neuropathy which is noted by needle electromyography, and mild hypesthesia on the left side of her body. The tumor was completely removed with sacrifice of the originating nerve rootlet, but no additional neurological deficits. In this report, we describe the anatomical basis for the patient's unusual clinical symptoms and discuss the feasibility and safety of sacrificing the cranial rootlet of the accessory nerve in an effort to achieve total tumor resection. To our knowledge, this is the first case of schwannoma originating from the cranial root of the accessory nerve that has been associated with the symptoms of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy. ","948":null,"949":"Benign triton tumor (BTT) or neuromuscular hamartoma is an uncommon tumor composed of mature neural and well-differentiated striated muscular elements. Its development is exceptionally rare in the adult and head region. This report describes a case of adulthood BTT that occurred in the orbit. The patient was a 53-year-old woman who presented with right periorbital swelling and pain in eyeball over 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-enhancing mass surrounding optic nerve and ocular muscles in the right retrobulbar area. The tumor was subtotally removed via transcranial approach. Its pathological diagnosis was confirmed to be a neuromuscular hamartoma. She developed diplopia postoperatively. Adulthood BTT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of head and neck tumors. It is also important to make adequate therapeutic strategy to avoid postoperative neural dysfunction. ","950":"Vertebral artery (VA) injuries usually accompany cervical trauma. Although these injuries are commonly asymptomatic, some result in vertebrobasilar infarction. The symptoms of VA occlusion have been reported to usually manifest within 24 hours after trauma. The symptoms of bilateral VA occlusions seem to be more severe and seem to occur with shorter latencies than those of unilateral occlusions. A 48-year-old man had a C3-4 fracture-dislocation with spinal cord compression that resulted from a traffic accident. After surgery, his initial quadriparesis gradually improved. However, he complained of sudden headache and dizziness on the 5th postoperative day. His motor weakness was abruptly aggravated. Radiologic evaluation revealed an infarction in the occipital lobe and cerebellum. Cerebral angiography revealed complete bilateral VA occlusion. We administered anticoagulation therapy. After 6 months, his weakness had only partially improved. This case demonstrates that delayed infarction due to bilateral VA occlusion can occur at latencies as long as 5 days. Thus, we recommend that patients with cervical traumas that may be accompanied by bilateral VA occlusion should be closely observed for longer than 5 days. ","951":"Propofol and volatile anesthesia have been associated with metabolic acidosis induced by increased lactate. This study was designed to evaluate changes in pH, base excess (BE), and lactate in response to different anesthetic agents and to characterize propofol infusion-associated lactic acidosis. The medical records of patients undergoing neurosurgical anesthesia between January 2005 and September 2012 were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups : those who received propofol (total intravenous anesthesia, TIVA) and those who received sevoflurane (balanced inhalation anesthesia, BIA) anesthesia. Propensity analysis was performed (1 : 1 match, n=47), and the characteristics of the patients who developed severe acidosis were recorded. In the matched TIVA and BIA groups, the incidence of metabolic acidosis (11% vs. 13%, p=1) and base excess (p&gt;0.05) were similar. All patients in the TIVA group who developed severe acidosis did so within 4 hours of the initiation of propofol infusion, and these patients improved when propofol was discontinued. The incidence of metabolic acidosis was similar during neurosurgical anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane. In addition, severe acidosis associated with propofol infusion appears to be reversible when propofol is discontinued. ","952":"A groove technique for securing an electrode connector was described as an alternative surgical technique in deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery to avoid electrode connector-related complications, such as skin erosion, infection, and migration. We retrospectively reviewed 109 patients undergoing one of two techniques; the standard technique (52 patients using 104 electrodes) and the groove technique (57 patients using 109 electrodes) for securing the electrode connector in DBS surgery, regardless of patient disease. In the standard percutaneous tunneling technique, the connector was placed on the vertex of the cranial surface. The other technique, so called the groove technique, created a groove (about 4 cm long, 8 mm wide) in the cranial bone at the posterior parietal area. Wound erosion and migration related to the connectors were compared between the two techniques. The mean follow-up period was 73 months for the standard method and 46 months for the groove technique. Connector-related complications were observed in three patients with the groove technique and in seven patients with the standard technique. Wound erosion at the connector sites per electrode was one (0.9%) with the groove technique and six (5.8%) with the standard technique. This difference was statistically significant. The electrode connector was migrated in two patients with the groove technique and in one patient with the standard technique. The groove technique, which involves securing an electrode using a groove in the cranial bone at the posterior parietal area, offers an effective and safe method to avoid electrode connector-related complications during DBS surgery. ","953":null,"954":"At present, gold-standard technique of cervical cord decompression is surgical decompression and fusion. But, many complications related cervical fusion have been reported. We adopted an extended anterior cervical foraminotomy (EACF) technique to decompress the anterolateral portion of cervical cord and report clinical results and effectiveness of this procedure. Fifty-three patients were operated consecutively using EACF from 2008 to 2013. All of them were operated by a single surgeon via the unilateral approach. Twenty-two patients who exhibited radicular and\/or myelopathic symptoms were enrolled in this study. All of them showed cervical cord compression in their preoperative magnetic resonance scan images. In surgical outcomes, 14 patients (64%) were classified as excellent and six (27%), as good. The mean difference of cervical cord anterior-posterior diameter after surgery was 0.92 mm (p&lt;0.01) and transverse area was 9.77 mm(2) (p&lt;0.01). The dynamic radiological study showed that the average post-operative translation (retrolisthesis) was 0.36 mm and the disc height loss at the operated level was 0.81 mm. The change in the Cobb angle decreased to 3.46, and showed slight kyphosis. The average vertebral body resection rate was 11.47%. No procedure-related complications occurred. Only one patient who had two-level decompression needed anterior fusion at one level as a secondary surgery due to postoperative instability. Cervical cord decompression was successfully performed using EACF technique. This procedure will be an alternative surgical option for treating cord compressing lesions. Long-term follow-up and a further study in larger series will be needed. ","955":"Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory rheumatic disease mainly affecting the axial skeleton. The rigid spine may secondarily develop osteoporosis, further increasing the risk of spinal fracture. In this study, we reviewed fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis that had been clinically diagnosed to better define the mechanism of injury, associated neurological deficit, predisposing factors, and management strategies. Between January 2003 and December 2013, 12 patients with 13 fractures with neurological complications were treated. Neuroimaging evaluation was obtained in all patients by using plain radiography, CT scan, and MR imaging. The ASIA Impairment Scale was used in order to evaluate the neurologic status of the patients. Management was based on the presence or absence of spinal instability. A total of 9 cervical and 4 thoracolumbar fractures were identified in a review of patients in whom ankylosing spondylitis had been diagnosed. Of these, 7 fractures were associated with a hyperextension mechanism. 10 cases resulted in a fracture by minor trauma. Posttraumatic neurological deficits were demonstrated in 11 cases and neurological improvement after surgery was observed in 5 of these cases. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are highly susceptible to spinal fracture and spinal cord injury even after only mild trauma. Initial CT or MR imaging of the whole spine is recommended even if the patient's symptoms are mild. The patient should also have early surgical stabilization to correct spinal deformity and avoid worsening of the patient's neurological status. ","956":"This study analyzed clinical and radiological outcomes of a zero-profile anchored spacer (Zero-P) and conventional cage-plate (CCP) for single level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to compare the incidence and difference of postoperative dysphagia with both devices. We retrospectively reviewed our experiences of single level ACDF with the CCP and Zero-P. From January 2011 to December 2013, 48 patients who had single level herniated intervertebral disc were operated on using ACDF, with CCP in 27 patients and Zero-P in 21 patients. Patients who received more than double-level ACDF or combined circumferential fusion were excluded. Age, operation time, estimated blood loss (EBL), pre-operative modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scores, post-operative mJOA scores, achieved mJOA scores and recovery rate of mJOA scores were assessed. Prevertebral soft tissue thickness and postoperative dysphagia were analyzed on the day of surgery, and 2 weeks and 6 months postoperatively. The Zero-P group showed same or favorable clinical and radiological outcomes compared with the CCP group. Postoperative dysphagia was significantly low in the Zero-P group. Application of Zero-P may achieve favorable outcomes and reduce postoperative dysphagia in single level ACDF. ","957":"The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical efficacy of motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring for supratentorial tumor surgery. Between 2010 and 2012, to prevent postoperative motor deterioration, MEP recording after transcranial stimulation was performed in 84 patients with supratentorial brain tumors (45 males, 39 females; age range, 24-80 years; median age, 58 years). MEP monitoring results were correlated with postoperative motor outcome compared to preoperative motor status. MEP recordings were stable in amplitude (&lt;50% reduction in amplitude) during surgery in 77 patients (91.7%). No postoperative motor deficit was found in 66 out of 77 patients with stable MEP amplitudes. However, postoperative paresis developed in 11 patients. False negative findings were associated with edema in peri-resectional regions and postoperative bleeding in the tumor bed. MEP decrease in amplitude (&gt;50%) occurred in seven patients (8.3%). However, no deficit occurred postoperatively in four patients following preventive management during the operation. Three patients had permanent paresis, which could have been associated with vascular injury during tumor resection. MEP monitoring during supratentorial tumor surgery is feasible and safe. However, false negative MEP results associated with postoperative events may occur in some patients. To achieve successful monitoring, collaboration between surgeon, anesthesiologist and an experienced technician is mandatory.

We report two successful experiences of treating severe dysesthetic pain occurring after anterior spine surgery, by performing a sympathetic block. The first patient experienced a burning and stabbing pain in the contralateral upper extremity of approach side used in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, and underwent a stellate ganglion block with a significant relief of his pain. The second patient complained of a cold sensation and severe unexpected pain in the lower extremity of the contralateral side after anterior lumbar interbody fusion and was treated with lumbar sympathetic block. We aimed to describe sympathetically maintained pain as one of the important causes of early postoperative pain and the treatment option chosen for these cases in detail.

The Dandy-Walker complex (DWC) is characterized by an enlarged posterior fossa with high insertion of the tentorium, hypoplasia or aplasia of the cerebellar vermis, and cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle. These each two conditions are rare, but NCM associated with DWC is even more rare. Most patients of NCM with DWC present neurological symptoms early in life such as intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and malignant transformation of the melanocytes. We report a 14-year-old male patient who was finally diagnosed as NCM in association with DWC with extensive intracerebral and spinal cord involvement.

Here, we report a case of a cervical synovial cyst presenting as acute myelopathy after manual stretching. A 68-year-old man presented with gait disturbance, decreased touch senses, and increased sensitivity to pain below T12 level. These symptoms developed after manual stretching 3 days prior. Computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1-cm, small multilocular cystic lesion in the spinal canal with cord compression at the C7-T1 level. We performed a left partial laminectomy of C7 and T1 using a posterior approach and completely removed the cystic mass. Histological examination of the resected mass revealed fibrous tissue fragments with amorphous materials and granulation tissue compatible with a synovial cyst. The patient's symptoms resolved after surgery. We describe a case of acute myelopathy caused by a cervical synovial cyst that was treated by surgical excision. Although cervical synovial cysts are often associated with degenerative facet joints, clinicians should be aware of the possibility that these cysts can cause acute neurologic symptoms. ","966":"Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in Asian countries, including Korea. We experienced a case of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) from gastric cancer that was originally misdiagnosed as vestibular schwannoma based on the similar radiological characteristics. To our knowledge, LC from gastric cancer is very rare. In conclusion, our experience with this case suggests that clinicians should consider the possibility of delayed leptomeningeal metastasis when treating patients with gastric cancer. ","967":"A 70-year-old woman presented with headaches and recurrent stroke symptoms. During five years, the patient has been treated for cerebral infarction associated with severe atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Three-year follow-up magnetic resonance angiography showed a tiny de novo aneurysm arising from the distal part of atherosclerotic internal carotid artery. And 5-year follow-up three-dimensional CT angiogram demonstrated a definite aneurysm enlargement as large as requiring treatment. During dissection of aneurysm, the oculomotor nerve was found to be penetrated with the growing de novo aneurysm. The authors report a case of a de novo aneurysm, which resulted from atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery at the supraclinoid portion, that was found to be penetrating the oculomotor nerve with no ocular palsy. ","968":"Helicopter ambulance transport (HAT) is a highly resource-intensive facility that is a well-established part of the trauma transport system in many developed countries. Here, we review the benefit of HAT for neurosurgical patients in Korea. This retrospective study followed neurotrauma patients who were transferred by HAT to a single emergency trauma center over a period of 2 years. The clinical benefits of HAT were measured according to the necessity of emergency surgical intervention and the differences in the time taken to transport patients by ground ambulance transport (GAT) and HAT. Ninety-nine patients were transferred to a single university hospital using HAT, of whom 32 were taken to the neurosurgery department. Of these 32 patients, 10 (31.3%) needed neurosurgical intervention, 14 (43.8%) needed non-neurosurgical intervention, 3 (9.4%) required both, and 11 (34.4%) did not require any intervention. The transfer time was faster using HAT than the estimated time needed for GAT, although for a relatively close distance (&lt;50 km) without ground obstacles (mountain or sea) HAT did not improve transfer time. The cost comparison showed that HAT was more expensive than GAT (3,292,000 vs. 84,000 KRW, p&lt;0.001). In this Korean-based study, we found that HAT has a clinical benefit for neurotrauma cases involving a transfer from a distant site or an isolated area. A more precise triage for using HAT should be considered to prevent overuse of this expensive transport method.

Its incidence seems to be increasing as a result of larger proportion of the older patients with chronic debilitating disease, the rise of intravenous drug abuser, and the increase in spinal procedure and surgery. In Korea, studies assessing infectious spinal disease are rare and have not been addressed in recent times. The objectives of this study are to describe the epidemiology of all kind of spinal infectious disease and their clinical and microbiological characteristics as well as to assess the diagnostic methodology and the parameters related to the outcomes. A retrospective study was performed in all infectious spinal disease cases presenting from January 2005 to April 2010 to three tertiary teaching hospitals within a city of 1.5 million in Korea. Patient demographics, risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes were assessed. Risk factors entailed the presence of diabetes, chronic renal failure, liver cirrhosis, immunosuppressants, remote infection, underlying malignancy and previous spinal surgery or procedure. We comparatively analyzed the results between the groups of pyogenic and tuberculous spinal infection. SPSS version 14 statistical software was used to perform the analyses of the data. The threshold for statistical significance was established at p&lt;0.05. Ninety-two cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Overall, patients of tuberculous spinal infection (TSI) and pyogenic spinal infection (PSI) entailed 20 (21.7%) and 72 (78.3%) cases, respectively. A previous spinal surgery or procedure was the most commonly noted risk factor (39.1%), followed by diabetes (15.2%). The occurrence of both pyogenic and tuberculous spondylitis was predominant in the lumbar spine. Discs are more easily invaded in PSI. At initial presentation, white cell blood count and C-reactive protein levels were higher in PSI compared to TSI (p&lt;0.05). Etiological agents were identified in 53.3%, and the most effective method for identification of etiological agents was tissue culture (50.0%). Staphyococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated infective agent associated with pyogenic spondylitis, followed by E. coli. Surgical treatment was performed in 31.5% of pyogenic spondylitis and in 35.0% of tuberculous spondylitis cases. Many previous studies in Korea usually reported that tuberculous spondylitis is the predominant infection. However, in our study, the number of pyogenic infection was 3 times greater than that of tuberculous spinal disease. Etiological agents were identified in a half of all infectious spinal disease. For better outcomes, we should try to identify the causative microorganism before antibiotic therapy and make every effort to improve the result of culture and biopsy.

The preoperative visualization of the course of facial nerve in relation to VS could help prevent injury to the nerve during the surgery. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) for preoperative identification of facial nerve. We prospectively collected data from 11 patients with VS, who underwent preoperative DTT for facial nerve. Imaging results were correlated with intraoperative findings. Postoperative DTT was performed at postoperative 3 month. Facial nerve function was clinically evaluated according to the House-Brackmann (HB) facial nerve grading system. Facial nerve courses on preoperative tractography were entirely correlated with intraoperative findings in all patients. Facial nerve was located on the anterior of the tumor surface in 5 cases, on anteroinferior in 3 cases, on anterosuperior in 2 cases, and on posteroinferior in 1 case. In postoperative facial nerve tractography, preservation of facial nerve was confirmed in all patients. No patient had severe facial paralysis at postoperative one year. This study shows that DTT for preoperative identification of facial nerve in VS surgery could be a very accurate and useful radiological method and could help to improve facial nerve preservation.

Anterior approaches offer direct visualization and access to the herniated disc and anterior dura but require access surgeons and are often associated with considerable postoperative pain and pulmonary complications. A disadvantage with using posterior approaches in the setting of central calcified thoracic disc herniation however, has been the limited visualization of anterior dura and difficulty to accurately assess the extent of decompression. We report our experience with intraoperative ultrasound (US) guidance during a modified posterior transpedicular approach for removal of a central calcified thoracic disc herniation with a review of pertinent literature. The herniated thoracic disc was successfully removed with posterior approach with the aid of intraoperative US. The patient had significant neurological improvement at three months follow-up. Intraoperative ultrasound is a simple yet valuable tool for real-time imaging during transpedicular thoracic discectomy. Visualization provided by intraoperative US increases the safety profile of posterior approaches and may make thoracotomy unnecessary in a selected group of patients, especially when a patient has existing pulmonary disease or is otherwise not medically fit for the transthoracic approach. ","978":"A case of intractable hiccup developed by cavernous hemangioma in the medulla oblongata is reported. There have been only five previously reported cases of medullary cavernoma that triggered intractable hiccup. The patient was a 28-year-old man who was presented with intractable hiccup for 15 days. It developed suddenly, then aggravated progressively and did not respond to any types of medication. On magnetic resonance images, a well-demarcated and non-enhancing mass with hemorrhagic changes was noted in the left medulla oblongata. Intraoperative findings showed that the lesion was fully embedded within the brain stem and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma. The hiccup resolved completely after the operation. Based on the presumption that the medullary cavernoma may trigger intractable hiccup by displacing or compression the hiccup arc of the dorsolateral medulla, surgical excision can eliminate the symptoms, even in the case totally buried in brainstem. ","979":"Hydranencephaly is a rare congenital disease defined as an absence of cerebral hemispheres with an intact thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum. Generally, patients with hydranencephaly require cerebro-spinal fluid diversion due to progressive hydrocephalus. An excellent view of the choroid plexus and advancement of the neurosurgical endoscope were possible, leading to easy coagulation of the choroid plexus to balance cerebro-spinal fluid production without the use of a shunt device. We present this rare case and good treatment outcome from endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus.

CIDP is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy, either progressive or relapsing-remitting. It is a non-hereditary disorder characterized by symmetrical motor and sensory deficits. Rarely, spinal nerve roots can be involved, leading to CES by hypertrophic cauda equina. A 34-year-old man presented with low back pain, radicular pain, bilateral lower-extremity weakness, urinary incontinence, and constipation. He had had musculoskeletal deformities, such as hammertoes and pes cavus, since age 10. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse thickening of the cauda equina. Electrophysiological testing showed increased distal latency, conduction blocks, temporal dispersion, and severe nerve conduction velocity slowing (3 m\/s). We were not able to find genetic mutations at the PMP 22, MPZ, PRX, and EGR2 genes. The pathologic findings of the sural nerve biopsy revealed thinly myelinated nerve fibers with Schwann cells proliferation. We performed a decompressive laminectomy, intravenous IgG (IV-IgG) and oral steroid. At 1 week after surgery, most of his symptoms showed marked improvements except foot deformities. There was no relapse or aggravation of disease for 3 years. We diagnosed the case as an early-onset CIDP with cauda equine syndrome, whose initial clinical findings were similar to those of CMT1, and successfully managed with decompressive laminectomy, IV-IgG and oral steroid.

Occasionally, SEL may occur in patients not exposed to steroids or suffering from endocrinopathies, namely, idiopathic SEL. Thus far, case studies of SEL among Korean have been published rather sporadically. We reviewed the clinical features of SEL cases, among Koreans with journal review, including this report of three operated cases. According to this study, there were some differences between Korean and western cases. Koreans had higher incidences of idiopathic SEL, predominant involvement in the lumbar segments, very few thoracic involvement and lower MBI, as opposed to westerners.

He was treated with total removal of the tumor. This is the first case of an extra-axially located medulloblastoma occurring in the cerebellar hemisphere posteriolateral to the cerebellopontine angle in Korea. Although the extra-axial occurrence of medulloblastoma is rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of extra-axial lesions of the posterior fossa in children.

The author reports a case of actively rebleeding aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery with intraventricular extravasation on the hyperacute CTA imaging. The rebleeding route, not into the third ventricle but into the lateral ventricles, can be visualized by real-time three-dimensional CT pictures. The hemorrhage broke the septum pellucidum and the lamina rostralis rather than the lamina terminalis. ","984":"The Sundt encircling clip was developed to repair defects of the vessel wall. With the advent of microvascular techniques, most parts of the damaged vessel wall during aneurysm surgery can be repaired by primary closure or by the bypass technique. However, these methods are not always successful. Here, we illustrate two cases of surgical clipping with the Sundt encircling clip in the ruptured internal carotid artery trunk aneurysm. The Sundt clip provides prompt control of unexpected tearing of the vessel wall or aneurysm and plays an important role in vascular rescue during aneurysm surgery. ","985":"Management guidelines for single intracranial hematomas have been established, but the optimal management of multiple hematomas has little known. We present bilateral traumatic supratentorial hematomas that each has enough volume to be evacuated and discuss how to operate effectively it in a single anesthesia. In total, 203 patients underwent evacuation and\/or decompressive craniectomies for acute intracranial hematomas over 5 years. Among them, only eight cases (3.9%) underwent operations for bilateral intracranial hematomas in a single session. Injury mechanism, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, types of intracranial lesions, surgical methods, and Glasgow outcome scale were evaluated. The most common injury mechanism was a fall (four cases). The types of intracranial lesions were epidural hematoma (EDH)\/intracerebral hematoma (ICH) in five, EDH\/EDH in one, EDH\/subdural hematoma (SDH) in one, and ICH\/SDH in one. All cases except one had an EDH. The EDH was addressed first in all cases. Then, the evacuation of the ICH was performed through a small craniotomy or burr hole. All patients except one survived. Bilateral intracranial hematomas that should be removed in a single-session operation are rare. Epidural hematomas almost always occur in these cases and should be removed first to prevent the hematoma from growing during the surgery. Then, the other hematoma, contralateral to the EDH, can be evacuated with a small craniotomy.

A total of 155 patients who underwent ACDF with more than 1 year follow up were included. Radiologically, IVH and interfacet distance (IFD) of the operated segment were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. We clinically evaluated neck and arm pains according to visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and assessed neck disability index (NDI) scores preoperatively, postoperatively, at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. The relationship between radiological parameters, and clinical scores were analyzed using a regression analysis. The mean increase in IVH was 2.62 mm, and the mean increase in IFD was 0.67 mm. The VAS scores for neck pain preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year postoperatively were 4.46, 2.11, 2.07, 1.95, and 1.29; those for arm pain were 5.89, 3.24, 3.20, 3.03, and 2.18. The NDI scores were improved from 18.52 to 7.47. No significant relationship was observed between the radiological evaluation results regarding the increase in intervertebral height or interfacet distance and clinical changes in VAS or NDI scores. The increase in intervertebral space or interfacet distance by the insertion of a large graft material while performing ACDF for the treatment of degenerative cervical disease was not related with the change in VAS scores for neck and arm pains and NDI scores postoperatively and during the follow-up period.

The patients had a median age of 57.1 years (range, 16--77 years), a female predominance of 79.7%, and a mean follow-up duration of 48.4 months (range, 0.8--242.2 months). Gross total resection (Simpson's grade I &amp; II) was achieved in 81.6% (129\/158) of patients. Non-skull base location was an independent factor for complete resection. The recurrence rate was 13.3% (21\/158) and the 5-, 10-, and 15-year recurrence rates were 8.2%, 12.0%, and 13.3%, respectively. Benign pathology, postoperative KPS over than 90, low peritumoral edema, and complete resection were significantly associated with longer recurrence-free survival rate. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 96.2%, 94.9%, and 94.9%, respectively. Benign pathology, postoperative KPS over than 90 and complete resection were significantly associated with a longer survival rate. The permanent complication rate was 13% (21\/158). Skull base location and postoperative KPS less than 90 were independent factors for the occurrence of permanent complication.

A 45-year-old male presented with left-sided focal seizures with generalization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a diffuse thickening and enhancement of the right convexity dura matter and falx with focal nodularity. The surgically resected specimens exhibited the proliferation of fibroblast-like spindle cells and an infiltration of mononuclear cells, including predominantly plasma cells. The ratio of IgG4-positive plasma cells to the overall IgG-positive cells was 45% in the area containing the highest infiltration of plasma cells. On the basis of the above findings, IgG4-related sclerosing disease arising from the dura mater was suspected. IgG4-related sclerosing disease should be added to the pachymeningitis spectrum.

Because the bodies of C6 and 7 were tightly locked together, cervical traction failed. Then the patient was operated on by a posterior approach. Posterior stabilization and fusion were performed by C4-5 lateral mass and C7-T1 pedicle screw fixation and rod instrumentation with bridging both C4-5's rods to the C7-T1's extended ones. After C6 total laminectomy and foraminotomy, the C6 body was returned to its proper position. Secondly, anterior stabilization and fusion were performed by C6-7 discectomy with a screw-plate system.

This case is classified as a post-surgical atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, but has a very rare morphology that has not previously been reported. Although there are several reports about post-surgical atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, an important point of this case is that it might be directly related to the spinal cord surgery in C1\/C2 level. On day 6 after surgery, the patient presented with the Cock Robin position, and a computed tomography scan revealed a normal type of atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation. Manual reduction was performed followed by external fixation with a neck collar. About 7 months after the first surgery, the subluxation became severe, irreducible, and assumed an atypical form where the anterior tubercle of C1 migrated to a cranial position, and the posterior tubercle of C1 and the occipital bone leaned in a caudal direction. The pathogenic process suggested deformity of the occipital condyle and bilateral C2 superior facets with atlantooccipital subluxation.

To determine the depth and width of the interspinous space, two methods are available which utilize plain film and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data analysis of the interspinous depth and width was undertaken in 100 patients. The standard deviations were variable, since skin thickness (zone 1) was altered by sex and age. The difference in the zone 1 distance between adjacent interspinous processes varied according to gender (p&lt;0.05), but was not influenced by age [p=0.32 by analysis of variance between groups (ANOVA)]. Zone 2, the supraspinous, and zone 3, the interspinous ligament depths, comprise the operative working area during insertion of an interspinous spacer.

Three years later, he complained of aggravated back pain, and follow-up MR examination showed a markedly expanded cyst, occupying the subarachnoid space from the T11 to the S1 level. L2 hemilaminectomy was performed, and a yellowish infected cyst bulged out through the dural opening. The cyst was removed en bloc. The histopathological findings of the cyst were consistent with parasitic infection. Serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the presence of spinal cysticercosis. As there was no intracranial lesion, the final diagnosis was primary spinal cysticercosis, which is very rare. MR imaging is a sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting cystic lesions in the spine; however, it is difficult to distinguish cysticercosis from non-infectious cysts such as an arachnoid cyst without using gadolinium enhancement.

Their preoperative symptoms were all resolved with burr hole and drainage operation. Juveniles and young adults suffering from CSDH differ from that of their elderly counterparts in their clinical and etiopathological characteristics.

Group A included patients with tumors above the superior nuchal line (SNL), Group B with tumors within the trapezius muscle area and patients who had tumors on the lateral trapezius muscle area were assigned to Group C. We compared the incidence related to postoperative sensory complications and summarized their additional treatments for these with clinical outcome. There were 12 patients (10%) with sensory complications related on the mass excision site (Group A: 1 patient, Group B: 2 patients, Group C: 9 patients). Six patients were affected with lesser occipital nerve (LON), 2 patients on greater occipital nerve (GON) and 4 patients on GON and LON. Over 6 months after surgery, two of the twelve patients with sensory complications did not have complete recovered pain in spite of proper medications and local chemical neurolysis with 1.0% lidocaine and dexamethasone.

MRI preferred over CT because of its high specificity and sensitivity. In emergency situations like acute hydrocephalus one can proceed with emergency endoscopic surgery. Through the endoscopic view, intra ventricular NCC (IVNCC) has distinguished morphological features like the full moon sign. This feature not only helps in identification of IVNCC, but also guides in further endoscopic treatment strategy.

Over the ensuing 48 hours, left sided weakness deteriorated despite medical treatment. Emergency extracranial-intracranial bypass was performed using a double-barrel technique, leaving the tumor as it was, and subsequently his neurological function was improved dramatically. We present a rare case of sphenoid ridge meningioma causing acute cerebral infarction as a result of middle cerebral artery compression. ","1036":"Vascular complications after percutaneous angiography include hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, thromboembolism, arterial laceration and infection. Hematomas may occur in the groin, thigh, retroperitoneal, intraperitoneal, or abdominal wall. A 54-year-old female underwent percutaneous transfemoral angiography for the evaluation of cerebral aneurysm. Renal subcapsular hematoma developed 3 hours after the procedure. Renal subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous angiography is very rare. We investigated the possible causes of renal subcapsular hematoma. To avoid this rare complication, we need to perform guide-wire passage carefully from the beginning of the procedure under full visual monitoring. ","1037":"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare inherited connective disease. Among several subgroups, type IV EDS is frequently associated with spontaneous catastrophic bleeding from a vascular fragility. We report on a case of carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) in a patient with type IV EDS. A 46-year-old female presented with an ophthalmoplegia and chemosis in the right eye. Subsequently, seizure and cerebral infarction with micro-bleeds occurred. CCF was completely occluded with transvenous coil embolization without complications. Thereafter, the patient was completely recovered. Transvenous coil embolization can be a good treatment of choice for spontaneous CCF with type IV EDS. However, every caution should be kept during invasive procedure. ","1038":"Chronic encapsulated intracerebral hematoma (CEIH) is a rare cerebrovascular disease that behaves as a slowly expanding lesion with a gradual onset. It is well established that CEIH is associated with arteriovenous malformations; however, CEIH associated with cavernous malformation (CM) is extremely rare. We herein report a case of CEIH associated with CM, and discuss its pathogenesis. A 12-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of a one week history of progressive headache and nausea. Brain computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed an intracerebral hematoma surrounded by edema in the right frontal lobe. One week later, her headache and nausea worsened, and a brain computed tomography scan revealed the enlargement of hematoma. A right frontal craniotomy was performed. The capsule, mass, and hematoma were totally removed. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of CEIH associated with CM. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the VEGF receptor-1 in the endothelium and fibroblasts. Our findings suggest that the activated VEGF pathway might have positively contributed to development of CEIH in the present patient. ","1039":"The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder affecting up to 5% to 15% of the general population, in which the incidence increases with age, and includes paresthesia in the legs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of RLS in spine center and to review clinical manifestations of this syndrome and its current treatments. Over a period of a year, retrospective medical record review and lumbar magnetic resonance images were performed on 32 patients with RLS in spine clinic who were diagnosed by National Institutes of Health criteria. Affected limbs were classified as five. Two grading systems were used in the evaluation of neural compromises. The incidence of RLS was 5.00% (32\/639). There were 16 males (50%) and 16 females (50%). The median age at diagnosis was 55.4 years (range, 25-93 years). There are no correlation between the affected limbs of RLS and neural compromises on the lumbar spine. The RLS is a clearly common neurologic disorder of the limbs, usually the legs. The awareness of this syndrome can help reduce diagnostic error; thereby, avoiding the morbidity and expense associated with unnecessary studies or inappropriate treatments in RLS patients.

We report here a patient with a solitary cavernous sinus sarcoidosis who had a history of syphilis and showed rapidly progressing cavernous sinus syndrome. A transsphenoidal biopsy was performed and a histopathologic examination revealed a non-caseating granuloma with an asteroid body. His facial pain disappeared after steroid therapy. He received oral prednisolone for one year. A follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed resolution of the mass over the cavernous sinus. Particularly in patients with a history of syphilis, neurosyphilis should be included in a differential diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. ","1045":"Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK) is a rare malignancy in infancy. Central nervous system involvement in RTK is already known. However, solitary spinal metastasis in RTK has been hardly reported. The authors report a case of metastatic RTK to spine causing paraplegia in an 8-month-old girl. Since the patient was young, the diagnosis of spine metastasis was delayed until paraplegia was seen after radical nephrectomy. Thorough neurological examination should be performed for early diagnosis of spinal metastasis in young patients with RTK. If there are any abnormal signs in neurologic examination, magnetic resonance images of brain and spine are recommended. ","1046":"Intracranial tumors secondary to radiotherapy are rare. In this group gliomas are the rarest. Only 6 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have been reported in patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) for craniopharyngiomas of which only 4 have been in children less than 18 years of age. In recent years RT has become a mainstay of adjuvant therapy for recurrent or partially excised craniopharyngiomas. We report a child of 12 years who had previously undergone RT for a suprasellar craniopharyngioma and presented 10 years later with a GBM. This is the 5th pediatric case in literature demonstrating a GBM after RT for a craniopharyngioma. The implications of subjecting the pediatric population to RT for a benign lesion versus the outcome of gross total removal and management of RT induced tumors is discussed and the need to avail of safer alternatives such as stereotactic radiosurgery is stressed. ","1047":"Mild traumatic brain injury is common in elderly patients, many of whom are on anticoagulant. The common practice is to discharge these patients from the emergency room if the computed tomography (CT) of the brain is normal. However, a very small proportion of these patients may develop a life threatening intracranial haematoma in the following days. We present here a case of a 66-year-old male on anticoagulant therapy that developed a subdural haematoma 48 hours after a mild head injury, with a normal initial CT scan of the brain. The patient underwent a craniotomy with evacuation of a large subdural clot. Postoperatively he had progressively improved and six months later has a Glasgow Outcome Score of three. This case is characterized by the delayed onset of a subdural haematoma in a patient on anticoagulation and we discuss here the possible pathogenesis related to this phenomenon. We also briefly review the pertinent literature and the current guidelines for the management of this type of head injuries. ","1048":"Brucellosis is caused by gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, facultative, intracellular coccobacilli belonging to the genus Brucella. A 50-year-old man working as an employee was admitted to neurosurgery clinic with severe low back, radicular right leg pain and hypoesthesia in right L4-5 dermatomes for 2 months. Brucella tube agglutination (Wright) test was positive in serum sample of the patient with a titer of 1\/640. Brucella melitensis was isolated from blood culture. X-ray and MRI of the lomber spine showed massive collapse of L4 vertebral body. Neural tissue was decompressed and then posterior L3-5 short segment transpedicular screw fixation and stabilization was performed. Brucella melitensis was isolated from microbiologic culture of pathologic specimen. Antibiotic therapy was given as doxycycline 200 mg\/day and rifampicin 600 mg\/day for 6 months. Brucellosis is a systemic zoonotic infection and still an important public health problem in many geographical parts of the world. Vertebral body collapse caused by brucellosis occurs very rarely but represents a neurosurgical emergency because of its potential for causing rapidly progressive spinal cord compression and permanent paralysis. Neurosurgeons, emergency department personnel as well as infectious disease specialists should always keep a high index of suspicion and include brucellosis in the differential diagnosis of vertebral body collapse. ","1049":"Patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) are predisposed to develop central nervous system tumors, due to the loss of neurofibromin, an inactivator of proto-oncogene Ras. However, to our knowledge, only three cases of ependymomas with NF1 have been reported in the literature. The authors present a case of NF1 patient with a spinal cord ependymoma. She was referred for about half a year history of increasing numbness that progressed from her fingers to her entire body above the bellybutton. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a relative-demarcated, heterogeneously enhanced mass lesion accompanied by perifocal edema in C5-7 level, a left-sided T11 spinous process heterogeneously enhanced mass in soft tissue, intervertebral disk hernia in L2-5 level, and widespread punctum enhancing lesion in her scalp and in T11-L5 level. The patient underwent C5-7 laminectomies and total excision of the tumor under operative microscope, and intraoperative ultrasonography and physiological monitoring were used during the surgery. Histopathologically, her tumor was found to be a ependymoma without malignant features (grade II in the World Health Organization classification). Therefore, no adjuvant therapy was applied. Following the operation, the patient showed an uneventful clinical recovery with no evidence of tumor recurrence after one year of follow-up. ","1050":"A correlation between radiation therapy and cavernoma has been suspected since 1994. Since then, only a few cases of radio-induced cavernomas have been reported in the literature (85 patients). Most of them were children, and the most frequent original tumour had been medulloblastoma. The authors report a case of two cystic cavernous angiomas after radiation therapy for atypical meningioma in adult woman. This is the first case of cavernous angioma after radiotherapy for low grade meningioma. A 39-year-old, Latin american woman was operated on for a frontal atypical meningioma with intradiploic component and adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered (6000 cGy local brain irradiation, fractionated over 6 weeks). Follow-up MR imaging showed no recurrences of the tumour and no other lesions. Ten years later, at the age of 49, she consulted for progressive drug-resistant headache. MR imaging revealed two new well defined areas of different signal intensity at the surface of each frontal pole. Both lesions were surgically removed; the histopathological diagnosis was cavernous angioma. This is the first case of cavernous angioma after radiation therapy for atypical meningioma : it confirms the development of these lesions after standard radiation therapy also in patients previously affected by non-malignant tumours. ","1051":"Treatment of complex aneurysms usually entails not only direct clipping but also alternative treatment modality. We recently experienced a case of vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm and obtained good treatment outcomes. Our case suggests that the endovascular segmental occlusion with posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) to PICA side anastomosis might be a good treatment option in patients with complex vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms. A 45-year-old woman has a left vertebral dissecting aneurysm with dizziness. Based on the aneurysmal morphology and the involvement of PICA, the patient underwent side to side anastomosis of the PICA. This was followed by the endovascular segmental coil occlusion. The aneurysmal sac was completely obliterated. At a 2-year follow-up, the patient achieved a good patency of both PICA. In conclusion our case suggests that the endovascular segmental occlusion of the parent artery followed by PICA to PICA bypass surgery through a midline suboccipital approach is a reasonable multimodal treatment option in patients with complex vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms. ","1052":"The pipeline embolization device (PED) is a new endovascular device for treatment of complex, fusiform and wide-neck intracranial aneurysms. The main mechanism of this stent is to divert the flow in the parent artery with reduction of inflow in the aneurysm leading to thrombosis. We treated a 40-year-old woman who had left facial pain and orbit discomfort. Angiography showed a giant fusiform aneurysm located in the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery. A PED was successfully deployed across the aneurysm. The procedure and post-procedural course were uneventful. After 3 months, angiography showed complete obliteration of the aneurysm with good patency of the branching vessels originating from the deployed segment. The patient's symptoms improved completely without complications. ","1053":"Early decompressive craniectomy (DC) has been used as the first stage treatment to prevent secondary injuries in cases of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Postoperative management is the major factor that influences outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of postoperative management, using intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and including consecutive DC on the other side, on the two-week mortality in severe TBI patients treated with early DC. Seventy-eight patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score &lt;9] underwent early DC were retrospectively investigated. Among 78 patients with early DC, 53 patients were managed by conventional medical treatments and the other, 25 patients were treated under the guidance of ICP monitoring, placed during early DC. In the ICP monitoring group, consecutive DC on the other side were performed on 11 patients due to a high ICP of greater than 30 mm Hg and failure to respond to any other medical treatments. The two-week mortality rate was significantly different between two groups [50.9% (27 patients) and 24% (6 patients), respectively, p=0.025]. After adjusting for confounding factors, including sex, low GCS score, and pupillary abnormalities, ICP monitoring was associated with a 78% lower likelihood of 2-week mortality (p=0.021). ICP monitoring in conjunction with postoperative treatment, after early DC, is associated with a significantly reduced risk of death. ","1054":"This study explored the relationships among demographic (DVs) and clinical variables (CVs), neurocognitive (NOs) and functional outcome (FO) that could be used as prognostic factors for old aged patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) undergoing or appointed disability evaluation (DE) after treatment. A total of 162 subjects with TBI above the age of 55 years undergoing DE or appointed to do so after treatments were selected. The patients were divided into two subgroups according to age : a junior elderly group 55 to 64 years old and a senior elderly group over the age of 65. NOs and FO were evaluated using the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery and Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Gender, age, and education level were shown to significantly impact the recovery of NOs after TBI. Other DVs and CVs such as area of residency, occupation, type of injury, or loss of consciousness were not found to significantly affect the recovery of NOs after TBI. Analysis of the relationships among DVs, CVs and NOs demonstrated that gender, age, and education level contributed to the variance of NOs. In FO, loss of consciousness (LOC) was included to prognostic factor. Gender, age and education level significantly influence the NOs of elderly patients with TBI. LOC may also serve as a meaningful prognostic factor in FO. Unlike younger adult patients with TBI, old aged patients with TBI did not show global faking-bad or malingering attitudes to DE for compensation, but assume that they could faking their performance in a test set available visual feedback. ","1055":"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is often complicated by subsidence, pseudoarthrosis, kyphosis, and graft donor site morbidities. To decrease the occurrence of these complications, various types of cages have been developed. We designed this retrospective study to analyze and compare the efficacy and outcomes of ACDF using double cylindrical cages (DCC) (BK Medical, Seoul, Korea) versus an anterior cervical plating system with autogenous iliac crest grafts. Forty-eight patients were treated with autograft and plating (plate group), and 48 with DCC group from October 2007 to October 2011. We analyzed construct length, cervical lordotic curvarture, the thickness of the prevertebral soft tissue, segmental instability, and clinical outcomes. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to the decrease in construct length or cervical lodortic curvature at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The prevertebral soft tissue was thinner in the DCC group than the plate group immediately after surgery and at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. The difference in interspinous distance on flexion-extension was shorter in the plate group than the DCC group at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. However, there was no significant difference in this distance between the two groups at the 12-month follow-up. A double cylindrical cage is a good alternative for fusion in patients with cervical degenerative diseases; the surgical method is relatively simple, allows good synostosis, has less associated prevertebral soft tissue swelling, and complications associated with autografting can be avoided. ","1056":"We evaluated pseudoprogression (PsPD) following radiation therapy combined with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ), and we assessed pseudoresponse following anti-angiogenic therapy for patients with recurrent disease using the Response Assessment of the Neuro-Oncology Working Group.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) with CPT-11 were used as a salvage option for cases of radiologic progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was routinely performed 1 month after concurrent radiochemotherapy (CRT) and every 3 months thereafter. For cases treated with the bevacizumab-containing regimen for progressive disease, MRI was performed every 2 months. Of 55 patients, 21 (38%) showed radiologic progression within 4 weeks after CRT. Of these patients, 16 (29%) showed progression at second post-CRT MRI (etPD) and five (9%) showed improvement (PsPD). Seven of thirty-four initially non-progressed patients showed progression at the second post-CRT MRI (ltPD). No difference in survival was observed between the etPD and ltPD groups (p=0.595). Five (50%) of ten patients showed a radiological response after salvage bevacizumab therapy. Four of those patients exhibited rapid progression immediately after discontinuation of the drug (drug holiday). Twelve weeks following treatment could be the optimal timing to determine PsPD or true progression. MRI with gadolinium enhancement alone is not sufficient to characterize tumor response or growth. Clinical correlation with adequate follow-up duration and histopathologic validation may be helpful in discriminating PsPD from true progression.

The patient was a 51-year-old female who presented with a 5-year history of a painless, progressively enlarging mass on the posterior neck. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a circumscribed mass compatible with fat between the C2 and C6 spinous processes with a large calcified irregular component. The mass with dual components was totally removed under general anesthesia and no recurrence was observed after 6 months of follow-up. We also reviewed the clinicopathologic features of previously reported osteolipomas in the literature and suggest that although osteolipoma is a rare variant of lipoma, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a lipoma of the posterior neck mixed with a bony component is encountered.

To investigate factors associated with successful trial stimulation, patients were classified into two groups (success and failure in trial). We investigated the following factors : age, sex, predominant pain areas (axial, limb, axial combined with limbs), number of operations, duration of preoperative pain, type of electrode (cylindrical\/paddle), predominant type of pain (nociceptive, neuropathic, mixed), degree of sensory loss in painful areas, presence of motor weakness, and preoperative Visual Analogue Scale. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, degree of pain, number of operations, and duration of pain (p&gt;0.05).

","1072":"Although surgical techniques for clipping paraclinoid aneurysms have evolved significantly in recent times, direct microsurgical clipping of large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms remains a formidable surgical challenge. We review here our surgical experiences in direct surgical clipping of large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms, especially in dealing with anterior clinoidectomy, distal dural ring resection, optic canal unroofing, clipping techniques, and surgical complications. Between September 2001 and February 2012, we directly obliterated ten large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms. In all cases, tailored orbito-zygomatic craniotomies with extradural and\/or intradural clinoidectomy were performed. The efficacy of surgical clipping was evaluated with postoperative digital subtraction angiography and computed tomographic angiography. Of the ten cases reported, five each were of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Five aneurysms occurred in the carotid cave, two in the superior hypophyseal artery, two in the intracavernous, and one in the posterior wall. The mean diameter of the aneurysms sac was 18.8 mm in the greatest dimension. All large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms were obliterated with direct neck clipping without bypass. With the exception of the one intracavenous aneurysm, all large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms were occluded completely. The key features of successful surgical clipping of large and giant paraclinoid aneurysms include enhancing exposure of proximal neck of aneurysms, establishing proximal control, and completely obliterating aneurysms with minimal manipulation of the optic nerve. Our results suggest that internal carotid artery reconstruction using multiple fenestrated clips without bypass may potentially achieve complete occlusion of large paraclinoid aneurysms.

Three days after photothrombotic infarction, rats were randomly allocated to one of four experimental groups [IA group : n=12, IV group : n=12, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) group : n=8, control group : n=8]. All groups were subdivided into 1, 6, 24, and 48 hours groups according to time point of sacrifice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consisting of T2 weighted image (T2WI), T2(*) weighted image (T2(*)WI), susceptibility weighted image (SWI), and diffusion weighted image of rat brain were obtained prior to and at 1, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-implantation. After final MRI, rats were sacrificed and grafted cells were analyzed in brain and lung specimen using Prussian blue and immunohistochemical staining. Grafted cells appeared as dark signal intensity regions at the peri-lesional zone. In IA group, dark signals in peri-lesional zone were more prominent compared with IV group. SWI showed largest dark signal followed by T2(*)WI and T2WI in both IA and IV groups. On Prussian blue staining, IA administration showed substantially increased migration and a large number of transplanted hBM-MSCs in the target brain than IV administration. The Prussian blue-positive cells were not detected in SPIO and control groups. In a rat photothrombotic model of ischemic stroke, selective IA administration of human mesenchymal stem cells is more effective than IV administration.

The purpose of this study was to compare the bone sparing effect of treatment of low-dose and high-dose curcumin after ovariectomy in rats. Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either a sham operation (the sham group) or bilateral ovariectomy (OVX). The ovariectomized animals were randomly distributed among three groups; untreated OVX group, low-dose (10 mg\/kg) curcumin administered group, and high-dose (50 mg\/kg) curcumin group. At 4 and 8 weeks after surgery, serum biochemical markers of bone turnover were analyzed. Bone histomorphometric parameters of the 4th lumbar vertebrae were determined by micro-computed tomography (CT). In addition, mechanical strength was determined by a three-point bending test. High-dose curcumin group showed significantly lower osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and the telopeptide fragment of type I collagen C-terminus concentration at 4 and 8 weeks compared with the untreated OVX group as well as low-dose curcumin group. In the analyses of micro-CT scans of 4th lumbar vertebrae, the high-dose curcumin treated group showed a significant increase in bone mineral densities (p=0.028) and cortical bone mineral densities (p=0.036) compared with the low-dose curcumin treated group. Only high-dose curcumin treated group had a significant increase of mechanical strength compared with the untreated OVX group (p=0.015). The present study results demonstrat that a high-dose curcumin has therapeutic advantages over a low-dose curcumin of an antiresorptive effect on bone remodeling and improving bone mechanical strength. ","1075":"There is a rich literature confirming the default mode network found compatible with task-induced deactivation regions in normal subjects, but few investigations of alterations of the motor deactivation in patients with intracranial lesions. Therefore, we hypothesized that an intracranial lesion results in abnormal changes in a task-induced deactivation region compared with default mode network, and these changes are associated with specific attributes of allocated regions. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a motor task were obtained from 27 intracranial lesion patients (mean age, 57.3 years; range 15-78 years) who had various kinds of brain tumors. The BOLD fMRI data for each patient were evaluated to obtain activation or deactivation regions. The distinctive deactivation regions from intracranial lesion patients were evaluated by comparing to the literature reports. THERE WERE ADDITIVE DEACTIVATED REGIONS ACCORDING TO INTRACRANIAL LESIONS: fusiform gyrus in cavernous hemangioma; lateral occipital gyrus in meningioma; crus cerebri in hemangiopericytoma; globus pallidus, lateral occipital gyrus, caudate nucleus, fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, claustrum, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus in GBM; fusiform gyrus in metastatic brain tumors. There is increasing interest in human brain function using fMRI. The authors report the brain function migrations and changes that occur in patients with intracranial lesions. ","1076":"","1077":"In most intracranial surgery cases, a drain catheter is inserted to prevent the collection of the wound hematoma or seroma. A drain catheter is also inserted to drain the hematoma or the cerebrospinal fluid. The drain catheter itself does not cause complications; but many complications occur during its removal, such as hematoma, seroma, air collection and pseudomeningocele formation. To prevent these complications, neurosurgeons perform a suture on the catheter to remove the site. In this study, an additional horizontal mattress suture and an anchoring suture to the drainage catheter are proposed. This method maintains negative pressure in the catheter insertion site during the catheter removal, compresses the catheter tunnel site and attaches the external wounds strongly. The technique is easy and safe to perform, and does not require an additional suture to remove the catheter. ","1078":"Liver abscess following ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting occurs very rarely. We report an unusual case of multiple liver abscesses caused by Staphylococcus capitis in a 50-year-old compromised woman due to a complicating VP shunt infection. We reviewed the nine cases of VP shunt complications reported in the English literature, and speculated that the most likely pathogenetic mechanism in our case is an infected peritoneal tip that migrated to and penetrated the liver, which subsequently caused the formation of multiple liver abscesses. The patient was successfully treated with percutaneous aspiration, drainage of the abscesses, intravenous antibiotics, and shunt revision. Awareness and vigilance of the possibility of liver abscess formation caused by VP shunt infection will help establish an early accurate diagnosis and therapeutic strategy. ","1079":"The cerebrospinal fluid tap test (CSFTT) is recommended as a key step in the diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). While there is no generally accepted evaluation period for ascertaining a CSFTT responder, a substantial number of patients are evaluated only once within 24 hours of the test for improvement in gait. We report an iNPH patient with a favorable response to shunt surgery, who was first judged a non-responder by this standard, though subsequently was judged a responder in virtue of repetitively testing gait over 7 days. A 68-year-old man presented with progressive impairment of gait, balance, and memory. He was diagnosed as iNPH with an Evans' ratio of 0.35. At first hospitalization, change in gait was evaluated 24 hours after the CSFTT. He didn't show any significant improvement and was judged as a non-responder. However, at the second CSFTT, we repetitively tested his change in gait over seven days. Forty-eight hours after the tap, he showed significant improvement in his gait. He was then confirmed as a responder. After the operation, the gait difficulties were almost fully resolved. Further studies developing the standard procedure of the CSFTT should be considered. ","1080":"Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) attributable to mild closed head trauma is a distinct rarity. Its diagnosis places high demands on the radiologist and the clinician. The authors describe this condition in a 36-year-old woman who slipped while walking and struck her face. Initial computed tomography did not reveal any causative cerebral and vascular lesions or orbital and cranial fractures. Enhancement and swelling of the cisternal segment of the oculomotor nerve was seen during the subacute phase on thin-sectioned contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images. The current case received corticosteroid therapy, and then recovered fully in 13 months after injury. Possible mechanism of ONP from minor head injury is proposed and previous reports in the literature are reviewed. ","1081":"Acute subdural hematoma is usually a neurological emergency that requires hematoma evacuation or close observation. However, spontaneous resolutions of an acute subdural hematoma without surgical interventions have been reported rarely. We report on a case who showed rapid resolution of an acute subdural hematoma with neurological improvement and review the relevant literatures. ","1082":"The prognosis of solitary plasmacytoma varies greatly, with some patients recovering after surgical removal or local fractional radiation therapy, and others progressing to multiple myeloma years later. Primary detection of progression to multiple myeloma is important in the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma. There have been several analyses of the risk factors involved in the early progression to multiple myeloma. We describe one case of solitary plasmacytoma of the lumbar vertebra that was treated with surgical decompression with stabilization and additional radiotherapy. The patient had no factors associated with rapid progression to multiple myeloma such as age, size, immunologic results, pathological findings, and serum free light chain ratio at the time of diagnosis. However, his condition progressed to multiple myeloma less than two months after the initial diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma. We suggest that surgeons should be vigilant in watching for rapid progression to multiple myeloma even in case that the patient with solitary plasmacytoma has no risk factors for rapid progression to multiple myeloma. ","1083":"We present a case report to remind surgeons of this unusual complication that can occur in any surgery, even posterior cervical spine surgery under general anesthesia and discuss its causes, treatment methods, and the follow-up results in the literature. The peripheral Tapia's syndrome is a rare complication of anesthetic airway management. Main symptoms are hoarseness of voice and difficulty of tongue movement. Tapia's syndrome after endotracheal general anesthesia is believed to be due to pressure neuropathy of the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nerve caused by the endotracheal tube. To our knowledge, no report has been published or given an explanation for Tapia's syndrome after posterior cervical spine surgery. Two patients who underwent posterior cervical surgery complained hoarseness and tongue palsy postoperatively. There is no direct anatomical relation between the operation, the vagus nerves and the hypoglossal nerves, and there is no record of displacement or malposition of the endotracheal tube. After several months, all symptoms are resolved. To avoid this problem in posterior cervical spine surgery, we suggest paying special attention to the position of the endotracheal tube to avoid excessive neck flexion before and during the positioning of the patient. ","1084":"Lymphomatosis cerebri is considered a diffuse form of primary central nervous system lymphoma and very rare. It is not well recognized and may be misdiagnosed with infiltrating tumors, degenerative disorders, ischemic diseases, and infectious diseases developed in the brain. Awareness of the possibility of this rare disease and early biopsy are required for differential diagnosis and preventing poor clinical outcomes. We report a case with lymphomatosis cerebri who presented with rapid neurological deteriorations and review the relevant literatures. ","1085":"Hemangioblastomas are sporadic tumors found in the cerebellum or spinal cord. Supratentorial hemangioblastomas are rare, and those with meningeal involvement are extremely rare and have been reported in only approximately 130 patients. Here, we report the case of a 51-year-old female patient with supratentorial meningeal hemangioblastoma detected 5 years after surgical resection of an infratentorial hemangioblastoma associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are at risk for developing multiple hemangioblastomas, with new tumor formation and growth and possible meningeal infiltration. Regular lifelong follow-up in at-risk patients is recommended and should include the differential diagnosis of dural-based tumors such as angioblastic meningioma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. ","1086":"The authors present a rare case of adult moyamoya disease in which a patient experienced rapid progression of cerebral infarction after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). A healthy 39-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with sudden headache, a decreased level of consciousness and mild tetraparesis. Initial magnetic resonance imaging revealed small cerebral infarction and IVH. Although the patient underwent conservative therapy including hypervolemia, hemodilution, keeping moderate hypertension and administration of a free radical scavenger, she showed a fulminant clinical course of cerebral infarction. The authors discuss the possible pathophysiology and suggest the treatment for such cases. ","1087":"The objective of this study was to investigate changes in the posterior cranial fossa in patients with symptomatic Chiari malformation type I (CMI) compared to a control group. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiological data from 12 symptomatic patients with CMI and 24 healthy control subjects. The structures of the brain and skull base were investigated using magnetic resonance imaging. The length of the clivus had significantly decreased in the CMI group than in the control group (p=0.000). The angle between the clivus and the McRae line (p&lt;0.024), as the angle between the supraocciput and the McRae line (p&lt;0.021), and the angle between the tentorium and a line connecting the internal occipital protuberance to the opisthion (p&lt;0.009) were significantly larger in the CMI group than in the control group. The mean vertical length of the cerebellar hemisphere (p&lt;0.003) and the mean length of the coronal and sagittal superoinferior aspects of the cerebellum (p&lt;0.05) were longer in the CMI group than in the control group, while the mean length of the axial anteroposterior aspect of the cerebellum (p&lt;0.001) was significantly shorter in the CMI group relative to control subjects. We elucidate the transformation of the posterior cranial fossa into the narrow funnel shape. The sufficient cephalocaudal extension of the craniectomy of the posterior cranial fossa has more decompression effect than other type extension of the craniectomy in CMI patients.

In addition, we assessed which psychopathological variable was most influential on neuropsychological performance via statistical clustering of the same characteristics of mild TBI. A total of 219 disability evaluation participants with mild brain injury were selected. All participants were classified into three groups, based on their psychopathological characteristics, via a two-step cluster analysis using validity and clinical scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R). The Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS), Korean Memory Assessment Scale (K-MAS) and the Korean Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) were used to evaluate the neurocognitive functions of mild TBI patients. Over a quarter (26.9%) experienced severe psychopathological symptoms and 43.4% experienced mild or moderate psychopathological symptoms, and all of the mild TBI patients showed a significant relationship between neurocognitive functions and subjective and\/or objective psychopathic symptoms, but the degree of this relationship was moderate. Variances of neurocognitive function were explained by neurotic and psychotic symptoms, but the role of these factors were different to each other and participants did not show intelligence and other cognitive domain decrement except for global memory abilities compared to the non-psychopathology group. Certain patients with mild TBI showed psychopathological symptoms, but these were not directly related to cognitive decrement. Psychopathology and cognitive decrement are discrete aspects in patients with mild TBI. Furthermore, the neurotic symptoms of mild TBI patients made positive complements to decrements or impairments of neurocognitive functions, but the psychotic symptoms had a negative effect on neurocognitive functions. ","1090":"Use of quantitative computed tomography (CT) to evaluate bone mineral density was suggested in the 1970s. Despite its reliability and accuracy, technical shortcomings restricted its usage, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) became the gold standard evaluation method. Advances in CT technology have reduced its previous limitations, and CT evaluation of bone quality may now be applicable in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to determine if the Hounsfield unit (HU) values obtained from CT correlate with patient age and bone mineral density. A total of 128 female patients who underwent lumbar CT for back pain were enrolled in the study. Their mean age was 66.4 years. Among them, 70 patients also underwent DXA. The patients were stratified by decade of life, forming five age groups. Lumbar vertebrae L1-4 were analyzed. The HU value of each vertebra was determined by averaging three measurements of the vertebra's trabecular portion, as shown in consecutive axial CT images. The HU values were compared between age groups, and correlations of HU value with bone mineral density and T-scores were determined. The HU values consistently decreased with increasing age with significant differences between age groups (p&lt;0.001). There were significant positive correlations (p&lt;0.001) of HU value with bone mineral density and T-score. The trabecular area HU value consistently decreases with age. Based on the strong positive correlation between HU value and bone mineral density, CT-based HU values might be useful in detecting bone mineral diseases, such as osteoporosis.

We conducted this study to compare the clinical features and surgical outcomes between the two types of lumbar disc herniations. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of patients who underwent microdiscectomies from 2008 to 2012. We evaluated the clinical characteristics such as age, preoperative autonomic dysfunction, the presence or absence of previous lumbar surgery and fusion required during surgery. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores about back pain and leg pain were evaluated preoperatively and at the final follow-up. Upper lumbar group (n=15) was significantly older than lower lumbar group (n=148). The incidence of autonomic dysfunction was significantly higher in upper lumbar group. The number of patients with a previous lumbar surgery was significantly greater in upper lumbar group. There was no statistical significance for fusion required during surgery between two groups. Both groups showed a significant decrease in the VAS scores of leg pain. VAS scores of back pain were significantly decreased in lower lumbar group. But this was not seen in upper lumbar group. Both groups showed significant improvement of Oswestry Disability Index score. Upper lumbar group had different clinical characteristics from those of lower lumbar group and these include older age, a higher incidence of autonomic dysfunctions and a higher incidence of patients with previous lumbar surgery. There were no significant differences in surgical outcomes, except for back pain, between two groups.

From January 1999 to March 2011, 11 patients with a ventral FM meningioma underwent a conventional posterior approach without further extension of lateral bony window. The tumor was removed through a working space between the dura and arachnoid membrane at the cervicomedullary junction with minimal retraction of medulla, spinal cord or cerebellum. Care should be taken not to violate arachnoid membrane. Preoperatively, six patients were of Nurick grade 1, three were of grade 2, and two were of grade 3. Median follow-up period was 55 months (range, 20-163 months). The extent of resection was Simpson grade I in one case and Simpson grade II in remaining 10 cases. Clinical symptoms improved in eight patients and stable in three patients. There were no recurrences during the follow-up period. Postoperative morbidities included one pseudomeningocele and one transient dysphagia with dysarthria. Ventral FM meningiomas can be removed gross totally using a posterior approach without fat lateral approach. The arachnoid membrane can then be exploited as an anatomical barrier. However, this approach should be taken with a thorough understanding of its anatomical limitation. ","1093":"Lumbar microdiscectomy (MD) is the gold standard for treatment of lumbar disc herniation. Generally, the surgeon attempts to protect the facet joint in hopes of avoiding postoperative pain\/instability and secondary degenerative arthropathy. We believe that preserving the facet joint is especially important in young patients, owing to their life expectancy and activity. However, preserving the facet joint is not easy during lumbar MD. We propose several technical tips (superolateral extension of conventional laminotomy, oblique drilling for laminotomy, and additional foraminotomy) for facet joint preservation during lumbar MD. ","1094":"Split cord malformations (SCMs) usually present in childhood, and are rarely reported in adults. And also, a cervicothoracic SCM associated with tethered cord syndrome has very rarely been reported in the literature. We report a case of SCM associated with tethered cord and spina bifida in an adult. This report describes the case of a 34-year-old woman who presented for evaluation of neck pain, back pain, and intermittent paraparesis of several months duration. The MRI and CT showed a SCM at the cervicothoracic level and a fibrous septum at the thoracic level. She underwent surgery for the SCM and tethered cord syndrome, and was followed for 7 years. Patient presented complete recovery in the follow-up. The authors discuss this unusual lesion and describe the anatomical relationship of the level of cord duplication and fibrous septum. ","1095":"Chronic hypoventilation due to injury to the brain stem respiratory center or high cervical cord (above the C3 level) can result in dependence to prolonged mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy, frequent nosocomial pneumonia, and prolonged hospitalization. Diaphragm pacing through electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve is an established treatment for central hypoventilation syndrome. We performed chronic phrenic nerve stimulation for diaphragm pacing with the spinal cord stimulator for pain control in a quadriplegic patient with central apnea due to complete spinal cord injury at the level of C2 from cervical epidural hematoma. After diaphragmatic pacing, the patient who was completely dependent on the mechanical ventilator could ambulate up to three hours every day without aid of mechanical ventilation during the 12 months of follow-up. Diaphragm pacing through unilateral phrenic nerve stimulation with spinal cord stimulator was feasible in an apneic patient with complete quadriplegia who was completely dependent on mechanical ventilation. Diaphragm pacing with the spinal cord stimulator is feasible and effective for the treatment of the central hypoventilation syndrome. ","1096":"Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst (SEAC) is a rare disease and uncommon cause of compressive myelopathy. The etiology remains still unclear. We experienced 2 cases of SEACs and reviewed the cases and previous literatures. A 59-year-old man complained of both leg radiating pain and paresthesia for 4 years. His MRI showed an extradural cyst from T12 to L3 and we performed cyst fenestration and repaired the dural defect with tailored laminectomy. Another 51-year-old female patient visited our clinical with left buttock pain and paresthesia for 3 years. A large extradural cyst was found at T1-L2 level on MRI and a communication between the cyst and subarachnoid space was illustrated by CT-myelography. We performed cyst fenestration with primary repair of dural defect. Both patients' symptoms gradually subsided and follow up images taken 1-2 months postoperatively showed nearly disappeared cysts. There has been no documented recurrence in these two cases so far. Tailored laminotomy with cyst fenestration can be a safe and effective alternative choice in treating SEACs compared to traditional complete resection of cyst wall with multi-level laminectomy.

A 54-year-old man visited our institute complaining left leg weakness and sensory change for several years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large multilocular cystic mass with canal invasion and bone erosion confined to left S1 body. The lesion showed multiple septal enhancement without definite solid component. Initially the tumor was considered as ABC. The patient underwent grossly-total tumor resection with lumbosacral reconstruction via posterior approach. The tumor was proved to be a cystic schwannoma. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was relieved from preoperative symptoms. We present a rare case of pure cystic giant schwannoma confined to sacrum mimicking ABC. The surgical treatment is challenging due to the complex anatomy of the sacrum. Schwannoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic sacral cysts. ","1098":"We report a very rare case of cervical compressive myelopathy by an anomalous bilateral vertebral artery (VA) entering the spinal canal at the C1 level and compressing the spinal cord. A 70-year-old woman had been suffering from progressive gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that a bilateral VA at the V4 segment had abnormal courses and caused compression to the high cervical cord. VA repositioning was performed by anchoring a suture between the artery and around the arachnoid membrane and dentate ligament, and then, microvascular decompression using a Teflon sponge was done between the VA and the spinal cord. The weakness in the patient improved in the lower extremity after the operation. Anomalous VA could be one of the rare causes of cervical compressive myelopathy. Additionally, an anchoring suture and microvascular decompression around the VA could be a sufficient and safe method to indirectly decompress the spinal canal.

To prepare the bone fusion bed, the transverse process of L3 and L4 was decorticated with a drill. On the 9th post-operative day, the patient complained of a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and distension. Abdominal computed tomography revealed retroperitoneal hematoma in the right psoas muscle and iatrogenic right L3 transverse process fracture. Lumbar spinal angiography showed the delayed hematoma due to rupture of the 2nd lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm and coil embolization was done at the ruptured lumbar artery pseudoaneusyrm. Since then, the patient's postoperative progress proceeded normally with recovery of the hemodynamic parameters. ","1100":"Intracerebral schwannomas are rare and there have been none reported in Korea. We present the case of a 25-year-old man with newly developed right-side weakness and recent seizure aggravation. His seizures started approximately 9 years prior to admission. At that time, a 1 cm diameter intra-axial enhancing mass at the left precentral gyrus was found on magnetic resonance image (MRI). After 9 years of observation and treatment with antiepileptic medication, an MRI taken due to symptom aggravation revealed peri-tumoral cyst formation with tumor enlargement. The tumor was surgically removed. Subsequently, right-side weakness diminished and there was good seizure control. Pathologic diagnosis was schwannoma. Schwannoma is a very rare tumor and there are no pathognomonic findings on radiologic images; thus, it is challenging to make a correct diagnosis. However, considering the natural course and excellent prognosis after surgical treatment of this kind of intra-axial mass with benign features, early surgery for diagnosis and proper treatment is highly recommended. ","1101":"Postoperative subgaleal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is considered as one of the common minor surgical complication which can lead to prolonged hospitalization. We introduce \"galeal tack-up suture\" to prevent postoperative subgaleal CSF collection. Galeal tack-up suture consists of various surgical techniques which aim to fix galea to cranium in order to prevent CSF pooling in subgaleal space. A total of 87 patients who underwent craniotomy were divided into two groups while closing the wound : group A with galeal tack-up suture and group B with routine wound closure without galeal tack-up suture. The patients were observed for postoperative subgaleal CSF collection. Among 87 cranitomy cases, galeal tack-up suture was performed in 32 cases and routine wound closure was done in 55 cases. Postoperative subgaleal CSF collection occurred in 13 cases (15%) in which 12 cases occurred in group B patients and 1 case occurred in group A patients (p=0.026). Galeal tack-up suture is an easy and effective technique in wound closure to prevent postoperative CSF collection. ","1102":"Brain metastases in primary breast cancer patients are considerable sources of morbidity and mortality. Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has gained popularity as an up-front therapy in treating such metastases over traditional radiation therapy due to better neurocognitive function preservation. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic factors for local tumor control and survival in radiosurgery for brain metastases from primary breast cancer. From March 2001 to May 2011, 124 women with metastatic brain lesions originating from a primary breast cancer underwent GKRS at a tertiary medical center in Seoul, Korea. All patients had radiosurgery as a primary treatment or salvage therapy. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical outcomes and radiological responses. The end point of this study was the date of patient's death or the last follow-up examination. In total, 106 patients (268 lesions) were available for follow-up imaging. The median follow-up time was 7.5 months. The mean treated tumor volume at the time of GKRS was 6273 mm(3) (range, 4.5-27745 mm(3)) and the median dose delivered to the tumor margin was 22 Gy (range, 20-25 Gy). Local recurrence was assessed in 86 patients (216 lesions) and found to have occurred in 36 patients (83 lesions, 38.6%) with a median time of 6 months (range, 4-16 months). A treated tumor volume &gt;5000 mm(3) was significantly correlated with poor local tumor control through a multivariate analysis (hazard risk=7.091, p=0.01). Overall survival was 79.9%, 48.3%, and 15.3% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The median overall survival was 11 months after GKRS (range, 6 days-113 months). Multivariate analysis showed that the pre-GKRS Karnofsky performance status, leptomeningeal seeding prior to initial GKRS, and multiple metastatic lesions were significant prognostic factors for reduced overall survival (hazard risk=1.94, p=0.001, hazard risk=7.13, p&lt;0.001, and hazard risk=1.46, p=0.046, respectively). GKRS has shown to be an effective and safe treatment modality for treating brain metastases of primary breast cancer. Most metastatic brain lesions initially respond to GKRS, though, many patients have further CNS progression in subsequent periods. Patients with poor Karnofsky performance status and multiple metastatic lesions are at risk of CNS progression and poor survival, and a more frequent and strict surveillance protocol is suggested in such high-risk groups. ","1103":"The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and perioperative complications associated with lumbar spinal fusion surgery, focusing on geriatric patients in the Republic of Korea. We retrospectively investigated 485 patients with degenerative spinal diseases who had lumbar spinal fusion surgeries between March 2006 and December 2010 at our institution. Age, sex, comorbidity, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, fusion segments, perioperative complications, and outcomes were analyzed in this study. Risk factors for complications and their association with age were analyzed. In this study, 81 patients presented complications (16.7%). The rate of perioperative complications was significantly higher in patients 70 years or older than in other age groups (univariate analysis, p=0.015; multivariate analysis, p=0.024). The perioperative complications were not significantly associated with the other factors tested (sex, comorbidity, ASA class, and fusion segments). Post-operative outcomes of lumbar spinal fusion surgeries for the patients were determined on the basis of MacNab's criteria (average follow up period : 19.7 months), and 412 patients (85.0%) were classified as having \"excellent\" or \"good\" results. Increasing age was an important risk factor for perioperative complications in patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery, whereas other factors were not significant. However, patients' satisfaction or return to daily activities when compared with younger patients did not show much difference. We recommend good clinical judgment as well as careful selection of geriatric patients for lumbar spinal fusion surgery.

We report the outcomes of the endoscopic TSA for recurrent pituitary adenoma after microscopic TSA. From February 2010 to February 2013, endoscopic TSA was performed for removal of 30 recurrent pituitary adenomas after microscopic TSA. Twenty-seven (90%) patients had a clinically non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Twenty-four (80%) patients suffered from a visual disturbance related to tumor growth. The clinical features and surgical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed for the ophthalmological, endocrinological, and oncological aspects. The mean tumor volume was 11.7 cm(3), and gross total resection was achieved in 50% of patients. The volumetric analysis based on the postoperative MR showed that the mean extent of resection rates were 90%. Vision was improved in 19 (79%) of 24 patients with visual symptoms, and endocrinological cure was achieved in all of three functioning pituitary adenomas; however, the post-operative follow-up endocrinological examination revealed a new endocrinological deficit in one patient. Two patients required antibiotics management for post-operative meningitis. The endoscopic TSA can be an effective treatment option for recurrent pituitary adenoma after microscopic TSA with acceptable outcome. ","1105":"Intracranial hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare tumors with aggressive behavior, including local recurrence and distant metastasis. We conducted this retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy of grossly total resection and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for these tumors. A total of 13 patients treated for intracranial HPC from January 1995 through May 2013 were included in this retrospective study. We analyzed the clinical presentations, radiologic appearances, treatment results, and follow-up outcomes, as well as reviewed other studies. The ages of the patients at the time of diagnosis ranged from 26 to 73 years (mean : 48 years). The majority of the patients were male (92.3%), and the majority of the tumors were located in the parasagittal and falx. The ratio of intracranial HPCs to meningiomas was 13 : 598 in same period, or 2.2%. Seven patients (53.8%) had anaplastic HPCs. Nine patients (69.2%) underwent gross total tumor resection in the first operation without mortality. Eleven patients (84.6%) underwent postoperative adjuvant RT. Follow-up period ranged from 13 to 185 months (mean : 54.3 months). The local recurrence rate was 46.2% (6\/13), and there were no distant metastases. The 10-year survival rate after initial surgery was 83.9%. The initial mean Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) was 70.8 and the final mean KPS was 64.6. Gross total tumor resection upon initial surgery is very important. We believe that adjuvant RT is helpful even with maximal tumor resection. Molecular biologic analyses and chemotherapy studies are required to achieve better outcomes in recurrent intracranial HPCs.

But their side effects and invasiveness make discomfort to patients. We evaluated the ivy sign on MR fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in adult patients with moyamoya disease and compared it with result of SPECT and MR perfusion images. We enrolled twelve patients (thirteen cases) who were diagnosed with moyamoya disease and underwent STA-MCA anastomosis at our medical institution during a period ranging from September of 2010 to December of 2012. The presence of the ivy sign on MR FLAIR images was classified as Negative (0), Minimal (1), and Positive (2). Regions were classified into four territories: the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the anterior MCA, the posterior MCA and the posterior cerebral artery. Ivy signs on preoperative and postoperative MR FLAIR were improved (8 and 4 in the ACA regions, 13 and 4 in the anterior MCA regions and 19 and 9 in the posterior MCA regions). Like this result, the cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) on SPECT was significantly increased in the sum of CVR in same regions after STA-MCA anastomosis. After STA-MCA anastomosis, ivy signs were decreased in the cerebral hemisphere. As compared with conventional diagnostic modalities such as SPECT and MR perfusion images, the ivy sign on MR FLAIR is considered as a useful indicator in detecting brain hemodynamic changes between preoperatively and postoperatively in adult moyamoya patients.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the possible relationship between CRP levels in the serum and transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the development of vasospasm in patients with aSAH. A total of 61 adult patients in whom aSAH was diagnosed were included in the study from November 2008 to May 2011. The patients' demographics, Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, CT scans, digital subtraction angiography studies, and daily neurological examinations were recorded. Serial serum CRP measurements were obtained on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 and TCD was measured on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. All patients underwent either surgical or endovascular treatment within 24 hours of their hemorrhagic attacks. Serum CRP levels peaked on the 3rd postoperative day. There were significant differences between the vasospasm group and the non-vasospasm group on the 1st, 3rd and 5th day. There were significant differences between the vasospasm group and the non-vasospasm group on the 3rd day in the mean middle cerebral artery velocities on TCD. Patients with high levels of CRP on the 1st postoperative day and high velocity of mean TCD on the 3rd postoperative day may require closer observation to monitor for the development of vasospasm. ","1109":"Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) has the ability to measure quantitative value and produce maps of mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV). We assessed cerebral hemodynamics by using these parameters and acetazolamide (ACZ) challenge for pre- and post-procedural evaluation in patients with unilateral cerebrovascular stenotic disease. Thirty patients underwent pre-procedural PCT with ACZ challenge, and 24 patients (80%) was conducted follow up PCT after angioplasty with same protocol. The mean MTT, CBF, and CBV were measured and compared in both middle cerebral arterial (MCA) territories before and after ACZ challenge. Hemispheric ratio and percent change after ACZ challenge were calculated before and after angioplasty. The mean stenosis rate was 76.6%. Significant increases in MTT (32.6%, p=0.000) and significant decreases in CBF (-14.2%, p=0.000) were found in stenotic side MCA territories. After ACZ challenge, there were significant changes in MTT (37.4%, p=0.000), CBF (-13.1%, p=0.000), and CBV (-10.5%, p=0.001) in pre-procedural perfusion study. However, no significant increases were found in MTT, or decreases in CBF and CBV in post-procedural study. There were no significant changes after ACZ challenge also. In addition, the degrees of these changes (before and after ACZ challenge) were highly correlated with the stenotic degrees in pre-procedural perfusion study. PCT with ACZ challenge appears to be a useful tool to assess the cerebral perfusion status especially in patients with unilateral symptomatic stenotic disease. ","1110":"This study was designed to determine the most reliable cephalometric measurement technique in the normal population and patients with basilar invagination (BI). Twenty-two lateral radiographs of BI patients and 25 lateral cervical radiographs of the age, sex-matched normal population were selected and measured on two separate occasions by three spine surgeons using six different measurements. Statistical analysis including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was carried out using the SPSS software (V. 12.0). Redlund-Johnell and Modified (M)-Ranawat had a highest ICC score in both the normal and BI groups in the inter-observer study. The M-Ranawat method (0.83) had a highest ICC score in the normal group, and the Redlund-Johenll method (0.80) had a highest ICC score in the BI group in the intra-observer test. The McGregor line had a lowest ICC score and a poor ICC grade in both groups in the intra-observer study. Generally, the measurement method using the odontoid process did not produce consistent results due to inter and intra-observer differences in determining the position of the odontoid tip. Opisthion and caudal point of the occipital midline curve are somewhat ambiguous landmarks, which induce variable ICC scores. On the contrary to other studies, Ranawat method had a lower ICC score in the inter-observer study. C2 end-plate and C1 arch can be the most reliable anatomical landmarks. ","1111":"Occipital neuralgia is a rare pain syndrome characterized by periodic lancinating pain involving the occipital nerve complex. We present a unique case of entrapment of the greater occipital nerve (GON) within the semispinalis capitis, which was thought to be the cause of occipital neuralgia. A 66-year-old woman with refractory left occipital neuralgia revealed an abnormally low-loop of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery on the magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting possible vascular compression of the upper cervical roots. During exploration, however, the GON was found to be entrapped at the perforation site of the semispinalis capitis. There was no other compression of the GON or of C1 and C2 dorsal roots in their intracranial course. Postoperatively, the patient experienced almost complete relief of typical neuralgic pain. Although occipital neuralgia has been reported to occur by stretching of the GON by inferior oblique muscle or C1-C2 arthrosis, peripheral compression in the transmuscular course of the GON in the semispinalis capitis as a cause of refractory occipital neuralgia has not been reported and this should be considered when assessing surgical options for refractory occipital neuralgia. ","1112":"We report a case of bilateral chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in a 75-year-old man after exercise using a vibrating belt machine on the head. He suffered from headache and intermittent left side numbness for ten days. He denied any head injuries except eccentric exercise using a vibrating belt on his own head for 20 days. An MRI revealed bilateral CSDH. The hematoma was isodense on the CT scan. We made burr-holes on the both sides under local anesthesia. We identified the neomembrane and dark red subdural fluid on both sides. In the postoperative CT scan, we found an arachnoid cyst on the left temporal pole. Although the arachnoid cyst itself is asymptomatic, trivial injury such as vibrating the head may cause a CSDH. ","1113":"We report a long-term survival case of a primary malignant intracerebral nerve sheath tumor (MINST) occurring in the right frontal lobe of a 13-year old boy. After the gross total resection (GTR), we have performed radiation therapy but it recurred 50 months after the surgery, so the second GTR was performed. Later, second tumor recurrence was found 4 months after the second surgery. Subsequently the third GTR, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were carried out. At present, the patient has been remaining alive for 77 months without evidence of tumor recurrence. According to the previous reports, the primary MINST is very rare : there are only 8 cases reported. It is also a fast-growing, invasive tumor with poor outcome. This is the first case that had no recurrence for 50 months after the surgery among the reported cases that had been followed up for more than 5 years. It is supposed that a period of recurrence free survival after GTR and low mitotic activity are associated with the patient's prognosis. A GTR followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy will be recommended to patients of MINST. ","1114":"A 61-year-old woman with a very rare case of totally ossified large thoracic spinal metaplastic meningioma, showing progressing myelopathy is presented. Computed tomographic images showed a large totally ossfied intradural round mass occupying the spinal canal on T9-10 level. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large T9-10 intradural extramedullary mass that was hypointense to spinal cord on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, partial enhancement was apparent after Gadolinium administration. The spinal cord was severely compressed and displaced toward the right at the level of T9-10. Surgical removal of the tumor was successfully accomplished via the posterior midline approach and the histological diagnosis verified an ossified metaplastic meningioma. The clinical neurological symptoms of patient were improved postoperatively. In this article we discuss the surgical and pathological aspects of rare case of spinal totally ossified metaplastic meningioma. ","1115":"Spinal intradural hemangiopericytoma is a very rare tumor and can be characterized by massive bleeding during surgeries, frequent recurrence, and metastasis. However, definite radiologic differential points of hemangiopericytoma are not known. We describe an unexpected hemangiopericytoma case with large bleeding and management of the tumor. A 21-year-old man visited complaining of progressive neck pain and tingling sensation in both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging of his spine revealed C1-2 ventral intradural mass. When the dura was opened, the intradural tumor was placed behind spinal accessary nerves. The tumor was partially exposed only after some accessary nerves had been cut. When internal debulking was performing, unexpected bleeding was noted and it was difficult to control because of narrow surgical field and hypervascularity. Intraoperative spinal angiography and embolization were performed. The tumor was completely removed after embolization. Pathological diagnosis was consistent with hemangiopericytoma. When surgeons meet a flesh-red tumor that bleeds unexpectedly during surgery, hemangiopericytoma may be considered. When feeder control is hard due to reciprocal location of spinal cord, the tumor, and feeders, intraoperative angiography and embolization may be a possible option.

Although Many Cases Of Primary Sft Have Been Reported, There Are Extremely Rare Repots To Date Of A Malignant Sft In The Spine Or Skull. A 54-year-woman Visited Our Hospital Due To Low Back Pain And Both Leg Radiating Pain. Several Imaging Studies Including Magnetic Resonance Imaging And Computed Tomography Revealed Expansive Enhanced Lesions In The Occipital Bone, T8, S1-2, And Ilium, With Neural Tissue Compression. We Performed Surgical Resection Of The Tumor In Each Site, And Postoperative Radiosurgery And Chemotherapy Were Performed. However, After Six Months, Tumors Were Recurred And Metastasized In Multiple Regions Including Whole Spine And Lung. The Authors Report Here The First Case Of Patient With Malignant Sft Of Tandem Lesions In The Various Bony Structures, Including Skull, Thoracic Spine, And Sacral Spine, With A Rapid Recurrence And Metastasis.

Occasionally there have been reports of bilateral cerebellar infarction due to vertebrobasilar atherosclerotic occlusion or stenosis, whereas no report of bilateral cerebellar infarction due to complicated hemodynamic changes. In this report, we present a patient with bilateral cerebral infarctions related to stenoses of bilateral internal carotid arteries, in whom vertebrobasilar system was supplied by multiple collaterals from both posterior communicating arteries and right external carotid artery. We performed stent-angioplasty of bilateral internal cerebral arterial stenosis, and then acute infarction developed on bilateral superior cerebellar artery territories. The authors assumed that the infarction occurred due to hemodynamic change between internal carotid artery and external carotid artery after stent-angioplasty for stenosis of right internal carotid artery.

However, motor deficit also impedes functional status of hand. Contrary to evaluation of sensory function, the objective, quantitative evaluation of median nerve motor function is not easy. The motor function of median was evaluated quantitatively using load cell and its correlation with findings of electrodiagnostic study (EDS) was evaluated. Objective motor function of median nerve was evaluated by load cell and personal computer-based measurement system. All of the measurement was done in patients diagnosed as having idiopathic CTS by clinical features and EDS findings. The strength of thumb abduction and index finger flexion was measured in each hand three times, and the average value was used to calculate thumb index ratio (TIR). The correlation of TIR with clinical, EDS, and ultrasonographic findings were evaluated. The TIR was evaluated in 67 patients (119 hands). There were 14 males and 53 females, mean age were 57.6 years (range 28 to 81). The higher preoperative nerve conductive studies grade of the patients, the lower TIR was observed [p&lt;0.001, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. TIR of cases with thenar atrophy were significantly lower than those without (p&lt;0.001, t-test). TIR were significantly lower in patients with severe median nerve swelling in ultrasonography (p=0.042, ANOVA). Measurements of median nerve motor function using load cell is a valuable evaluation tool in CTS. It might be helpful in detecting subclinical motor dysfunction before muscle atrophy develops.

We retrospectively reviewed a total of 254 patients with spinal cord injury. Of them, we selected 21 spinal cord injury patients who required tracheostomy due to long-term mechanical ventilation and analyzed their medical records. The patients were categorized into two groups. Early tracheostomy was performed day 1-10 from intubation in 10 patients and the late tracheostomy was performed after day 10 in 11 cases. We also evaluated the duration of mechanical ventilation, stay in the ICU and complications related to tracheostomy, the injury level of and clinical severity. All data was analyzed using SPSS 18.0\/WIN. The early tracheostomy offered clear advantages for shortening the total ICU stay (20.8 day vs. 38.0 day, p=0.010). There was also statistically significant reduction in the total length of time on mechanical ventilation (5.2 day vs. 29.2 day, p=0.009). However, the reductions in the incidence of pneumonia (40% vs. 82%) and the length of ICU stay post to tracheostomy (6 day vs. 15 day) were found to be statistically not significant. There were also no statistically significant differences in the injury level and clinical severity between the groups. We concluded that the early tracheostomy (at least 10 days) is beneficial for SCI patients who are likely to require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Retrospective analysis was performed using sequential computed tomography (CT) images maintained in a prospective observational database containing 177 ASDH cases treated from 2005 to 2011. Patients were allocated to four groups as followings; 136 (76.8%) patients to the spontaneous resolution group, 12 (6.8%) who underwent operation between 4 hours and 7 days to the rapid worsening group (RWG), 24 (13.6%) who experienced an increase of hematoma and that underwent operation between 7 and 28 days to the subacute worsening group (SWG), and 5 (2.8%) who developed delayed aggravation requiring surgery from one month after onset to the delayed worsening group (DWG). Groups were compared with respect to various factors. No significant intergroup difference was found with respect to age, mechanism of injury, or initial Glasgow Coma Scale. The presence of combined cerebral contusion or subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to be a significant prognostic factor. Regarding CT findings, mixed density was common in the RWG and the SWG. Midline shifting, hematoma thickness, and numbers of CT slices containing hematoma were significant prognostic factors of the RWG and the SWG. Brain atrophy was more severe in the SWG and the DWG. A large proportion of initially non-operated ASDHs worsen in the acute or subacute phase. Patients with risk factors should be monitored carefully for progression by repeat CT imaging.

From 2009 to 2012, a total of 198 young adult male patients with spondylolysis were identified. Eighty age-matched patients without spondylolysis were also selected. Standing lateral films that included both hip joints were obtained for each subject. Pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral inclination, lumbosacral angle, and sacral table angle were measured in both groups. A comparative study of the spinopelvic parameters of these two groups was performed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Among the aforementioned spinopelvic parameters, PI, SS and STA were significantly different between patients with spondylolysis and those without spondylolysis. PI and SS were higher in the spondylolysis group than in the control group, but STA was lower in the spondylolysis group than in the control group. PI and SS were higher in the spondylolysis group than in the control group, but STA was lower in the spondylolysis group than in the control group. Patients with spondylolysis have low STA at birth, which remains constant during growth; a low STA translates into high SS. As a result, PI is also increased in accordance with SS. Therefore, we suggest that STA is an important etiologic factor in young adult patients with L5 spondylolysis.

Among 452 patients who underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion between June 2009 and January 2013, patients with postoperative SIJ pain, being responded to SIJ block were enrolled. For a control group, patients matched for sex, age group, the number of fused level and fusion to sacrum were randomly selected. Patients were assessed radiologic parameters including lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT) and sacral slope (SS). To evaluate the sagittal sacropelvic morphology and balance, the ratio of PT\/PI, SS\/PI and PT\/SS were analyzed. A total of 28 patients with SIJ pain and 56 patients without SIJ pain were assessed. Postoperatively, SIJ pain group showed significantly greater PT (p=0.02) than non-SIJ pain group. Postoperatively, PT\/PI and SS\/PI in SIJ pain group was significantly greater and smaller than those in non-SIJ pain group respectively (p=0.03, 0.02, respectively) except for PT\/SS (p=0.05).

We followed up 1, 3, 6 months and 12 month and monitored a Visual Analogue rating Scale (VAS) of back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and degree of motor weakness. We analyzed the differences between surgical and nonsurgical groups using Mann-Whitney U test and repeat measure ANOVA in each follow-up periods. In the recovery of motor weakness, surgical treatment uncovered a rapid functional recovery in the early periods (p=0.003) and no difference between groups at the end of follow-up period was found (p&gt;0.05). In VAS of back and leg, the interaction between time and group was not found (p&gt;0.05) and there was no difference between groups (p&gt;0.05). In ODI, the interaction between time and group was not found (p&gt;0.05) and there was no difference between groups (p&gt;0.05). Surgical treatment for motor weakness caused by herniated intervertebral disc resulted in a rapid recovery in the short-term period, especially 1 month.

The authors treated cystic brain tumor patients with Holmium-166-chitosan complex (Ho-166-chico), composed of a beta-emitting radionuclide Holmium-166 and biodegradable chit polymer, and evaluated the safety and effective measurement for response. Twenty-two patients with recurrent cystic brain tumor and\/or located in a deep or eloquent area were enrolled in this pilot study. The cyst volume and wall thickness were determined on CT or MRI to assess radiological response. The activity of Ho-166-chico injected via Ommaya reservoir was prescribed to be 10-25 Gy to the cyst wall in a depth of 4 mm. There was neither complications related to systemic absorption nor leakage of Ho-166-chico in all 22 patients. But, two cases of oculomotor paresis were observed in patients with recurrent craniopharyngioma. Radiological response was seen in 14 of 20 available follow-up images (70%). Seven patients of 'evident' radiological response experienced more than 25% decrease of both cyst volume and wall thickness. Another 7 patients with 'suggestive' response showed decrease of cyst volume without definitive change of the wall thickness or vice versa. All patients with benign tumors or low grade gliomas experienced symptomatic improvement. Ho-166-chico intracavitary radiation therapy for cystic tumor is a safe method of palliation without serious complications. The determination of both minimal effective dosage and time interval of repeated injection through phase 1 trial could improve the results in the future.

The medical records of 1943 S-ICH patients from January 2000 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed with focus on demographic, radiological, and laboratory characteristics. A total of 1558 supratentorial S-ICH patients were included in the present study and 102 (6.5%) were ESRD patients. The 30-day mortality of the S-ICH patients with ESRD was 53.9%, and 29.4% achieved good functional recovery at 6 months post-S-ICH. Multivariate analysis showed that age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupillary abnormality, ventricular extension of hemorrhage, hemorrhagic volume, hematoma enlargement, anemia, and treatment modality were independently associated with 30-day mortality in S-ICH patients with ESRD (p&lt;0.05), and that GCS score, volume of hemorrhage, conservative treatment, and shorter hemodialysis duration was independently associated with good functional recovery at 6 months post-S-ICH in patients with ESRD (p&lt;0.05). This retrospective study showed worse outcome after S-ICH in patients with ESRD than those without ESRD; 30-day mortality was four times higher and the functional recovery rate was significantly lower in S-ICH patients with ESRD than in S-ICH patients without ESRD.

This study evaluates the role of strict blood pressure (BP) control for the prevention of CHS. All 18 patients who received CEA from February 2009 through November 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were routinely managed in an intensive care unit by a same protocol. The cerebral perfusion state was evaluated on the basis of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) study by perfusion computed tomography (pCT) and mean velocity by transcranial doppler (TCD). BP was strictly controlled (&lt;140\/90 mm Hg) for 7 days. When either post-CEA hyperperfusion (&gt;100% increase in the rCBF by pCT or in the mean velocity by TCD compared with preoperative values) or CHS was detected, BP was maintained below 120\/80 mm Hg. TCD and pCT data on the patients were analyzed. Ipsilateral rCBF was significantly increased after CEA in the pCT (p=0.049). Post-CEA hyperperfusion was observed in 3 patients (18.7%) in the pCT and 2 patients (12.5%) in the TCD study. No patients developed clinical CHS for one month after CEA. Furthermore, no patients developed additional neurological deficits related to postoperative cerebrovascular complications. Intensive care with strict BP control (&lt;140\/90 mm Hg) achieved a low prevalence of post-CEA hyperperfusion and prevented CHS. This study suggests that intensive care with strict BP control can prevent the prevalence of post-CEA CHS.

A 51-year-old man underwent TLIF at L4-5 with posterior instrumentation for the treatment of grade 1 isthmic spondylolisthesis with LSTV. At 7 weeks postoperatively, imaging studies demonstrated that banana-shaped cage migrated anteriorly and anterolisthesis recurred at the index level with pseudoarthrosis. The cage was removed and exchanged by new cage through anterior approach, and screws were replaced with larger size ones and cement augmentation was added. At postoperative 2 days of revision surgery, computed tomography (CT) showed fracture on lateral pedicle and body wall of L5 vertebra. He underwent surgery again for paraspinal decompression at L4-5 and extension of instrumentation to S1 vertebra. His back and leg pains improved significantly after final revision surgery and symptom relief was maintained during follow-up period. At 6 months follow-up, CT images showed solid fusion at L4-5 level. Careful cage selection for TLIF must be done for treatment of spondylolisthesis accompanied with deformed LSTV, especially when reduction will be attempted. Banana-shaped cage should be positioned anteriorly, but anterior dislodgement of cage and reduction failure may occur in case of a highly unstable spine.

She was treated conservatively, but underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation 3 months after the initial attack due to deteriorated mental status and chronic hydrocephalus. Three months later, her mental status deteriorated further. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium demonstrated an irregular enhanced mass in which the previous hemorrhage occurred. The final histological diagnosis which made by stereotactic biopsy was an anaplastic astrocytoma. In the present case, the diagnosis of a high grade glioma was delayed due to tumor bleeding mimicking hypertensive ICH.

Fifty-two PD patients who underwent STN DBS were followed-up for more than 3 years. The Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and other clinical profiles were assessed preoperatively and during follow-up. A linear regression model was used to analyze whether factors predict the results of STN DBS. We divided the study individuals into subgroups according to several factors and compared subgroups. Preoperative activity of daily living (ADL) and the magnitude of preoperative levodopa response were shown to predict the improvement in UPDRS part II without medication, and preoperative ADL and levodopa equivalent dose (LED) were shown to predict the improvement in UPDRS part II with medication. In UPDRS part III with medication, the magnitude of preoperative levodopa response was a predicting factor. The intensity of preoperative levodopa response was a strong factor for motor outcome. And preoperative ADL and LED were strong factors for ADL improvement. More vigorous studies should be conducted to elucidate how levodopa-induced motor complications are ameliorated after STN DBS.

Between April 2004 and May 2011, a total of 23 patients underwent GKR for 67 metastatic brain tumors from 12 renal cell cancers, 5 sarcomas and 6 melanomas. The mean age was 56 years (range, 18 to 79 years). Most of the patients were classified as the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class II (91.3%). The synchronous metastasis was found in 6 patients (26.1%) and metachronous metastasis in 17 patients (73.9%). We analyzed the local control rate, intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The mean tumor volume for GKR was 2.24 cc and the mean prescription dose was 19.4 Gy (range, 10 to 24) to the tumor margin. Out of metachronous metastases, the median duration to intracranial metastasis was 3.3 years in renal cell cancer (RCC), 2.4 years in melanoma and 1.1 years in sarcoma (p=0.012). The total local control rate was 89.6% during the mean 12.4 months follow-up. The six-month and one-year local control rate was 90.2% and 83% respectively. Depending on the pathology, the control rate of RCC was 95.7%, sarcoma 91.3% and melanoma 80.5% during the follow-up. The common cause of local failure was the tumor bleeding in melanoma. The median PFS and OS were 5.2 and 8.4 months in RCC patients, 6.5 and 9.8 months in sarcoma, and 3.8 and 5.1 months in melanoma. The GKR can be one of the effective management options for the intracranial metastatic tumors from the radioresistant tumors. The melanoma showed a poor local control rate compared to other pathologies because of the hemorrhage. ","1145":"To investigate the cases of intracranial abnormal brain MRI findings even in the negative brain CT scan after mild head injury. During a 2-year period (January 2009-December 2010), we prospectively evaluated both brain CT and brain MRI of 180 patients with mild head injury. Patients were classified into two groups according to presence or absence of abnormal brain MRI finding even in the negative brain CT scan after mild head injury. Two neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist validated the images from both brain CT scan and brain MRI double blindly. Intracranial injury with negative brain CT scan after mild head injury occurred in 18 patients (10.0%). Headache (51.7%) without neurologic signs was the most common symptom. Locations of intracranial lesions showing abnormal brain MRI were as follows; temporal base (n=8), frontal pole (n=5), falx cerebri (n=2), basal ganglia (n=1), tentorium (n=1), and sylvian fissure (n=1). Intracranial injury was common in patients with a loss of consciousness, symptom duration &gt;2 weeks, or in cases of patients with linear skull fracture (p=0.00013), and also more frequent in multiple associated injury than simple one (35.7%&gt;8.6%) (p=0.105). Our investigation showed that patients with mild head injury even in the negative brain CT scan had a few cases of intracranial injury. These findings indicate that even though the brain CT does not show abnormal findings, they should be thoroughly watched in further study including brain MRI in cases of multiple injuries and when their complaints are sustained. ","1146":"Neurologic complications during carotid artery stenting (CAS) are usually associated with distal embolic event. These embolic incident during CAS are highly associated with the carotid plaque instability. The current study was undertaken to identify the angiographic characteristics of carotid plaque vulnerability, which was represented as filling defect in the cerebral protection filters during CAS. A total of 107 patients underwent CAS with use of a distal protection filter. Angiographic carotid plaque surface morphology was classified as smooth, irregular, and ulcerated. To determine predictable factors of filling defect in the protection filters, 11 variables were retrospectively analyzed which might influence filling defect in the protection filters during CAS. Filling defects during CAS were presented in the 33 cerebral protection filters. In multivariate analysis, angiographic ulceration [odds ratio (OR), 6.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) : 2.24, 19.4; p=0.001], higher stenosis degree (OR, 1.06; 95% CI : 1.00, 1.12; p=0.039), and coexistent thrombus (OR, 7.58; 95% CI : 1.69, 34.05; p=0.08) were highly associated with filling defect in the cerebral protection devices during CAS. Among several variables, angiographic surface ulceration was the only significant factor associated with flow stagnation during CAS (OR, 4.11; 95% CI : 1.33, 12.72; p=0.014). Plaque surface morphology on carotid angiography can be a highly sensitive marker of plaque instability during CAS. The independent risk factors for filling defect in the filter devices during CAS were plaque ulceration, stenosis degree, and coexistent thrombus. ","1147":"Surgical results for anterior choroidal artery (AChA) aneurysms have previously been reported as unsatisfactory due to inadvertent occlusion of the AChA, while the low incidence of AChA aneurysms hampers the accumulation of surgical experience. The authors reviewed their related surgical experience to document the ischemic complications and surgical outcomes. Identification of the AChA at its origin by rigorous visual scrutiny, careful microdissection, and meticulous clip placement to avoid the AChA origin are all crucial surgical maneuvers. A retrospective review of a surgical series of 62 consecutive cases of an AChA aneurysm between 2004 and 2012 was performed. All patients, except for five (8.1%) with a small residual neck, showed complete aneurysm obliteration in postoperative angiographic evaluations. There was no incidence of procedure-related permanent AChA syndrome or oculomotor nerve palsy, while three (4.8%) patients suffered from transient AChA syndrome. The clinical outcomes [the 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS)] of the patients were related to their preoperative World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons (WFNS) grade. As regards the 3-month mRS, significant differences were found between patients with an unruptured aneurysm (WFNS grade 0; n=20), good-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (WFNS grade 1-3; n=30), and poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (WFNS grade 4-5; n=4). In surgical treatment of AChA aneurysms, a risk of AChA insufficiency can be minimized by taking every precaution to preserve the AChA patency and intraoperative monitoring. In addition, the surgical outcome is primarily determined by the preoperative clinical state. ","1148":"Transfemoral catheter angiography (TFCA) is a basic procedure in neurovascular surgery with increasing importance in surgical and non-invasive treatments. Unfortunately, resident neurosurgeons have relatively few opportunities to perform TFCA in most institutions. We report a method developed in our hospital for training resident neurosurgeons to perform TFCA and evaluate the efficacy of this training. From May 2011 to September 2011, a total of 112 consecutive patients underwent TFCA by one resident neurosurgeon supervised by two neuroendovascular specialists. Patients who underwent elective diagnostic procedures were included in this study. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment were excluded. Demographic data, indications for TFCA, side of approach, number of selected arteries, and complications were analyzed. This study included 64 males and 48 females with a mean age of 51.6 (12-81) years. All procedures were performed in the angiography suite. Common indications for procedures were as follows: stroke-induced symptoms in 61 patients (54.5%), Moyamoya disease and arteriovenous malformation in 13 patients (11.6%), and unruptured intracranial aneurysm in eight patients (7.1%). Right and left femoral puncture was performed in 98.2% and 1.8% of patients, respectively. A total of 465 selective angiographies were performed without complications. Angiographic examination was performed on 4.15 vessels per patient. TFCA can be performed safely by resident neurosurgeons based on anatomical study and a meticulous protocol under the careful supervision of neuroendovascular specialists.

The aim of this study was to report our experience with endovascular treatment of A1 Aneurysms. From August 2007 through May 2012, eleven A1 aneurysms in eleven patients were treated endovascularly. Six aneurysms were unruptured and 5 were ruptured. One patient with an unruptured A1 aneurysm presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Procedural data, clinical and angiographic results were reviewed retrospectively. All of the aneurysms were successfully treated with coil embolization. Six were treated with a simple technique while the remaining 5 required adjunctive technique : double catheters (n=2), balloon-assisted (n=2), and stent-assisted (n=1). The immediate angiographic control showed a complete occlusion in all cases. Procedure-related complication occurred in only one patient : parent artery occlusion, which was not clinically significant. All patients had excellent clinical outcomes but one patient was discharged with a slight disability. No neurologic deterioration or bleeding was seen during the follow-up period in this cohort of patients. Follow-up angiography (mean, 20 months) was available in ten patients and revealed stable occlusion in all cases. Endovascular treatment is a feasible and effective therapeutic modality for A1 aneurysms. Tailored microcatheter shaping and\/or adjunctive techniques are necessary for successful aneurysm embolization because of the projection and location of A1 aneurysms.

Intracranial chronic SDH was evacuated through two burr holes. Back pain and radiating leg pain derived from the spinal SDH diminished about 2 weeks after admission and spinal SDH was completely resolved on MRI obtained 3 months after onset.

Additionally, we performed spine series MRI, bone scan and positive emission tomography for confirmation of other bone lesions. These studies showed no other pathological lesions. He underwent anterior cervical corpectomy of the seventh cervical vertebra and plate fixation with iliac bone graft. After surgical management, neurological symptoms were much improved.

However, iron deficiency anemia is not a common cause for CVT in adult. Posterior fossa infarction following CVT is not well demonstrated because posterior fossa has abundant collateral vessels. Here, we report a case of a 55-year-old man who was admitted with complaints of headache, nausea, and mild dizziness. The patient was diagnosed with isolated lateral sinus thrombosis presenting as cerebellar infarction. Laboratory findings revealed normocytic normochromic anemia due to iron deficiency, and the patient's symptoms were improved after iron supplementation. ","1157":"Despite several limitations, the Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) is normally used to evaluate trauma systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventable trauma death rate using the TRISS method in severe trauma patients with traumatic brain injury using our emergency department data. The use of the TRISS formula has been suggested to consider definitively preventable death (DP); the deaths occurred with a probability of survival (Ps) higher than 0.50 and possible preventable death (PP); the deaths occurred with a Ps between 0.50 and 0.25. Deaths in patients with a calculated Ps of less than 0.25 is considered as no-preventable death (NP). A retrospective case review of deaths attributed to mechanical trauma occurring between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 was conducted. A total of 565 consecutive severe trauma patients with ISS&gt;15 or Revised Trauma Score&lt;7 were admitted in our institute. We excluded a total of 24 patients from our analysis : 22 patients younger than 15 years, and 2 patients with burned injury. Of these, 221 patients with head injury were analyzed in the final study. One hundred eighty-two patients were in DP, 13 in PP and 24 in NP. The calculated predicted mortality rates were 11.13%, 59.04%, and 90.09%. The actual mortality rates were 12.64%, 61.547%, and 91.67%, respectively.

Also, TRISS is relatively exact and acceptable compared with actual data, as a simple and time-saving method. ","1158":"Density of the chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is variable. It often appears to be mixed density. Multiple densities of cSDH may result from multiple episodes of trauma. We investigated the frequency of mixed density and the causes of head injuries representing each density. We could collect 242 cases of chronic SDH. The cSDHs were classified into four groups; hypodensity, homogeneous isodensity, layered type, and mixed type on the basis of CT scans. The density of cSDH was isodense in 115 patients, hypodense in 31 patients, mixed in 79 cases, and layered in 17 cases. The cSDH was on the left side in 115 patients, on the right side in 70 patients, and bilateral in 40 patients. The history of trauma was identifiable in 122 patients. The etiology could be identified in 67.7% of the hypodense hematomas, while it was obscure in 59.5% of the mixed hematomas. Mixed density of cSDH results from multiple episodes of trauma, usually in the aged. It is hard to remember all the trivial traumas for the patients with the mixed density cSDHs.

Nineteen patients with symptomatic L5-S1 stenosis were checked by Proset-MRI. Four patients were performed decompressive surgery and 15 patients were performed selective nerve root block (SNRB) at L5. The pain scale of patients was checked by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores at the pre- and post-treatment state. Proset-MRI findings of patients with symptomatic stenosis are root swelling (RS) and indentation. The comparisons with VAS scores had a meaningful statistical result at each RS (p&lt;0.01) and indentation (p&lt;0.01).

Authors studied where this transition point (TP) is located between the posterior lamina and the C1 pedicle and how it can be recognized. The 3D computed images of 86 cadaver C1s (M : F=45 : 41) were used in this study. The superior ridge of the C1 posterior arch had 2 types of orientation. One was in the vertical direction in the C1 posterior lamina and the other was in the horizontal direction in the C1 pedicle. The TP was located at the border between the 2 areas, the same site as the posterior end of the groove of the vertebral artery. On posterior-anterior projection, the posterior arch was sharpened abruptly at TP. We were unable to identify the TP in 6.4% of specimens due to complete or partial osseous bridges. A total of 93.8% of the TP were located between the most enlarged point of the spinal canal and the medial wall of the vertebral artery.

Eleven formalin-fixed Korean adult cadaveric heads were used and frontotemporal craniotomies were done bilaterally. The length of C6 segment of the internal carotid artery on its lateral and medial side and optic nerve length were checked before and after anterior clinoidectomy. The basal width and height of the ACP were measured. The relationships among the paraclinoidal structures were assessed. The origin and projection of the ophthalmic artery (OA) were investigated. The mean values of intradural basal width and height of the ACP were 10.82 mm and 7.61 mm respectively. The mean length of the C6 lateral and medial side increased 49%. The mean length of optic nerve increased 97%. At the parasellar area, the lengths from the optic strut to the falciform liament, distal dural ring, origin of OA were 6.69 mm, 9.36 mm and 5.99 mm, respectively. The distance between CN III and IV was 11.06 mm. With the removal of ACP, exposure of the C6 segments and optic nerve can expand 49% and 97%, respectively.

In group 2 (SCI-VPA), the animals received a dose of 200 mg\/kg of VPA. In group 3 (SCI-saline), animals received 1.0 mL of the saline vehicle solution. A modified aneurysm clip with a closing force of 30 grams was applied extradurally around the spinal cord at T9, and then rapidly released with cord compression persisting for 2 minutes. The rats were sacrificed and the spinal cord were collected one week after SCI. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting sample were obtained from 5 mm rostral region to the lesion and prepared. We analyzed the nestin immunoreactivity from the white matter of ventral cord and the ependyma of central canal. Nestin and SOX2 were used for markers for NSPCs and analyzed by IHC and western blotting, respectively. Nestin and SOX2 were expressed significantly in the SCI groups but not in the sham group. Comparing SCI groups, nestin and SOX2 expression were much stronger in SCI-VPA group than in SCI-saline group. Nestin and SOX2 as markers for NSPCs showed increased expression in SCI-VPA group in comparison with SCI-saline group. This result suggests VPA increases expression of spinal NSPCs in SCI.

The K-II group was sacrificed on the 1st day after transient focal cerebral ischemia and the K-III group on the 3rd day. The D-I group was administered quetiapine following ischemia and sacrificed on the 1st day while the D-II group was administered quetiapine every day following the ischemia and sacrificed on the 3rd day. The samples were stained with the immunochemical TUNEL method and the number of apoptotic cells were counted. There was a significant difference between the first and third day control groups (K-II\/K-III : p=0.004) and this indicates that apoptotic cell death increases with time. This increase was not encountered in the drug groups (D-I\/D-II : p=1.00). Statistical analysis of immunohistochemical data revealed that quetiapine decreased the apoptotic cell death that normally increased with time. Quetiapine is already in clinical use and is a safe drug, in contrast to many substances that are used to prevent ischemia and are not normally used clinically.

Based upon the operative findings, the stent grabbed the main thrombi but inadvertently detached at a severely tortuous, acutely angled, and circumferentially calcified segment of the internal carotid artery. Postoperative angiography demonstrated complete recanalization of the internal carotid artery. The patient's neurological deficits gradually improved, and the modified Rankin scale score was 2 at three months after surgery.

We used ICG-VA in that operations with half of recommended dose (0.2 to 0.3 mg\/kg). Postoperative digital subtraction angiography and computed tomography angiography was used to confirm anatomical results. Intraoperative ICG-VA demonstrated fully occluded aneurysm sack, no neck remnant, and without vessel compromise in 119 cases (93.7%) of 127 aneurysms. Eight clipping (6.3%) of 127 operations were identified as an incomplete aneurysm occlusion or compromising vessel after ICG-VA.

In the two patients of arteriovenous malformation, ICG-VA was useful for find the superficial nature of the feeding arteries and draining veins. ICG-VA is simple and provides real-time information of the patency of vessels including very small perforators within the field of the microscope and has a lower rate of adverse reactions.

The cumulative risk of recanalization was 7% at 12-month, 10% at 24-month, and 13% at 36-month of postembolization, and significantly higher for the second and third categories of every scale (p&lt;0.001). Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of the second and third categories as compared with the first category of AGS (HR : 3.95 and 4.15, p=0.004 and 0.001) and 2DPO (HR : 4.87 and 3.12, p&lt;0.001 and 0.01) were similar. For vPD, there was no association between occlusion rates and recanalization. The validated and optimism-adjusted C-indices were 0.50 [confidence (CI) : -1.09-2.09], 0.47 (CI : -1.10-2.09) and 0.44 (CI : -1.10-2.08) for AGS, 2DPO, and vPD, respectively. Total occlusion should be reasonably tried in coiling to maximize the benefit of the treatment. AGS may be the best to predict recanalization, whereas vPD should not be used alone. ","1177":"After spinal cord injury (SCI), functional and structural reorganization occurs at multiple levels of brain including motor cortex. However, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. The current study was performed to investigate the alterations in the expression of the main regulators of neuronal development, survival and death, in the brain following thoracic contusive SCI in a mouse model. Eight-week-old female imprinting control region mice (n=60; 30-35 g) were used in this study. We analyzed the expression levels of regulators such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 in the brain following thoracic contusive SCI. The expression of BDNF levels were elevated significantly compared with control group at 2 weeks after injury (p&lt;0.05). The expression of NGF levels were elevated at 2, 4 weeks compared with control group, but these difference were not significant (p&gt;0.05). The GDNF levels were elevated at 2 week compared with control group, but these differences were not significant (p&gt;0.05). The difference of HDAC1 levels were not significant at 2, 4 and 8 weeks compared with control group (p&gt;0.05). These results demonstrate that the upregulation of BDNF may play on important role in brain reorganization after SCI. ","1178":"The offset connector can allow medial and lateral variability and facilitate intralaminar screw incorporation into the construct. The aim of this study was to compare the biomechanical characteristics of C7 intralaminar screw constructs with and without offset connector using a three dimensional finite element model of a C6-7 cervical spine segment. Finite element models representing C7 intralaminar screw constructs with and without the offset connector were developed. Range of motion (ROM) and maximum von Mises stresses in the vertebra for the two techniques were compared under pure moments in flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. ROM for intralaminar screw construct with offset connector was less than the construct without the offset connector in the three principal directions. The maximum von Misses stress was observed in the C7 vertebra around the pedicle in both constructs. Maximum von Mises stress in the construct without offset connector was found to be 12-30% higher than the corresponding stresses in the construct with offset connector in the three principal directions. This study demonstrated that the intralaminar screw fixation with offset connector is better than the construct without offset connector in terms of biomechanical stability. Construct with the offset connector reduces the ROM of C6-7 segment more significantly compared to the construct without the offset connector and causes lower stresses around the C7 pedicle-vertebral body complex. ","1179":"To develop a simple, reproducible model of disc degeneration in rabbits through percutaneous annular puncture and to confirm the degree of degeneration over time. Fifteen New Zealand white rabbits (4 to 5 months old and weighing approximately 3 to 3.5 kg each) underwent annular puncture of the L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 discs. Rabbits were sacrificed at 4, 8, or 20 weeks after puncture. For a longitudinal study to assess changes in disc height over time, serial X-rays were performed at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 20 weeks for rabbits in the 20-week group. Upon sacrifice, the whole spinal column and discs were extracted and analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and histological staining. The X-rays showed a slow, progressive decrease in disc height over time. Significant disc space narrowing compared to preoperative disc height was observed during the time period (p&lt;0.001). The MRI grade, aggrecan, and matrix metalloprotease-13 mRNA expression and hematoxylin and eosin\/safranin O\/anti-collagen II staining were consistently indicative of degeneration, supporting the results of the X-ray data. Percutaneous annular puncture resulted in slow, reproducible disc degeneration that was confirmed by radiology, biochemistry, and histology. This in vivo model can be used to study and evaluate the safety and efficacy of biologic treatments for degenerative disc disease.

It is very difficult to make a diagnosis of MNO for doctors who are not familiar with its clinical features and diagnostic criteria. We report a case of a young female patient who had been suffering motor weakness and radiating pain in both upper extremities. Cervical MRI showed tumorous lesion in spinal cord and performed surgery to remove lesion. We could not find a tumor mass in operation field and final diagnosis was NMO. NMO must be included in the differential diagnosis of lesions to rescue the patient from invasive surgical interventions.

There was a case of a healthy man without a history of immune-compromised disease who had invasive aspergillosis with unusual radiologic findings. A 48-year-old healthy man with diabetes mellitus, presented with complaints of blurred vision that persisted for one month. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple nodular enhancing lesions on the right cerebral hemisphere. The diffusion image appeared in a high-signal intensity in these areas. Cerebrospinal fluid examination did not show any infection signs. An open biopsy was done and intraoperative findings showed grayish inflammatory and necrotic tissue without a definitive mass lesion. The pathologic result was a brain abscess caused by fungal infection, morphologically aspergillus. Antifungal agents (Amphotericin B, Ambisome and Voriconazole) were used for treatment for 3 months. The visual symptoms improved. There was no recurrence or abscess pocket, but the remaining focal enhanced lesions were visible in the right temporal and occipital area at a one year follow-up MRI. This immune-competent patient showed multiple enhancing CNS aspergillosis in the cerebral hemisphere, which had a good outcome with antifungal agents. ","1182":"Ganglion cysts usually arise from the tissues around the facet joints. It is usually associated with degenerative cahanges in facet joints. Bilateral thoracic ganglion cysts are very rare and there is no previous case that located in bilateral intervertebral foramen compressing the L1 nerve root associated with severe radiculopathy. We report a 53 years old woman who presented with bilateral groin pain and severe numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral cystic mass in the intervertebral foramen between 12th thoracal and 1st lumbar vertebrae. The cystic lesions were removed after bilateral exposure of Th12-L1 foramens. The result of hystopathology confirmed the diagnosis as ganglion cyst. The ganglion cyst may compromise lumbar dorsal ganglion when it located in the intervertebral foramen. The surgeon should keep this rare entity in their mind for differential diagnosis. ","1183":"Myositis ossificans (MO) is a benign condition of non-neoplastic heterotopic bone formation in the muscle or soft tissue. Trauma plays a role in the development of MO, thus, non-traumatic MO is very rare. Although MO may occur anywhere in the body, it is rarely seen in the lumbosacral paravertebral muscle (PVM). Herein, we report a case of non-traumatic MO in the lumbosacral PVM. A 42-year-old man with no history of trauma was referred to our hospital for pain in the low back, left buttock, and left thigh. On physical examination, a slightly tender, hard, and fixed mass was palpated in the left lumbosacral PVM. Computed tomography showed a calcified mass within the left lumbosacral PVM. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed heterogeneous high signal intensity in T1- and T2-weighted image, and no enhancement of the mass was found in the postcontrast T1-weighted MRI. The lack of typical imaging features required an open biopsy, and MO was confirmed. MO should be considered in the differential diagnosis when the imaging findings show a mass involving PVM. When it is difficult to distinguish MO from soft tissue or bone malignancy by radiology, it is necessary to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

","1187":"The aneurysm arising from fenestrated proximal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is considered to be unique. The authors report a case of a 59-year-old woman who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) secondary to a ruptured aneurysm originating from the fenestrated A1 segment of right ACA. The patient had another unruptured aneurysm which was located at the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation. She was successfully treated with surgical clipping for both aneurysms. From the previously existing literatures, we found 18 more cases (1983-2011) of aneurysms associated with fenestrated A1 segment. All cases represented saccular type of aneurysms, and 79% of the patients had SAH. There were three subtypes of the fenestrated A1 aneurysms depending on the anatomical location, relative to the fenestrated segment. The most common type was the aneurysms located on the proximal end of fenestrated artery (82%). Azygos ACA and hypoplastic A1 were frequently accompanied by the aneurysm (33% and 31%, respectively), and multiple aneurysms were shown in three cases (16%). Considering that fenestrated A1 segment is likely to develop an aneurysm, which has high risk of rupture, early management may benefit patients with aneurysms accompanied by fenestrated proximal ACA.

It is generally benign, but disease progression and malignant transformation have been reported. Prognostic factors for PXA and optimal therapies are not well known. The study period was January 2000 to March 2012. Data on MR findings, histology, surgical extents and adjuvant therapies were reviewed in twenty-two patients diagnosed with PXA. The frequent symptoms of PXA included seizures, headaches and neurologic deficits. Tumors were most common in the temporal lobe followed by frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. One patient who died from immediate post-operative complications was excluded from the statistical analysis. Of the remaining 21 patients, 3 (14%) died and 7 (33%) showed disease progression. Atypical tumor location (p&lt;0.001), peritumoral edema (p=0.022) and large tumor size (p=0.048) were correlated with disease progression, however, Ki-67 index and necrosis were not statistically significant. Disease progression occurred in three (21%) of 14 patients who underwent GTR, compared with 4 (57%) of 7 patients who did not undergo GTR, however, it was not statistically significant. Ten patients received adjuvant radiotherapy and the tumors were controlled in 5 of these patients. The prognosis for PXA is good; in our patients overall survival was 84%, and event-free survival was 59% at 3 years. Atypical tumor location, peritumoral edema and large tumor size are significantly correlated with disease progression.

The records of 23 consecutive patients with 24 MCA aneurysms, who underwent stent-assisted embolization of the aneurysm, were retrospectively evaluated. Fifteen aneurysms were treated with one stent and 8 were treated using more than two stents (5 a stent-within-a-stent, 1 triple stents, and two Y-stent). Angiographically, complete or near complete occlusion was achieved in 15 aneurysms (65.2%), residual neck in five (21.7%), and residual aneurysm in three (13.1%). Five aneurysms demonstrated thrombosis within the stent during the procedure and hospitalization, and were resolved by intraarterial and intravenous Tirofiban injection. Symptomatic thromboembolic complications were developed in five patients and permanent deficits demonstrated in two patients with modified Rankin Scale 1 and 2, respectively. Treatment-related permanent morbidity and mortality rates were 8.3% and 0% with relatively high complication rate. Angiographic follow-up was available in 17 aneurysms at 6-31 months (mean, 13.2 months) and showed stable or improved in 15 (88.2%) and major and minor recurrence in one, respectively. Complex MCA aneurysms could be treated by stent-assisted coiling and showed lower recanalization rate during mid-term follow-up by effective flow diversion due to various stent-assisted techniques.

","1191":"Posture induced common peroneal nerve (CPN) palsy is usually produced during the prolonged squatting or habitual leg crossing while seated, especially in Asian culture and is manifested by the onset of foot drop. Because of its similarity to discogenic foot drop, patients may be diagnosed with a lumbar disc disorder, and in some patients, surgeons may perform unnecessary examinations and even spine surgery. The purpose of our study is to establish the clinical characteristics and diagnostic assessment of posture induced CPN palsy. From June 2008 to June 2012, a retrospective study was performed on 26 patients diagnosed with peroneal nerve palsy in neurophysiologic study among patients experiencing foot drop after maintaining a certain posture for a long time. The inducing postures were squatting (14 patients), sitting cross-legged (6 patients), lying down (4 patients), walking and driving. The mean prolonged neural injury time was 124.2 minutes. The most common clinical presentation was foot drop and the most affected sensory area was dorsum of the foot with tingling sensation (14 patients), numbness (8 patients), and burning sensation (4 patients). The clinical improvement began after a mean 6 weeks, which is not related to neural injury times. Electrophysiology evaluation was performed after 2 weeks later and showed delayed CPN nerve conduction study (NCS) in 24 patients and deep peroneal nerve in 2 patients. We suggest that an awareness of these clinical characteristics and diagnostic assessment methods may help clinicians make a diagnosis of posture induced CPN palsy and preclude unnecessary studies or inappropriate treatment in foot drop patients.

A 39-year-old hypertensive man presenting with seizure-like movement underwent computed tomography, which showed acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and an A1 segment of ACA aneurysm with superior and inferior projection. He underwent surgical clipping of the aneurysm, but superior and posterior portion of wide-neck aneurysm remained. We decided to treat the remnant aneurysm using an endovascular modality. After selection of the aneurysm, coil packing was performed assisted by the temporary semi-jailing technique. The Enterprise stent (Cordis Neurovascular, Miami, FL, USA) was deployed and recaptured repeatedly for angiography to ensure safety of the small caliber parent artery. Successful semi-deployment and recapture of the stent allowed subtotal coil occlusion of the aneurysm with good anatomic and clinical results. No complications were encountered. The stent could be recaptured up to the point where the proximal end of the stent marker was aligned with distal marker band of the microcatheter, approximately 70% of the stent length.

A total of 16 cases with craniocervical instability underwent OCF since the year 2002. The mean age of the patients was 51.5 years with a mean follow-up period of 34.9 months. The subjects were compared using lateral X-ray taken before the operation, after the operation, and during last follow-up. The Nurick score was used to assess neurological function pre and postoperatively. All patients showed improvements in myelopathic symptoms after the operation. The mean preoperative Nurick score was 3.1. At the end of follow-up after surgery, the mean Nurick score was 2.0. After surgery, most patients' posterior occipito-cervical angle entered the normal range as the pre operation angle decresed from 121 to 114 degree. There were three cases with complications, such as, vertebral artery injury, occipital screw failure and wound infection. In two cases with cerebral palsy, occipital screw failures occurred. But, reoperation was performed in one case. OCF is an effective method in treating craniocervical instability.

The purpose of this study is to present our experience regarding the usefulness of transradial cerebral angiography, especially in elderly patients. Between May 2011 and February 2012, a total of 126 cerebral angiographies were performed via a transradial approach in a single center. Of them, only 47 patients were over 60 years old. In our institution, we shifted the initial access from the right femoral artery to the right radial artery in all patients requiring cerebral angiography in 2011. We did not attempt radial access in 40 cases for variable reasons. The procedural success rate was 92.2%. We have four failures of transradial angiography; two because of loop formations of the radial and brachial artery and two due to multiple puncture failures. All supra-aortic vessels were successfully catheterized. However, the selective catheterization rates of the left side distal vessels were lower, as success rates were 89.7% for the right internal carotid artery and 75% for the left internal carotid artery. Procedure-related vascular complications, such as puncture site hematoma, hand ischemia, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula and arterial dissection were not observed in our series. However, intraprocedural thrombosis developed in one patient, which was resolved completely by intraarterial thrombolytic agents. With advancing patient's age, we believe that transradial cerebral angiography is a useful tool to decrease patient's discomfort and more effectively manage the vessel tortuosity.

It usually occurs bilaterally or ipsilaterally to the pathologic lesions. We report the case of a contralateral sixth nerve palsy following ruptured dissecting VA aneurysm. A 38-year-old man was admitted for the evaluation of a 6-day history of headache. Abnormalities were not seen on initial computed tomography (CT). On admission, the patient was alert and no signs reflecting neurologic deficits were noted. Time of flight magnetic resonance angiography revealed a fusiform dilatation of the right VA involving origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The patient suddenly suffered from severe headache with diplopia the day before the scheduled cerebral angiography. Neurologic examination disclosed nuchal rigidity and isolated left abducens nerve palsy. Emergent CT scan showed high density in the basal and prepontine cistern compatible with ruptured aneurismal hemorrhage. Right vertebral angiography illustrated a right VA dissecting aneurysm with prominent displaced vertebrobasilar artery to inferiorly on left side. Double-stent placement was conducted for the treatment of ruptured dissecting VA aneurysm. No diffusion restriction signals were observed in follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the brain stem. Eleven weeks later, full recovery of left sixth nerve palsy was documented photographically.

A 46-year-old man presented with a penetrating wound to his face. A piece of an electric angular grinder disc became lodged in the anterior skull base. Computed tomography revealed that the disc had penetrated the unilateral paraclinoid and suprasellar areas without flow of the intracranial carotid artery on the lesion side. The cavernous sinus was also compromised. Removal of the anterior clinoid process reopened the carotid blood flow, and the injection of glue into the cavernous sinus restored complete hemostasis during extraction of the fragment from the face. Digital subtraction angiography revealed complete recanalization of the carotid artery without any evidence of dissection. Accurate diagnosis regarding the extent of the compromised structures and urgent decompressive surgery with adequate hemostasis minimized the severity of penetrating damage in our patient.","1211":"Many studies have investigated paraspinal muscle changes after posterior lumbar surgery, including lumbar fusion. However, no study has been performed to investigate back muscle changes after pedicle based dynamic stabilization in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal diseases. In this study, the authors compared back muscle cross sectional area (MCSA) changes after non-fusion pedicle based dynamic stabilization. Thirty-two consecutive patients who underwent non-fusion pedicle based dynamic stabilization (PDS) at the L4-L5 level between February 2005 and January 2008 were included in this retrospective study. In addition, 11 patients who underwent traditional lumbar fusion (LF) during the same period were enrolled for comparative purposes. Preoperative and postoperative MCSAs of the paraspinal (multifidus+longissimus), psoas, and multifidus muscles were measured using computed tomographic axial sections taken at the L4 lower vertebral body level, which best visualize the paraspinal and psoas muscles. Measurements were made preoperatively and at more than 6 months after surgery. Overall, back muscles showed decreases in MCSAs in the PDS and LF groups, and the multifidus was most affected in both groups, but more so in the LF group. The PDS group showed better back muscle preservation than the LF group for all measured muscles. The multifidus MCSA was significantly more preserved when the PDS-paraspinal-Wiltse approach was used. Pedicle based dynamic stabilization shows better preservation of paraspinal muscles than posterior lumbar fusion. Furthermore, the minimally invasive paraspinal Wiltse approach was found to preserve multifidus muscles better than the conventional posterior midline approach in PDS group. ","1212":"There are many cases in which degenerative changes are prevalent in both the cervical and lumbar spine, and the relation between both spinal degenerative findings of MRI is controversial. The authors analyzed the prevalence of abnormal findings on MRI, and suggested a model to explain the relationship between cervical and lumbar disc in asymptomatic Korean subjects. We performed 3 T MRI sagittal scans on 102 asymptomatic subjects (50 men and 52 women) who visited our hospital between the ages of 14 and 82 years (mean age 46.3 years). Scores pertaining to herniation (HN), annular fissure (AF), and nucleus degeneration (ND) were analyzed. The total scores for the cervical and lumbar spine were analyzed using correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression with various predictive parameters, including weight, height, sex, age, smoking, occupation, and sedentary fashion. The correlation coefficients of HN, AF, and ND were 0.44, 0.50, and 0.59, respectively. We made the best model for relationship by using multiple linear regression. The results of the current study showed that there was a close relationship between the cervical score (CS) and lumbar score (LS). In addition, the correlation between CS and LS, as well as the LS value itself, can be altered by other explanatory variables. Although not absolute, there was also a linear relationship between degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spine. Based on these results, it can be inferred that degenerative changes of the lumbar spine will be useful in predicting the degree of cervical spine degeneration in an actual clinical setting.

Neuronavigation makes the operation more safe, exact and lesser invasive procedures. But classical neuronavigation systems with rigid pinning fixations were difficult to apply to pediatric populations because of their thin and immature skull. Electromagnetic neuronavigation has used in the very young patients because it does not need rigid pinning fixations. The usefulness of electromagnetic neuronavigation is described through our experiences of neuroendoscopy for pediatric groups and reviews for several literatures. Between January 2007 and July 2011, nine pediatric patients were managed with endoscopic surgery using electromagnetic neuronavigation (AxiEM, Medtronics, USA). The patients were 4.0 years of mean age (4 months-12 years) and consisted of 8 boys and 1 girl. Totally, 11 endoscopic procedures were performed. The cases involving surgical outcomes were reviewed. The goal of surgery was achieved successfully at the time of surgery, as confirmed by postoperative imaging. In 2 patients, each patient underwent re-operations due to the aggravation of the previous lesion. And one had transient mild third nerve palsy due to intraoperative manipulation and the others had no surgery related complication. By using electromagnetic neuronavigation, neuroendoscopy was found to be a safe and effective technique. In conclusion, electromagnetic neuronavigation is a useful adjunct to neuroendoscopy in very young pediatric patients and an alternative to classical optical neuronavigation.

Patients were divided into two groups including those with small emboli (group A; grade 1, 2) and those with large emboli (group B; grade 3, 4). The size and number of emboli were assigned one of four grades (1=no clots, 2=1 or 2 small clots, 3=more than 3 small clots, 4=large clots) by microscopic observation of the EPD after CAS. We compared demographic characteristics, medical history, and angiographic findings of each group. Thirty-five patients underwent CAS, and technical success was achieved in all cases. Twenty-three patients were included in group A and 12 patients in group B. Our results demonstrated that advanced age [odds ratio (OR) 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.52; p=0.044] and smoking (OR 42.06; CI 2.828-625.65, p=0.006) were independent risk factors for developing large emboli after CAS. In patients with carotid artery stenosis treated with CAS, advanced age and smoking increased the number and size of emboli. Although use of an EPD is controversial, it may be useful in CAS in patients with risk factors for large emboli in order to reduce the risk of ischemic events. ","1215":"To evaluate the effect of electromagnetic (EM) navigation system on ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt failure rate through comparing the result of standard shunt placement. All patients undergoing VP shunt from October 2007 to September 2010 were included in this retrospective study. The first group received shunt surgery using EM navigation. The second group had catheters inserted using manual method with anatomical landmark. The relationship between proximal catheter position and shunt revision rate was evaluated using postoperative computed tomography by a 3-point scale. 1) Grade I; optimal position free-floating in cerebrospinal fluid, 2) Grade II; touching choroid or ventricular wall, 3) Grade III; tip within parenchyma. A total of 72 patients were participated, 27 with EM navigated shunts and 45 with standard shunts. Grade I was found in 25 patients from group 1 and 32 patients from group 2. Only 2 patients without use of navigation belonged to grade III. Proximal obstruction took place 7% in grade I, 15% in grade II and 100% in grade III. Shunt revision occurred in 11% of group 1 and 31% of group 2. Compared in terms of proximal catheter position, there was growing trend of revision rate according to increase of grade on each group. Although infection rate was similar between both groups, the result had no statistical meaning (p=0.905, chi-square test). The use of EM navigation in routine shunt surgery can eliminate poor shunt placement resulting in a dramatic reduction in failure rates. ","1216":null,"1217":"Transient anterograde amnesia is occasionally observed in a number of conditions, including migraine, focal ischemia, venous flow abnormalities, and after general anesthesia. The inhalation anesthetic, isoflurane, is known to induce transient anterograde amnesia. We examined the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) in the underlying mechanisms of the isoflurane-induced transient anterograde amnesia. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups : the control group, the 10 minutes after recovery from isoflurane anesthesia group, and the 2 hours after recovery from isoflurane anesthesia group (n=8 in each group). The rats in the isoflurane-exposed groups were anesthetized with 1.2% isoflurane in 75% nitrous oxide and 25% oxygen for 2 hours in a Plexiglas anesthetizing chamber. Short-term memory was determined using the step-down avoidance task. BDNF and TrkB expressions in the hippocampus were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. Latency in the step-down avoidance task was decreased 10 minutes after recovery from isoflurane anesthesia, whereas it recovered to the control level 2 hours after isoflurane anesthesia. The expressions of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus were decreased immediately after isoflurane anesthesia but were increased 2 hours after isoflurane anesthesia. In this study, isoflurane anesthesia induced transient anterograde amnesia, and the expressions of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus might be involved in the underlying mechanisms of this transient anterograde amnesia. ","1218":"Ultrasound scanning of a peripheral nerve along its expected course is a simple and useful method for determining the cause of peripheral neuropathy. We present 3 cases of peripheral neuropathy in which the pathology was detected by simple ultrasound scanning of the affected nerve. There were 2 cases of entrapment neuropathy due to mucoid cyst and 1 case of nerve sheath tumor. All lesions were visualized by simple ultrasound scanning of the involved peripheral nerve. Our results suggest that if a lesion affecting the peripheral nerve is suspected after history and physical examination or electrophysiologic studies, ultrasound scanning of the peripheral nerve of interest throughout its course is very helpful for identifying the causative lesion.","1219":"The incidence of spinal meningioma is very rare in children. A 14-year-old girl presented with right arm weakness, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intradural extramedullary tumor dorsal to the spinal cord in the level of C1. The tumor was totally removed despite the severe cord compression. Meningotheliomatous meningioma was diagnosed after histological examination.","1220":"A 65-year-old man who had lateral cervical disc herniation underwent cervical posterior laminoforaminotomy at C5-6 and C6-7 level right side. During the operation, there was no serious surgical bleeding event. After operation, he complained persistent right shoulder pain and neck pain. Repeated magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed diffuse cervical epidural hematoma (EDH) extending from C5 to T1 level right side and spinal cord compression at C5-6-7 level. He underwent exploration. There was active bleeding at muscular layer. Muscular active bleeding was controlled and intramuscular hematoma was removed. The patient's symptom was reduced after second operation. Symptomatic postoperative spinal EDH requiring reoperation is rare. Meticulous bleeding control is important before wound closure. In addition, if patient presents persistent or aggravated pain after operation, rapid evaluation using MRI and second look operation is needed as soon as possible.","1221":"Granular cell tumors (GrCTs) of the spinal cord are rare benign tumors with a high rate of local recurrence. Only 6 cases of spinal GrCTs have been reported. GrCT is difficult to distinguish from other benign tumors such as schwannoma using imaging. A radiological \"speckled dots\" sign may be a useful differentiating feature of GrCT based upon experience with two cases and a review of the literature.","1222":"We report a rare case of remote cerebellar hemorrhage after intradural disc surgery at the L1-2 level. Two days after the spine surgery, patient complained unexpected headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. From the urgently conducted brain CT, it was reported that the patient had cerebellar hemorrhage. Occipital craniotomy and hematoma evacuation was performed, and hemorrhagic lesion on the right cerebellum was effectively removed. After occipital craniotomy, the patient showed signs of improvement on headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. He was able to leave the hospital after two weeks of initial operation without any neurological deficit. Remote cerebellar hemorrhage following spinal surgery is extremely rare, but may occur from dural damage of spinal surgery, accompanied with cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Early diagnosis is particularly important for the optimal treatment of remote cerebellar hemorrhage.","1223":"Simultaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage and infarction is a quite rare presentation in a patient with a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery. Identifying relevant radiographic features and serial angiographic surveillance as well as mode of clinical manifestation, either hemorrhage or infarction, could sufficiently determine appropriate treatment. Enlargement of ruptured aneurysm and progressing arterial stenosis around the aneurysm indicates impending risk of subsequent stroke. In this setting, prompt treatment with stent-assisted endovascular embolization can be a reliable alternative to direct surgery. When multiple arterial dissections are coexistent, management strategy often became complicated. However, satisfactory clinical results can be obtained by acknowledging responsible arterial site with careful radiographic inspection and antiplatelet medication.","1224":"Bilateral abducens nerve palsy related to ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) has only been reported in four patients. Three cases were treated by surgical clipping. No report has described the clinical course of the isolated bilateral abducens nerve palsy following ruptured ACoA aneurysm obliterated with coil. A 32-year-old man was transferred to our institution after three days of diplopia, dizziness and headache after the onset of a 5-minute generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Computed tomographic angiography revealed an aneurysm of the ACoA. Magnetic resonance imaging showed focal intraventricular hemorrhage without brain stem abnormalities including infarction or space-occupying lesion. Endovascular coil embolization was conducted to obliterate an aneurysmal sac followed by lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Bilateral paresis of abducens nerve completely recovered 9 weeks after ictus. In conclusion, isolated bilateral abducens nerve palsy associated with ruptured ACoA aneurysm may be resolved successfully by coil embolization and lumbar CSF drainage without directly relieving cerebrospinal fluid pressure by opening Lillequist's membrane and prepontine cistern.","1225":"Burr hole drainage has been widely used to treat chronic subdural hematomas (SDH), and most of them are easily treated by simple trephination and drainage. However, various complications, such as, hematoma recurrence, infection, seizure, cerebral edema, tension pneumocephalus and failure of the brain to expand due to cerebro-cranial disproportion may develop after chronic SDH drainage. Among them, intracerebral hemorrhage after evacuation of a recurrent chronic SDH is very rare. Here, we report a fatal case of delayed intracerebral hemorrhage caused by coagulopathy following evacuation of a chronic SDH. Possible pathogenic mechanisms of this unfavorable complication are discussed and a review of pertinent literature is included.","1226":null,"1227":null,"1228":"Similar to back pain, neck pain has recently shown to have increasing prevalence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in identifying the causes of neck pain. However, MRI shows not only pathological lesions but also physiological changes at the same time, and there are few Korean data. The authors have attempted to analyze the prevalence of disc degeneration in highly selective asymptomatic Korean subjects using MRI. We performed 3 T MRI sagittal scans from C2 to T1 on 102 asymptomatic subjects (50 men and 52 women) who visited our hospital between the ages of 14 and 82 years (mean age 46.3 years). All images were read independently by three observers (two neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist) who were not given any information about the subjects. We classified grading for cervical disc herniation (HN), annular fissure (AF), and nucleus degeneration (ND), using disc degeneration classification. The prevalence of HN, AF, and ND were 81.0%, 85.9%, and 95.4%, respectively. High prevalence of HN, AF, and ND was shown compared to previous literature. In asymptomatic Korean subjects, the abnormal findings of 3 T MRI showed a high prevalence in HN, AF, and ND. Several factors might play important roles in these results, such as population-specific characters, MRI field strength, and disc degeneration grading system. ","1229":"The authors reviewed their experiences of combined surgery (open door laminoplasty with unilateral screw fixation) for unstable multi-level cervical stenosis, to clarify the situation regarding the surgical approach most appropriate for the treatment of diffuse unstable multi-level cervical stenosis. From January 2011 to January 2012, combined surgery was performed for unstable multi-level cervical stenosis by one surgeon at our institution. The subjects of this study were 6 men of mean age 53.7 years (range, 48-71) with a mean follow-up of 9.3 (range, 3-14) months. All imaging studies showed severe multi-level cervical stenosis with spinal cord signal change, and instability or kyphotic deformity. A retrospective review of clinical, radiological, and surgical data was conducted. Average laminoplasty level was 4.8 and the average screw fixation level was 5.0. Japanese Orthopedic Association score improved from an average of 5.2 to 11.2 points. According to Nurick's grades and Odom's criteria, symptom improvement was statistically significant. On the other hand, Cobb's angle changes were not significant. Average operation time was 5.86 hours with an average blood loss of 460 mL. No significant surgical complication was encountered. Despite the small cohort and the short follow-up duration, the present study demonstrates that laminoplasty with unilateral screw fixation is a safe and effective treatment for unstable multi-level cervical stenosis. ","1230":null,"1231":"Cerebral aneurysm (CA) is an important acquired cerebrovascular disease that can cause catastrophic results. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, playing essential roles in modulating basic physiologic and pathological processes. Currently, evidences have been established about biologic relationship between miRNAs and abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, biologic roles of miRNAs in CA formation have not been explained yet. We employed microarray analysis to detect and compare miRNA expression profiles in late stage of CA in rat model. Twenty-six, 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a CA induction procedure. The control animals (n=11) were fed a normal diet, and the experimental animals (n=26) were fed a normal diet with 1% normal saline for 3 months. Then, the rats were sacrificed, their cerebral arteries were dissected, and the five regions of aneurysmal dilation on the left posterior communicating artery were cut for miRNA microarrays analysis. Six miRNAs (miRNA-1, miRNA-223, miRNA-24-1-5p, miRNA-551b, miRNA-433, and miRNA-489) were randomly chosen for validation using real-time quantitative PCR. Among a set of differentially expressed miRNAs, 14 miRNAs were over-expressed more than 200% and 6 miRNAs were down-expressed lower than 50% in the CA tissues. The results show that miRNAs might take part in CA formation probably by affecting multiple target genes and signaling pathways. Further investigations to identify the exact roles of these miRNAs in CA formation are required. ","1232":"In order to develop a novel nerve guidance channel using porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) for nerve regeneration, we investigated the possibility of SIS, a tissue consisting of acellular collagen material without cellular immunogenicity, and containing many kinds of growth factors, as a natural material with a new bioactive functionality. Left sciatic nerves were cut 5 mm in length, in 14 Sprague-Dawley rats. Grafts between the cut nerve ends were performed with a silicone tube (Silicon group, n=7) and rolled porcine SIS (SIS group, n=7). All rats underwent a motor function test and an electromyography (EMG) study on 4 and 10 weeks after grafting. After last EMG studies, the grafts, including proximal and distal nerve segments, were retrieved for histological analysis. Foot ulcers, due to hypesthesia, were fewer in SIS group than in Silicon group. The run time tests for motor function study were 2.67 seconds in Silicon group and 5.92 seconds in SIS group. Rats in SIS group showed a better EMG response for distal motor latency and amplitude than in Silicon group. Histologically, all grafts contained some axons and myelination. However, the number of axons and the degree of myelination were significantly higher in SIS group than Silicon group. These results show that the porcine SIS was an excellent option as a natural biomaterial for peripheral nerve regeneration since this material contains many kinds of nerve growth factors. Furthermore, it could be used as a biocompatible barrier covering neural tissue. ","1233":"Four patients underwent lumbar surgery. In all four patients, the dura was minimally torn during the operation. However, none exhibited signs of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage. In each case, a few days after the operation, the patient suddenly experienced severe recurring pain in the leg. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging showed transdural nerve rootlets entrapped in the intervertebral disc space. On exploration, ventral dural tears and transdural nerve rootlet entrapment were confirmed. Midline durotomy, herniated rootlet repositioning, and ventral dural tear repair were performed, and patients' symptoms improved after rootlet repositioning. Even with minimal dural tearing, nerve rootlets may become entrapped, resulting in severe recurring symptoms. Therefore, the dural tear must be identified and repaired during the first operation.","1234":"A case of traumatic spondyloptosis of the cervical spine at the C6-C7 level is reported. The patient was treated succesfully with a anterior-posterior combined approach and decompression. The patient had good neurological outcome after surgery. A-51-year-old female patient was transported to our hospital's emergency department after a vehicle accident. The patient was quadriparetic (Asia D, MRC power 4\/5) with severe neck pain. Plain radiographs, computerize tomography and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed C6-7 spondyloptosis and C5, C6 posterior element fractures. Gardner-Wells skeleton traction was applied. Spinal alignment was reachived by traction and dislocation was decreased to a grade 1 spondylolisthesis. Then the patient was firstly operated by anterior approach. Anterior stabilization and fusion was firstly achieved. Seven days after first operation the patient was operated by a posterior approach. The posterior stabilization and fusion was achieved. Postoperative lateral X-rays and three-dimensional computed tomography showed the physiological realignment and the correct screw placements. The patient's quadriparesis was improved significantly. Subaxial cervical spondyloptosis is a relatively rare clinical entity. In this report we present a summary of the clinical presentation, the surgical technique and outcome of this rarely seen spinal disorder.","1235":"Chondrosarcoma is a very uncommon malignant primary bone tumor, especially, it occurs extremely rare in the spine. A 52-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with sudden paraplegia. Twelve hours prior to a paraplegic event, he visited an outpatient clinic with discomfort and tenderness around the medial border of the right scapular, and his neurologic status was absolutely intact. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lobulated soft tissue mass from T3 to T5, which extended to the epidural space. Computed tomography scans showed soft tissue mass on the spinal posterior arch and osteolytic change of the adjacent bony structures. Emergent surgery was performed and the lesion was removed. Dark reddish blood and gel-like material were encountered around the dura and posterior arch during the operation. Multiple pulmonary nodules were found on a chest CT scan and a biopsy of one of them had been proven to be a metastasis of chondrosarcoma. The histologic examination showed dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. The patient's neurologic deficit was improved slowly from ASIA A to ASIA D. Chondrosarcoma in the spine is extremely rare, even more with acute hemorrhage and sudden expansion into the epidural space. We named it chondrosarcoma apoplexy. We should consider the possibility of a hemorrhagic event when the patient's neurologic deficit worsens suddenly with spinal bone tumor.","1236":"\"Tumor-to-tumor\" metastasis is a rare event; meningioma has been reported as the most common primary intracranial tumor to harbor cancer metastases. Several hypotheses have been previously proposed to explain this occurrence, but the exact mechanism by which these metastases develop into meningiomas is not yet understood. Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy have been valuable diagnostic tools, but preoperative diagnosis of metastasis to meningioma remains highly difficult. We present a case report of a metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer into an intracranial meningioma.","1237":"Obtaining real-time image is essential for neurosurgeons to minimize invasion of normal brain tissue and to prompt diagnosis of intracranial event. The aim of this study was to report our three-year experience with a mobile computed tomography (mCT) for intraoperative and bedside scanning. A total of 357 mCT (297 patients) scans from January 2009 to December 2011 in single institution were reviewed. After excluding post-operative routine follow-up, 202 mCT were included for analysis. Their medical records such as diagnosis, clinical application, impact on decision making, times, image quality and radiologic findings were assessed. Two-hundred-two mCT scans were performed in the operation room (n=192, 95%) or intensive care unit (ICU) (n=10, 5%). Regarding intraoperative images, extent of resection of tumor (n=55, 27.2%), degree of hematoma removal (n=42, 20.8%), confirmation of catheter placement (n=91, 45.0%) and monitoring unexpected complications (n=4, 2.0%) were evaluated. A total of 14 additional procedures were introduced after confirmation of residual tumor (n=7, 50%), hematoma (n=2, 14.3%), malpositioned catheter (n=3, 21.4%) and newly developed intracranial events (n=2, 14.3%). Every image was obtained within 15 minutes and image quality was sufficient for interpretation. mCT is feasible for prompt intraoperative and ICU monitoring with enhanced diagnostic certainty, safety and efficiency. ","1238":"Asymptomatic patients show high degeneration prevalence at lumbar disc in previous literatures. Unfortunately, there are few Korean data, so the authors attempted to analyze the prevalence of disc degeneration in highly selective asymptomatic Korean subjects using MRI. We performed 3 T MRI sagittal scans from T12 to S1 on 102 asymptomatic subjects (50 men and 52 women) who visited our hospital between the ages of 14 and 82 years (mean age 46.3 years). All images were read independently by three observers (two neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist) who were not given any information about the subjects. We classified grading for lumbar disc herniation (HN), annular fissure (AF), and nucleus degeneration (ND), using disc degeneration classification. The prevalence of HN, AF, and ND were 81.4%, 76.1%, and 75.8% respectively. Almost all levels showed an age-related proportional tendency with some exceptions. In asymptomatic Korean subjects, the abnormal findings showed high prevalence of AF, ND, and extrusion. Especially in young ages, the authors found that bulging, protrusion, and AF showed high prevalence at L4\/5 and L5\/S1. And ND showed high prevalence at L5\/S1. So, all lumbar disc degenerations are not pathologic, especially in children and adolescents. ","1239":"The purpose of this study was to compare the results of three types of short segment screw fixation for thoracolumbar burst fracture accompanying osteopenia. The records of 70 patients who underwent short segment screw fixation for a thoracolumbar burst fracture accompanying osteopenia (-2.5&lt; mean T score by bone mineral densitometry &lt;-1.0) from January 2005 to January 2008 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on whether or not bone fusion and bone cement augmentation procedure 1) Group I (n=26) : short segment fixation with posterolateral bone fusion; 2) Group II (n=23) : bone cement augmented short segment fixation with posterolateral bone fusion; 3) Group III (n=21) : bone cement augmented, short segment percutaneous screw fixation without bone fusion. Clinical outcomes were assessed using a visual analogue scale and modified MacNab's criteria. Radiological findings, including kyphotic angle and vertebral height, and procedure-related complications, such as screw loosening or pull-out, were analyzed. No significant difference in radiographic or clinical outcomes was noted between patients managed using the three different techniques at last follow up. However, Group I showed more correction loss of kyphotic deformities and vertebral height loss at final follow-up, and Group I had higher screw loosening and implant failure rates than Group II or III. Bone cement augmented procedure can be an efficient and safe surgical techniques in terms of achieving better outcomes with minimal complications for thoracolumbar burst fracture accompanying osteopenia. ","1240":"We compared the results of two surgical techniques by retrospective study of 60 elderly patients (65 years or older) who underwent either decompression alone or fusion for the treatment of two-level or more lumbar spinal stenosis. During the period of 2003 and 2008, two-level or more decompression alone or fusion was performed for lumbar spinal stenosis by three surgeons at our institution. Patients were allocated to two groups by surgical modality, namely, to a decompression group (31 patients) or a fusion group (29 patients). Overall mean age was 71.1 years (range, 65-84) and mean follow-up was 5.5 years (range, 3-9). A retrospective review of clinical, radiological, and surgical data was conducted. No significant difference between the two groups was found with respect to age, follow-up period, surgical levels, or preoperative condition. At the last follow-up, correction of lumbar lordotic angle (determined radiologically) was better in the fusion group. However, clinical outcomes including visual analogue scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and the Odom's criteria were not significantly different in the two groups. On the other hand, surgical outcomes, such as, operation time, estimated blood loss, and surgical complications were significantly better in the decompression alone group. Our findings suggest that decompressive laminectomy alone achieves good outcomes in patients with two-level or more lumbar spinal stenosis, associated with an advanced age, poor general condition, or osteoporosis. ","1241":"There are few published studies which have documented psychopathological abnormalities in patients with of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychopathological influence of AIS in Korean 19-year-old males. The authors compared the Korean military multiphasic personal inventory (KMPI) military profiles of 105 AIS cases (more than 10 degrees of Cobb's angle without surgical treatment) with the KMPI profiles of 108 normal controls. The AIS group was split depending on Cobb's angle to further evaluate this relation by the severity of AIS. A significantly decreased result on the faking-good response scale and an significantly increased result on the faking-bad response were observed in the AIS group compared to the control (p&lt;0.012). The neurosis scale results, including anxiety, depression and somatization symptoms, were significantly increased in the AIS group compared to the control (p&lt;0.010). The severity level of personality disorder and schizophrenia were also significantly increased in the AIS group (p&lt;0.010). Differences in KMPI scale scores were not related to the severity of AIS. Young males with AIS tend to have abnormal results on the multiphasic personal inventory test compared to normal volunteers, suggesting that AIS may be related to psychopathology in the young male group in Korea. Although these psychopathology in AIS were differently observed compared to normal controls, but not interfered with military life. Clinicians are recommended to pay attention the psychopathological traits of patients with AIS. ","1242":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and surgical outcomes of familial hemifacial spasm (HFS) and to discuss the role of genetic susceptibility. Between 2001 and 2011, 20 familial HFS patients with ten different pedigrees visited our hospital. The data from comprehensive evaluation of these patients, including clinical, radiological and electrophysiological data and surgical outcomes were reviewed to characterize familial HFS and to compare the characteristics between familial HFS and sporadic HFS. According to the family tree, the inheritance pattern was difficult to define clearly using these data. Radiologic findings suggested that the vertebral artery (VA) was a more frequent offender in familial HFS than in sporadic cases (35.0% vs. 10.0%, p&lt;0.001). Chi-square test showed that there were no correlation between VA tortuosity and underlying morbidity such as diabetes or hypertension (p=0.391). Eighteen out of 19 patients who underwent microvascular decompression showed no residual spasm. Other features of familial HFS overlap with sporadic cases. These findings suggest that certain genetic susceptibilities rather than hypertension or diabetes may influence vascular tortuosity and HFS development. In this study, familial HFS seems not so different from sporadic cases. Authors thought familial HFS could have heterogeneous etiology. Further study of familial HFS including clinical, anatomic, genetic, and molecular information may help identify a gene or trait that can provide insight into the mechanisms of sporadic and familial HFS. ","1243":"This consecutive retrospective study was designed to analyze and to compare the efficacy and outcomes of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) using a fibular and femur allograft with anterior cervical plating. A total of 88 consecutive patients suffering from cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) who were treated with ACDF from September 2007 to August 2010 were enrolled in this study. Thirty-seven patients (58 segments) underwent anterior interbody fusion with a femur allograft, and 51 patients (64 segments) were treated with a fibular allograft. The mean follow-up period was 16.0 (range, 12-25) months in the femur group and 19.5 (range, 14-39) months in the fibular group. Cage fracture and breakage, subsidence rate, fusion rate, segmental angle and height and disc height were assessed by using radiography. Clinical outcomes were assessed using a visual analog scale and neck disability index. At 12 months postoperatively, cage fracture and breakage had occurred in 3.4% (2\/58) and 7.4% (4\/58) of the patients in the femur group, respectively, and 21.9% (14\/64) and 31.3% (20\/64) of the patients in the fibular group, respectively (p&lt;0.05). Subsidence was noted in 43.1% (25\/58) of the femur group and in 50.5% (32\/64) of the fibular group. No difference in improvements in the clinical outcome between the two groups was observed. The femur allograft showed good results in subsidence and radiologic parameters, and sustained the original cage shape more effectively than the fibular allograft. The present study suggests that the femur allograft may be a good choice as a fusion substitute for the treatment of cervical DDD. ","1244":"Authors report a rare case of acute intracranial subdural and intraventricular hemorrhage that were caused by intracranial hypotension resulted from cerebrospinal fluid leakage through an unidentified dural tear site during spinal surgery. The initial brain computed tomography image showed acute hemorrhages combined with preexisting asymptomatic chronic subdural hemorrhage. One burr hole was made over the right parietal skull to drain intracranial hemorrhages and subsequent drainage of cerebrospinal fluid induced by closure of the durotomy site. Among various methods to treat cerebrospinal fluid leakage through unidentified dural injury site, primary repair and spinal subarachnoid drainage are well known treatment options. The brain imaging study to diagnose intracranial hemorrhage should be taken before selecting the treatment method, especially for spinal subarachnoid drainage. Similar mechanism to its spinal counterpart, cranial cerebrospinal fluid drainage has not been mentioned in previous article and could be another treatment option to seal off an unidentified dural tear in particular case of drainage of intracranial hemorrhage is needed.","1245":"Thinning of parietal bone bilaterally is extremely rare but well known phenomenon. Approximate prevalence is 0.4-0.5% according to radiological scans, case reports and anthropologic researches. Even though biparietal osteodystrophy occurs mostly in over 60-year-old women, it shows no special association with race or geographical area tendency. Current definition was changed by understanding that is a pathological situation, not an anatomical variety or result of growing old in time. Biparietal osteodystrophy may have an unusual presentation and treatment still remains unclear. We aim to present a patient with biparietal osteodystrophy associated with minor head trauma that caused parietal fracture and epidural hematoma underneath.","1246":"Avulsion of spinous process, also called Clay-shoveler's fracture, is most prevalent among those engaged in hard physical labor. To the best of the author's knowledge, only one case of multiple spinous process fractures of the upper thoracic spine in a novice golfer has been reported. A 45-year-old female presented with intractable posterior neck pain. The patient experienced a sharp, sudden pain on the neck while swinging a golf club, immediately after the club head struck the ground. Dynamic cervical radiographic findings were C6 and C7 spinous process fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed C6 and C7 spinous process fractures without spinal cord pathology. The patient was treated with pain medications and cervical bracing. The patient's pain gradually improved. The injury mechanism was speculated to be similar to Clay-shoveler's fracture. Lower cervical spinous process fractures can be associated with a golf swing. If the patient complains of long lasting neck pain and has a history of golf activity, further study should be conducted to rule out lower cervical spinous fracture.","1247":"Synovial cysts of the lumbar spine are an uncommon cause of back and radicular pain. These cysts most frequently present as back pain, followed by chronic progressive radiculopathy or gradual onset of symptoms secondary to spinal canal compromise. Although less common, they can also present with acute spinal cord or root compression symptoms. We report of a case in which hemorrhaging into a right L2-3 facet synovial cyst caused an acute onset of back pain and radiculopathy, requiring surgical excision.","1248":"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma rarely originates from bone, and even more infrequently from a vertebral body. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and results from an abnormality in adaptive immune cells. A 27-year-old man presented with a two-month history of night sweats, weight loss, and severe back pain. Radiological studies demonstrated an osteolytic lesion compressing the subarachnoid space at the T11 level. Posterolateral fusion with decompression was performed and a pathologic examination confirmed lymphoblastic lymphoma of the B-cell precursor type. To our knowledge, this is the first report of solitary lymphoblastic lymphoma from B-cell precursors in of the thoracic spine. Herein, we discuss the presenting symptoms and the management of this rare case of lymphoblastic lymphoma.","1249":"Desmoplastic fibroma, which develops predominantly in long bones and the mandible, is a rare and benign but locally aggressive tumor. Desmoplastic fibroma of the cranium is extremely rare. We report a case of desmoplastic fibroma of the frontal bone in a young man. Because of its locally aggressive behavior, complete surgical excision with a safety margin is essential.","1250":"The 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced tumor fluorescence is a useful intraoperative marker for the diagnosis and the detection of various malignancies, but its use in meningioma is only reported infrequently. In meningioma, a complete resection of the tumor mass is crucial for the prevention of recurrence and postoperative morbidities. Deep sylvian meningioma is a rare type of meningioma where complete tumor removal is complicated by its deep anatomical location and close involvement with the middle cerebral artery. From our experience, 5-ALA-mediated fluorescence facilitated a safe excision whilst preserving critical neurovascular structures. To our best knowledge, this is first report from use of 5-ALA in a deep sylvian meningioma.","1251":"We report an uncommon case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with spontaneous rhinorrhea. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed an abnormally large sphenoid sinus associated with a parasellar bony defect (Sternberg's canal) through which magnetic resonance imaging could detect an encephalocele of the right temporal lobe. An endoscope-assisted trans-sphenoidal approach was performed and, with the aid of image guided surgery, reduction of the encephalocele was obtained and followed by surgical repair of the dural and bony defects. The postoperative course was uneventful and the cerebrospinal fluid fistula was closed as confirmed by the postoperative CT scan and by the absence of rhinorrhea. After three years of monitoring the patient remained asymptomatic.","1252":"Alternative to carotid endarterectomy, carotid artery stenting (CAS) can be performed for symptomatic severe stenosis of internal carotid artery, especially for high-risk patients. Among several complications after CAS, subacute in-stent thrombosis is rare but important, because patient's condition can deteriorate rapidly. Subacute in-stent thrombosis with carotid artery occlusion can be managed by superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis. We report two cases of STA-MCA anastomosis for internal carotid artery occlusion by subacute in-stent thrombosis after CAS.","1253":"Tracheoinnominate artery fistula is a critical complication of tracheostomy. The most important factors influencing patient outcome are prompt diagnosis, immediate control of bleeding with a patent airway, and emergency operation with or without interruption of the innominate artery. Here, we report a case of tracheoinnominate artery fistula in a 40-year-old woman with cerebrovascular accident who was successfully managed with an aorta-axillary artery bypass.","1254":null,"1255":"Brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare and radiosurgical management is complicated by the sensitivity of the adjacent neurological structures. Complete obliteration of the nidus is not always possible. We describe over 20 years of radiosurgical procedures for brainstem AVMs, focusing on clinical outcomes and radiosurgical techniques. Between 1992 and 2011, the authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 464 cerebral AVMs. Twenty-nine of the 464 patients (6.3%) reviewed had brainstem AVMs. This series included sixteen males and thirteen females with a mean age of 30.7 years (range : 5-71 years). The symptoms that led to diagnoses were as follows : an altered mentality (5 patients, 17.3%), motor weakness (10 patients, 34.5%), cranial nerve symptoms (3 patients, 10.3%), headache (6 patients, 20.7%), dizziness (3 patients, 10.3%), and seizures (2 patients, 6.9%). Two patients had undergone a previous nidus resection, and three patients had undergone a previous embolization. Twenty-four patients underwent only GKRS. With respect to the nidus type and blood flow, the ratio of compact type to diffuse type and high flow to low flow were 17 : 12 and 16 : 13, respectively. In this series, 24 patients (82.8%) had a prior hemorrhage. The mean target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-11.3 cm(3)). The mean maximal and marginal radiation doses were 38.5 Gy (range 28.6-43.6 Gy) and 23.4 Gy (range 18-27 Gy), and the mean isodose profile was 61.3% (range 50-70%). Twenty-four patients had brainstem AVMs and were followed for more than 3 years. Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 17 patients (70.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 77.5 months (range 36-216 months). With respect to nidus type and blood flow, the obliteration rate of compact types (75%) was higher than that of diffuse types (66.7%), and the obliteration rate of low flow AVMs (76.9%) was higher than that of high flow AVMs (63.6%) (p&lt;0.05). Two patients (6.9%) with three hemorrhagic events suffered a hemorrhage during the follow-up period. The annual bleeding rate of AVM after GKRS was 1.95% per year. No adverse radiation effects or delayed cystic formations were found. GKRS has an important clinical role in treatment of brainstem AVMs, which carry excessive surgical risks. Angiographic features and radiosurgical techniques using a lower maximal dose with higher isodose profiles are important for lesion obliteration and the avoidance of complications. ","1256":null,"1257":"The incidence of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is rare. Patients with SSEH, however, present disabling neurologic deficits. Clinical outcomes are variable among patients. To evaluate the adequate treatment method according to initial patients' neurological status and clinical outcome with comparison of variables affecting the clinical outcome. We included 15 patients suffered from SSEH. Patients were divided into two groups by treatment method. Initial neurological status and clinical outcomes were assessed by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale. Also sagittal hematoma location and length of involved segment was analyzed with magnetic resonance images. Other factors such as age, sex, premorbid medication and duration of hospital stay were reviewed with medical records. Nonparametric statistical analysis and subgroup analysis were performed to overcome small sample size. Among fifteen patients, ten patients underwent decompressive surgery, and remaining five were treated with conservative therapy. Patients showed no different initial neurologic status between treatment groups. Initial neurologic status was strongly associated with neurological recovery (p=0.030). Factors that did not seem to affect clinical outcomes included : age, sex, length of the involved spinal segment, sagittal location of hematoma, premorbid medication of antiplatelets or anticoagulants, and treatment methods. For the management of SSEH, early decompressive surgery is usually recommended. However, conservative management can also be feasible in selective patients who present neurologic status as ASIA scale E or in whom early recovery of function has initiated with ASIA scale C or D. ","1258":"Meningiomas represent 18-20% of all intracranial tumors and have a 20-50% 10-year recurrence rate, despite aggressive surgery and irradiation. Hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, is known to inhibit meningioma cells by induction of apoptosis. We report the long-term follow-up result of hydroxyurea therapy in the patients with recurrent meningiomas. Thirteen patients with recurrent WHO grade I or II meningioma were treated with hydroxyurea (1000 mg\/m(2)\/day orally divided twice per day) from June 1998 to February 2012. Nine female and 4 male, ranging in age from 32 to 83 years (median age 61.7 years), were included. Follow-up assessment included physical examination, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Standard neuro-oncological response criteria (Macdonald criteria) were used to evaluate the follow-up MRI scans. The treatment was continued until there was objective disease progression or onset of unmanageable toxicity. Ten of the 13 patients (76.9%) showed stable disease after treatment, with time to progression ranging from 8 to 128 months (median 72.4 months; 6 patients still accruing time). However, there was no complete response or partial response in any patients. Three patients had progressive disease after 88, 89, 36 months, respectively. There was no severe (Grade III-IV) blood systemic disorders and no episodes of non-hematological side effects. This study showed that hydroxyurea is a modestly active agent against recurrent meningiomas and can induce long-term stabilization of disease in some patients. We think that hydroxyurea treatment is well tolerated and convenient, and could be considered as an alternative treatment option in patients with recurrent meningiomas prior to reoperation or radiotherapy. ","1259":"It is rare that the medial loop in the V2 segment of the vertebral artery (VA) causes compression of the proximal cervical root of the spinal cord without leading to bony erosion and an enlarged foramen. We evaluated the clinical significance and incidence of the medial loop in the V2 segment of the VA. We reviewed the records from 1000 consecutive patients who had undergone magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the cervical spine between January 2005 and January 2008. The inclusion criteria were that over a third of the axial aspect of the VA located in the intervertebral foramen was inside the line between the most ventral points of the bilateral lateral mass, and that the ipsilateral proximal root deviated dorsally because of the medial loop of the VA. We excluded cases of bone erosion, a widened foramen at the medial loop of the VA, any bony abnormalities, tumors displacing VA, or vertebral fractures. The medical records were reviewed retrospectively to search for factors of clinical significance. In six patients (0.6%), the VA formed a medial loop that caused compression of the proximal cervical root. One of these patients had the cervical radiculopathy that developed after minor trauma but the others did not present with cervical radiculopathy related to the medial loop of the VA. The medial loop of the VA might have a direct effect on cervical radiculopathy. Therefore, this feature should be of critical consideration in preoperative planning and during surgery.

Dramatical improvement of neurological deficits, control of convulsions and partial prevention of cerebral atrophy are achieved after these operations. One of the most important complications of cranioplasty is late infection. Here, we report a 43-year-old male patient admitted with the history of purulant discharge from the right temporal incission site for one year to whom cranioplasty had been performed with allograft material 20 days after craniectomy which had been performed in 1989. Allograft cranioplasty material was removed and cranioplasty was performed using new allograft material with the diagnosis of late cranioplasty infection.","1263":"Isolated tuberculosis of the coccyx is extremely rare. A 35-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of coccygeal and gluteal pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed osseous destruction and a large enhancing mass involving the coccyx with anterior and posterior extension. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed necrosis, chronic granulomatous inflammation, and multinucleated giant cells consistent with tuberculosis. This case highlights the importance of considering tuberculosis as a diagnosis even though unusual sites are involved.","1264":"We report a rare complication of iatrogenic spinal intradural following minimally invasive extradural endoscopic procedues in the lumbo-sacral spines. To our knowledge, intradural cyst following epiduroscopy has not been reported in the literature. A 65-year-old woman with back pain related with previous lumbar disc surgery underwent endoscopic epidural neuroplasty and nerve block, but her back pain much aggravated after this procedure. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large intradural cyst from S1-2 to L2-3 displacing the nerve roots anteriorly. On T1 and T2-weighted image, the signal within the cyst had the same intensity as cerebrospinal fluid. The patient underwent partial laminectomy of L5 and intradural exploration, and fenestration of the cystic wall was accomplished. During operation, the communication between the cyst and subarachnoid space was not identified, and the content of the cyst was the same as that of cerebrospinal fluid. Postoperatively, the pain attenuated immediately. Incidental durotomy which occurred during advancing the endoscope through epidural space may be the cause of formation of the intradural cyst. Intrdural cyst should be considered, if a patient complains of new symptoms such as aggravation of back pain after epiduroscopy. Surgical treatment, simple fenestration of the cyst may lead to improved outcome. All the procedures using epiduroscopy should be performed with caution.","1265":null,"1266":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and the most malignant astrocytoma in adults, with rare extra-cranial metastases, especially for subcutaneous metastases.

GBM with subcutaneous metastasis is extremely rare, and knowledge of a prior intracranial GBM, pathological examinations and immunocytochemical tests with markers typically expressed by GBM are of vital importance for the diagnosis of GBM metastasis. Surgical resection of subcutaneous swelling, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, could be the best strategy of treatment for the patients with GBM subcutaneous metastasis.","1267":"The authors present a case of isolated dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) in the transverse sinus, which developed six years after microvascular decompression caused by hemifacial spasm via suboccipital craniectomy.

We present two cases of CHS after cerebral revascularization that presented autonomic dysfunction.","1269":"The aim of this study is to establish the value of hand elevation test as a reproducible provocative test for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). We had a prospective study of 45 hands of 38 patients diagnosed with CTS between April 2005 and February 2009. The diagnosis of CTS was based on the American Academy of Neurology clinical diagnostic criteria. Experimental and control group patients underwent Tinel's test, Phalen's test, carpal compression test and hand elevation test as provocative tests for CTS. We used chi-square analysis to compare Tinel's test and Phalen's test, carpal compression test with hand elevation test. The sensitivity and specificity of the hand elevation test is 86.7% and 88.9% each. Tinel's test had 82.2% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. Phalen's test had 84.4% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity. Carpal compression test had 84.4% sensitivity 82.2% specificity. Comparisons of sensitivity and specificity between hand elevation test and Tinel's test, Phalen's test, and carpal compression test had no statistically significant differences. To compare the diagnostic accuracies of four tests, the area under the non-parametric receiver operating character curve was applied. The hand elevation test has higher sensitivity and specificity than Tinel's test, Phalen's test, and carpal compression test. Chi-square statistical analysis confirms the hand elevation test is not ineffective campared with Tinel's test, Phalen's test, and carpal compression test. ","1270":"The aim of this study was to devise an objective clustering method for magnetoencephalography (MEG) interictal spike sources, and to identify the prognostic value of the new clustering method in adult epilepsy patients with cortical dysplasia (CD). We retrospectively analyzed 25 adult patients with histologically proven CD, who underwent MEG examination and surgical resection for intractable epilepsy. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 3.1 years. A hierarchical clustering method was adopted for MEG interictal spike source clustering. Clustered sources were then tested for their prognostic value toward surgical outcome. Postoperative seizure outcome was Engel class I in 6 (24%), class II in 3 (12%), class III in 12 (48%), and class IV in 4 (16%) patients. With respect to MEG spike clustering, 12 of 25 (48%) patients showed 1 cluster, 2 (8%) showed 2 or more clusters within the same lobe, 10 (40%) showed 2 or more clusters in a different lobe, and 1 (4%) patient had only scattered spikes with no clustering. Patients who showed focal clustering achieved better surgical outcome than distributed cases (p=0.017). This is the first study that introduces an objective method to classify the distribution of MEG interictal spike sources. By using a hierarchical clustering method, we found that the presence of focal clustered spikes predicts a better postoperative outcome in epilepsy patients with CD.

Grade 2 and 3 were considered as incorrect position. The correct position was found in 95 screws (91.3%); grade 0-75 screws, grade 1-20 screws and the incorrect position in 9 screws (8.7%); grade 2-6 screws, grade 3-3 screws. There was no neurovascular complication related with cervical pedicle screw insertion. This technique (technique with direct exposure of the pedicle by laminoforaminotomy) could be considered relatively safe and easy method to insert cervical pedicle screw. ","1272":"In the present study, we evaluated the effect, safety and radiological outcomes of cervical hybrid surgery (cervical disc prosthesis replacement at one level, and interbody fusion at the other level) on the multilevel cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). Fifty-one patients (mean age 46.7 years) with symptomatic multilevel cervical spondylosis were treated using hybrid surgery (HS). Clinical [neck disability index (NDI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score] and radiologic outcomes [range of motion (ROM) for cervical spine, adjacent segment and arthroplasty level] were evaluated at routine postoperative intervals of 1, 6, 12, 24 months. Review of other similar studies that examined the HS in multilevel cervical DDD was performed. Out of 51 patients, 41 patients received 2 level hybrid surgery and 10 patients received 3 level hybrid surgery. The NDI and VAS score were significantly decreased during the follow up periods (p&lt;0.05). The cervical ROM was recovered at 6 and 12 month postoperatively and the mean ROM of inferior adjacent segment was significantly larger than that of superior adjacent segments after surgery. The ROM of the arthoplasty level was preserved well during the follow up periods. No surgical and device related complications were observed. Hybrid surgery is a safe and effective alternative to fusion for the management of multilevel cervical spondylosis.

A three-dimensional finite-element model of a functional spinal unit was developed using computed tomography scans of a normal motion segment, comprising the T11, T12 and L1 vertebrae. Volumes of bone cement, with appropriate mechanical properties, were inserted into the trabecular core of the T12 vertebra. Parametric studies were done by varying the volume and stiffness of the bone cement. When the bone cement filling volume reached 30% of the volume of a vertebral body, the level of stiffness was restored to that of normal bone, and when higher bone cement exceeded 30% of the volume, the result was stiffness in excess of that of normal bone. When the bone cement volume was varied, local stress in the bony structures (cortical shell, trabecular bone and endplate) of each vertebra monotonically increased. Low-modulus bone cement has the effect of reducing strain in the augmented body, but only in cases of relatively high volumes of bone cement (&gt;50%). Furthermore, varying the stiffness of bone cement has a negligible effect on the stress distribution of vertebral bodies. The volume of cement was considered to be the most important determinant in endplate fracture. Changing the stiffness of bone cement has a negligible effect on the stress distribution of vertebral bodies. ","1276":"Conventional laminectomy is the most popular technique for the complete removal of intradural spinal tumors. In particular, the central portion intramedullary tumor and large intradural extramedullary tumor often require a total laminectomy for the midline myelotomy, sufficient decompression, and adequate visualization. However, this technique has the disadvantages of a wide incision, extensive periosteal muscle dissection, and bony structural injury. Recently, split-spinous laminectomy and tubular retractor systems were found to decrease postoperative muscle injuries, skin incision size and discomfort. The combined technique of split-spinous laminectomy, using a quadrant tube retractor system allows for an excellent exposure of the tumor with minimal trauma of the surrounding tissue. We propose that this technique offers possible advantages over the traditional open tumor removal of the intradural spinal cord tumors, which covers one or two cervical levels and requires a total laminectomy.","1277":"Spinal infection is an inflammatory process around the vertebral body, and it can extend to the epidural space, posterior elements and paravertebral soft tissues. Infectious spondylitis is a rare infectious disorder, which is often associated with significant neurologic deficits and mortality. When an extensive soft tissue defect is accompanied by infectious spondylitis, effective infection control and proper coverage of soft tissue are directly connected to successful outcomes. However, it is not simple to choose the appropriate treatment methods for infectious spondylitis accompanied by a soft tissue defect. Herein, we report a case of severe infectious spondylitis that was accompanied by an extensive soft tissue defect which was closed with a reverse latissimus muscle flap after traumatic spinal epidural hemorrhage.","1278":"Cerebral aspergillosis is rare and usually misdiagnosed because its presentation is similar to that of a tumor. The correct diagnosis is usually made intra-operatively. Cerebral abscess with fungal infection is extremely rare and few cases have been reported, but it carries a poor prognosis.A 73 year-old man presented with decreased visual acuity and paresis of the right cranial nerve III. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the right cavernous sinus, extened to the anterior crainial fossa and the superior orbital fissure. During surgery, a well encapsulated pus pocket was found, and histopathological examination of the mass resulted in the diagnosis of aspergillosis. Despite appropriate anti-fungal treatment, the patient eventually died from fatal cerebral ischemic change and severe brain swelling.The correct diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis can only be achieved by histopathological examination because clinical and radiological findings including MRI are not specific. Surgical intervention and antifungal therapy should be considered the optimal treatment. Early diagnosis and aggressive antifungal treatment provide good results.","1279":"Tumors of the central nervous system are common in the pediatric population and constitute the second most prevalent tumor type in children. Within this group, spinal cord tumors are relatively rare and account for 1 to 10% of all pediatric central nervous system tumors. We describe a very rare case of an intradural extramedullary spinal cord tumor with a subcutaneous mass and discuss its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and treatment. A male infant was delivered normally, with uneventful development. At 16 days post-delivery, his family took him to a pediatrician because of a mass on his upper back. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine revealed a well-demarcated soft-tissue mass with central cystic change or necrosis at the subcutaneous layer of the posterior back (T2-7 level). Another mass was found with a fat component at the spinal canal of the T1-3 level, which was intradural extramedullary space. After six weeks, the spinal cord tumor and subcutaneous mass were grossly total resected; pathologic findings indicated an atypical myxoid spindle cell neoplasm, possibly nerve sheath in type. The final diagnosis of the mass was an atypical myxoid spindle cell neoplasm. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged after nine days without any neurological deficit. We report a rare case of an intradural extramedullary spinal tumor with subcutaneous mass in a neonate. It is necessary to monitor the patient's status by examining consecutive radiologic images, and the symptoms and neurological changes should be observed strictly during long-term follow-up.","1280":"A 38-year-old man fell from a chair with a chopstick in his hand. The chopstick penetrated his left eye. He noticed pain, swelling, and numbness around his left eye. On physical examination, a linear wound was noted at the medial aspect of the left eyelid. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) study showed a linear hypodense structure extending from the medial aspect of the left orbit to the occipital bone, suggesting a foreign body. This foreign body was hyperdense relative to normal parenchyma. From a CT scan with 3-dimensional reconstruction, the foreign body was found to be passing through the optic canal into the cranium. The clear plastic chopstick was withdrawn without difficulty. The patient was discharged home 3 weeks after his surgery.

Toxocariasis can be related with a form of EM. This report describes two cases of cervical eosinophilic myelitis initially considered as intramedullary tumors. When a differential diagnosis of the intramedullary spinal cord lesion is in doubt, evaluation for eosinophilic myelitis and toxocariasis would be beneficial.","1282":"A spinal epidural hemangioma is rare. In this case, a 51 year-old female patient had low back pain and right thigh numbness. She was initially misdiagnosed as having a ruptured disc with possible sequestration of granulation tissue formation due to the limited number of spinal epidural hemangiomas and little-known radiological findings.

The objective of the current study was to compare the long-term incidences of surgical site infection according to the graft material and cranioplasty timing after craniectomy, and to determine the associated factors of cranioplasty infection. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess graft infection in patients who underwent cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy between 2001 and 2011 at a single-center. From a total of 197 eligible patients, 131 patients undergoing 134 cranioplasties were assessed for event-free survival according to graft material and cranioplasty timing after craniectomy. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression methods were employed, with cranioplasty infection identified as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were also evaluated, including autogenous bone resorption, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma and brain contusion. The median follow-up duration was 454 days (range 10 to 3900 days), during which 14 (10.7%) patients suffered cranioplasty infection. There was no significant difference between the two groups for event-free survival rate for cranioplasty infection with either a cryopreserved or artificial bone graft (p=0.074). Intergroup differences according to cranioplasty time after craniectomy were also not observed (p=0.083). Poor neurologic outcome at cranioplasty significantly affected the development of cranioplasty infection (hazard ratio 5.203, 95% CI 1.075 to 25.193, p=0.04). Neurologic status may influence cranioplasty infection after decompressive craniectomy. A further prospective study about predictors of cranioplasty infection including graft material and cranioplasty timing is necessary. ","1285":"Removal of the anterior clinoid process (ACP) is an essential process in the surgery of giant or complex aneurysms located near the proximal internal carotid artery or the distal basilar artery. An extradural clinoidectomy must be performed within the limits of the meningeal layers surrounding the ACP to prevent morbid complications. To identify the safest method of extradural exposure of the ACP, anatomical studies were done on cadaver heads. Anatomical dissections for extradural exposure of the ACP were performed on both sides of seven cadavers. Before dividing the frontotemporal dural fold (FTDF), we measured its length from the superomedial apex attached to the periorbita to the posterolateral apex which connects to the anterosuperior end of the cavernous sinus. The average length of the FTDF on cadaver dissections was 7 mm on the right side and 7.14 mm on the left side. Cranial nerves were usually exposed when cutting FTDF more than 7 mm of the FTDF. The most delicate area in an extradural anterior clinoidectomy is the junction of the FTDF and the anterior triangular apex of the cavernous sinus. The FTDF must be cut from the anterior side of the triangle at the periorbital side rather than from the dural side. The length of the FTDF incision must not exceed 7 mm to avoid cranial nerve injury. ","1286":"The objective of this study was to investigate the morphologic characteristics between the vertebral body and the regions of the cervical and thoracic spinal cords where each rootlets branch out. Sixteen adult cadavers (12 males and 4 females) with a mean age of 57.9 (range of 33 to 70 years old) were used in this study. The anatomical relationship between the exit points of the nerve roots from the posterior root entry zone at each spinal cord segment and their corresponding relevant vertebral bodies were also analyzed. Vertical span of the posterior root entry zone between the upper and lower rootlet originating from each spinal segment ranged from 10-12 mm. The lengths of the rootlets from their point of origin at the spinal cord to their entrance into the intervertebral foramen were 5.9 mm at the third cervical nerve root and increased to 14.5 mm at the eighth cervical nerve root. At the lower segments of the nerve roots (T3 to T12), the posterior root entry zone of the relevant nerve roots had a corresponding anatomical relationship with the vertebral body that is two segments above. The posterior root entry zones of the sixth (94%) and seventh (81%) cervical nerve roots were located at a vertebral body a segment above from relevant segment. Through these investigations, a more accurate diagnosis, the establishment of a better therapeutic plan, and a decrease in surgical complications can be expected when pathologic lesions occur in the spinal cord or vertebral body. ","1287":"Detection of focal non-hemorrhagic lesion (NHL) has become more efficient in diffuse axonal injury (DAI) patients using an MRI. The aims of this study are to find out the radiological distribution, progress of NHL and its clinical significance. Between September 2005 and October 2011, 32 individuals with NHLs on brain MRI were enrolled. NHLs were classified by brain location into 4 major districts and 13 detailed locations including cortical and subcortical, corpus callosum, deep nuclei and adjacent area, and brainstem. The severity of NHL was scored from grades 1 to 4, according to the number of districts involved. Fourteen patients with NHL were available for MRI follow-up and an investigation of the changes was conducted. Thirty-two patients had 59 NHLs. The most common district of NHL was cortical and subcortical area; 15 patients had 20 NHSs. However the most common specific location was the splenium of the corpus callosum; 14 patients had 14 lesions. The more lesions patients had, the lower the GCS, however, this was not a statistically meaningful difference. On follow-up MRI in 14 patients, out of 24 lesions, 13 NHLs resolved, 5 showed cystic change, and 6 showed atrophic changes. NHLs were located most commonly in the splenium and occur frequently in the thalamus and the mesial temporal lobe. Because most NHS occur concomitantly with hemorrhagic lesions, it was difficult to determine their effects on prognosis. Since most NHLs resolve completely, they are probably less significant to prognosis than hemorrhagic lesions.

In addition, we also evaluated the necessity of posterolateral fusion for patients treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation. From January 2007 to December 2009, 46 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture were included in this study. On the basis of posterolateral fusion, we divided our patients into the non-fusion group and the fusion group. The radiological assessment was performed according to the Cobb's method, and results were obtained at immediately, 3, 6, 12 months after surgery. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using the modified Mcnab criteria at the final follow-up. The demographic data and the mean follow-up period were similar between the two groups. Patients of both groups achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes. The mean loss of kyphosis correction showed that patients of both groups experienced loss of correction with no respect to whether they underwent the posterolateral fusion. There was no significant difference in the degree of loss of correction at any time points of the follow-up between the two groups. In addition, we also compared the effect of fixed levels (i.e., short versus long segment) on loss of correction between the two groups and there was no significant difference. There were no major complications postoperatively and during follow-up period. We suggest that posterolateral fusion may be unnecessary for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures who underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation. ","1293":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the patterns and the risk factors of newly developed vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). We performed a retrospective review of the 244 patients treated with PVP from September 2006 to February 2011. Among these patients, we selected 49 patients with newly developed VCFs following PVP as the new VCFs group, and the remaining 195 patients as the no VCFs group. The new VCFs group was further divided into 2 groups : an adjacent fractures group and a nonadjacent fractures group. The following data were collected from the groups : age, gender, body weight\/height, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD) score of the spine and femur, level of initial fracture, restoration rate of anterior\/middle vertebral height, and intradiscal cement leakage, volume of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Age, gender, mean body height\/weight, mean BMI and volume of PMMA of each of the group are not statistically significantly associated with fractures. In comparison between the new VCFs group and the no VCFs group, lower BMD, intradiscal cement leakage and anterior vertebral height restoration were the significant predictive factors of the fracture. In addition, new VCFs occurrence at the adjacent spines was statistically significant, when the initial fracture levels were confined to the thoracolumbar junction, among the subgroups of new VCFs. Lower spinal BMD, the greater anterior vertebral height restoration rate and intradiscal cement leakage were confirmed as risk factors for newly formed VCFs after PVP. ","1294":"We compared the survival time between patients with multiple gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and patients with a single GKRS plus whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), in patients with multiple metachronous brain metastases from lung cancer. From May 2006 to July 2010, we analyzed 31 patients out of 112 patients who showed multiple metachronous brain metastases. 20 out of 31 patients underwent multiple GKRS (group A) and 11 patients underwent a single GKRS plus WBRT (group B). We compared the survival time between group A and B. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards were used to analyze relationship between survival and 1) the number of lesions in each patient, 2) the average volume of lesions in each patient, 3) the number of repeated GKRS, and 4) the interval of development of new lesions, respectively. Median survival time was 18 months (range 6-50 months) in group A and 6 months (range 3-18 months) in group B. Only the average volume of individual lesion (over 10 cc) was negatively related with survival time according to Kaplan-Meier method. Cox-proportional hazard ratio of each variable was 1.1559 for the number of lesions, 1.0005 for the average volume of lesions, 0.0894 for the numbers of repeated GKRS, and 0.5970 for the interval of development of new lesions. This study showed extended survival time in group A compared with group B. Our result supports that multiple GKRS is of value in extending the survival time in patients with multiple metachronous brain metastases, and that the number of the lesions and the frequency of development of new lesions are not an obstacle in treating patients with GKRS. ","1295":"The indications and optimal surgical treatments for intracranial cysts are controversial. In the present study, we describe long-term clinical and neuroimaging results of surgically treated intracranial cysts in children. The goal of this study is to contribute to the discussion of the debate. This study included 110 pediatric patients that underwent surgeries to treat intracranial cysts. Endoscopic cyst fenestrations were performed in 71 cases, while craniotomies and cyst excisions (with or without fenestrations) were performed in 30 patients. Cystoperitoneal shunts were necessary for nine patients. Long-term results were retrospectively assessed with medical and neuroimaging records. Clinical and radiological improvement was reported in 87.3% and 92.8% of cases, respectively, after endoscopic neurosurgery, and in 93.3% and 100% using open microsurgery whereas 88.9% and 85.7% after shunt operation. There were no statistical differences in clinical outcomes (p=0.710) or volume reductions (p=0.177) among the different surgeries. There were no mortalities or permanent morbidities, but complications such as shunt malfunctions, infections, and subdural hematomas were observed in 56% of the patients that had shunt operations. A total of 13 patients (11.8%) underwent additional surgeries due to recurrences or treatment failures. The type of surgery performed did not influence the recurrence rate (p=0.662) or the failure rate (p=0.247). Endoscopic neurosurgeries are less invasive than microsurgeries and are at least as effective as open surgeries. Thus, given the advantages and complications of these surgical techniques, we suggest that endoscopic fenestration should be the first treatment attempted in children with intracranial cysts. ","1296":"The purposes of this study are to investigate the factors that may be related to ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt in patients with cerebellar hematoma and the effect of severe fourth ventricular hemorrhage, causing obstructive hydrocephalus on subsequent VP shunt performance. This study included 31 patients with spontaneous cerebellar hematoma and concomitant fourth ventricular hemorrhage, who did not undergo a surgical evacuation of hematoma. We divided this population into two groups; the VP shunt group, and the non-VP shunt group. The demographic data, radiologic findings, and clinical factors were compared in each group. The location of the hematoma (whether occupying the cerebellar hemisphere or the vermis) and the degree of the fourth ventricular obstruction were graded respectively. The intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) score was used to assess the IVH severity. Ten out of 31 patients underwent VP shunt operations. The midline location of cerebellar hematoma, the grade of fourth ventricle obstruction, and IVH severity were significantly correlated with that of VP shunt operation (p=0.015, p=0.013, p=0.028). The significant variables into a logistic regression multivariate model resulted in statistical significance for the location of cerebellar hemorrhage [p=0.05; odds ratio (OR), 8.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00 to 67.0], the grade of fourth ventricle obstruction (p=0.044; OR, 19.26; 95% CI, 1.07 to 346.6). The location of the cerebellar hematoma on CT scans and the degree of fourth ventricle obstruction by IVH were useful signs for the selection of VP shunt operation in patients with spontaneous cerebellar hematoma and concomitant acute hydrocephalus. ","1297":"In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the risk factors for seizure and the effect of prophylactic anticonvulsants are not well known. This study aimed to determine the risk factor for seizures and the role for prophylactic anticonvulsants after spontaneous ICH. Between 2005 and 2010, 263 consecutive patients with spontaneous ICH were retrospectively assessed with a mean follow-up of 19.5 months using medical records, updated clinical information and, when necessary, direct patient contact. The seizures were classified as early (within 1 week of ICH) or late (more than 1 week after ICH). The outcomes were measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale at discharge and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at both 2 weeks and discharge. Twenty-two patients (8.4%; 9 patients with early seizures and 13 patients with late seizures) developed seizures after spontaneous ICH. Out of 263 patients, prophylactic anticonvulsants were administered in 216 patients. The prophylactic anticonvulsants were not associated with a reduced risk of early (p=0.094) or late seizures (p=0.326). Instead, the factors associated with early seizure were cortical involvement (p&lt;0.001) and younger age (60 years or less) (p=0.046). The risk of late seizure was increased by cortical involvement (p&lt;0.001) and communicating hydrocephalus (p=0.004). The prophylactic anticonvulsants were associated with a worse mRS at 2 weeks (p=0.024) and at last follow-up (p=0.034). Cortical involvement may be a factor for provoked seizures. Although the incidence of early seizures tended to decrease in patients prescribed prophylactic anticonvulsants, no statistical difference was found.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of delayed cranirve ( VI, VII, and VIII ) palsy following MVD and its clinical courses. Between January 1998 and December 2009, 1354 patients underwent MVD for HFS at our institution. Of them, 100 patients (7.4%) experienced delayed facial palsy (DFP), one developed sixth nerve palsy, and one patient had delayed hearing loss. DFP occurred between postoperative day number 2 and 23 (average 11 days). Ninety-two patients (92%) completely recovered; however, House-Brackmann grade II facial weakness remained in eight other patients (8%). The time to recovery averaged 64 days (range, 16 days to 9 months). Delayed isolated sixth nerve palsy recovered spontaneously without any medical or surgical treatment after 8 weeks, while delayed hearing loss did not improve. Delayed cranial nerve (VI, VII, and VIII) palsies can occur following uncomplicated MVD for HFS. DFP is not an unusual complication after MVD, and prognosis is fairly good. Delayed sixth nerve palsy and delayed hearing loss are extremely rare complications after MVD for HFS. We should consider the possibility of development of these complications during the follow up for MVD.

After 3 months of metronidazole administration, the patient complained of dysarthria, tingling sense of all extremities, and left hemiparesis. MRI revealed symmetric hyperintensity lesions in medulla, pons, dentate nuclei of cerebellum, and splenium of corpus callosum, all of which represent typical findings of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy. In addition, asymmetric lesions in midbrain, thalamus, putamen and cerebral subcortical white matter were noted. The patient recovered after discontinuation of metronidazole and the remaining abscess was successfully treated with meropenem and levofloxacine.","1304":"A 31-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to hydrocephalus with neurosarcoidosis. Ventriculo-peritoneal shunting was performed in the right lateral ventricle with intravenous methylprednisolone. Subsequently, after 4 months, additional ventriculo-peritoneal shunting in the left lateral ventricle was performed due to the enlarged left lateral ventricle and slit-like right lateral ventricle. After 6 months, he was re-admitted due to upward gaze palsy, and magnetic resonance image showed an isolated fourth ventricle with both the inlet and outlet of fourth ventricle obstructed by recurrent neurosarcoidosis. Owing to the difficulty of using an endoscope, we performed neuronavigator-guided ventriculo-peritoneal shunting via the left lateral transcerebellar approach for the treatment of the isolated fourth ventricle with intravenous methyl prednisolone. The patient was discharged with improved neurological status.","1305":"Traumatic brachial plexus injuries can be devastating, causing partial to total denervation of the muscles of the upper extremities. Surgical reconstruction can restore motor and\/or sensory function following nerve injuries. Direct nerve-to-nerve transfers can provide a closer nerve source to the target muscle, thereby enhancing the quality and rate of recovery. Restoration of elbow flexion is the primary goal for patients with brachial plexus injuries. A 4-year-old right-hand-dominant male sustained a fracture of the left scapula in a car accident. He was treated conservatively. After the accident, he presented with motor weakness of the left upper extremity. Shoulder abduction was grade 3 and elbow flexor was grade 0. Hand function was intact. Nerve conduction studies and an electromyogram were performed, which revealed left lateral and posterior cord brachial plexopathy with axonotmesis. He was admitted to Rehabilitation Medicine and treated. However, marked neurological dysfunction in the left upper extremity was still observed. Six months after trauma, under general anesthesia with the patient in the supine position, the brachial plexus was explored through infraclavicular and supraclavicular incisions. Each terminal branch was confirmed by electrophysiology. Avulsion of the C5 roots and absence of usable stump proximally were confirmed intraoperatively. Under a microscope, neurotization from the musculocutaneous nerve to two medial pectoral nerves was performed with nylon 8-0. Physical treatment and electrostimulation started 2 weeks postoperatively. At a 3-month postoperative visit, evidence of reinnervation of the elbow flexors was observed. At his last follow-up, 2 years following trauma, the patient had recovered Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 4+ elbow flexors. We propose that neurotization from medial pectoral nerves to musculocutaneous nerve can be used successfully to restore elbow flexion in patients with brachial plexus injuries.","1306":"Injury to the bilateral internal branch of superior laryngeal nerve (ibSLN) brings on an impairment of the laryngeal cough reflex that could potentially result in aspiration pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses. We describe a patient with traumatic cervical injury who underwent bilateral ibSLN palsy after anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF). An 75-year-old man visited with cervical spine fracture and he underwent ACDF through a right side approach. During the post-operative days, he complained of high pitched tone defect, and occasional coughing during meals. With a suspicion of SLN injury and for the work up for the cause of aspiration, we performed several studies. According to the study results, he was diagnosed as right SLN and left ibSLN palsy. We managed him for protecting from silent aspiration. Swallowing study was repeated and no evidence of aspiration was found. The patient was discharged with incomplete recovery of a high pitched tone and improved state of neurologic status. The SLN is an important structure; therefore, spine surgeons need to be concerned and be cautious about SLN injury during high cervical neck dissection, especially around the level of C3-C4 and a suspicious condition of a contralateral nerve injury.","1307":"The experience of pediatric deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) in the treatment of early-onset DYT1 generalized dystonia is still limited. Here, we report the surgical experience of bilateral GPi-DBS under general anesthesia by using microelectrode recording in a 7-year-old girl with early-onset DYT1 generalized dystonia. Excellent improvement of her dystonia without neurological complications was achieved. This case report demonstrates that GPi-DBS is an effective and safe method for the treatment of medically refractory early-onset DYT1 generalized dystonia in children.","1308":"Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts usually cause symptoms related to spinal cord or nerve root compression. Here, we report an atypical presentation of a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst combined with congenital hemivertebra which was presented as a retroperitoneal mass that exerted mass effects to the abdominal organs. On image studies, the communication between the cystic pedicle and the spinal arachnoid space was indistinct. Based on our experience and the literature of the pathogenesis, we planned anterior approach for removal of the arachnoid cyst in order to focus on mass removal rather than ligation of the fistulous channel. In our estimation this was feasible considering radiologic findings and also essential for the symptom relief. The cyst was totally removed with the clogged 'thecal sac-side' end of the cystic pedicle. The patient was free of abdominal discomfort by one month after the surgery.","1309":"Intracranial hypotension syndrome typically occurs spontaneously or iatrogenically. It can be associated with headache, drowsy mentality and intracranial heamorrhage. Iatrogenic intracranial hypotension can occur due to dural pucture, trauma and spine surgery. Treatment may include conservative therapy and operation. We report a case of a 54-year-old man who was successfully treated with epidural blood patches for intracranial hypotension due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage into the lumbosacral area after spine surgery.","1310":null,"1311":"Intracranial extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is extremely rare, with only seven patients previously reported. We present a case report of a 21-year-old woman admitted for weakness in her right extremities and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hydrocephalus and a well-enhanced large mass around her left thalamus. A left parietal craniotomy and a cortisectomy at the superior parietal lobule were performed. Total surgical resection was also performed, and pathology results confirmed an extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. Postoperative MRI showed no residual tumor, and the patient underwent radiotherapy. After six months of radiotherapy, the patient's headache and weakness had improved to grade IV. This malignant tumor showed high rates of recurrence in previous reports. We here report another occurrence of this highly malignant and rare tumor in a patient treated using total surgical excision and adjuvant radiotherapy.","1312":"It is well known that spontaneous thrombosis in giant cerebral aneurysm is common. However, spontaneous obliteration of a non-giant and unruptured cerebral aneurysm has been reported to be rare and its pathogenic mechanism is not clear. We describe a case with rare vascular phenomenon and review the relevant literatures.","1313":"The anterior choroidal artery has several kinds of variations. Among them, the transposition of anterior choroidal artery and posterior communicating artery origins has been extremely rare. We report a case with cerebral aneurysm arising from posterior communicating artery which origin was distal to the anterior choroidal artery and review the relevant literature.","1314":"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a typical disease that is encountered frequently in neurosurgical practice. The medications which could cause coagulopathies were known as one of the risk factors of CSDH, such as anticoagulants (ACs) and antiplatelet agents (APs). Recently, the number of patients who are treated with ACs\/APs is increasing, especially in the elderly population. With widespread use of these drugs, there is a need to study the changes in risk factors of CSDH patients. We retrospectively reviewed 290 CSDH patients who underwent surgery at our institute between 1996 and 2010. We classified them into three groups according to the time of presentation (Group A : the remote period group, 1996-2000, Group B : the past period group, 2001-2005, and Group C : the recent period group, 2006-2010). Also, we performed the comparative analysis of independent risk factors between three groups. Among the 290 patients, Group A included 71 patients (24.5%), Group B included 98 patients (33.8%) and Group C included 121 patients (41.7%). Three patients (4.2%) in Group A had a history of receiving ACs\/APs, 8 patients (8.2%) in Group B, and 19 patients (15.7%) in Group C. Other factors such as head trauma, alcoholism, epilepsy, previous neurosurgery and underlying disease having bleeding tendency were also evaluated. In ACs\/APs related cause of CSDH in Group C, significantly less proportion of the patients are associated with trauma or alcohol compared to the non-medication group. In this study, the authors concluded that ACs\/APs have more importance as a risk factor of CSDH in the recent period compared to the past. Therefore, doctors should prescribe these medications carefully balancing the potential risk and benefit. ","1315":"Chronic neck or back pain can be managed with various procedures. Although these procedures are usually well-tolerated, a variety of side effects have been reported. In this study we reviewed cases of unexpected temporary adverse events after blocks and suggest possible causes. We reviewed the records of patients treated with spinal pain blocks between December 2009 and January 2011. The types of blocks performed were medial branch blocks, interlaminar epidural blocks and transforaminal epidural blocks. During the first eight months of the study period (Group A), 2% mepivacaine HCL and triamcinolone was used, and during the last six months of the study period (Group B), mepivacaine was diluted to 1% with normal saline. There were 704 procedures in 613 patients. Ten patients had 12 transient neurologic events. Nine patients were in Group A and one was in Group B. Transient complications occurred in four patients after cervical block and in eight patients after lumbar block. Side effects of lumbar spine blocks were associated with the concentration of mepivacaine (p&lt;0.05). The likely causes were a high concentration of mepivacaine in five patients, inadvertent vascular injection in three patients, intrathecal leak of local anesthetics in one, and underlying conversion disorder in one. Spinal pain blocks are a good option for relieving pain, but clinicians should always keep in mind the potential for development of inevitable complications. Careful history-taking, appropriate selection of the anesthetics, and using real-time fluoroscopy could help reduce the occurrence of adverse events. ","1316":"Spinal cord hemangioblastomas are rare tumors. Despite their benign, slow-growing nature, they can cause severe neurological consequences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate variable factors, including clinical features, tumor findings, the extent of resection, and its recurrence or progression, which determine postoperative functional outcomes. This study included sixteen patients at our institute who underwent microsurgical resection for sporadic spinal intramedullary hemangioblastomas and spinal intramedullary hemangioblastomas associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, between June 2003 and March 2012. A total of 30 operations were performed. Total resection (TR) of the tumor was achieved in 10 patients, and subtotal resection (STR) was achieved in 6. Postoperatively, the initial presenting symptoms were improved in 18.7% of the patients and were unchanged in 56.3%, but 25% were worse. Stable postoperative neurological functions were found in 83% of patients with preoperative McCormick grade I, and TR was achieved in 75% of these patients. In the STR group, poorer neurological status was observed in one patient, despite multiple operations. There were no poorer outcomes in the four cases of VHL disease. Various factors were analyzed, but only a correlation between the pre- and postoperative neurological status was verified in the TR-group patients. Preoperative focal neurological impairment and meticulous microsurgical manipulation may be predictors of favorable outcomes for solitary hemangioblastomas. In addition, the preservation of function is more important than the extent of resection in VHL disease. ","1317":"There were previous reports of redundant nerve roots (RNRs) focused on their clinical significance and pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the significant radiologic findings that correlate with RNRs occurrence. These relations would provide an advanced clue for clinical significance and pathogenesis of RNRs. Retrospective research was performed with data from 126 patients who underwent surgery for central lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Finally, 106 patients with common denominators (inter-observer accuracy : 84%) were included on this study. We divided the patients into two groups by MRI, patients with RNRs and those with no RNRs (NRNRs). Comparative analyses were performed with clinical and radiologic parameters. RNRs were found in 45 patients (42%) with central LSS. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in severity of symptoms. On the other hand, we found statistically significant differences in duration of symptom and number of level included (p&lt;0.05). In the maximal stenotic level, ligamentum flavum (LF) thickness, LF cross-sectional area (CSA), dural sac CSA, and segmental angulation are significantly different in RNRs group compared to NRNRs group (p&lt;0.05). RNRs patients showed clinically longer duration of symptoms and multiple levels included. We also confirmed that wide segmental angulation and LF hypertrophy play a major role of the development of RNRs in central LSS. Together, our results suggest that wide motion in long period contribute to LF hypertrophy, and it might be the key factor of RNRs formation in central LSS. ","1318":"This retrospective study aimed to compare clinical outcomes in terms of pain relief and recurrence rate between fragmentectomies and conventional microdiscectomies in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Between January 2008 and May 2011, a total of 175 patients met the inclusion criteria of this study. The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of back and radicular pains were recorded before surgery, 2 and 6 weeks after surgery. Recurrence was defined when a patient had the same pattern of preoperative symptoms and was confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging. Seventy-four patients (42.3%) were suitable for fragmentectomy, and 101 patients underwent conventional microdiscectomy. There were no significant differences in VAS scores between the fragmentectomy and conventional microdiscectomy groups 2 and 6 weeks after surgery. During the follow-up period, 3 patients (4.05%) in the fragmentectomy group and 7 patients (6.93%) in the conventional microdiscectomy group relapsed. If patients are selected according to well-defined criteria, fragmentectomy can be a good surgical option for LDH, in the physiological aspect of preserving healthy intervertebral disc materials. ","1319":null,"1320":"The sub-axial injury classification (SLIC) and severity scale was developed to decide whether to operate the cervical injured patient or not, but the reliability of SLIC and severity scale among the different physicians was not well known. Therefore, we evaluated the reliability of SLIC among a spine surgeon, a resident of neurosurgery and a neuro-radiologist. In retrograde review in single hospital from 2002 to 2009 years, 75 cases of sub-axial spine injured patients underwent operation. Each case was blindly reviewed for the SLIC and severity scale by 3 different observers by two times with 4 weeks interval with randomly allocated. The compared axis was the injury morphology score, the disco-ligamentous complex score, the neurological status score and total SLIC score; the neurological status score was derived from the review of medical record. The kappa value was used for the statistical analysis. Interobserver agreement of SLIC and severity scale was substantial agreement in the score of injury morphology [intraclass correlation (ICC)=0.603] and total SLIC and severity sacle (ICC value=0.775), but was fair agreement in the disco-ligamentous complex score (ICC value=0.304). Intraobserver agreements were almost perfect agreement in whole scales with ICC of 0.974 in a spine surgeon, 0.948 in a resident of neurosurgery, and 0.963 in a neuro-radiologist. The SLIC and severity scale is comprehensive and easily applicable tool in spine injured patient. Moreover, it is very useful tool to communicate among spine surgeons, residents of neurosurgery and neuro-radiologists with sufficient reproducibility.

We retrospectively analyzed 27 patients who had undergone surgical resection (SR) and 156 patients with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) as an initial treatment for their PBM from breast cancer in our institution and compared the difference of incidence of LMC according to clinical factors. The diagnosis of LMC was made by cerebrospinal fluid cytology and\/or magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 27 patients (14%) in the study population developed LMC at a median of 6.0 months (range, 1.0-50). Ten of 27 patients (37%) developed LMC after SR, whereas 17 of 156 (11%) patients who received WBRT were diagnosed with LMC after the index procedure. The incidence of LMC was significantly higher in the SR group compared with the WBRT group and the hazard ratio was 2.95 (95% confidence interval; 1.33-6.54, p&lt;0.01). Three additional factors were identified in the multivariable analysis : the younger age group (&lt;40 years old), the progressing systemic disease showed significantly increased incidence of LMC, whereas the adjuvant chemotherapy reduce the incidence. There is an increased risk of LMC after SR for PBM from breast cancer compared with WBRT. The young age (&lt;40) and systemic burden of cancer in terms of progressing systemic disease without adjuvant chemotherapy could be additional risk factors for the development of LMC. ","1322":"Stent-assisted coiling on intracranial aneurysm has been considered as an effective technique and has made the complex aneurysms amenable to coiling. To achieve reconstruction of intracranial vessels with preservation of parent artery the use of stents has the greatest potential for assisted coiling. We report the results of our experiences in ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms using Y-stent coiling. From October 2003 to October 2011, 12 patients (3 men, 9 women; mean age, 62.6) harboring 12 complex ruptured aneurysms (3 middle cerebral artery, 9 basilar tip) were treated by Y-stent coiling by using self-expandable intracranial stents. Procedural complications, clinical outcome, and initial and midterm angiographic results were evaluated. The definition of broad-necked aneurysm is neck diameter over than 4 mm or an aneurysm with a neck diameter smaller than 4 mm in which the dome\/neck ratio was less than 2. In all patients, the aneurysm was successfully occluded with no apparent procedure-related complication. There was no evidence of thromboembolic complication, arterial dissection and spasm during procedure. Follow-up studies showed stable and complete occlusion of the aneurysm in all patients with no neurologic deficits. The present study did show that the Y-stent coiling seemed to facilitate endovascular treatment of ruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. More clinical data with longer follow-up are needed to establish the role of Y-stent coiling in ruptured aneurysms. ","1323":"Even in the patients with neurologically good outcome after intracranial aneurysm surgery, their perception of health is an important outcome issue. This study aimed to investigate the quality of life (QOL) and its predictors of patients who had a good outcome following anterior circulation aneurysm surgery as using the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument-Korean version. We treated 280 patients with 290 intracranial aneurysms for 2 years. This questionnaire was taken and validated by 99 patients whose Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 4 and more and Global deterioration scale 3 and less at 6 months after the operation, and 85 normal persons. Each domain and facet was compared between the two groups, and a subgroup analysis was performed on the QOL values and hospital expenses of the aneurysm patients according to the type of craniotomy, approach, bleeding of the aneurysm and brain injury. Aneurysm patients showed a lower quality of life compared with control patients in level of independence, psychological, environmental, and spiritual domains. In the environmental domain, there were significant intergroup differences according to the type of craniotomy and the surgical approach used on the patients (p&lt;0.05). The hospital charges were also significantly different according to the type of craniotomy (p&lt;0.05). Despite good neurological status, patients surgically treated for anterior circulation aneurysm have a low quality of life. The craniotomy size may affect the QOL of patients who underwent an anterior circulation aneurysm surgery and exhibited a good outcome. ","1324":"The aim of this study was to determine the role of intra-arterial (IA) nimodipine injections for cerebral vasospasm secondary to ruptured subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and to investigate the factors that influence vasodilation and clinical outcomes. We enrolled 29 patients who underwent aneurysm clipping for ruptured cerebral aneurysms between 2009 and 2011, and who received IA nimodipine after subsequently presenting with symptomatic vasospasm. The degree of vasodilation shown in angiography was measured, and the correlation between the degree of vasodilation and both the interval from SAH to cerebral vasospasm and the interval from clipping to cerebral vasospasm was determined. The change in blood flow rate after IA injection was assessed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Multiple clinical parameters were completed before and after IA nimodipine injection to evaluate any improvements in clinical symptoms. For eight patients, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores increased by two or more points. The regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the change in GCS scores after IA nimodipine injection and the change in blood vessel diameter (p=0.025). A positive correlation was also observed between the interval from SAH to vasospasm and the change in diameter (p=0.040); and the interval from clipping to vasospasm and the change in diameter (p=0.022). IA nimodipine injection for SAH-induced vasospasm led to significant vasodilation in angiography and improvement in clinical symptoms without significant complications. Our findings suggest that IA nimodipine injection should be utilized when intractable vasospasm develops despite rigorous conservative management.

We retrospectively investigated 1459 patients who underwent surgery and endovascular treatment for ruptured cerebral aneurysms from June 1992 to December 2010 and compared clinical characteristics. We also reviewed pre-existing medical conditions and perioperative complications. Among 1459 patients, there were 21 patients (1.44%) in the third decade and 104 patients (7.13%) in the fourth decade of life. Within two age groups, 88 (70.4%) were male and 37 (29.6%) were female, a ratio of 2.37 : 1. In both groups, we observed the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysm with the most frequency (p=0.028). In general, favorable outcome was achieved in both age groups (90.5% and 81.7%, respectively). An initial univariate analysis showed Hunt-Hess grade, Fisher grade, location of aneurysm, and rebleeding significantly associated with outcome after aneurysm rupture. Further, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only Hunt-Hess grade (grade 4-5) was a risk factor for the outcome (odds ratio=9.730, 95% confidence interval 2.069-45.756, p=0.004). The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was higher in the male population of the third and fourth decades of life. Aneurysms on the ACA were most frequently occurred in both age groups and the outcome of aneurysmal SAH among the third and fourth decades was favorable. Multivariate analysis revealed that high Hunt-Hess grade was a risk factor for patient's outcome.

In most cases, its etiology is alleged to be trauma to the back and only rarely has a congenital origin been indicated. Furthermore, most reported cases involved adults, the majority of whom were middle-aged. Here, the authors describe the case of the youngest girl reported to date with congenital transverse process bridging. As far as the authors' knowledge, there has been no report of congenital bridging of transverse processes in children or adolescents in Korea.","1328":"Intervertebral intradural lumbar disc herniation (ILDH) is a quite rare pathology, and isolated intradural lumbar disc herniation is even more rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may not be able to reveal ILDHs, especially if MRI findings show an intact lumbar disc annulus and posterior longitudinal ligament. Here, we present an exceedingly rare case of an isolated IDLH that we initially misidentified as a spinal intradural tumor, in a 54-year-old man hospitalized with a 2-month history of back pain and right sciatica. Neurologic examination revealed a positive straight leg raise test on the right side, but he presented no other sensory, motor, or sphincter disturbances. A gadolinium-enhanced MRI revealed what we believed to be an intradural extramedullary tumor compressing the cauda equina leftward in the thecal sac, at the L2 vertebral level. The patient underwent total L2 laminectomy, and we extirpated the intradural mass under microscopic guidance. Histologic examination of the mass revealed a degenerated nucleus pulposus.","1329":"A Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC) is a benign pituitary cyst derived from the remnant of Rathke's pouch, and usually presents as an intrasellar lesion with varying degrees of suprasellar extension.

The patient presented with facial weakness. Initial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the right cerebellopontine angle. A subtotal resection was performed via right retrosigmoid suboccipital approach. Histopathological findings were consistent with an epidermoid tumor. Five months later, the patient underwent gamma knife radiosurgery due to highly probable recurrent epidermoid tumor. Two years after, the patient's neurological deficit had been newly developed, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large contrast-enhancing tumor in the left cerebellopontine angle, which compressed the brainstem. After resection of the tumor, histopathological examinations revealed a squamous cell carcinoma probably arising from an underlying epidermoid cyst. We report a case of an epidermoid tumor in the cerebellopontine angle that transformed into a squamous cell carcinoma.","1331":"Intraventricular cavernous hemangiomas are uncommon. Among them, those occurred at the foramen of Monro in the third ventricle may be of particular interest because of its rarity, development of hydrocephalus, being differentiated from other brain lesions.

Twenty-one patients with consecutive 22 surgeries for primary brachial plexus tumors were enrolled between February 2002 and November 2011 were included in this study. The medical records of all patients were reviewed. Eleven male and 10 female patients were enrolled. Mean age was 39 years. Three patients had brachial plexus tumor associated with neurofibromatosis (13.6%). Presenting signs and symptoms included parenthesis and numbness (54.5%), radiating pain (22.7%), direct tenderness and pain (27.2%), palpable mass (77.3%). Twelve patients presented preoperative sensory deficit (54.5%) and 9 patients presented preoperative motor deficit (40.9%). Twenty tumors (90.9%) were benign and 2 tumors (9.1%) were malignant. Benign tumors included 15 schwannomas (68.2%), 4 neurofibromas (18.2%) and 1 granular cell tumor (4.5%). There were 1 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and 1 malignant granular cell tumor. Gross total resection was achieved in 16 patients (72.7%), including all schwannomas, 1 neurofibroma. Subtotal resection was performed in 6 tumors (27.3%), including 3 neurofibromatosis associated with brachial plexus neurofibromas, 1 MPNST and 2 granular cell tumor in one patient.

The aim of this study was to analyze clinical data and surgical results from symptomatic CSDH patients who underwent TDC with closed-system drainage at the pre-coronal point (PCP). We analyzed data for 134 symptomatic CSDH patients who underwent TDC at the PCP with closed-system drainage. We defined the PCP for TDC to be 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture at the level of superior temporal line. TDC at the PCP with closed-system drainage was selected in patients with CSDH that extended beyond the coronal suture, confirmed by preoperative CT scans. Medical records, radiological findings, and clinical performance were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 134 CSDH patients, 114 (85.1%) showed improved clinical performance and imaging findings after surgery. Catheter failures were seen in two cases (1.4%); the catheters were inserted in the epidural space. Recurrent cases were seen in eight patients (5.6%), and they were improved with a second BHD with a closed-system operation. TDC at the PCP with closed-system drainage is safe and effective for patients with symptomatic CSDH whose hematomas extend beyond the coronal suture.

The authors retrospectively reviewed the imaging findings of 19 patients with an obscure SSBL on MRI at our hospital from January 1994 to April 2011. The 19 patients were divided to benign groups and malignant groups according to final diagnosis. MRI and CT findings were evaluated and the results of additional work-up studies were conducted to achieve a differential diagnosis. At final diagnoses, 10 (52.6%) of the 19 SSBLs were malignant tumors and 9 (47.4%) were benign lesions. The malignant tumors included 6 metastatic cancers, 3 multiple myelomas, and 1 chordoma, and the benign lesions included 4 osteomyelitis, 2 hemangiomas, 2 nonspecific chronic inflammations, and 1 giant cell tumor. No MRI characteristics examined was found to be significantly different in the benign and malignant groups. Reactive sclerotic change was observed by CT in 1 (10.0%) of the 10 malignant lesions and in 7 (77.8%) of the 9 benign lesions (p=0.005). Approximately half of the obscure SSBLs were malignant tumors. CT and MRI findings in combination may aid the differential diagnosis of obscure SSBLs. In particular, sclerotic change on CT images was an important finding implying benign lesion. Finally, we suggest a possible diagnostic strategy for obscure SSBLs on MRI.

We performed this procedure in thirteen patients who had atlantoaxial instabilities and retrospectively evaluated the bone fusion rate and complications. By using this method, we have achieved excellent bone fusion comparing with the result of other methods without any complications related to this procedure.

The spinal nerve injury, violation of the facet joint, vertebral artery injury, and the bicortical purchases were examined at each lateral mass. All thirty-nine patients received instrumentations with poly axial screws and rod systems, in which one hundred and seventy-eight screws in total. No vertebral artery injury or nerve root injury were observed. Sixteen facet joint violations were observed (9.0%). Bicortical purchases were achieved on one hundred and fifty-six (87.6%). Bone fusion was achieved in all patients. The advantages of the Kim's technique are that it is performed by using given anatomical structures and that the complication rate is as low as those of other known techniques.

The patients received fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks and daily temozolomide, followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), response, and safety. A total of 103 patients were enrolled in this study. Ninety-six patients (93%) completed the CCRT and 54 patients (52%) received 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. The response rate was 73% (53\/73) and the tumor control rate was 92% (67\/73). Of the 96 patients who completed the CCRT, the median OS was 18.0 months and the 1- and 2-year OS rates were 74 and 38%, respectively. The median PFS was 10.0 months and the 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 33 and 16%, respectively. The only significant prognostic factor of survival was the extent of surgical resection (p&lt;0.05). CCRT resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxic effects in 8% of patients. No opportunistic infections were noted.

The objective of this study was to investigate the outcome of microvascular decompression (MVD) for HFS caused by VBD. There were 10 patients of HFS caused by VBD at our hospital between September 1978 and September 2008. We evaluated magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and time of flight magnetic resonance imaginge (TOF MRI) findings using the criteria for VBD. We compared the clinical outcomes of MVD for the 10 patients with VBD with the overall outcomes of the total 2058 MVDs performed for HFS. The results of MVD for HFS caused by VBD were successful in 90.9% of cases. The postoperative complication rate in VBD was 45.5%. Offending vessels in patients with VBD were identified visually during surgery. Adverse effects after MVD were found in 4 patients. We found that the diameter of VBD was significantly greater in patients with complications than in those with no complications (p=0.028). Our data shows that MVD may be a good treatment modality for HFS caused by VBD but care must be taken to avoid adverse effects from the procedure.

Enrolled subjects were 41 patients with ruptured MCA aneurysm with ICH who were treated with surgical clipping. Clinical factors such as gender, age, and initial Glasgow coma scale were assessed while radiological factors such as the volume and location of hematoma, the degree of a midline shift, and aneurysm size were considered retrospectively. Prognosis was evaluated postoperatively by Glasgow outcome scale. Age and prognosis were correlated only in the groups with ICH over 31 mL or ICH at the frontal lobe or sylvian fissure. When initial mental status was good, only patients with ICH on the temporal lobe had a better prognosis. If the midline shift was less than 4.5 mm, the probability of better prognosis was 95.5% (21 of 22). If the midline shift was more than 4.5 mm, the probability of poor prognosis was 42.1% (8 of 19). Patients with ICH less than 31 mL had higher survival rates, whereas if the ICH was more than 31 mL, 41.2% (7 of 17) had a poor clinical pathway.

This retrospective analysis was performed in 157 patients diagnosed with aneurysmal SAH from January 2007 to December 2011 at a single center. Seventy patients (44.6%) received a combination treatment of nimodipine with magnesium and 87 patients (55.4%) received only nimodipine. A matched case-control study using propensity scores was conducted and 41 subjects were selected from each group. A dosage of 64 mmol\/day of magnesium was administrated. The infusion of magnesium did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (n=7, 17.1%, p=0.29) compared with simple nimodipine injection (n=11, 26.8%). The ratios of good clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-2) at 6 months were similar, being 78% in the combination treatment group and 80.5% in the nimodipine only group (p=0.79). The proportions of delayed cerebral infarction was not significantly lower in patients with combination treatment (n=2, 4.9% vs. n=3, 7.3%; p=0.64). There was no difference in the serum magnesium concentrations between the patients with symptomatic vasospasm and without vasospasm who had magnesium supplementation.

The patient presented with a two-week history of gradually increasing tingling in her left posterior thigh and calf. A preoperative magnetic resonance image revealed a well-defined intramedullary cystic lesion on the ventral side of the spinal cord at the T11 to T12 levels. The lesion was hyper intense in T2-weighted images and hypointense in T1-weighted. The patient underwent a right-side hemilaminectomy at the T11 to T12 levels and fenestration of the cyst wall. After having the cyst wall partially removed and communication established between the cyst and the subarachnoid space, the patient improved neurologically. A histological study of the surgical specimens revealed that the cyst wall consisted of glial cells lined by a simple cuboidal to columnar epithelium. An immunohistochemical examination of the cells lining the cyst wall was positive for S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, epithelial membrane antigen, and cytokeratin. We suggest that the optimal treatment of intramedullary ependymal cysts creates adequate communication between the cyst and the subarachnoid space.","1345":"The authors report 2 cases of nerve root herniation after discectomy of a large lumbar disc herniation caused by an unrecognized dural tear.

We introduce the concept and technique of a new shunting procedure, syringo-subarachnoid-peritoneal shunt. A 54-year-old patient presented to our hospital with a progressive impairment of motion and position sense on the right side. Sixteen years before this admission, he had been treated by decompressive laminectomy for a burst fracture of L1. On his recent admission, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of the whole spine revealed the presence of a huge syrinx extending from the medulla to the L1 vertebral level. We performed a syringo-subarachnoid-peritoneal shunt, including insertion of a T-tube into the syrinx, subarachnoid space and peritoneal cavity. Clinical manifestations and radiological findings improved after the operation. The syringo-subarachnoid-peritoneal shunt has several advantages. First, fluid can communicate freely between the syrinx, the subarachnoid space, and the peritoneal cavity. Secondly, we can prevent shunt catheter from migrating because dural anchoring of the T-tube is easy. Finally, we can perform shunt revision easily, because only one arm of the T-tube is inserted into the intraspinal syringx cavity. We think that this procedure is the most beneficial method among the various shunting procedures.","1347":"Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) with skull and brain metastases is extremely rare. A 53-year-old patient diagnosed as skull metastasis of ASPS visited our clinic complaining of an outgrowing scalp mass in spite of radiation therapy.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense ovoid mass on the T2-weighted image, an isointense on the T1-weighted image, and a homogeneous enhanced mass with gadolinium. Another small-sized enhanced mass with mild peritumoral swelling was found at the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe. A gross total resection of the skull lesion with cranioplasty was performed for the surgical defect. A histologic examination of the specimens revealed metastatic ASPS involving the skull.

The results of microvascular decompression (MVD) in 37 patients with trigeminal neuralgia were evaluated at 6 months after surgery and were compared with clinical and operative findings. The sex of the patient, the patient's age at surgery, the side of the pain, and the duration of symptoms before surgery did not play any significant roles in prognosis. Also, the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the patient, the duration of each pain attack, and the frequency of pain over 24 hours did not play any significant roles in prognosis. In addition, intraoperative detection of the type of conflicting vessel, the degree of severity of conflict, and the location of the conflict around the circumference of the root did not play any roles in prognosis. The only factors affecting the prognosis in MVD surgery were intraoperative detection of the site of the conflict along the root and neuroradiological compression signs on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These findings demonstrated that if neurovascular compression is seen on preoperative MRI\/MRA and\/or compression is found intraoperative at the root entry zone, then the patient will most likely benefit from MVD surgery.

Allodynia was induced by administering 35% v\/v ethanol (10 g\/kg; oral gavage) to Spraue-Dawley rats for 8 weeks. Rolipram and saline (vehicle) were administered intraperitoneally. Mechanical allodynia was measured by using von Frey filaments. Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) was proposed as complementary measure to assess the integrity of nerve pathway.

Although WHO grade II meningiomas are rare (2-10%), WHO grade II meningiomas have higher recurrence and mortality rates than benign. We evaluated the patient recurrence rate and investigated the prognostic factors of WHO grade II meningiomas. Between 1993 and 2005, 55 patients were diagnosed with WHO grade II meningiomas in our hospital. WHO grade II meningiomas (n=55) were compared with other WHO grades meningiomas (I, n=373; and III, n=20). The patients had a median age of 48.4 years (range, 14-17 years), a male-to-female ratio of 26 : 29, and a mean follow-up time of 45 months (range, 3-175 months). In WHO grade II meningiomas, only the extent of resection was a significant prognostic factor. Post-operative radiotherapy had no significant influence on tumor recurrence (p=0.053). The relative risk of recurrence was significantly higher in WHO grade II meningiomas with incomplete resection (10\/27, RR=37%) than in WHO grade II meningiomas with complete resection (4\/28, RR=14%) regardless of post-operative radiotherapy. In the incomplete resection group, Simpson grade III or IV had a significantly high risk of recurrence regardless of post-operative RT (n=3, RR=100%) However, if the degree of resection was Simpson grade II, the recurrence rate was similar to the complete resection group even though post-operative RT was not performed. Complete resection was the most powerful independent predictive factor of the recurrence rate in WHO grade II meningiomas. Post-operative adjuvant RT was not a significant factor in this study.

Serum biochemical markers of bone turnover including osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which are sensitive biochemical markers of bone formation, and the telopeptide fragment of type I collagen C-terminus (CTX), which is a sensitive biochemical marker of bone resorption, were analyzed. Bone histomorphometric parameters of the 4th lumbar vertebrae and femur were determined by micro-computed tomography. Ovariectomized rats were found to have higher osteocalcin, ALP and CTX levels than sham controls. Additionally, 8 weeks after ovariectomy in the OVX group, serum levels of osteocalcin, ALP and CTX were significantly higher than those of 4 weeks after ovariectomy. Bone loss after ovariectomy was more extensive in the 4th lumbar spine compared to the femur. Bone loss in the 4th lumbar spine was mainly caused by trabecular thinning, but in the femur, it was mainly caused by trabecular elimination. The present study demonstrates different patterns of bone loss between the 4th lumbar spine and the femur in ovariectomized rats. Therefore, when considering animal models of osteoporosis, it is important that bone sites should be taken into account. ","1358":"There has been no report of bilateral pedicle stress fractures involving two vertebrae. The authors describe a unique case of spondylolisthesis accompanying a bilateral pedicle stress fracture involving two vertebrae. De novo development of spondylolisthesis at the L5-S1 vertebrae accompanying a bilateral pedicle stress fracture at L4 and L5 was observed in a 70-year-old woman. The patient's medical history was unremarkable and she did not have any predisposing factors except severe osteoporosis. Interbody fusion with bone cement augmented screw fixation was performed. Surgical treatment resulted in good pain management and improved functional recovery.","1359":"Spinal epidural abscess, if especially caused by Brucellosis is a very rare disease which is usually a consequence of spondylodiscitis. The spinal column can be affected at any joint; however, the lumbar spine is the most common region, especially at the level of the L4-5 and L5-S1. The frequency of spinal involvement usually seen at the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine respectively. As an occupational disease in farmers, veterinaries, butchers, laboratory staff and shepherds, brucellosis can also occur by direct contact to animals and infected materials or ingestion of raw cheese, milk or unpasteurized milk products. In this study, we presented two cases with cervical spinal epidural abscess caused by brucella melitensis, which was successfully treated by surgical approach. Initial treatment was combined with antibiotic therapy after the surgery for 3 months.","1360":"Bacterial meningitis is rarely complicated by an intradural spinal abscess, and recurrent meningitis is an uncommon presentation of a spinal intramedullary abscess. Here, we report a 63-year-old patient with recurrent meningitis as the first manifestation of an underlying spinal intramedullary abscess. To the best of our knowledge, no previous report has been issued on recurrent meningitis accompanied by a spinal intramedullary abscess in an adult. In this article, the pathophysiological mechanism of this uncommon entity is discussed and the relevant literature reviewed.","1361":"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is one of the most common lymphomas and accounts for about 7% of all newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The clinical course of MALT lymphoma is relatively indolent and, in the majority of cases (50%), the lymphoma arises within the stomach. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), an uncommon variant of extranodal NHL, can affect any part of the neuraxis, including the eyes, brain, leptomeninges, or spinal cord. Herein, we present a rare case of PCNSL, which occurred one year after radiochemotherapy of gastric MALT lymphoma. A 62-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of left facial palsy. One year ago, he underwent antibiotic eradication therapy of Helicobacter pylori, local stomach fractional radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for gastric MALT lymphoma. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a strong enhancing solid mass in the right frontal lobe. The tumor was completely removed, and the histological diagnosis of PCNSL developing from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was made. Although elucidating the correlation between the first gastric MALT lymphoma and the second PCNSL seemed difficult, we have postulated and discussed some possible pathogeneses, together with a review of literature.","1362":"Endovascular embolization is being increasingly used to treat intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). However, we experienced two patients with retained microcatheters after AVM embolization using Onyx.","1363":"The intracranial stent functions primarily to prevent protrusion of coils into the parent vessel during the embolization of wide-necked cerebral aneurysms and might also reduce aneurysm recanalization rate. In spite of these advantages, little is known about the long-term interaction of the stent with the parent vessel wall. We present a rare case of severe in-stent stenosis occurring as a delayed complication of Neuroform stent-assisted coil embolization of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm.","1364":"Terson syndrome was originally used to describe a vitreous hemorrhage arising from aneurysmal subrarachnoid hemorrhage. Terson syndrome can be caused by intracranial hemorrhage, subdural or epidural hematoma and severe brain injury but is extremely rare in intraventricular hemorrhage associated with moyamoya disease. A 41-year-old man presented with left visual disturbance. He had a history of intraventicular hemorrhage associated with moyamoya disease three months prior to admission. At that time he was in comatose mentality. Ophthalmologic examination at our hospital detected a vitreous hemorrhage in his left eye, with right eye remaining normal. Vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane removal was performed. After operation his left visual acuity was recovered. Careful ophthalmologic examination is mandatory in patients with hemorrhagic moyamoya disease.","1365":"Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a syndrome of pain and\/or dysesthesia in the anterolateral thigh that is caused by an entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) at its pelvic exit. Despite early accounts of MP, there is still no consensus concerning the effectiveness of neurolysis or transaction treatments in the long-term relief for medically refractory patients with MP. We retrospectively analyzed available long-term results of LFCN neurolysis for medically refractory MP in an effort to clarify this issue. During the last 7 years, 11 patients who had neurolysis for MP were enrolled in this study. Nerve entrapment was confirmed preoperatively by electrophysiological studies or a positive response to local anesthetic injection. Decompression of the LFCN was performed at the level of the iliac fascia, inguinal ligament, and fascia of the thigh distally. The outcome of surgery was assessed 8 weeks after the procedure followed at regular intervals if symptoms persisted. Twelve decompression procedures were performed in 11 patients over a 7-year period. The average duration of symptoms was 8.5 months (range, 4-15 months). The average follow-up period was 33 months (range, 12-60 months). Complete and partial symptom improvement were noted in nine (81.8%) and two (18.2%) cases, respectively. No recurrence was reported. Neurolysis of the LFCN can provide adequate pain relief with minimal complications for medically refractory MP. To achieve a good outcome in neurolysis for MP, an accurate diagnosis with careful examination and repeated blocks of the LFCN, along with electrodiagnosis seems to be essential. Possible variation in the course of the LFCN and thorough decompression along the course of the LFCN should be kept in mind in planning decompression surgery for MP. ","1366":null,"1367":"Life expectancy for humans has increased dramatically and with this there has been a considerable increase in the number of patients suffering from lumbar spine disease. Symptomatic lumbar spinal disease should be treated, even in the elderly, and surgical procedures such as fusion surgery are needed for moderate to severe lumbar spinal disease. However, various perioperative complications are associated with fusion surgery. The aim of this study was to examine perioperative complications and assess risk factors associated with lumbar spinal fusion, focusing on geriatric patients at least 70 years of age in the Republic of Korea. We retrospectively investigated 489 patients with various lumbar spinal diseases who underwent lumbar spinal fusion surgery between 2003 and 2007 at our institution. Three fusion procedures and the number of fused segments were analyzed in this study. Chronic diseases were also evaluated. Risk factors for complications and their association with age were analyzed. In this study, 74 patients experienced complications (15%). The rate of perioperative complications was significantly higher in patients 70 years of age or older than in other age groups (univariate analysis, p=0.001; multivariate analysis, p=0.004). However, perioperative complications were not significantly associated with the other factors tested (sex, comorbidities, operation procedures, fusion segments involved). Increasing age was an important risk factor for perioperative complications in patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery whereas other factors were not significant. We recommend good clinical judgment and careful selection of geriatric patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery. ","1368":"Pedicle-based dynamic stabilization systems, in which semi-rigid rods or cords are used to restrict or control spinal segmental motion, aim to reduce or eliminate the drawbacks associated with rigid fusion. In this study, we analyzed the two-year clinical outcomes of patients treated with the NFlex (Synthes Spine, Inc.), a pedicle-based dynamic stabilization system. Five sites participated in a retrospective study of 72 consecutive patients who underwent NFlex stabilization. Of these 72 patients, 65 were available for 2-year follow-up. Patients were included based on the presence of degenerative disc disease (29 patients), degenerative spondylolisthesis (16 patients), lumbar stenosis (9 patients), adjacent segment degeneration (6 patients), and degenerative lumbar scoliosis (5 patients). The clinical outcome measures at each assessment were Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure back pain, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to measure functional status. Radiographic assessments included evidence of instrumentation failure or screw loosening. Sixty-five patients (26 men and 39 women) with a mean age of 54.5 years were included. Mean follow-up was 25.6 months. The mean VAS score improved from 8.1 preoperatively to 3.8 postoperatively, representing a 53% improvement, and the ODI score from 44.5 to 21.8, representing a 51% improvement. Improvements in pain and disability scores were statistically significant. Three implant-related complications were observed. Posterior pedicle-based dynamic stabilization using the NFlex system seems effective in improving pain and functional scores, with sustained clinical improvement after two years. With appropriate patient selection, it may be considered an effective alternative to rigid fusion. ","1369":null,"1370":"The lateral supraorbital (LSO) approach is a modified method of the classic pterional approach and it has advantages of short skin incision and small craniotomy compared with the pterional approach. This study was designed to compare the two approaches in the surgical treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. We retrospectively reviewed 122 patients with 137 unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated by clipping, from July 2009 to April 2011. Between August 2010 and April 2011, 61 patients were treated by clipping via the lateral supraorbital approach and the same number of patients treated by clipping via the pterional approach were retrospectively enrolled. We analyzed the two groups and compared demographic, radiologic and clinical variables. The mean age of patients in the two groups was 54.6 years (LSO group) and 55.7 years (Pterion group). The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter in the LSO group than in the Pterion group (7.9 days vs. 9.0 days, p=0.125) and the mean operation time was also significantly shorter in the LSO group (117.1 minutes vs. 164.3 minutes, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the mean craniotomy area was much smaller in the LSO group (1275.4 mm(2) vs. 2858.9 mm(2), p&lt;0.001). The two groups showed similar distributions of aneurysm location and postoperative complications. The lateral supraorbital approach for the clipping of unruptured intracranial aneurysm could be a good alternative to the classic pterional approach. ","1371":null,"1372":"The purpose of this study was to verify the appropriateness of ovariectomized rats as the osteoporosis animal model. Twelve female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a sham operation (the sham group) or bilateral ovariectomy [the ovariectomy (OVX) group]. Eight weeks after operations, serum biochemical markers of bone turnover were analyzed; osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, which are sensitive biochemical markers of bone formation, and C-terminal telopeptide fragment of type I collagen C-terminus (CTX), which is a sensitive biochemical marker of bone resorption. Bone histomorphometric parameters and microarchitectural properties of 4th lumbar vertebrae were determined by micro-computed tomographic (CT) scan. The OVX group showed on average 75.4% higher osteocalcin and 72.5% higher CTX levels than the sham group, indicating increased bone turnover. Micro-CT analysis showed significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) (p=0.005) and cortical BMD (p=0.021) in the OVX group. Furthermore, the OVX group was found to have a significantly lower trabecular bone volume fraction (p=0.002). Our results showed that bone turnover was significantly increased and bone mass was significantly decreased 8 weeks after ovariectomy in rats. Thus, we propose that the ovariectomized rat model be considered a reproducible and reliable model of osteoporosis. ","1373":"A 24-year-old man presented with mental change, fever, abdominal pain, tenderness and palpable mass on the lower abdomen. He was a non-Korean engineer and did not accompany a legal guardian, so medical history taking was difficult due to his mental status. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple rim-enhanced lesions of the brain, and abdominal computed tomography showed huge paraspinal abscess. Chest X-ray and computed tomography showed poorly defined nodular opacities. We initially thought that this patient was infected with toxoplasmosis with typical cerebral image finding and immunoglobulin laboratory finding of cerebrospinal fluid and serum study. The abdominal abscess was confirmed as tuberculosis through the pathologic finding of caseous necrosis. We used anti-tuberculosis medication and anti-toxoplasmosis medication for almost 4 months, and then his clinical state and radiological findings were considerably improved.","1374":"We report magnetic resonance image (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) findings in a patient of cerebral fat embolism (CFE) occurred in a 26-year-old woman after an autologous fat injection into the face. After initial neurologic symptom onset, MRI and MRS data were obtained two times to investigate repeated CFE. We obtained the MRS data in the two different time intervals and two different echo times to compare the lesions with normal brain parenchyma. The results of MRS data showed that a decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate, an increase in lactate and a very high early peak of free lipids between 0.9 and 1.4 ppm were obtained at the acute infarcted lesion as compared with normal brain parenchyma. In addition, these findings were more clearly detected on short echo time spectrum rather than long spectrum. A close relationship between the clinical manifestations and MRI and MRS findings of the brain can helpful to distinguish CFE with other conditions and to evaluate the cause materials of infarctions rather than conventional MRI or diffusion-weighted imaging.","1375":"Hemorrhagic complications associated with aspirin use occur primarily at skin or gastrointestinal sites but can occasionally occur in the central nervous system. In particular, spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhage (SSEH) associated with aspirin is very rare. We report a case of low-dose (100 mg daily) aspirin-related SSEH that was successfully treated with medical management. Our case indicates that low-dose aspirin could induce SSEH and that conservative treatment with close observation and repeated imaging studies should be considered in cases with neurological improvement or mild deficits.","1376":"Oblique basal skull fractures resulting from lateral crushing injuries involving both clivus and occipital condyle are rare due to their deep locations. Furthermore, these fractures may present clinically with multiple cranial nerve injuries because neural exit routes are restricted in this intricate region. The authors present an interesting case of basal skull fractures involving the clivus and occipital condyle and presenting with sixth and contralateral twelfth cranial nerve deficits. Clinico-anatomic correlations and the courses of cranial nerve deficits are reiterated. To the authors' knowledge, no other report has been previously issued on concomitant sixth and contralateral twelfth cranial nerve palsies following closed head injury.","1377":"We report a patient with a ruptured vertebral artery (VA) dissecting aneurysm that was treated by internal trapping of the aneurysm and parent artery using detachable coils with subsequent antegrade recanalization of occluded vertebral artery during the follow-up period. A 38-year-old man was admitted with a ruptured right VA dissecting aneurysm just distal to origin of right posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The dissected segment of the VA was occluded by coil embolization. The 14 months follow-up angiography showed that dissected aneurysm was completely occluded, but the parent artery was recanalized in an antegrade fashion. Based on this unique case, the authors suggest that careful angiographic follow-up of dissecting aneurysm is required, even in patients successfully treated with endovascular occlusion of the affected artery and aneurysm.","1378":"Internal carotid artery (ICA) trapping can be used for the treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms, blood blister-like aneurysms, and fusiform dissecting aneurysms. Fusiform dissecting aneurysms are challenging to treat surgically and endovascularly because of no definite neck and critical perforators. Surgical or endovascular trapping of the ICA with or without an extracranial-intracranial bypass has commonly been used as an effective method to treat these lesions, but balloon test occlusion (BTO) must be performed. Here, we report a case of a ruptured fusiform dissecting aneurysm of the distal ICA, which was successfully treated using an endovascular ICA trapping with a manual ICA compression test instead of BTO.","1379":"Many reports have been published on complications related to middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm surgical clipping procedures. We report an emergency intracranial in situ bypass surgery case which was performed as a rescue procedure after aneurysmal neck laceration during clipping of an MCA large aneurysm. In this case, we performed in situ M3-superficial temporal artery (STA) interposition graft-M3 bypass procedure. If a STA-MCA anastomosis is not available under MCA flow obstruction, we can consider an emergency in situ MCA-MCA bypass procedure with or without an STA interposition graft.","1380":null,"1381":"Occipital neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal jabbing pain in the dermatomes of the greater or lesser occipital nerves caused by irritation of these nerves. Although several therapies have been reported, they have only temporary therapeutic effects. We report the results of pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the occipital nerve, which was used to treat occipital neuralgia. Patients were diagnosed with occipital neuralgia according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders classification criteria. We performed pulsed radiofrequency neuromodulation when patients presented with clinical findings suggestive occipital neuralgia with positive diagnostic block of the occipital nerves with local anesthetics. Patients were analyzed according to age, duration of symptoms, surgical results, complications and recurrence. Pain was measured every month after the procedure using the visual analog and total pain indexes. From 2010, ten patients were included in the study. The mean age was 52 years (34-70 years). The mean follow-up period was 7.5 months (6-10 months). Mean Visual Analog Scale and mean total pain index scores declined by 6.1 units and 192.1 units, respectively, during the follow-up period. No complications were reported. Pulsed radiofrequency neuromodulation of the occipital nerve is an effective treatment for occipital neuralgia. Further controlled prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the exact effects and long-term outcomes of this treatment method. ","1382":"Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is the least invasive surgical option for patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN). However, the indications and long term outcomes of GKRS are still controversial. Additionally, a series with uniform long-term follow-up data for all patients has been lacking. In the present study, the authors analyzed long-term outcomes in a series of patients with TN who underwent a single GKRS treatment followed by a minimum follow-up of 60 months. From 1994 to 2009, 40 consecutive patients with typical, intractable TN received GKRS. Among these, 22 patients were followed for &gt;60 months. The mean maximum radiation dose was 77.1 Gy (65.2-83.6 Gy), and the 4 mm collimator was used to target the radiation to the root entry zone. The mean age was 61.5 years (25-84 years). The mean follow-up period was 92.2 months (60-144 months). According to the pain intensity scale in the last follow-up, 6 cases were grades I-II (pain-free with or without medication; 27.3%) and 7 cases were grade IV-V (&lt;50% pain relief with medication or no pain relief; 31.8%). There was 1 case (facial dysesthesia) with post-operative complications (4.54%). The long-term results of GKRS for TN are not as satisfactory as those of microvascular decompression and other conventional modalities, but GKRS is a safe, effective and minimally invasive technique which might be considered a first-line therapy for a limited group of patients for whom a more invasive kind of treatment is unsuitable. ","1383":"Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are generally regarded as benign tumors with typical radiologic and pathologic findings. However, they sometimes have unusual findings. We have analyzed radiologic findings and pathologic growth patterns on CPPs. The study group included 5 male and 5 female patients (age range, 3 months to 58 years : median, 29 years). The study group included 3 pediatric and 7 adult patients. All patients underwent surgery; 9 patients had a gross total resection and 1 patient had a subtotal resection. We analyzed the radiologic findings (location, size, mottle-like appearance, enhancement, calcifications, and hydrocephalus) and pathologic growth patterns (typical papillary, papillary and solid, and papillary and tubular). The median follow-up duration was 21.3 months (range, 4-47.8 months). There were no recurrences after initial treatment. All patients had benign CPPs. Pediatric CPPs were 3.2 cm masses (range, 2.7-4 cm) with homogeneous enhancement and a mottle-like appearance, which pathologically showed the papillary growth pattern. Hydrocephalus was present in all pediatric patients. Postoperatively, subdural hygroma had occurred in two patients. In adults, CPPs were located in the fourth ventricle in 6 patients and suprasellar area in 1 patient. The size varied from 0.5-4.2 cm. Hydrocephalus and calcifications occurred in 3 and 4 patients, respectively. Three patients showed the heterogeneous enhancement without a mottle-like appearance and pathologically showed combined papillary and solid growth in 2 patients and papillary and tubular growth in one. Postoperatively, two patients with large masses had injuries of the brainstem and underwent shunt procedures for aggravation of hydrocephalus. CPPs may show unusual radiologic findings, which preoperatively give the difficulty to be differentiated from other tumors. CPPs with unusual radiologic findings showed the combined pathologic growth patterns. ","1384":"To propose grading of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms, which helps to predict the prognosis more accurately. From August 2005 to December 2010, 27 cases of emergent hematoma evacuation and aneurysm clipping for MCA aneurysms were done in the author's clinic. Three variables were considered in grading the ICH, which were 1) hematoma volume, 2) diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that extends to the contralateral sylvian cistern, and 3) the presence of midline shifting from computed tomography findings. For hematoma volume of greater than 25 mL, we assigned 2 points whereas 1 point for less than 25 cc. We also assigned 1 point for the presence of diffuse SAH whereas 0 point for the absence of it. Then, 1 point was assigned for midline shifting of greater than 5 mm whereas 0 point for less than 5 mm. According to the grading system, the numbers of patients from grade 1 to 4 were 4, 6, 8 and 9 respectively and 5, 7, 8, 4 and 3 patients belonged to Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 5 to 1 respectively. It was found that the patients with higher GOS had lower ICH grade which were confirmed to be statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). Preoperative Hunt and Hess grade and absence of midline shifting were the factors to predict favorable outcome. The ICH grading system composed of above three variables was helpful in predicting the patient's outcome more accurately.

The authors measured various cervical parameters in cadaveric dry bones and compared with previous reported results. We made 255 dry bones age from 19 to 72 years (mean, 42.3 years) that were obtained from 51 subjects in 100 subjects who donated their bodies. All measurements from C3-C7 levels were made using digital vernier calipers, standard goniometer, and self-made fix tool for two different cervical axes (canal and disc setting). We classified into 4 groups (uncinate process, vertebral body, lamina, and pedicle) and measured independently by two neurosurgeons for 28 parameters. We analyzed 23970 measurements by mean value and standard deviations. In comparing with previous literatures, there are some different results. The mean values for uncinate process (UP) width ranged from 5.5 mm at C4 and 5 to 6.3 mm at C3 and C7 in men. Also, in women, the mean values for UP width ranged from 5.5 mm at C5 to 6.3 mm at C7. C7 was widest and C5 was most narrow than other levels. The antero-posterior length of UP tended to increase gradually from C3 to C6. The tip way, tip distance, and base distance of UP also showed increasing pattern from C3 to C7. These measurements can provide the spinal surgeons with a starting point to address bony architectures surrounding targeted soft tissues for safeguard against unintended damages during cervical operation. ","1388":"Dural tears can occur during spinal surgery and may lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage which is rarely involved in remote cerebellar hemorrhage. Only a few of cases of simultaneous cerebral and cerebellar hemorrhage have been reported in the English literature. We experienced a case of multiple remote cerebral and cerebellar hemorrhages in a 63-year-old man who exhibited no significant neurologic deficits after spinal surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 4 days after the surgery showed a large amount of CSF leakage in the lumbosacral space. The patient underwent the second surgery for primary repair of the dural defect, but complained of headache after dural repair surgery. Brain MRI taken 6 days after the dural repair surgery revealed multifocal remote intracerebral and cerebellar hemorrhages in the right temporal lobe and both cerebellar hemispheres. We recommend diagnostic imaging to secure early identification and treatment of this complication in order to prevent serious neurologic deficits.","1389":"Simultaneous intracranial and spinal subdural hematomas are extremely rare. In most cases, they are attributed to major or minor trauma and iatrogenic causes, such as those resulting from spinal puncture. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been only two reports of spontaneous concomitant intracranial and spinal subdural hematomas in a patient receiving anticoagulant therapy who had an absence of evident trauma history. We report on a case of spontaneous concomitant intracranial and spinal subdural hematomas that occurred in association with anticoagulant therapy and present a review of the relevant literature.","1390":"Osteochondroma is a rare condition in the spine that may be indolent due to its slow growth. The authors present a case of 32-year-old man with subclinical osteochondroma in the cervical spine presenting as Brown-Sequard syndrome after trivial neck trauma. After resection of the tumor through hemilaminectomy, his symptoms were improved with mild residual sequelae.","1391":"A 31-year-old man presented with acute onset of paraplegia. The patient's history was significant for thyroid carcinoma that had been treated 2 years earlier by thyroidectomy. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enhancing intramedullary lesion at T7-8. Patient underwent surgical treatment and a tumor with hematoma was resected via posterior midline myelotomy. Postoperatively, the patient's motor weakness was improved to grade 3. The lesion showed typical histologic features consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Early diagnosis and microsurgical resection can result in improvement in neurological deficits and quality of life of patients with an ISCM.","1392":"Iatrogenic vascular injuries during lumbar disc surgery may occur rarely but they are serious complications, which can be fatal without appropriate management. Prompt diagnosis and management of these complications are imperative to prevent a desperate outcome. A 72-year-old female with proximal left common iliac artery iatrogenic injury during lumbar discectomy was successfully treated by percutaneous deployment of a stent graft in an emergency setting. Postprocedural angiogram demonstrated complete exclusion of the iliac artery laceration. The patient became hemodynamically stable. Two weeks later she complained of vascular claudication. Follow-up angiography revealed decreased arterial flow in the opposite common iliac artery. An additional kissing stent was inserted into the right common iliac artery and the symptoms of vascular claudication disappeared. Endovascular stenting offers a safe and effective method for the treatment of an iatrogenic arterial laceration, particularly in a critical condition. But, the contralateral iliac arterial flow should be kept intact in case of proximal iliac artery injury. Otherwise, additional treatments may be needed.","1393":"The waffle-cone technique is a modified stent application technique, which involves protrusion of the distal portion of a stent into an aneurysm fundus to provide neck support for subsequent coiling. The authors report two cases of wide necked basilar bifurcation aneurysms, which were not amenable to stent assisted coiling, that were treated using the waffle-cone technique with a Solitaire AB stent. A 58-year-old woman presented with severe headache. Brain CT showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and angiography demonstrated a ruptured giant basilar bifurcation aneurysm with broad neck, which was treated with a Solitaire AB stent and coils using the waffle-cone technique. The second case involved an 81-year-old man, who presented with dizziness caused by brain stem infarction. Angiography also demonstrated a large basilar bifurcation unruptured aneurysm with broad neck. Solitaire AB stent deployment using the waffle-cone technique, followed by coiling resulted in near complete obliteration of aneurysm. The waffle-cone technique with a Solitaire AB stent can be a useful alternative to conventional stent application when it is difficult to catheterize bilateral posterior cerebral arteries in patients with a wide-necked basilar bifurcation aneurysm.","1394":"A 20-month-old boy presented with a intraparenchymal mass in the right frontoparietal area manifesting as complex partial seizure, secondary generalization and left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain showed inhomogeneously enhancing mass in the right frontoparietal area which has irregular margin and perilesional edema. Based on the radiological findings, a preoperative diagnosis was an intraaxial tumor, such as pilocytic astrocytoma or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor. The patient underwent a surgery including frontal craniotomy. The tumor had a partially extreme adherence to the surrounding brain tissue but it showed no dural attachment. Gross-total resection of the tumor was achieved. Postoperative follow-up computed tomography scans showed no residual tumor. The pathological findings confirmed the tumor as a WHO grade I meningioma, transitional type. Nine months after the surgery, follow-up brain MRI showed no recurrence of the tumor, porencephaly in site where the tumor was resected; the patient's symptoms had fully recovered. We report the case of a meningioma in a 20-month-old boy.","1395":"Traumatic epidural hematomas (EDHs) in children are a relatively unusual occurrence. The cause and outcome vary depending on period and region of study. The aims of this analysis were to review the cause and outcome of pediatric EDHs nowadays and to discuss outcome-related variables in a large consecutive series of surgically treated EDH in children. This is a retrospective review of 29 patients with surgically treated EDHs between Jan 2000 and February 2010. Patients' medical records, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and, if performed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were reviewed to define variables associated with outcome. Variables included in the analysis were age, associated severe extracranial injury, abnormal pupillary response, hematoma thickness, severity of head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score), parenchymal brain injury, and diffuse axonal injury. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 109 months (0-185 months). Most of the injuries with EDHs occurred in traffic accident (14 cases, 48.2%) and followed by slip down in 6 cases and falls in 6 cases. There were one birth injury and one unknown cause. EDHs in traffic accidents occurred in pedestrians hit by a motor vehicle, 9 cases; motorbike and car accidents, 5 cases and bicycle accidents, 1 case. The locations of hematoma were almost same in both sides (left side in 15 cases). Temporal lobe is the most common site of hematomas (13 cases, 44%). The mean size of the EDHs was 18 mm (range, 5-40 mm). Heterogeneous hematomas in CT scans were 20 cases (67%). Two patients were referred with unilateral or bilateral dilated pupil(s). There was enlargement of EDH in 5 patients (17%). All of them were heterogeneous hematomas in CT scans. Except for 4 patients, all EDHs were associated with skull fracture(s) (87%). There was no case of patient with major organ injury. CT or MRI revealed brain contusion in 5 patients, and diffuse axonal injury in one patient. The mortality was zero, and the outcomes were excellent in 26 and good in 2 patients. None of the tested variables were found to have a prognostic relevance. Regardless of the EDH size, the clinical status of the patients, the abnormal pupillary findings, or the cause of injury, the outcome and prognosis of the patients with EDH were excellent. ","1396":null,"1397":"The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of screw fixation without bone fusion for unstable thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fracture. Nine patients younger than 40 years underwent screw fixation without bone fusion, following postural reduction using a soft roll at the involved vertebra, in cases of burst fracture. Their motor power was intact in spite of severe canal compromise. The surgical procedure included postural reduction for 3 days and screw fixations at one level above, one level below and at the fractured level itself. The patients underwent removal of implants 12 months after the initial operation, due to possibility of implant failure. Imaging and clinical findings, including canal encroachment, vertebral height, clinical outcome, and complications were analyzed. Prior to surgery, the mean pain score (visual analogue scale) was 8.2, which decreased to 2.2 at 12 months after screw fixation. None of the patients complained of worsening of pain during 6 months after implant removal. All patients were graded as having excellent or good outcomes at 6 months after implant removal. The proportion of canal compromise at the fractured level improved from 55% to 35% at 12 months after surgery. The mean preoperative vertebral height loss was 45.3%, which improved to 20.6% at 6 months after implant removal. There were no neurological deficits related to neural injury. The improved vertebral height and canal compromise were maintained at 6 months after implant removal. Short segment pedicle screw fixation, including fractured level itself, without bone fusion following postural reduction can be an effective and safe operative technique in the management of selected young patients suffering from unstable burst fracture. ","1398":"This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the role of chemotherapy in the management of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). We compared the survival outcome among the 3 different treatment protocol groups in a single institution. A total of 86 patients (39 men and 47 women) with newly diagnosed AA after surgery were analyzed. Among them, 31 patients (36.0%) were treated with radiotherapy only (RT Group), 30 patients (34.9%) were treated with nimustine-cisplatin chemotherapy before RT (ACNU-CDDP group), and 25 patients (29.1%) were treated with procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy after radiotherapy (PCV group). The median survival was 14.0, 30.0 and 72.0 months in RT, ACNU-CDDP, and PCV group, respectively and showed significant differences (RT vs. ACNU-CDDP; p=0.039, RT vs. PCV; 0.002, ACNU-CDDP vs. PCV; 0.045). PCV group showed less toxicity rate (5 patients; 20%) than ACNU-CDDP group (12 patients; 40%), while only 3 patients (9.6%) in RT group experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities. An application of chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy is beneficial in prolonging the survival of patients with AA. Adjuvant PCV chemotherapy after radiotherapy is recommendable. ","1399":"Valproic acid (VPA), as known as histone deacetylase inhibitor, has neuroprotective effects. This study investigated the histological changes and functional recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) associated with VPA treatment in a rat model. Locomotor function was assessed according to the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale for 2 weeks in rats after receiving twice daily intraperitoneal injections of 200 mg\/kg VPA or the equivalent volume of normal saline for 7 days following SCI. The injured spinal cord was then examined histologically, including quantification of cavitation. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale scores in rats receiving VPA were significantly higher than in the saline group (p&lt;0.05). The cavity volume in the VPA group was significantly reduced compared with the control (saline-injected) group (p&lt;0.05). The level of histone acetylation recovered in the VPA group, while it was significantly decreased in the control rats (p&lt;0.05). The macrophage level was significantly decreased in the VPA group (p&lt;0.05). VPA influences the restoration of hyperacetylation and reduction of the inflammatory reaction resulting from SCI, and is effective for histology and motor function recovery. ","1400":"In conventional percutaneous disc surgery, introducing instruments into disc space starts by inserting a guide needle into the triangular working zone. However, landing the guide needle tip on the annular window is a challenging step in endoscopic discectomy. Surgeons tend to repeat the needling procedure to reach an optimal position on the annular target. Obturator guiding technique is a modification of standard endoscopic lumbar discectomy, in which, obturator is used to access triangular working zone instead of a guide needle. Obturator guiding technique provides more vivid feedback and easy manipulation. This technique decreases the steps of inserting instruments and takes safer route from the peritoneum.","1401":"We present a case of an athetoid cerebral palsy with quadriparesis caused by kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine, severe spinal stenosis at the cervicomedullary junction, and atlantoaxial instability. The patient improved after the first surgery, which included a C1 total laminectomy and C-arm guided righ side unilateral C1-2 transarticular screw fixation. C1-2 fixation was not performed on the other side because of an aberrant and dominant vertebral artery (VA). Eight months after the first operation, the patient required revision surgery for persistent neck pain and screw malposition. We used intraoperative VA angiography with simultaneous fluoroscopy for precise image guidance during bilateral C1-2 transarticular screw fixation. Intraoperative VA angiography allowed the accurate insertion of screws, and can therefore be used to avoid VA injury during C1-2 transarticular screw fixation in comorbid patients with atlantoaxial deformities.","1402":"This report describes a rare case of postoperative hyperventilation attack after an endoscopic third ventriculostomy in a 46-year-old woman. About 60 min after the termination of the operation, an intractable hyperventilation started with respiratory rate of 65 breaths\/min and EtCO(2), 16.3 mm Hg. Sedation with benzodiazepine, thiopental sodium, fentanyl, and propofol\/remifentanil infusion was tried under a rebreathing mask at a 4 L\/min of oxygen. With aggressive sedative challenges, ventilation pattern was gradually returned to normal during the 22 hrs of time after the surgery. A central neurogenic hyperventilation was suspected due to the stimulating central respiratory center by cold acidic irrigation solution during the neuroendoscopic procedure.","1403":"Central nervous system (CNS) sparganosis is a rare parasitic infestation caused by ingestion of the raw or inadequately cooked snakes or frogs. Sparganum is well known for its ability of migrating though the tissue, therefore, it can cause various neurological symptoms if it involves neurological systems. A 51-year-old male patient visited our department of neurosurgery complaining of the motor weakness and radiating pain on both upper extremities over 4 months. He had a history of ingesting raw snakes untill his late twenties. The magnetic resonance (MR) images of cervical spine revealed an intramedullary ill-defined enhancing lesion with the aggregated cysts in the upper cervical spinal cord. Under presumptive diagnosis of sparganosis, we took brain MR image. The brain MR images revealed the signal change in right fronto-temporal lobe suggesting the trajectory of parasitic migration via ventricular systems. He underwent a midline myelotomy and granuloma removal followed by the posterior laminoplasty. Pathologic findings showed inflammatory changes and necrosis with keratinized tissue suggesting the CNS sparganosis. We report an uncommon case of CNS sparganosis migrated from the brain to the spinal cord with literature review.","1404":"This case report describes a patient who had a foreign body in transverse sinus. A 35-year-old Korean-Chinese man visited the emergency room with lacerated wound in left eyelid and a foreign body which was stumbled upon in the skull. On examination, there was right side hemianopsia in his left eye. He did not complain any headache or show any abnormal neurological signs, but there was a foreign body at left transverse sinus in computed tomography which was taken at another hospital. There was no intracranial abnormality except the foreign body in computed tomography. Because of the financial problem, additional evaluations were not possible. We herein report a strange case in which the pathway of a foreign body to locate in transverse sinus was ambiguous, and suggest that the foreign body located in transverse sinus might have been the penetrated along the anterior fontanelle and passed through the superior sagittal sinus.","1405":"Penetrating injuries to the upper cervical spine resulting from gunshots are rare in South Korea due to restrictions of gun use. Moreover, gunshot wounds to the upper cervical spine without neurological deficits occur infrequently because of the anatomic location and surrounding essential structures. We present an uncommon case involving the surgical removal of a bullet located in the anterior arch of first cervical vertebra (C1) via a transoral approach without neurological complications or subsequent mechanical instability.","1406":"We report an unusual case of lateral medullary infarction after successful embolization of the vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA). A 49-year-old man who had no noteworthy previous medical history was admitted to our hospital with a severe headache. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage, located in the basal cistern and posterior fossa. Cerebral angiography showed a VADA, that did not involve the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). We treated this aneurysm via endovascular trapping of the vertebral artery distal to the PICA. After operation, CT revealed post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, which we resolved with a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure. Postoperatively, the patient experienced transient mild hoarsness and dysphagia. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a small infarction in the right side of the medulla. The patient recovered well, though he still had some residual symptom of dysphagia at discharge. Such an event is uncommon but can be a major clinical concern. Further investigation to reveal risk factors and\/or causative mechanisms for the medullary infarction after successful endovascular trapping of the VADA are sorely needed, to minimize such a complication.","1407":"The treatment of bilateral vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is still challenging. The authors report a rare case of bilateral VADA treated with coil trapping of ruptured VADA and covered stents implantation after multiple unsuccessful stent assisted coiling of the contralateral unruptured VADA. A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of severe headache and sudden stuporous consciousness. Brain CT showed thick SAH and intraventricular hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography demonstrated bilateral VADA. Based on the SAH pattern and aneurysm configurations, the right VADA was considered ruptured. This was trapped with endovascular coils without difficulty. One month later, the contralateral unruptured VADA was protected using a stent-within-a-stent technique, but marked enlargement of the left VADA was detected by 8-months follow-up angiography. Subsequently two times coil packing for pseudosacs resulted in near complete occlusion of left VADA. However, it continued to grow. Covered stents graft below the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) origin and a coronary stent implantation across the origin of the PICA resulted in near complete obliteration of the VADA. Covered stent graft can be used as a last therapeutic option for the management of VADA, which requires absolute preservation of VA flow.","1408":"We report here two cases of primary intraosseous meningioma with aggressive behavior. A 68-year-old man presented with a one year history of a soft, enlarging mass in the right parietal region. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a 6 cm sized, heterogeneously-enhancing, bony expansile mass in the right parietal bone, and computed tomograph (CT) showed a bony, destructive lesion. The tumor, including the surrounding normal bone, was totally resected. Dural invasion was not apparent. Diagnosis was atypical meningioma, which extensively metastasized within the skull one year later. A 74-year-old woman presented with a 5-month history of a soft mass on the left frontal area. MRI revealed a 4 cm sized, multilobulated, strongly-enhancing lesion on the left frontal bone, and CT showed a destructive lesion. The mass was adhered tightly to the scalp and dura mater. The lesion was totally removed. Biopsy showed a papillary meningioma. The patient refused adjuvant radiation therapy and later underwent two reoperations for recurred lesions, at 19 and at 45 months postoperative. The patient experienced back pain 5 years later, and MRI showed an osteolytic lesion on the 11th thoracic vertebra. After her operation, a metastatic papillary meningioma was diagnosed. These osteolytic intraosseous meningiomas had atypical\/malignant pathologies, which metastasized to whole skull and the spine.","1409":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive intracranial tumor and it commonly spreads by direct extension and infiltration into the adjacent brain tissue and along the white matter tract. The metastatic spread of GBM outside of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare. The possible mechanisms of extraneural metastasis of the GBM have been suggested. They include the lymphatic spread, the venous invasion and the direct invasion through dura and bone. We experienced a 46-year-old man who had extraneural metastasis of the GBM on his left neck. The patient was treated with surgery for 5 times, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He had survived 6 years since first diagnosed. Although the exact mechanism of the extraneural metastasis is not well understood, this present case shows the possibility of extraneural metastasis of the GBM, especially in patients with long survival.","1410":"Parkinsonism secondary to intracranial mass lesions usually results from compression or distortion of the basal ganglia. Secondary parkinsonism due to midbrain infiltration or compression is rare and generally associated with other neurologic signs caused by pyramidal tract and\/or cranial nerve involvement. We report a case of 30-year-old woman in whom mild parkinsonism was the major clinical manifestation of an astrocytoma in the anterior third ventricle and hypothalamus. She underwent surgical resection, ventriculoperitoneal shunt and radiation therapy. All symptoms of parkinsonism were completely recovered 3 months after the treatment. Brain tumors can be manifested only by the symptoms of parkinsonism. This case emphasizes the significance of neuroimaging in the evaluation of parkinsonism.","1411":"The authors describe a case of choriocarcinoma that metastasized to the cerebral cortex, vertebral body, and intramedullary spinal cord. A 21-year-old woman presented with sudden headache, vomiting and a visual field defect. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance examinations revealed an intracranial hemorrhage in the left temporo-parietal lobe and two enhancing nodules in the left temporal and right frontal lobe. After several days, the size of the hemorrhage increased, and a new hemorrhage was identified in the right frontal lobe. The hematoma and enhancing mass in the left temporo-parietal lobe were surgically removed. Choriocarcinoma was diagnosed after histological examination. At 6 days after the operation, her consciousness had worsened and she was in a state of stupor. The size of the hematoma in the right frontal lobe was enlarged. We performed an emergency operation to remove the hematoma and enhancing mass. Her mental status recovered slowly. Two months thereafter, she complained of paraplegia with sensory loss below the nipples. Whole spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-enhancing mass in the thoracic intramedullary spinal cord and L2 vertebral body. Despite chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient died 13 months after the diagnosis.","1412":"To evaluate radiographic results of anterior fusion methods in two-level cervical disc disease : tricortical autograft and plate fixation (ACDF-AP), cage and plate fixation (ACDF-CP), stand-alone cage (ACDF-CA), and corpectomy and plate fixation (ACCF). The numbers of patients were 70 with a minimum 6 month follow-up (ACDF-AP : 12, ACDF-CP : 27, ACDF-CA : 15, and ACCF : 16). Dynamic simple X-ray and computed tomography were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, 6 month, and at the final follow-up. The fusion and subsidence rates at the final were determined, and global cervical lordosis (GCL), cervical range of motion, fused segment angle (FSA), and fused segment height (FSH) were analyzed. Nonunion was observed in 4 (25%) patients with ACDF-CA, 1 (8%) patient with ACDF-AP, 1 (4%) patient with ACDF-CP. The number of loss of FSH (%) more than 3 mm were 2 patients (16%) in ACDF-AP, 3 patients (11%) in ACDF-CP, 5 patients (33%) in ACDF-CA, and 3 patients (20%) in ACCF. The GCL was decreased with ACDF-CA and increased with others. The FSA was increased with ACDF-AP, ACDF-CP, and ACCF, but ACDF-CA was decreased. At the final follow-up, the FSH was slightly decreased in ACDF-CP, ACDF-AP, and ACCF, but ACDF-CA was more decreased. Graft related complication were minimal. Screw loosening, plate fracture, cage subsidence and migration were not identified. ACDF-CP demonstrated a higher fusion rate and less minimal FSH loss than the other fusions in two-level cervical disc disease. The ACDF-AP and ACCF methods had a better outcome than the ACDF-CA with respect to GCL, FSA, and FSH. ","1413":"To analyze the prognostic factors thought to be related with survival time after a spinal metastasis operation. We retrospectively analyzed 217 patients who underwent spinal metastasis operations in our hospital from 2001 to 2009. Hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, were excluded. The factors thought to be related with postoperative survival time were gender, age (below 55, above 56), primary tumor growth rate (slow, moderate, rapid group), spinal location (cervical, thoracic, and lumbo-sacral spine), the timing of radiation therapy (preoperative, postoperative, no radiation), operation type (decompressive laminectomy with or without posterior fixation, corpectomy with anterior fusion, corpectomy with posterior fixation), preoperative systemic condition (below 5 points, above 6 points classified by Tomita scoring), pre- and postoperative ambulatory function (ambulatory, non-ambulatory), number of spinal metastases (single, multiple), time to spinal metastasis from the primary cancer diagnosis (below 21 months, above 22 months), and postoperative complication. The study cohort mean age at the time of surgery was 55.5 years. The median survival time after spinal operation and spinal metastasis diagnosis were 6.0 and 9.0 months. In univariate analysis, factors such as gender, primary tumor growth rate, preoperative systemic condition, and preoperative and postoperative ambulatory status were shown to be related to postoperative survival. In multivariate analysis, statistically significant factors were preoperative systemic condition (p=0.048) and postoperative ambulatory status (p&lt;0.001). The other factors had no statistical significance. The factors predictive for postoperative survival time should be considered in the surgery of spinal metastasis patients. ","1414":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is usually carried out under three-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic guidance. However, operative complications or bone cement distribution might be difficult to assess on the basis of only 2D radiographic projection images. We evaluated the feasibility of performing an intraoperative and postoperative examination in patients undergoing PVP by using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructive C-arm. Standard PVP procedures were performed on 14 consecutive patients by using a Siremobil Iso-C(3D) and a multidetector computed tomography machine. Post-processing of acquired volumetric datasets included multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and surface shaded display (SSD). We analyzed intraoperative and immediate postoperative evaluation of the needle trajectory and bone cement distribution. THE MALE : female ratio was 2 : 12; mean age of patients, 70 (range, 77-54) years; and mean T score, -3.4. The mean operation time was 52.14 min, but the time required to perform and post-process the rotational acquisitions was 7.76 min. The detection of bone cement distribution and leakage after PVP by using MPR and SSD was possible in all patients. However, detection of the safe trajectory for needle insertion was not possible. 3D rotational image acquisition can enable intra- or post-procedural assessment of vertebroplasty procedures for the detection of bone cement distribution and leakage. However, it is difficult to assess the safe trajectory for needle insertion. ","1415":"The sinking skin flap syndrome is a rare complication after a large craniectomy. It consists of a sunken skin above the bone defect with neurological symptoms such as severe headache, mental changes, focal deficits, or seizures. In patient with sinking skin flap syndrome, cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism are decreased by sinking skin flap syndrome, and it may cause the deterioration of autoregulation of brain. We report a case of a patient with sinking skin flap syndrome who suffered from reperfusion injury after cranioplasty with review of pertinent literature.","1416":"Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is benign vascular lesion destructing the cortical bone by the expansion of the vascular channel in the diploic space that usually involve long bone and spine. Orbital ABC is rare and the clinical symptoms deteriorate rapidly after initial slow-progression period for a few months. A 12-year-old female patient visited ophthalmologist due to proptosis and upward gaze limitation of the right eye, and orbital mass was noted in the upper part of right eye on orbital MRI. Five months later, exophthalmos was worsened rapidly with other features of ophthalmoplegia. Orbital mass was enlarged on MRI with intracranial extension. Surgery was done through frontal craniotomy and intracranial portion of the tumor was removed. Destructed orbital roof and mass in the orbit was also removed, and surrounding bone which was suspected to have lesion was resected as much as possible. Histopathological diagnosis was aneurysmal bone cyst. Postoperative course was satisfactory and the patient's eye symptoms improved. Authors report a rare case of orbital ABC with review of the literature. Exact diagnosis by imaging studies is important and it is recommended to perform surgical resection before rapid-progressing period and to resect the mass completely to prevent recurrence.","1417":"It is rare for low-grade gliomas to disseminate to the leptomeninges. However, low-grade gliomas with dissemination to the leptomeninges have been occasionally reported in children, and have generally been associated with local recurrence. A 16-year-old boy sought evaluation for diplopia and gait disturbance. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed pontine mass, which was proved to be fibrillary astrocytoma on biopsy, later. Radiation therapy (5400 cGy) was given and the patient's symptoms were improved. He was followed-up radiologically for brain lesion. Seven months after diagnosis he complained of back pain and gait disturbance. A brain MRI showed a newly-developed lesion at the left cerebellopontine angle without an interval change in the primary lesion. A spinal MRI demonstrated leptomeningeal dissemination of the entire spine. Radiation therapy (3750 cGy) to the spine, and adjuvant chemotherapy with a carboplatin plus vincristine regimen were administered. However, he had a progressive course with tumoral hemorrhage and expired 13 months after diagnosis. We report an unusual case of a low-grade brainstem glioma with spinal dissemination, but without local recurrence, and a progressive course associated with hemorrhage.","1418":"Giant spinal schwannoma of the cauda equine involving many nerve roots is rare, and ossification is usually not observed in the schwannoma. A 21-year-old man presented with a 12-month history of urinary dysfunction and numbness below the buttocks. Plain radiography showed scalloping of the posterior surface of the vertebral bodies from L4 to the sacrum, and magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed a giant cauda equina tumor with dystrophic calcification. The tumor was completely removed, with intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring. Histopathologic examination showed that the tumor was a schwannoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with urinary function and numbness gradually improving. Although a giant schwannoma accompanied by dystrophic calcification is extremely rare, such a tumor can be removed safely and completely by meticulous dissection and careful neuromonitoring of the cauda equina spinal nerves involved in the tumor.","1419":"Although decompressive craniectomy is an effective treatment for various situations of increased intracranial pressure, it may be accompanied by several complications. Paradoxical herniation is known as a rare complication of lumbar puncture in patients with decompressive craniectomy. A 38-year-old man underwent decompressive craniectomy for severe brain swelling. He remained neurologically stable for five weeks, but then showed mental deterioration right after a lumbar puncture which was performed to rule out meningitis. A brain computed tomographic scan revealed a marked midline shift. The patient responded to the Trendelenburg position and intravenous fluids, and he achieved full neurologic recovery after successive cranioplasty. The authors discuss the possible mechanism of this rare case with a review of the literature.","1420":"We report a patient who underwent gamma knife radiosurgery to treat recurrent meningioma after microsurgery and thereafter developed secondary malignancy adjacent to the original tumor. A 47-year-old woman had underwent resection of the olfactory groove meningioma. Then radiosurgery was done three times over 4 year period for the recurrent tumor. After 58 months from the initial radiosurgery, she presented with headache and progressive mental dullness. Huge tumor in bifrontal location was revealed in MRI. Subsequent operation and pathological examination confirmed diagnosis of glioblastoma. This case fits the criteria of radiation-induced tumor and the clinical implication of the issue is discussed.","1421":"Tumors that metastasize to the pituitary gland are unusual, and are typically seen in elderly patients with diffuse malignant disease. The most common metastases to the pituitary are from primary breast and lung cancers. We report a 65-year-old woman with pituitary metastasis from breast cancer who presented with recent-onset left progressive deterioration of visual acuity and visual field. The clinical diagnosis was made after brain and sellar magnetic resonance imaging showed a large sellar mass compressing the optic chiasm and invading the pituitary stalk. An otorhinolaryngology and neurosurgery team removed the tumor via a transsphenoidal approach, and this procedure obtained symptomatic relief. Postoperatively, metastasis from breast invasive ductal adenocarcinoma was confirmed histologically. We report this unusual case with a review of the relevant literature.","1422":"Acute spontaneous subdural hematoma (SDH) of arterial origin is very rare. We report a case of acute spontaneous SDH that showed contrast media extravasation from cortical artery on angiograms. A 58-year-old male patient developed sudden onset headache and right hemiparesis. Brain CT scan demonstrated acute SDH at left convexity. The patient was drowsy mentality on admission. He had no history of head trauma. Cerebral angiography was performed and revealed a localized extravasation of the contrast media from distal cortical MCA branch. After angiography, the patient deteriorated to comatose mentality. Decompressive craniectomy for removal of SDH was performed. We verified the arterial origin of the bleeding and coagulated the bleeding focus. The histological diagnosis was aneurysmal artery. He recovered after surgery with mild disability. In a case of acute spontaneous SDH, the possibility of a cortical artery origin should be considered.","1423":"Life-threatening hemispheric stroke is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. Decompressive hemicraniectomy has been regarded as an effective treatment option for refractory intracranial hypertension. Here, we reported the clinical course of 5 children with decompressive craniectomy and duroplasty after non-traumatic refractory intracranial hypertension. Four toddlers and one preschool-girl were included in this study; there were 3 boys and 2 girls with a mean age of 34.6 months (range 17-80). Decompressive craniectomy including duroplasty was performed in cases of dilatation of pupil size after intensified standard medical therapy had proven insufficient. All children had a Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt;8 at pre-operation state. The mean time-point of craniectomy after stroke attack was 12 hours (range 4-19). During the long-term follow-up period (mean 47.6 months), no children died. One year later, when we checked their Glasgow Outcome Scale scores, only one toddler received a score of 4 (moderate disability). But the others had good recoveries although they had minor physical or mental deficits. According to the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale, 4 children received a score of 2 (mild disability). Despite our small cases, we suggest that decompressive hemicraniectomy and duroplasty is an acceptable and life-saving treatment for refractory intracranial hypertension after unilateral hemispheric stroke in toddlers and preschool children. ","1424":"The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effects of body mass index (BMI) on intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and intraoperative blood loss (IBL) during lumbar spinal surgery. Thirty patients scheduled for single level posterior lumbar interbody fusion were allocated equally to a normal group (Group 1, BMI;18.5-22.9 kg\/m(2)), an overweight group (Group 2, BMI; 23-24.9 kg\/m(2)), and an obese group (Group 3, BMI; 25.0-29.9 kg\/m(2)) according to BMI. IAP was measured using a urinary bladder catheter; 1) supine after anesthesia induction, 2) prone at skin incision, 3) prone at the end of surgery. In addition, IBL was also measured in the three groups. IAP in the supine position was not significantly different in groups 1, 2, and 3 (2.7 mm Hg, 3.0 mm Hg, and 4.2 mm Hg, respectively) (p=0.258), and IAP in the prone position at incision increased to 7.8 mm Hg, 8.2 mm Hg, and 10.4 mm Hg, respectively, in the three groups, and these intergroup differences were significant, especially for Group 3 (p=0.000). IAP at the end of surgery was slightly lower (7.0 mm Hg, 7.7 mm Hg, and 9.2 mm Hg, respectively). IBLs were not significantly different between the three groups. However, IBLs were found to increase with IAP in the prone position (p=0.022) and BMI (p&lt;0.05). These results show that BMI affects IAP in the prone position more than in the supine position during lumbar spinal surgery. In addition, IBLs were found to increase with IAP in the prone position and with BMI. Thus, IBLs can be expected to be higher in morbidly obese patients due to an increased IAP.

Methods to aid the surgeon in appropriate screw placement have included the use of intraoperative fluoroscopy and\/or radiography as well as image-guided techniques. We describe our technique for free hand pedicle screw placement in the thoracic spine without any radiographic guidance and present the results of pedicle screw placement analyzed by computed tomographic scan in two human cadavers. This free hand technique of thoracic pedicle screw placement performed in a step-wise, consistent, and compulsive manner is an accurate, reliable, and safe method of insertion to treat a variety of spinal disorders, including spinal deformity.","1427":null,"1428":"Although the mechanism of hemifacial spasm (HFS) is not yet well established, vascular compression of the facial nerve root exit zone and hyperexcitability of the facial nucleus have been suggested. We report a case of HFS in the setting of coinciding intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) of the pons and proximal ligation of the contralateral vertebral artery (VA) for the treatment of a fusiform aneurysm of the distal VA and discuss the possible etiologies of HFS in this patient. A 51-year-old male with an ICH of the pons was admitted to our hospital. Neuroimaging studies revealed an incidental fusiform aneurysm of the right VA distal to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Eight months after proximal ligation of the VA the patient presented with intermittent spasm of the left side of his face. Pre- and post-ligation magnetic resonance angiography revealed an enlarged diameter of the VA. The spasm completely disappeared after microvascular decompression.","1429":"We present the rare case of solitary xanthogranuloma in the upper cervical column mimicking a Brown-Sequard syndrome. A 29-year-old man complained with right hemiparesis and left hypoesthesia after a car accident. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance images revealed a lobulated homogenously well-enhancing mass in between posterior arch of the atlas (C1) and spinous process of the axis (C2) resulting in a marked spinal canal narrowing with cortical erosions. The patient was managed by complete resection of the tumor with partial laminectomy with lower half of C1 posterior arch and upper half of C2 spinous process. The authors advise complete removal of the xanthogranuloma and consideration as a differential diagnosis of lesions among upper cervical lesions.","1430":"Spontaneous hematomas of the iliacus muscle are rare lesions and these are seen in individuals receiving anticoagulation therapy or patients with blood dyscrasias such as hemophilia. It can cause femoral neuropathy and resultant pain and paralysis. Although there is no clear consensus for the treatment of femoral neuropathy from iliacus muscle hematomas, delays in the surgical evacuation of hematoma for decompression of the femoral nerve can lead to a prolonged or permanent disability. We report here on a rare case of a spontaneous iliacus muscle hematoma that caused femoral neuropathy in a patient who was taking warfarin for occlusive vascular disease and we discuss the treatment.","1431":null,"1432":"The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) artery supplying blood to the SCM muscle has different origins according to its anatomical segment. The authors performed cadaveric neck dissection to review the surgical anatomy of neurovascular structures surrounding the carotid artery in the neck. During the dissection, an unusual finding was cited in which the SCM artery supplying the middle part of the SCM muscle originated from the lingual artery (LA); it was also noted that it crossed over the hypoglossal nerve (HN). There have been extremely rare reports citing the SCM artery originated from the LA. Though the elevation of the HN over the internal carotid artery was relatively high, the vascular loop crossing over the HN was very close to the carotid bifurcation. Special anatomical consideration is required to avoid the injury of the HN during carotid artery surgery.","1433":"Two cases of the posterior fossa dissecting aneurysm associated with a double origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (DOPICA) causing subarachnoid hemorrhage are presented. After observing a relationship between the aneurysm and DOPICA on a three dimensional rotational angiogram (3DRA), the dissecting aneurysms were successfully obliterated by surgical trapping and endovascular internal trapping, respectively. This report warrants suspecting DOPICA of an associating anomaly predisposing to dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory and highlights the role of 3DRA in pretreatment evaluation of unusual aneurysms accompanying a particular anatomical variation.","1434":"We present a rare case of massive intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from a small, superficially-located supratentorial cavernous malformation, or cavernoma. These lesions rarely lead to massive, life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhages. A 17-year-old female presented with a 3-week history of declining mental status. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sizable intracranial hemorrhage, within the right occipital region, associated with a small nodule at the hematoma's posterior margin. An emergency operation removed the entire hematoma and nodule. Histological examination of the nodule was compatible with a diagnosis of cavernous malformation. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful.","1435":"The purpose of this study was to elucidate the anatomical development of physiologic suture closure processes in infants using three dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT). A consecutive series of 243 infants under 12 months of age who underwent three dimensional CT were included in this study. Four major cranial sutures (sagittal, coronal, lambdoidal and metopic suture) were classified into four suture closure grades (grade 0=no closure along the whole length, grade 1=partial or intermittent closure, grade 2=complete closure with visible suture line, grade 3=complete fusion (ossification) without visible suture line), and measured for its closure degree (suture closure rates; defined as percentage of the length of closed suture line divided by the total length of suture line). Suture closure grade under 12 months of age comprised of grade 0 (n=195, 80.2%), grade 1 (n=24, 9.9%) and grade 2 (n=24, 9.9%) in sagittal sutures, whereas in metopic sutures they were grade 0 (n=61, 25.1%), grade 1 (n=167, 68.7%), grade 2 (n=6, 24%) and grade 3 (n=9, 3.7%). Mean suture closure rates under 12 months of age was 58.8% in metopic sutures, followed by coronal (right : 43.8%, left : 41.1%), lambdoidal (right : 27.2%, left : 25.6%) and sagittal sutures (15.6%), respectively. These quantitative descriptions of cranial suture closure may help understand the process involved in the cranial development of Korean infants. ","1436":"This study was conducted to assess the clinical significance of traumatic brain stem injury (TBSI) reflected on Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) by various clinical variables. A total of 136 TBSI patients were selected out of 2695 head-injured patients. All initial computerized tomography and\/or magnetic resonance imaging studies were retrospectively analyzed according to demographic- and injury variables which result in GCS and GOS. In univariate analysis, mode of injury showed a significant effect on combined injury (p&lt;0.001), as were the cases with skull fracture on radiologic finding (p&lt;0.000). The GCS showed a various correlation with radiologic finding (p&lt;0.000), mode of injury (p&lt;0.002), but less favorably with impact site (p&lt;0.052), age (p&lt;0.054) and skull fracture (p&lt;0.057), in order of statistical significances. However, only GOS showed a definite correlation to radiologic finding (p&lt;0.000). In multivariate analysis, the individual variables to enhance an unfavorable effect on GCS were radiologic finding [odds ratio (OR) 7.327, 95% confidence interval (CI)], mode of injury (OR; 4.499, 95% CI) and age (OR; 3.141, 95% CI). Those which influence an unfavorable effect on GOS were radiologic finding (OR; 25.420, 95% CI) and age (OR; 2.674, 95% CI). In evaluation of TBSI on outcome, the variables such as radiological finding, mode of injury, and age were revealed as three important ones to have an unfavorable effect on early stage outcome expressed as GCS. However, mode of injury was shown not to have an unfavorable effect on late stage outcome as GOS. Among all unfavorable variables, radiological finding was confirmed as the only powerful prognostic variable both on GCS and GOS. ","1437":"To compare radiographic analysis on the sagittal lumbar curve when standing, sitting on a chair, and sitting on the floor. Thirty asymptomatic volunteers without a history of spinal pathology were recruited. The study population comprised 11 women and 19 men with a mean age of 29.8 years. An independent observer assessed whole lumbar lordosis (WL) and segmental lordosis (SL) between L1 and S1 using the Cobb's angle on lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine obtained from normal individuals when standing, sitting on a chair, and sitting on the floor. WL and SL at each segment were compared for each position. WL when sitting on the floor was reduced by 72.9% than the average of that in the standing position. Of the total decrease in WL, 78% occurred between L4 to S1. There were significant decreases in SL at all lumbar spinal levels, except L1-2, when sitting on the floor as compared to when standing and sitting on a chair. Changes in WL between the positions when sitting on a chair and when sitting on the floor were mostly contributed by the loss of SL at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. When sitting on the floor, WL is relatively low; this is mostly because of decreasing lordosis at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels. In the case of lower lumbar fusion, hyperflexion is expected at the adjacent segment when sitting on the floor. To avoid this, sitting with a lordotic lumbar curve is important. Surgeons should remember to create sufficient lordosis when performing lower lumbar fusion surgery in patients with an oriental life style. ","1438":"The authors performed a retrospective study to assess the clinical and radiological outcome in symptomatic lumbar spondylolysis patients who underwent a direct pars repair surgery using two different surgical methods; pedicle screw with universal hook system (PSUH) and direct pars screw fixation (DPSF), and compared the results between two different treated groups. Forty-seven consecutive patients (PSUH; 23, DPSF; 15) with symptomatic lumbar spondylolysis who underwent a direct pars repair surgery were included. The average follow-up period was 37 months in the PSUH group, and 28 months in the DPSF group. The clinical outcome was measured using visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). The length of operation time, the amount of blood loss, the duration of hospital stay, surgical complications, and fusion status were also assessed. When compared to the DPSF group, the average preoperative VAS and ODI score of the PSUH group were less decreased at the last follow-up; (the PSUH group; back VAS : 4.9 vs. 3.0, leg VAS : 6.8 vs. 2.2, ODI : 50.6% vs. 24.6%, the DPSF group; back VAS : 5.7 vs. 1.1, leg VAS : 6.1 vs. 1.2, ODI : 57.4% vs. 18.2%). The average operation time was 174.9 minutes in the PSUH group, and 141.7 minutes in the DPSF group. The average blood loss during operation was 468.8 cc in the PSUH group, and 298.8 cc in the DPSF group. The average hospital stay after operation was 8.9 days in the PSUH group, and 7 days in the DPSF group. In the PSUH group, there was one case of a screw misplacement requiring revision surgery. In the DPSF group, one patient suffered from transient leg pain. The successful bone fusion rate was 78.3% in the PSUH group, and 93.3% in the DPSF group. The present study suggests that the technique using direct pars screw would be more effective than the method using pedicle screw with lamina hook system, in terms of decreased operation time, amount of blood loss, hospital stay, and increased fusion success rate, as well as better clinical outcome. ","1439":null,"1440":"The incidence and prevalence of spinal metastases are increasing, and although the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of metastatic tumors of the spine has been well established, the same cannot be said about the role of stereotactic radiosurgery. Herein, the authors present a systematic review regarding the value of spinal stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of spinal metastasis. A systematic literature search for stereotactic radiosurgery of spinal metastases was undertaken. Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Education (GRADE) working group criteria was used to evaluate the qualities of study datasets. Thirty-one studies met the study inclusion criteria. Twenty-three studies were of low quality, and 8 were of very low quality according to the GRADE criteria. Stereotactic radiosurgery was reported to be highly effective in reducing pain, regardless of prior treatment. The overall local control rate was approximately 90%. Additional asymptomatic lesions may be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery to avoid further irradiation of neural elements and further bone-marrow suppression. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be preferred in previously irradiated patients when considering the radiation tolerance of the spinal cord. Furthermore, residual tumors after surgery can be safely treated by stereotactic radiosurgery, which decreases the likelihood of repeat surgery and accompanying surgical morbidities. Encompassing one vertebral body above and below the involved vertebrae is unnecessary. Complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery are generally self-limited and mild. In the management of spinal metastasis, stereotactic radiosurgery appears to provide high rates of tumor control, regardless of histologic diagnosis, and can be used in previously irradiated patients. However, the quality of literature available on the subject is not sufficient. ","1441":"We evaluated a modified trans-middle temporal gyrus (MTG) approach with good postoperative visual preservation for patients with trigonal tumors. Three patients with a trigonal tumor were treated via the modified trans-MTG approach guided by a neuro-navigator. Modified trans-MTG approach involve the incision at the MTG within 5 mm to the superior temporal sulcus. This approach makes a proper trajectory to the trigone but also reduces the retraction injury of MTG as little as possible to prevent postoperative visual field defect. Preoperative and postoperative visual field examination using perimetry was performed to evaluate the visual field. Three patients underwent surgery for lymphoma in the right trigone, meningioma in the left trigone, and focal enhancing nodule in the right paratrigonal area, respectively. In case of lymphoma, preoperative examination showed a left homonymous hemianopsia : one week later after surgery, a visual field examination was performed and revealed improvement of the visual field defect. In case of the meningioma, the preoperative examination showed no visual field defect : one month later, the visual field had no defect. In case of the enhancing nodule, preoperative visual field testing revealed a partial left homonymous hemianopsia. Visual examination within one month after surgery showed no visual field defect. All three patients treated with the modified trans-MTG approach showed no visual deterioration after surgery. The modified trans-MTG approach provides a safe and useful technique for trigonal tumors without postoperative visual field deterioration and affords adequate exposure of the trigonal tumor with a short trajectory. ","1442":"Recently, combination of surgery and radiation therapy (RT) has been recommended in the treatment of craniopharyngioma. RT could be associated with late complications, including vasculopathy. We report two cases of the moyamoya syndrome seen in children with craniopharyngioma who received RT after surgical resection. Thirty-five patients in pediatric age with craniopharyngioma were surgically treated. Fifteen out of 35 patients underwent surgical resection followed by RT or gamma knife surgery. Two of the 15 were found to have symptoms of transient ischemic attack and were diagnosed as moyamoya syndrome through the cerebral angiography. Age at RT was 4 and 13 years, respectively. The latent period for development of the moyamoya syndrome was 27 months and 3 years, respectively, after RT. The RT dose of both patients was 54 Gy. These two patients received bilateral encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis procedures. We report here these two cases of radiation-induced moyamoya syndrome in pediatric craniopharyngioma. Pediatric patients with craniopharyngioma who received RT should be reminded, during follow-up, about the risk of development of the moyamoya syndrome.","1443":"Temple trauma that appears initially localized to the skin might possess intracranial complications. Early diagnosis and management of such complications are important, to avoid neurologic sequelae. Non-penetrating head injuries with intracranial hemorrhage caused by a driven bone fragment are extremely rare. A 53-year-old male was referred to our hospital because of intracerebral hemorrhage. He was a mechanic and one day before admission to a local clinic, tip of metallic rod hit his right temple while cutting the rod. Initial brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated scanty subdural hematoma at right temporal lobe and left falx and intracerebral hematoma at both frontal lobes. Facial CT with 3-D reconstruction images showed a small bony defect at the right sphenoid bone's greater wing and a small bone fragment at the left frontal lobe, crossing the falx. We present the unusual case of a temple trauma patient in whom a sphenoid bone fragment migrated from its origin upward, to the contralateral frontal lobe, producing hematoma along its trajectory.","1444":"Although posterior segmental fixation technique is becoming increasingly popular, surgical treatment of craniovertebral junctional disorders is still challenging because of its complex anatomy and surrounding critical neurovascular structures. Basilar invagination is major pathology of craniovertebral junction that has been a subject of clinical interest because of its various clinical presentations and difficulty of treatment. Most authors recommend a posterior occipitocervical fixation following transoral decompression or posterior decompression and occipitocervical fixation. However, both surgical modalities inadvertently sacrifice C0-1 and C1-2 joint motion. We report two cases of basilar invagination reduced by the vertical distraction between C1-2 facet joint. We reduced the C1-2 joint in an anatomical position and fused the joint with iliac bone graft and C1-2 segmental fixation using the polyaxial screws and rods C-1 lateral mass and the C-2 pedicle.","1445":"A 67-year-old woman presented for evaluation of severe coccygeal pain. The computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging showed an asymmetric midline sacral tumor invading the right lower portion of S2. To preserve both S2 nerve roots and to obtain negative surgical margins, a modified mid-sacrectomy with an aid of a computed navigation system was performed. The sacral tumor was excised en bloc with negative tumor margins. Both S2 nerve roots were preserved and additional reconstruction was not necessary because of minimal resection of the sacroiliac joint. We report a case of a sacral chordoma which was excised en bloc with adequate surgical margins by a computer-assisted modified mid-sacrectomy. The computed navigation system may be a useful tool for tumor targeting and safe osteotomies in sacral tumor surgery via the posterior only approach.","1446":"Injury to the vertebral artery during anterior cervical discectomy is rare but potentially fatal. We report a case of cerebellar infarction after endovascular embolization for iatrogenic vertebral artery injury at C5-C6 during an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. A 61-year-old man had an intraoperative injury of the right vertebral artery that occurred during anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C5-C6. Hemorrhage was not controlled successfully by packing with surgical hemostatic agents. While the patient was still intubated, an emergency angiogram was performed. The patient underwent endovascular occlusion of the right V2 segment with coils. After the procedure, his course was uneventful and he did not show any neurologic deficits. Brain computed tomographic scans taken 3 days after the operation revealed a right cerebellar infarction. Anti-coagulation medication was administered, and at 3-month follow-up examination, he had no neurologic sequelae in spite of the cerebellar infarction.","1447":"Stent assisted coiling on intracranial broad neck aneurysm has been considered as an effective technique and has made the complex aneurysms amenable to coiling. However, stent navigation and application themselves often have the problems especially when the parent vessel angle (entrance between afferent and efferent vessel) is over 90 degrees. We report here a case of a ruptured broad neck basilar top aneurysm that was successfully coiled using two self-expandable stents (Enterprise and Neuroform) placed in a fashion of modified Y-configured stents with waffle cone technique.","1448":"Patients with asymptomatic chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) are prone to fall or slip. Acute trauma on these patients may develop acute subdural bleeding over the chronic SDH. We recently experienced 9 patients with acute-on-chronic SDH. We report the clinical and radiological features of this lesion. We retrospectively examined the computed tomographic (CT) scans of 107 consecutive patients who diagnosed as chronic SDH from January 2008 to December 2010. All cases of CSDH were diagnosed on CT with or without MRI scan. Acute-on-chronic SDH is not rare, being 8% of chronic SDH. The most common cause of trauma was a slip in drunken state. Alcoholism with multiple episodes of trauma was one of the prominent histories. Acute-on-chronic SDH appeared as a hyperdense layer of clot with irregular blurred margin or lumps in liquefied hematoma. Single or two burr holes was usually effective to remove the hematoma. Repeated trauma may cause acute bleeding over the chronic SDH. It will be helpful to understand the role of repeated trauma as a mechanism of hematoma enlargement.

CNV can change biological function and contribute to pathophysiological conditions of human disease. Its relationship with common, complex human disease in particular is not fully understood. Here, we searched the human genome to identify copy number variants that predispose to moya-moya type cerebrovascular disease. We retrospectively analyzed patients who had unilateral or bilateral steno-occlusive lesions at the cerebral artery from March, 2007, to September, 2009. For the 20 subjects, including patients with moyamoya type pathologies and three normal healthy controls, we divided the subjects into 4 groups : typical moyamoya (n=6), unilateral moyamoya (n=9), progression unilateral to typical moyamoya (n=2) and non-moyamoya (n=3). Fragmented DNA was hybridized on Human610Quad v1.0 DNA analysis BeadChips (Illumina). Data analysis was performed with GenomeStudio v2009.1, Genotyping 1.1.9, cnvPartition_v2.3.4 software. Overall call rates were more than 99.8%. In total, 1258 CNVs were identified across the whole genome. The average number of CNV was 45.55 per subject (CNV region was 45.4). The gain\/loss of CNV was 52\/249, having 4.7 fold higher frequencies in loss calls. The total CNV size was 904,657,868, and average size was 993,038. The largest portion of CNVs (613 calls) were 1M-10M in length. Interestingly, significant association between unilateral moyamoya disease (MMD) and progression of unilateral to typical moyamoya was observed. Significant association between unilateral MMD and progression of unilateral to typical moyamoya was observed. The finding was confirmed again with clustering analysis. These data demonstrate that certain CNV associate with moyamoya-type cerebrovascular disease.

Spinal mesenchymal chondrosarcomas are even rarer and, to the best of our knowledge those that are concomitantly located in the intradural and extradural regions, have never been reported. We report a case of a 25-year-old man with back pain and bilateral progressive weakness of the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a markedly enhanced dumbbell-shaped mass at the T7 level. The lesion was intradurally located at the left side of the spinal cord, and extended extradurally to the extraforminal space through the T7-8 intervertebral foramen. The tumor was completely excised through a posterior approach. Microscopic examination and immunohistochemical studies confirmed mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy were also performed to prevent local recurrence and metastasis. The patient has been symptom-free for two years after surgery. Herein, we reviewed and discussed the clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of primary intraspinal mesenchymal chondrosarcomas in the literature.","1458":null,"1459":"There are few reported cases of post-operative spondylitis caused by Mycobacterium intracellulare. A 75-year-old female presented to our hospital with low back pain and paraparesis after a fall. The radiologic examination revealed compression fractures of L1, L3 and L4 and an epidural hematoma compressing the spinal cord. The dark-red epidural hematoma was urgently evacuated. Four weeks post-operatively, neurologic deficits recurred with fever. On magnetic resonance image, an epidural abscess and osteomyelitis were detected in the previous operative site. Five weeks post-operatively, revision was performed with multiple biopsies. The specimen were positive for acid-fast bacilli and traditional anti-tuberculous medications were started. Because the Polymerase Chain Reaction for non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) was positive, the anti-tuberculous medications were changed to anti-NTM drugs. However, the neurologic deficits did not improve and persistent elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were noted. Eight weeks after the revision, Mycobacterium intracellulare was detected in the specimen cultures. Despite supportive care with medication, the patient died due to multiple organ failure.","1460":"A rare case of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage from newly developed cerebral aneurysm in glioblastoma patient is presented. A 57-year-old man was presented with headache and memory impairment. On the magnetic resonance image and the magnetic resonance angiography, a large enhancing mass was found at right frontal subcortex and intracranial aneurysm was not found. The mass was removed subtotally and revealed as glioblastoma. He took concurrent PCV chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but the mass recurred one month later after radiotherapy. He was then treated with temozolomide for 7 cycles. Three months after the completion of temozolomide therapy, he suffered from a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a rupture of a small de novo aneurysm at distal anterior cerebral artery.

A total of 38 patients diagnosed and treated with RFT as an idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia were investigated. To minimize the risks related to conventional technique based on cutaneous landmarks, and to eliminate the need to frequent reposition of cannula, we adopted a technique of image-guided fluoroscopic cannulation of the foramen ovale. To minimize sensory complication following thermal lesion, our target response was a generation of a lesion with mild to moderate hypalgesia rather than dense hypalgesia. The immediate pain-relief was achieved in all patients underwent RFT. With mean duration of follow-up of 38.2 months (range,12-72), 11 (28.9%) experienced recurrence of pain. The mean timing of recurrence was 26.1 months (range,12-46). A 42.7% recurrence rate was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis for the 38 patients at 46 months; 20.2% within 2 years, 29.1% within 3 years. In the long-term, 27 patients (71%) and 6 patients (15.8%) showed Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) score I and BNI score II responses. 3 (7.9%) patients was assessed as BNI score III, 2 patients (5.3%) showed BNI score IV response. As a complication, troublesome dysesthesia occurred in 3 of 38 patients (7.9%), however, there was no permanent cranial nerve palsy or morbidity. These results indicates that RFT under fluoroscopic image-guided cannulation of foramen ovale is a safe, effective, and reliable means of treating trigeminal neuralgia.

The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical technique and outcome of minimally invasive multi-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and to determine its efficacy. Forty-two patients who underwent mini-open PLIF using the percutaneous screw fixation system were studied. The mean age of the patients was 59.1 (range, 23 to 78 years). Two levels were involved in 32 cases and three levels in 10 cases. The clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS). Achievement of radiological fusion, intra-operative blood loss, the midline surgical scar and procedure related complications were also analyzed. The mean follow-up period was 25.3 months. The mean LBOS prior to surgery was 34.5, which was improved to 49.1 at the final follow up. The mean pain score (VAS) prior to surgery was 7.5 and it was decreased to 2.9 at the last follow up. The mean estimated blood loss was 238 mL (140-350) for the two level procedures and 387 mL (278-458) for three levels. The midline surgical scar was 6.27 cm for two levels and 8.25 cm for three level procedures. Complications included two cases of asymptomatic medial penetration of the pedicle border. However, there were no signs of neurological deterioration or fusion failure. Multi-level, minimally invasive PLIF can be performed effectively using the percutaneous transpedicular screw fixation system. It can be an alternative to the traditional open procedures. ","1464":"The goals of surgical intervention for metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) are prolonging survival and improving quality of life. Non-ambulatory paraplegic patients, either at presentation or after treatment, have a much shorter life expectancy than ambulatory patients. We therefore analyzed prognostic factors for survival and postoperative ambulation in patients surgically treated for MSCC. We assessed 103 patients with surgically treated MSCC who presented with lower extremity weakness between January 2001 and December 2008. Factors prognostic for overall survival (OS) and postoperative ambulation, including surgical method, age, sex, primary tumor site, metastatic spinal site, surgical levels, Tokuhashi score, and treatment with chemo- or radiation therapy, were analyzed retrospectively. Median OS was significantly longer in the postoperatively ambulatory group [11.0 months; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.29-12.71 months] than in the non-ambulatory group (5.0 months; 95% CI, 1.80-8.20 months) (p=0.035). When we compared median OS in patients with high (9-11) and low (0-8) Tokuhashi scores, they were significantly longer in the former (15.0 months; 95% CI, 9.29-20.71 months vs. 9.0 months; 95% CI, 7.48-10.52 months; p=0.003). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative ambulation with or without aid [odds ratio (OR) 5.35; 95% CI 1.57-18.17; p=0.007] and hip flexion power greater than grade III (OR 6.23; 95% CI, 1.29-7.35; p=0.038) were prognostic of postoperative ambulation. We found that postoperative ambulation and preoperative high Tokuhashi score were significantly associated with longer patient survival. In addition, preoperative hip flexion power greater than grade III was critical for postoperative ambulation. ","1465":"The Histoculture Drug Response Assay (HDRA), which measures chemosensitivity using minced tumor tissue on drug-soaked gelfoam, has been expected to overcome the limitations of in vitro chemosensitivity test in part. We analyzed interim results of HDRA in malignant gliomas to see if the test can deserve further clinical trials. Thirty-three patients with malignant gliomas were operated and their tumor samples were examined for the chemosensitivity to 10 chosen drugs by HDRA. The most sensitive chemotherapy regimen among those pre-established was chosen based on the number of sensitive drugs or total inhibition rate (IR) of the regimen. The response was evaluated by 3 month magnetic resonance image. Among 13 patients who underwent total resection of the tumor, 12 showed no evidence of disease and one patient revealed progression. The response rate in 20 patients with residual tumors was 55% (3 complete and 8 partial responses). HDRA sensitivity at the cut-off value of more than one sensitive drug in the applied regimen showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 60% and predictability of 70%. Another cut-off value of &gt;80% of total IR revealed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 69%, and predictability of 80%. For 12 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients, median progression-free survival of the HDRA sensitive group was 21 months, while that of the non-sensitive group was 6 months (p=0.07). HDRA for malignant glioma was inferred as a feasible method to predict the chemotherapy response. We are encouraged to launch phase 2 clinical trial with chemosensitivity on HDRA.

This study was designed to evaluate morphological changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and assess profiles of pain behaviors following intraspinal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or quisqualate (QUIS) in rats. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups : a sham, and two experimental groups receiving injections of 125 mM NMDA or QUIS into their spinal dorsal horn. Following injection, hypersensitivity to cold and mechanical stimuli, and excessive grooming behaviors were assessed serially for four weeks. At the end of survival periods, morphological changes in the spinal cord were evaluated. Cold allodynia was developed in both the NMDA and QUIS groups, which was significantly higher in the QUIS group than in the NMDA group. The mechanical threshold for the ipsilateral hind paw in both QUIS and NMDA groups was significantly lower than that in the control group. The number of groomers was significantly higher in the NMDA group than in the QUIS group. The size of the neck region of the spinal dorsal horn, but not the superficial layer, was significantly smaller in the NMDA and QUIS groups than in the control group. Intraspinal injection of NMDA or QUIS can be used as an excitotoxic model of SCI for further research on spinal neuropathic pain.

HA-CMC was injected in 15 rats at a dose of 0.2 cc (HA-CMC group) and a saline solution of 0.2 cc in the other 15 rats (control group). Simple radiographs were taken until postoperative 9 weeks with an interval of one week. At postoperative 4 and 9 weeks, three dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) scanning was performed to observe the process of bone fusion. At 9 weeks, bone fusion was confirmed by gross examination and manual palpation. There were no statistically significant differences in bone fusion between the two groups. 3D CT scanning did not reveal significant differences between the groups. The gross examination and manual palpation after autopsy performed at 9 weeks confirmed bone union in 93.3% of both groups. The anti-adhesive material used for spinal surgery did not have adverse effects on spinal fusion in rats. ","1469":"Contrary to some clinical belief, there were quite a few studies regarding animal models of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in vivo suggesting that prior use of statins may improve outcome after ICH. This study reports the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, simvastatin given before experimental ICH. Fifty-one rats were subjected to collagenase-induced ICH, subdivided in 3 groups according to simvastatin treatment modality, and behavioral tests were done. Hematoma volume, brain water content and hemispheric atrophy were analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining for microglia (OX-42) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was performed and caspase-3 activity was also measured. Pre-simvastatin therapy decreased inflammatory reaction and perihematomal cell death, but resulted in no significant reduction of brain edema and no eNOS expression in the perihematomal region. Finally, prior use of simvastatin showed less significant improvement of neurological outcome after experimental ICH when compared to post-simvastatin therapy. The present study suggests that statins therapy after ICH improves neurological outcome, but prior use of statins before ICH might provide only histological improvement, providing no significant impact on neurological outcome against ICH.

Although many associated diseases have been suggested, the etiology of IHSP is not well understood. The ideal treatment is controversial. In the first case, a 55-year-old woman presented back pain, progressive paraparesis, both leg numbness, and voiding difficulty. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an anterior epidural mass lesion involving from C6 to mid-thoracic spine area with low signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighted images. We performed decompressive laminectomy and lesional biopsy. After operation, she was subsequently treated with steroid and could walk unaided. In the second case, a 45-year-old woman presented with fever and quadriplegia after a spine fusion operation due to lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative herniated lumbar disc. Initial MRI showed anterior and posterior epidural mass lesion from foramen magnum to C4 level. She underwent decompressive laminectomy and durotomy followed by steroid therapy. However, her conditions deteriorated gradually and medical complications occurred. In our cases, etiology was not found despite through investigations. Initial MRI showed dural thickening with mixed signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Pathologic examination revealed chronic nonspecific inflammation in both patients. Although one patient developed several complications, the other showed slow improvement of neurological symptoms with decompressive surgery and steroid therapy. In case of chronic compressive myelopathy due to the dural hypertrophic change, decompressive surgery such as laminectomy or laminoplasty may be helpful as well as postoperative steroid therapy.","1472":"A lesion that is hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map is a characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding in acute ischemic infarction. In some cases, however, these findings can persist for a few months after infarct onset. It is thought that these finding reflect the different evolution speeds of the infarcted tissue. We report a patient with a right middle cerebral artery territory infarction with persistent hyperintensity on DWI and hypointensity on the ADC map for over 8 months. To our knowledge, this is the most persistent case of hyperintensity lesion on DWI and the serial MRI images of this patient provide important information on the evolution of infarcted tissue.","1473":"Leptomeningeal metastasis is a devastating complication of advanced stage cancer. It is frequently accompanied by hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension that must be treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunts. However, there are actual risks of peritoneal seeding or accumulation of malignant ascites after the cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure, though it has not been reported. Here, we present the case of a patient with non-small cell lung cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis in whom malignant ascites developed after a subduroperitoneal shunt.","1474":"The authors report a case of atypical extraventricular neurocytoma (EVN) transformed from EVN which had been initially diagnosed as an oligodendroglioma 15 years ago. An 8-year-old boy underwent a surgical resection for a right frontal mass which was initially diagnosed as oligodendroglioma. When the tumor recurred 15 years later, a secondary operation was performed, followed by salvage gamma knife treatment. The recurrent tumor was diagnosed as an atypical EVN. The initial specimen was reviewed and immunohistochemistry revealed a strong positivity for synaptophysin. The diagnosis of the initial tumor was revised as an EVN. The patient maintained a stable disease state for 15 years after the first operation, and was followed up for one year without any complications or disease progression after the second operation. We diagnosed an atypical extraventricular neurocytoma transformed from EVN which had been initially diagnosed as an oligodendroglioma 15 years earlier. We emphasize that EVN should be included in the differential diagnosis of oligodendroglioma.","1475":"The purpose of this study was to determine the anatomic relationships between neurovascular structures and the transverse carpal ligament so as to avoid complications during endoscopic carpal tunnel surgery. Twenty-eight patients (age range, 35-69 years) with carpal tunnel syndrome were entered into the study. We examined through wrist magnetic resonance imaging in three different positions (neutral, radial flexion, and ulnar flexion) and determined several anatomic landmark (distance from the hamate hook to the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and ulnar vessel) based on the lateral margin of the hook of the hamate. The median nerve and ulnar neurovascular structure were studied with the wrist in the neutral, ulnar, and radial flexion positions. The ulnar neurovascular structures usually passed just over or ulnar to the hook of the hamate. However, in 12 hands, a looped ulnar artery coursed 0.6-3.3 mm radial to the hook of the hamate and continued to the superficial palmar arch. The looped ulnar artery migrates on the ulnar side of Guyon's canal (-5.2-1.8 mm radial to the hook of the hamate) with the wrist in radial flexion. During ulnar flexion of the wrist, the ulnar artery shifts more radially beyond the hook of the hamate (-2.5-5.7 mm). It is appropriate to transect the ligament greater than 4 mm apart from the lateral margin of the hook of the hamate without placing the edge of the scalpel toward the ulnar side. We would also recommend not transecting the transverse carpal ligament in the ulnar flexed wrist position to protect the ulnar neurovascular structure. ","1476":"Posttraumatic cerebral infarction (PTCI), an infarction in well-defined arterial distributions after head trauma, is a known complication in patients with severe head trauma. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiographic characteristics of PTCI, and to assess the effect on outcome of decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) in patients with PTCI. We present a retrospective analysis of 20 patients with PTCI who were treated between January 2003 and August 2005. Twelve patients among them showed malignant PTCI, which is defined as PTCI including the territory of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). Medical records and radiologic imaging studies of patients were reviewed. Infarction of posterior cerebral artery distribution was the most common site of PTCI. Fourteen patients underwent DHC an average of 16 hours after trauma. The overall mortality rate was 75%. Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) of survivors showed that one patient was remained in a persistent vegetative state, two patients were severely disabled and only two patients were moderately disabled at the time of discharge. Despite aggressive treatments, all patients with malignant PTCI had died. Malignant PTCI was the indicator of poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at the admission was the most valuable prognostic factor. Significant correlation was observed between a GCS less than 5 on admission and high mortality (p&lt;0.05). In patients who developed non-malignant PTCI and GCS higher than 5 after head injury, early DHC and duroplasty should be considered, before occurrence of irreversible ischemic brain damage. High mortality rate was observed in patients with malignant PTCI or PTCI with a GCS of 3-5 at the admission. A large prospective randomized controlled study will be required to justify for aggressive treatments including DHC and medical treatment in these patients. ","1477":"We investigated the clinical and radiological advantages of unilateral laminectomy in posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) procedure comparing with bilateral laminectomy, under the same procedural condition including bilateral instrumentation and insertion of two cages, in patients with degenerative lumbar disease with unilateral leg symptoms. We retrospectively reviewed 124 consecutive cases of PLIF via unilateral or bilateral approach between January 2006 and April 2010. In 80 cases (bilateral group), two cages were inserted via bilateral laminectomy, and in 44 cases (unilateral group), via unilateral laminectomy. The average follow-up duration was 29.5 months. The clinical outcomes were evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The fusion rates and disc space heights were determined by dynamic standing radiographs and\/or computed tomography. Operative times, intra-operative and post-operative blood losses and hospitalization periods were also evaluated. In clinical evaluation, the VAS and ODI scores showed excellent outcomes in both groups. There were no significant differences in term of fusion rate, but the perioperative blood loss and the operative time of the unilateral group were lower than that of the bilateral group. Unilateral laminectomy can minimize the operative time and perioperative blood loss in PLIF procedure. However, the different preoperative disc height between two groups is a limitation of this study. Despite this limitation, solid fusion and satisfactory symptomatic improvement could be achieved uniquely by our surgical method. This surgical method can be an alternative surgical technique in patients with unilateral leg pain.

We evaluated and compared the cadaveric allograft and titanium cages used to reconstruct, maintain alignment and achieve fusion in the management of pyogenic spinal infection. There were 33 patients with pyogenic osteomyelitis underwent fusion in this study. Fifteen of the 33 patients were operated on by fusion with allografts (cadaveric patella bones) and 18 of those were operated with titanium mesh cages filled with autologous cancellous iliac bone. After the affected disc and vertebral body resection with pus drainage, cadaveric allograft or titanium cages were inserted into the resected space. Posterior transpedicular screw fixation and rod compression in resected space, where cadaveric allograft or titanium cages were inserted, was performed to prevent the malposition in all patients except in 1 case. Recurrent infection was identified by serial erythrocyte sedimentation rate and cross reactive protein follow-up. Osseous union and recurred infection available at a minimum of 2 years following operation was identified. The amount of kyphosis correction and the subsidence were measured radiographically. Spinal fusion was achieved in 29 of 33 patients. In the cadaveric allograft group, 93.3% of patient (14 of 15) showed the osseous union while 83.3% of patient (15 of 18) in the titanium cage group showed union. Subsidence was noted in 12 of the patients. Twelve patients (36.3%) showed unsettling amounts of subsidence postoperatively whereas 46.6% of patients in the cadaveric allograft group and 37.7% of patients in the titanium cage group showed similar subsidence, respectively. There were statistical difference in the fusion rate (p=0.397) and subsidence rate (p=0.276) between the two groups. There was significant statistical difference in the postoperative improvement of segmental kyphosis between the two groups (p=0.022), that is the improvement in sagittal alignment was greater in the titanium cage group than in the cadaveric allograft group. There was no case of recurred infection. The cadaveric allograft and titanium cages are effective and safe in restoring and maintaining sagittal plane alignment without increased incidence in infection recurrence in pyogenic osteomyelitis. The postoperative improvement of segmental kyphosis was better in the cage group.

The authors conducted a retrospective investigation of 31 consecutive patients with pyogenic thoracic and lumbar spondylitis who underwent continuous irrigation through laminotomy from 2004 to 2008. The study included 22 men and 9 women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean 58.1 years). The average follow-up duration was 13.4 months (range, 8-34 months). We performed debridement and abscess removal after simple laminotomy, and then washed out epidural and disc space using a continuous irrigation system. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered empirically and changed according to the subsequent culture result. Clinical outcomes were based on the low back outcome scale (LBOS), visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and Frankel grade at the last follow-up. Radiological assessment involved plain radiographs, including functional views. Common predisposing factors included local injection for pain therapy, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and liver cirrhosis. Causative microorganisms were identified in 22 cases (70.9%) : Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. were the main organisms. After surgery, LBOS, VAS score, and Frankel grade showed significant improvement in most patients. Spinal stability was maintained during the follow-up period, making secondary reconstructive surgery unnecessary for all patients, except one. Simple laminotomy with continuous irrigation by insertion of a catheter into intervertebral disc space or epidural space was minimally invasive and effective in the treatment of pyogenic spondylitis. This procedure could be a beneficial treatment option in patients with thoracolumbar spondylitis combined with minimal or moderate destructive change of vertebrae.

During the last 15 years, 20 consecutive patients with ruptured PICA aneurysms were treated and these patients were included in this study. The Fisher's exact test was used for the statistical significance of Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) according to initial Hunt-Hess (H-H) grade, treatment modalities, and the presence of acute hydrocephalus. Eleven (55%) and nine (45%) patients were treated with surgical clipping and endovascular treatment, respectively. Among 20 patients, thirteen (65.0%) patients had good outcomes (GOS 4 or 5). There was the statistical significance between initial poor H-H grade, the presence of acute hydrocephalus and poor GOS. In our study, we suggest that initial H-H grade and the presence of acute hydrocephalus may affect the clinical outcome rather than treatment modalities in the ruptured PICA aneurysms.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the accuracy and safety of these percutaneous ventriculostomies. A retrospectively review of medical records and head computed tomography scans were examined in 227 patients who underwent 250 freehand pass ventriculostomy catheter placements using two different methods at two institutions, between 2003 and 2009. Eighty-one patients underwent 101 ventriculostomies using Kocher's point (group 1), whereas 146 patients underwent 149 forehead ventriculostomies (group 2). In group 1, the catheter tip was optimally placed in either the ipsilateral frontal horn or the third ventricle, through the foramen of Monro (grade 1) in 82 (81.1%) procedures, in the contralateral lateral ventricle (grade 2) in 4 (3.9%), and into eloquent structures or non-target cerebrospinal space (grade 3) in 15 (14.8%). Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) &gt;1 mL developed in 5 (5.0%) procedures. Significantly higher incidences of optimal catheter placements were observed in group 2. ICH&gt;1 mL developed in 11 (7.4%) procedures in group 2, showing no significant difference between groups. In addition, the mean interval from the EVD to ventriculoperitoneal shunt was shorter in group 2 than in group 1, and the incidence of EVD-related infection was decreased in group 2. Accurate and safe ventriculostomies were achieved using both cranial sites, Kocher's point and the forehead. However, the forehead ventriculostomies provided more accurate ventricular punctures.

We have treated patients with hyperacute stroke by mechanical thrombolysis for 3 years. In current study, we analyzed the outcome of mechanical thrombolysis. From March 2008 to February 2011, 36 patients were treated with mechanical thrombolysis. Initially we treated the patients by aggressive mechanical clot disruption (AMCD) who were admitted within 6 hours after the symptom onset. If revascularization was not achieved, balloon angioplasty was performed, followed by stenting or temporary endovascular bypass was performed. The result in 15 cases was not so successful. Since then, we started using the thromboaspiration method as the first line treatment of the mechanical thrombolysis. After using the thromboaspiration, we had better results in recanalization rate, modified Rankin Score (mRS) and reperfusion injury compared to AMCD. The recanalization rate was 80.85%, mRS is 2.85, and there was only 0.09% hemorrhagic formation. Even though thromboaspiration is not statistically significant due to the limited numbers of patients enrolled in this study, we think it is a good way in mechanical thronbolysis for hyperacute stroke. ","1486":"Intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) therapy combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is one of the major treatment modalities for leukemia and lymphoma involving the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this study was to retrospectively determine the incidences of leukoencephalopathy and disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (DNL) following intrathecal MTX therapy for CNS lymphoma or leukemia and to assess the potential risk factors. Between January 2000 and August 2009, 143 patients with CNS lymphoma or leukemia received intrathecal MTX therapy alone or in combination with WBRT at a single institution. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically at regular two- or three-month intervals. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information regarding the patients' demographics, medical histories, radiologic characteristics, treatments, and clinical courses. On follow-up MR images, leukoencephalopathy was found in 95 of 143 patients (66.4%). The median time to develop leukoencephalopathy was 6.6 months. Among those with leukoencephalopathy, four patients showed seven extensive white-matter changes with strongly enhancing lesions demonstrating DNL. Histological confirmation was done in six lesions of three patients and radiological diagnosis alone in one patient. Four lesions spontaneously disappeared on MR images without any treatment, with a mean duration of 14 months before disappearance of DNL. Leukoencephalopathy is a common phenomenon that occurs following intrathecal MTX therapy; however, DNL occurs at a very low incidence. For newly developed enhancing lesions, consideration for the occurrence of DNL should be taken to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures or therapies. ","1487":"Brainstem metastases are rarely operable and generally unresponsive to conventional radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Recently, Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) was used as feasible treatment option for brainstem metastasis. The present study evaluated our experience of brainstem metastasis which was treated with GKRS. Between November 1992 and June 2010, 32 patients (23 men and 9 women, mean age 56.1 years, range 39-73) were treated with GKRS for brainstem metastases. There were metastatic lesions in pons in 23, the midbrain in 6, and the medulla oblongata in 3 patients, respectively. The primary tumor site was lung in 21, breast in 3, kidney in 2 and other locations in 6 patients. The mean tumor volume was 1,517 mm(3) (range, 9-6,000), and the mean marginal dose was 15.9 Gy (range, 6-23). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was obtained every 2-3 months following GKRS. Follow-up MRI was possible in 24 patients at a mean follow-up duration of 12.0 months (range, 1-45). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors. Follow-up MRI showed tumor disappearance in 6, tumor shrinkage in 14, no change in tumor size in 1, and tumor growth in 3 patients, which translated into a local tumor control rate of 87.5% (21 of 24 tumors). The mean progression free survival was 12.2 months (range, 2-45) after GKRS. Nine patients were alive at the completion of the study, and the overall mean survival time after GKRS was 7.7 months (range, 1-22). One patient with metastatic melanoma experienced intratumoral hemorrhage during the follow-up period. Survival was found to be associated with score of more than 70 on Karnofsky performance status and low recursive partitioning analysis class (class 1 or 2), in terms of favorable prognostic factors. GKRS was found to be safe and effective for management of brainstem metastasis. The integral clinical status of patient seems to be important in determining the overall survival time.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and to determine their relationship with disruption of endothelial blood-barrier after photochemically induced SCI in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g (aged 8 weeks) received focal spinal cord ischemia by photothrombosis using Rose Bengal. Expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by Western blot and gelatin zymography at various times from 6 h to 7 days. Endothelial blood-barrier integrity was assessed indirectly using spinal cord water content. Zymography and Western blot analysis demonstrated rapid up-regulation of MMP-9 protein levels in spinal cord after ischemic onset. Expressions and activities of MMP-9 showed a significant increased at 6 h after the photothrombotic ischemic event, and reached a maximum level at 24 h after the insult. By contrast, activated MMP-2 was not detected at any time point in either the experimental or the control groups. When compared with the control group, a significant increase in spinal cord water content was detected in rats at 24 h after photothrombotic SCI. Early up-regulation of MMP-9 might be correlated with increased water content in the spinal cord at 24 h after SCI in rats. Results of this study suggest that MMP-9 is the key factor involved in disruption of the endothelial blood-barrier of the spinal cord and subsequent secondary damage after photothrombotic SCI in rats. ","1490":"Pituitary apoplexy is life-threatening clinical syndrome caused by the rapid enlargement of a pituitary tumor due to hemorrhage and\/or infarction. The pathogenesis of pituitary apoplexy is not completely understood. We analyzed the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pituitary tumors and subsequently correlated the radiological findings with the clinical presentation. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was also performed to determine whether certain biomarkers are related to radiological apoplexy. Thirty-four cases of pituitary adenoma were enrolled for retrospective analysis. In this study, the radiological apoplexy was defined as cases where hemorrhage, infarction or cysts were identified on MRI. Acute clinical presentation was defined as the presence of any of the following symptoms: severe sudden onset headache, decreased visual acuity and\/or visual field deficit, and acute mental status changes. Angiogenesis was quantified by immunohistochemical expression of fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1), neuropilin (NRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, while microvascular density (MVD) was assessed using Endoglin and CD31. Clinically, fourteen patients presented with acute symptoms and 20 for mild or none clinical symptoms. Radiologically, fifteen patients met the criteria for radiological apoplexy. Of the fifteen patients with radiologic apoplexy, 9 patients presented acute symptoms whereas of the 19 patient without radiologic apoplexy, 5 patients presented acute symptoms. Of the five biomarkers tracked, only VEGF was found to be positively correlated with both radiological and nonradiological apoplexy. While pituitary apoplexy is currently defined in cases where clinical symptoms can be histologically confirmed, we contend that cases of radiologically identified pituitary hemorrhages that present with mild or no symptoms should be designated subacute or subclinical apoplexy. VEGF is believed to have a positive correlation with pituitary hemorrhage. Considering the high rate of symptomatic or asymptomatic pituitary tumor hemorrhage, additional studies are needed to detect predictors of the pituitary hemorrhage.

An autologous epidural blood patch at the CSF-leak site can effectively relieve SIH. We report a case of bilateral SDH with SIH caused by a CSF leak originating at the C1-2 level. A 55-year-old male complained of orthostatic headache without neurological signs. His symptoms did not respond to conservative treatments including bed rest, hydration and analgesics. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the bilateral fronto-parietal region, and computed tomography (CT) myelography showed a CSF leak originating at the C1-2 level.

An 18-month-old girl visited our clinic due to rapid growing orange-yellowish lesion on scalp. Enlarging time from 1 mm to 12 mm was just 8 weeks. We excised the tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Histopathological study showed numerous eosinophils and Touton giant cells within the lesion. Immunohistochemical study revealed positive immunoreactivity for CD68 in most areas. No recurrence was seen during 12 months after resection. We report a case with rapidly growing JXG on scalp with peculiar histopathologic findings.","1493":"Spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) is an extremely uncommon condition. Causative factors include trauma, anticoagulant drug administration, hemostatic disorders, and vascular disorders such as arteriovenous malformations and lumbar punctures. Of SSDH cases, those that do not have any traumatic event can be considered cases of nontraumatic acute spinal subdural hematoma, which is known to have diverse clinical progress. Treatment typically consists of surgical decompression and cases in which the condition is relieved with conservative treatment are rarely reported. We report two nontraumatic acute spinal subdural hematoma patients who were successfully treated without surgery.","1494":"A 50-year-old man presented bilateral hypesthesia on and below the T6 dermatome and paresthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intraspinal extradural tumor, which located from the 6th thoracic vertebral body to the upper margin of the 7th vertebral body, continuing dumbbell-like through the intervertebral foramen into the right middle thorax suggesting a neurogenic tumor (neurofibroma or neurilemmoma). With the patient in a prone position, we exposed and excised the tumor via a one stage posterior approach through a hemi-laminictomy of T6. Histologic examination showed a grade 1 meningothelial meningioma, according to the World Health Organization classification. Initially, we assumed the mass was a schwannoma because of its location and dumbbell shape. However, the tumor was actually a meningioma. Postoperatively, hypesthesia resolved completely and motor power of the leg gradually full recovered. A postoperative MRI revealed no evidence of residual tumor.","1495":"Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are abnormal arteriovenous connections that lie within the dura. Intraosseous DAVFs involving diploic venous system are extremely rare. A 46-year-old woman presented with headache and right pulsatile tinnitus for three weeks. The tinnitus started after yelling. Digital subtraction angiography revealed DAVF within the basal portion of right parietal bone along the middle meningeal artery (MMA) groove. The fistula was fed by frontal branch of right MMA and drained into right transverse sigmoid sinus junction through dilated middle meningeal vein. The intraosseous DAVF involving diploic vein was successfully obliterated with Onyx embolization via transarterial route.","1496":"We report a rare case of Williams syndrome accompanying moyamoya disease in whom postoperative global cerebral infarction occurred unpredictably. Williams syndrome is an uncommon hereditary disorder associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. To our knowledge, our case report is the second case of Williams syndrome accompanying moyamoya disease. A 9-year-old boy was presented with right hemiparesis after second operation for coarctation of aorta. He was diagnosed as having Williams syndrome at the age of 1 year. Brain MRI showed left cerebral cortical infarction, and angiography showed severe stenosis of bilateral internal carotid arteries and moyamoya vessels. To reduce the risk of furthermore cerebral infarction, we performed indirect anastomosis successfully. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well, but at postoperative third day, without any unusual predictive abnormal findings the patient's pupils were suddenly dilated. Brain CT showed the global cerebral infarction. Despite of vigorous treatment, the patient was not recovered and fell in brain death one week later. We suggest that in this kind of labile patient with Williams syndrome accompanying moyamoya disease, postoperative sedation should be done with more thorough strict patient monitoring than usual moyamoya patients. Also, we should decide the revascularization surgery more cautiously than usual moyamoya disease. The possibility of unpredictable postoperative ischemic complication should be kept in mind.","1497":"Authors report a case of a painless acute dissecting aneurysm of the descending aorta in a patient who presented with unexplained hypotension followed by simultaneous paraplegia and right arm monoparesis. To our knowledge, case like this has not been reported previously. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine revealed hemodynamic cerebral infarction and extensive cord ischemia, respectively. Computerized tomography angiography confirmed a dissecting aneurysm of the descending aorta. The cause of the brain infarction may not have been embolic, but hemodynamic one. Dissection-induced hypotension may have elicited cerebral perfusion insufficiency. The cause of cord ischemia may be embolic or hemodynamic. The dissected aorta was successfully replaced into an artificial patch graft. The arm monoparesis was improved, but the paraplegia was not improved. In rare cases of brain and\/or spinal cord infarction caused by painless acute dissecting aneurysm of the aorta, accurate diagnosis is critical because careless thrombolytic therapy can result in life-threatening bleeding.","1498":"Intracranial pial arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are rare vascular lesions of the brain. These lesions consist of one or more arterial connection to a single venous channel without true intervening nidus. A 24-year-old woman visited to our hospital because of headache, vomiting, dizziness and memory disturbance that persisted for three days. She complained several times of drop attack because of sudden weakness on both leg. Cerebral angiograms demonstrated a giant venous aneurysm on right frontal lobe beyond the genu of corpus callosum, multiple varices on both frontal lobes fed by azygos anterior cerebral artery, and markedly dilated draining vein into superior sagittal sinus, suggesting single channel pial AVF with multiple varices. Transarterial coil embolization of giant aneurysm and fistulous portion resulted in complete disappearance of pial AVF without complication.","1499":"Two-thirds of ependymomas arise in the infratentorial or intraventricles, whereas one-third are located supratentorially. But supratentorial \"cortical\" ependymomas are very rare. We report a case of a cortical ependymoma in a 21-month-old boy. The patient presented with simple partial seizures. This tumor was located in the postcentral gyrus and he had gross total excision. Microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed grade II differentiation ependymoma.","1500":"Clear cell ependymomas (CCEs) are rare variants of ependymomas. Tumors show anaplastic histological features and behave as an aggressive manner. CCEs have a predilection for extraneural metastases and early recurrence, and they demonstrate characteristic radiographic features. These tumors should be radiologically and pathologically differentiated from oligodendrogliomas. On microscopic examination, CCEs are composed of sheets of cells and resemble oligodendroglioma. However, upon closer examination, the nature of CCEs can be detected earlier, resulting in prompt treatment of the tumor. Although we report only one case, we emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Future description of more cases of these rare cancers is necessary to aid in their diagnosis and treatment.","1501":"Radiation therapy has been widely applied for cancer treatment. Childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), characterized by frequent central nervous system involvement, is a well documented disease for the effect of prophylactic cranio-spinal irradiation. Irradiation, however, acts as an oncogenic factor as a delayed effect and it is rare that glioblastoma multiforme develops during the remission period of ALL. We experienced a pediatric radiation-induced GBM patient which developed during the remission period of ALL, who were primarily treated with chemotherapeutic agents and brain radiation therapy for the prevention of central nervous system (CNS) relapse.

However, there are few clinical series describing the epidural fluid collection (EFC) as complication of cranioplasty. This study was planned to identify the predictive factors and fate of EFC after cranioplasty. We reviewed retrospectively the demographic, clinical, and radiographic data in 59 patients who underwent a first cranioplsty following decompressive craniectomy during a period of 6 years, from January 2004 to December 2009. We compared demographic, clinical, and radiographic factors between EFC group and no EFC group. The predictive factors associated with the development of EFC were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Overall, 22 of 59 patients (37.3%) suffered from EFC following cranioplasty. EFC had disappeared (n=6, 31.8%) or regressed (n=6, 31.8%) over time on follow up brain computed tomographic (CT) scans. However, 5 patients (22.7%) required reoperation due to symptomatic and persistent EFC. Predictive factors for EFC were male [odds ratio (OR), 5.48; 95% CI, 1.26-23.79], air bubbles in the epidural space (OR, 12.52; 95% CI, 2.26-69.28), and dural calcification on postoperative brain CT scan (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.12-15.84). The most of EFCs could be treated by conservative therapy. Air bubble in the epidural space and dural calcification are proposed to be the predictive factors in the formation of EFC after cranioplasty.

We reviewed the medical records of 182 patients who underwent surgery for a metastatic spinal tumor from January 1987 to January 2009 retrospectively. Twelve potential prognostic factors (age, gender, primary tumor, extent and location of spinal metastases, interval between primary tumor diagnosis and metastatic spinal cord compression, preoperative treatment, surgical approach and extent, preoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Nurick score, Tokuhashi and Tomita score) were investigated. The median survival of the entire patients was 8 months. Of the 182 patients, 80 (44%) died within 6 months after surgery, 113 (62%) died within 1 year after surgery, 138 (76%) died within 2 years after surgery. Postoperatively 47 (26%) patients had improvement in ambulatory function, 126 (69%) had no change, and 9 (5%) had deterioration. On multivariate analysis, better ambulatory outcome was associated with being ambulatory before surgery (p=0.026) and lower preoperative ECOG score (p=0.016). Survival rate was affected by preoperative ECOG performance status (p&lt;0.001) and Tomita score (p&lt;0.001). Survival after metastatic spinal tumor surgery was dependent on preoperative ECOG performance status and Tomita score. The ambulatory functional outcomes after surgery were dependent on preoperative ambulatory status and preoperative ECOG performance status. Thus, prompt decompressive surgery may be warranted to improve patient's survival and gait, before general condition and ambulatory function of patient become worse.

Nineteen patients with SCI were included in this study; ten patients with clinical improvement and nine without. The cortical sensorimotor activations were studied using the proprioceptive stimulation during the fMRI. Diagnostic accuracy of fMRI with neurological improvement was 70.0% and 44.4% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Signal activation in the ipsilateral motor cortex in fMRI was commonly observed in the clinically neurological improved group (p-value=0.002). Signal activation in the contralateral temporal lobe and basal ganglia was more commonly found in the neurological unimproved group (p-value&lt;0.001). Signal activation in other locations was not statistically different. In patients with SCI, activation patterns of fMRI between patients with neurologic recovery and those without varied. Such plasticity should be considered in evaluating SCI interventions based on behavioral and neurological measurements.

Sixty patients who underwent posterior lumbar instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar disease at our institution from September 2007 to January 2008 were enrolled in this study. Out of sixty patients, thirty patients received IV PCA group and thirty patients received epidural PCA group. The pain scale was measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) score. There were no significant difference between IV PCA group and epidural PCA group on the PCA related complications (p=0.7168). Ten patients in IV PCA group and six patients in epidural PCA group showed PCA related complications. Also, there were no significant differences in reduction of VAS score between two groups on postoperative 2 hours (p=0.9618) and 6 hours (p=0.0744). However, postoperative 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours showed the significant differences as mean of reduction of VAS score (p=0.0069, 0.0165, 0.0058 respectively). The epidural PCA is more effective method to control the post-operative pain than IV PCA after 12 hours of spinal fusion operation.

From June 2004 to October 2010, 25 spinal cord tumors were approached with unilateral hemilaminectomy. We calculated the cross-sectional occupying ratio (CSOR) of tumor to spinal canal before and after the operations. The locations of the tumors were intradural extramedullary in 20 cases, extradural in 2, and intramedullary in 3. The levels of the tumors were lumbar in 12, thoracic 9, and cervical 4. In all cases, the tumor was removed grossly and totally without damaging spinal cord or roots. The mean height and width of the lesions we195re 17.64 mm (3-47.5) and 12.62 mm (4-32.7), respectively. The mean CSOR was 69.40% (range, 27.8-96.9%). Postoperative neurological status showed improvement in all patients except one whose neurologic deficit remained unchanged. Postoperative spinal stability was preserved during the follow-up period (mean, 21.5 months) in all cases. Tumor recurrence did not develop during the follow-up period. Unilateral hemilaminectomy combined with microsurgical technique provides sufficient space for the removal of diverse spinal cord tumors. The basic profiles of the spinal cord tumors which can be removed through the unilateral hemilaminectomy demonstrate its role for the surgery of the benign spinal cord tumors in various sizes.

The study involved a retrospective analysis of 13 patients who underwent EC-IC bypass surgery using RAIG at a single neurosurgical institute between 2003 and 2009. The diseases comprised intracranial aneurysm (n=10), carotid artery occlusive disease (n=2), and delayed stenosis in the donor superficial temporal artery (STA) following previous STA-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery (n=1). Patients were followed clinically and radiographically. Bypass surgery was successful in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 53.4 months, the short-term patency rate was 100%, and the long-term rate was 92.3%. Twelve patients had an excellent clinical outcome of Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 5, and one case had GOS 3. Procedure-related complications were a temporary dysthesia on the graft harvest hand (n=1) and a hematoma at the graft harvest site (n=1), and these were treated successfully with no permanent sequelae.

This study was conducted to analyze energy metabolism, apoptotic signal pathways, and genetic changes in the hippocampus of the ischemic rat brain. Focal transient cerebral ischemia was induced by obstructing the middle cerebral artery for two hours. After 24 hours, the induction of ischemia was confirmed by the measurement of infarct size using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. A cDNA microarray assay was performed after isolating the hippocampus, and was used to examine changes in genetic expression patterns. According to the cDNA microarray analysis, a total of 1,882 and 2,237 genes showed more than a 2-fold increase and more than a 2-fold decrease, respectively. When the genes were classified according to signal pathways, genes related with oxidative phosphorylation were found most frequently. There are several apoptotic genes that are known to be expressed during ischemic brain damage, including Akt2 and Tnfrsf1a. In this study, the expression of these genes was observed to increase by more than 2-fold. As energy metabolism related genes grew, ischemic brain damage was affected, and the expression of important genes related to apoptosis was increased\/decreased. Our analysis revealed a significant change in the expression of energy metabolism related genes (Atp6v0d1, Atp5g2, etc.) in the hippocampus of the ischemic rat brain.

Expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, CD44 and RHAMM mRNA by invading glioma cells compared with tumor core was confirmed by realtime-PCR of twenty-four glioma specimens. Clinical data also were reviewed for invasion and recurrence pattern of the gliomas radiologically and invasive rim pattern microscopically. Overall results of the molecular analysis showed that relative overexpression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and RHAMM were noted at the invasive edge of human glioma specimens comparing to the tumor core but CD44 was highly expressed in the tumor core comparing to the margin. High marginal expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were noted in poorly ill-defined margin on the pathological finding. High marginal expression of CD44 and MMP-2 were demonstrated in the midline cross group on the radiological review, and that of RHAMM and MMP-2 were showed in the aggressive recurrence group. High expression of MMP-2 seems to be involved in the various invasion-related phenomenons.

She received temporary pain relief with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks twice. We performed pulsed radiofrequency treatment, and the pain declined to 25% of the maximal pain intensity. At 4 months after the procedure, the pain intensity did not aggravate without medication.

A 66-year-old woman was admitted presenting with lower extremity weakness and radiating pain in her left leg. Ten months before admission, the patient was diagnosed as having an L4-5 spinal stenosis and underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion followed by posterior fixation. Her symptoms had been sustained and she did not respond to transforaminal steroid injections. Repetitive injections (10 times) had been performed on the L4-5 level for six months. She had been taking bisphosphonate as an antiresorptive agent for ten months after surgery. Calcification in the ventral epidural and extraforaminal space was detected. The gritty particles were removed during decompressive surgery and these were proven to be a dystrophic calcification. The patient recovered from weakness and radiating leg pain. Repetitive triamcinolone acetonide injections after discectomy may be the cause of dystrophic calcification not only in the degenerated residual disc, but also in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Possible mechanisms may include the toxicity of preservatives and the insolubility of triamcinolone acetonide. We should consider that repetitive triamcinolone injections in the postdisectomy state may cause intraspinal ossification and calcification.","1520":"Spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL) is an overgrowth of the normally encapsulated adipose tissue in the epidural space around the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar spine causing compression of the neural components.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4-specific inhibitor, in a segmental spinal nerve ligation model in rats. Both the L5 and L6 spinal nerves of the left side of the rats were ligated. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (rolipram) and saline (vehicle) were administered intraperitoneally. We measured mechanical allodynia using von Frey filaments and a nerve conduction study. The mechanical allodynia, which began to manifest on the first day, peaked within 2 days. Multiple intraperitoneal injections of rolipram ameliorated the mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, an intraperitoneal administration of rolipram improved the development of pain behavior and nerve conduction velocity.

Among these patients, 11 received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) before the development of metastatic lesions (PCI group), and GKRS was performed as an initial treatment for newly diagnosed lesions in 12 patients who had not received PCI (primary GKRS group). In addition, GKRS was performed as a salvage treatment for progressive lesions after WBRT in 27 patients (salvage GKRS group). The medical records and imaging data of all patients were retrospectively analyzed. The overall survival of the 50 patients was 20.8 months (range 1-53) after the diagnosis of primary tumor and 12.0 months (range 1-47) after the development of cerebral metastasis. Median survival after GKRS was 4.8 months (range 1-15) in the PCI group, 4.6 months (range 0-18) in the primary GKRS group, and 7.6 months (range 0-33) in the salvage GKRS group. Further treatment for progressive lesions after GKRS was necessary in 15 patients, after a mean interval of 3.8 months.

Five years previously, he underwent a percutaneous vertebroplasty for an osteoporotic L1 compression fracture, and was diagnosed with AS at that time. Plain radiographs showed aggravated kyphosis and a stress fracture through the ossified posterior element, below the prior vertebroplasty. Magnetic resonance images revealed a right foraminal cystic lesion at the L2-L3 level with effacement of the nerve root. A 1.6 cm cystic lesion that appeared to arise from the L2-L3 facet joint without direct communication was excised from the L2-L3 foramen. Pathological examination confirmed synovial cyst.

A 19-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a chief complaint of dizziness and facial numbness on the right side. His illness had begun two years previously with sudden hearing loss on the right side, for which he had been treated as an idiopathic sudden hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal signals located mainly in the right middle cerebellar peduncle. We performed partial resection of the tumor by suboccipital craniotomy. The histopathological diagnosis was medulloblastoma. Intrinsic brain tumor is an extremely rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and is therefore easily overlooked as was in the present case. The present case highlights not only the need to evaluate patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss by magnetic resonance imaging but also the importance of paying attention to intrinsic lesions involving the brainstem. Although this condition like the presented case might be rare, intrinsic brain tumor should be considered as a potential cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, as it may be easily missed leading to a delay in appropriate treatment.","1538":null,"1539":"Abnormal contrast enhancement on brain computed tomography (CT) scan after diagnostic or interventional angiography is not rare, and has known to be induced by temporary blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption from contrast media.

The distance from the medial margin of the SG to the medial margin of the corresponding rib head was 4.2 mm on T1, 5.9 mm, and 6.3 mm on T2, T3. The mean distance from the medial margin of the SG to the lateral margin of the longus colli muscle was 6.7 mm on T1, 8.8 mm, 9.9 and mm on T2, T3. The mean distance between the prominent point of the rib head and the lateral margin of the longus colli muscle was 4.8 mm on T1, 4.6 mm, and 5.9 mm on T2, T3. The mean width of SG was 6.1 mm on T1, 4.1 mm, and 3.1 mm on T2, T3. We present morphometric data to assist in surgical planning and the localization of the upper thoracic SG during thoracoscopic sympathectomy. ","1543":"The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography for confirmation of vascular anastomosis patency in both extracranial-intracranial and intracranial-intracranial bypasses. Intraoperative ICG videoangiography was used as a surgical adjunct for 56 bypasses in 47 patients to assay the patency of intracranial vascular anastomosis. These patients underwent a bypass for cerebral ischemia in 31 instances and as an adjunct to intracranial aneurysm surgery in 25. After completion of the bypass, ICG was administered to assess the patency of the graft. The findings on ICG videoangiography were then compared to intraoperative and\/or postoperative imaging. ICG provided an excellent visualization of all cerebral arteries and grafts at the time of surgery. Four grafts were determined to be suboptimal and were revised at the time of surgery. Findings on ICG videoangiography correlated with intraoperative and\/or postoperative imaging. ICG videoangiography is rapid, effective, and reliable in determining the intraoperative patency of bypass grafts. It provides intraoperative information allowing revision to reduce the incidence of technical errors that may lead to early graft thrombosis. ","1544":"In the present study, authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of halo-vest immobilization (HVI) versus surgical fixation in patients with odontoid fracture after either non-surgical treatment (HVI) or with surgical fixation. From April 1997 to December 2008, we treated a total of 60 patients with upper cervical spine injuries. This study included 31 (51.7%) patients (22 men, 9 women; mean age, 39.3 years) with types II and III odontoid process fractures. The average follow-up was 25.1 months. We reviewed digital radiographs and analyzed images according to type of injury and treatment outcomes, following conservative treatment with HVI and surgical management with screw fixation. There were a total of 31 cases of types II and III odontoid process fractures (21 odontoid type II fractures, 10 type III fractures). Fifteen patients underwent HVI (10 type II fractures, 5 type III fractures). Nine (60%) out of 15 patients who underwent HVI experienced successful healing of odontoid fractures. The mean period for bone healing was 20.2 weeks. Sixteen patients underwent surgery including anterior screw fixation (6 cases), posterior C1-2 screw fixation (8), and transarticular screw fixation (2) for healing the odontoid fractures (11 type II fractures, 5 type III fractures). Fifteen (93.8%) out of 16 patients who underwent surgery achieved healing of cervical fractures. The average bone healing time was 17.6 weeks. The overall healing rate was 60% after HVI and 93.8% with surgical management. Patients treated with surgery showed a higher fusion rate and shorter bony healing time than patients who received HVI. However, prospective studies are needed in the future to define better optimal treatment and cost-effective perspective for the treatment of odontoid fractures. ","1545":"The purpose of the present study was to determine the incidence of dural tears and predictable factors suggesting dural tears in patients who had lumbar burst fractures with vertical laminar fractures. A retrospective review was done on thirty-one patients who underwent operative treatment for lumbar burst fractures with vertical laminar fractures between January 2003 and December 2008. All patients were divided into two groups according to existence of dural tears, which were surgically confirmed; 21 patients with dural tears and 10 patients without dural tears. Clinical and radiographic findings were analyzed for their association with dural tears. Among a total of 31 patients, dural tears were detected in 21 (67%) patients. A preoperative neurological deficits and mean separation distances of the edges in laminar fractures were found to be the reliable factors of dural tears (p=0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Decreased ratio of the central canal diameter and interpedicular distance were also the reliable factors suggesting dural tears (p=0.006 and 0.015, respectively). However, dural tears showed no significant association with age, sex, level of injury, absence of a posterior fat pad signal, the angle of retropulsed segment, or site of laminar fracture. Our study of lumbar burst fracture combined laminar fracture revealed that dural tears should be ruled out in cases of a preoperative neurological deficits, wide separation of the laminar fracture, severe canal encroachment, and wider interpedicular distance. ","1546":"Spontaneous acute subdural hematomas (aSDH) secondary to ruptured intracranial aneurysms are rarely reported. This report reviews the clinical features, diagnostic modalities, treatments, and outcomes of this unusual and often fatal condition. We performed a database search for all cases of intracranial aneurysms treated at our hospital between 2005 and 2010. Patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms who presented with aSDH on initial computed tomography (CT) were selected for inclusion. The clinical conditions, radiologic findings, treatments, and outcomes were assessed. A total of 551 patients were treated for ruptured intracranial aneurysms during the review period. We selected 23 patients (4.2%) who presented with spontaneous aSDH on initial CT. Ruptured aneurysms were detected on initial 3D-CT angiography in all cases. All ruptured aneurysms were located in the anterior portion of the circle of Willis. The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade on admission was V in 17 cases (73.9%). Immediate decompressive craniotomy was performed 22 cases (95.7%). Obliteration of the ruptured aneurysm was achieved in all cases. The Glasgow outcome scales for the cases were good recovery in 5 cases (21.7%), moderate disability to vegetative in 7 cases (30.4%), and death in 11 cases (47.8%). Spontaneous aSDH caused by a ruptured intracranial aneurysm is rare pattern of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. For early detection of aneurysm, 3D-CT angiography is useful. Early decompression with obliteration of the aneurysm is recommended. Outcomes were correlated with the clinical grade and CT findings on admission. ","1547":"There is no proven regimen to reduce the severity of stroke in patients with acute cerebral infarction presenting beyond the thrombolytic time window. Ozagrel sodium, a selective thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor, has been known to suppress the development of infarction. The antiplatelet effect is improved when aspirin is used together with a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor. Patients with non-cardiogenic acute ischemic stroke who were not eligible for thrombolysis were randomly assigned to two groups; one group received ozagrel sodium plus 100 mg of aspirin (group 1, n=43) and the other 100 mg of aspirin alone (group 2, n=43). Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, initial stroke severity [National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and motor strength scale] and stroke subtypes were analyzed in each group. Clinical outcomes were analyzed by NIHSS and motor strength scale at 14 days after the onset of stroke. There were no significant differences in the mean age, gender proportion, the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, stroke subtypes, and baseline neurological severity between the two groups. However, the clinical outcome for group 1 was much better at 14 days after the onset of stroke compared to group 2 (NIHSS score, p=0.007, Motor strength scale score, p&lt;0.001). There was one case of hemorrhagic transformation in group 1, but there was no statistically significant difference in bleeding tendency between two groups. In this preliminary study, thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor plus a low dose of aspirin seems to be safe and has a favorable outcome compared to aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke who presented beyond the thrombolytic time window.

Here, a 67-year-old woman with sudden foot drop on the left side is reported. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identified a foraminal gas containing lesion compressing the left L5 root at the L5-S1 foramen. The foraminal gas containing lesion compressing the L5 ganglion was successfully removed by the posterior approach. The histological diagnosis was a gas pseudocyst. This unique case of surgically proven gas pseudocyst indicates that it should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with sudden foot drop.","1549":"Sporadic osseous hemangioblastomas in the vertebra are extremely rare and they can be misdiagnosed as a vertebral hemangioma or metastasis in imaging studies. We report an intraosseous hemangioblastoma that arose from the 11th thoracic vertebra and was diagnosed initially as a metastasis in a patient with renal cell carcinoma. Diagnosis, surgical treatment and adjuvant radiosurgery of such case in reference to the literature are discussed.","1550":"A case of intradural extramedullary cavernous angioma is presented with headache, dizziness, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss caused by an intracranial superficial hemosiderosis. It was incidentally found in a patient with a 3-month history of sustained headache, dizziness and a 3-year history of hearing difficulty. The neurological examination was unremarkable in the lower extremity. MR images showed an intracranial superficial hemosiderosis mostly in the cerebellar region. Myelography and MR images of the thoracolumbar spine revealed an intradural extramedullary mass, which was pathologically proven to be a cavernous angioma. T12 total laminoplastic laminotomy and total tumor removal were performed without any neurologic deficits. The patient's symptoms, including headache and dizziness, have been absent for three years. Intradural extramedullary cavernous angioma can present with an intracranial superficial hemosiderosis as a result of chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage.","1551":"We report a case of a non traumatic spinal subdural hematoma or subarachnoid hematoma manifesting as lumbago, leg pain and bladder dysfunction that showed angiographically occult vascular malformation (AOVM). Although the spinal angiogram did not reveal any vascular abnormality, the follow-up magnetic resonance image showed AOVM. Complete surgical removal was performed due to the aggravated bladder dysfunction. This case highlights the need to consider bleeding due to spinal AOVM, even when angiography is negative.","1552":"Dissection of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is less frequent compared with dissection of the vertebrobasilar system or carotid artery. Recently, high-resolution cross sectional MR imaging (HRMRI) has emerged as a potential technique for atherosclerotic plaque imaging in MCA. We introduce the findings of HRMRI in a 56-year-old woman with traumatic MCA dissection. HRMRI showed an intimal flap and tapered pseudolumen with intraluminal hemorrhage. We performed stent deployment about MCA dissection after failed medical treatment. Three months later, there was no in-stent restenosis and no further neurological deficit were noted.","1553":"Angiocentric glioma was recently recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity in the 2007 World Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system. Typically, it presents with seizure in children and young adults. However, our patient did not have a history of seizure. Seizure did not occur up to 6 months after operation. Although it usually does not have calcification brain magnetic resonance imaging in our patient showed T1-hyperintense and T2-hypointense signals with calcification.","1554":"Cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) are benign gliomas predominantly found in the pediatric population. Intracranial hemorrhages are extremely rare in initial presentations of cerebellar PAs. There are no reports in the medical literature of adult cerebellar PA cases presenting with intratumoral hemorrhage. We report 2 cases of adult cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas with intratumoral hemorrhage. The first case is a 37-year-old woman presenting with severe headache, nausea, and vomitting. Computed tomography demonstrated an acute hemorrhage adjacent to the right cerebellar hemisphere and hydrocephalus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cerebellar vermian tumor with the hemorrhage as a mixed isointense area in the T2-weighted image, and as a mixed hyperintense area in the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image. The second case is a 53-year-old man presenting with headache for 3 weeks. MRI revealed a cerebellar hemispheric tumor with the hemorrhage as a mixed hyperintense area. It had a cystic mass with a heterogeneous enhanced mural nodule in the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image and a fluid-fluid level within the cyst in the T2-weighted image. Both of them underwent radical resections of their respective lesions. Histological examination of the specimens revealed typical astrocytoma, including a hemorrhagic portion. Both patients recovered postoperatively and continue to do well at present. The medical literature on hemorrhagic cerebellar PAs is also reviewed.","1555":"Ewing's sarcoma\/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES\/PNET) is an unusual malignancy with aggressive behavior. ES\/PNET in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is extremely uncommon, and we report on a rare case here. A 31-year-old man presented with one month history of left facial palsy, hearing loss, swallowing difficulty, and hoarseness. Magnetic resonance images showed a large mass in the left CPA and a small one in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The patient underwent a surgery for the CPA mass lesion, and the pathology was compatible with ES\/PNET. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy were administered. In contrast to the initial radiologic findings resembling vestibular schwannoma or meningioma, ES\/PNET had several distinct clinical features. A patient with a CPA mass and presenting unusual clinical features should be suspected of having a rare malignancy.","1556":"Subdural hygroma (SDG) is a complication occurring after head trauma that may occur secondary to decompressive craniectomy (DC). However, the mechanism underlying SDG formation is not fully understood. Also, the relationship between the operative technique of DC or the decompressive effect and the occurrence and pathophysiology of SDG has not been clarified. Purpose of this study was to investigate the risk factors of SDG after DC in our series. From January 2004 to December 2008, DC was performed in 85 patients who suffered from traumatic brain injury. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological features. For comparative analysis, we divided the patients into 2 groups : one group with SDG after craniectomy (19 patients; 28.4% of the total sample), the other group without SDG (48 patients; 71.6%). The risk factors for developing SDG were then analyzed. The mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores at discharge of the groups with and without SDG were 2.8 and 3.1, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). Analysis of radiological factors showed that a midline shift in excess of 5 mm on CT scans was present in 19 patients (100%) in the group with SDG and in 32 patients (66.7%) in the group without SDG (p&lt;0.05). An accompanying subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was seen in 17 patients (89.5%) in the group with SDG and in 29 patients (60.4%) in the group without SDG (p&lt;0.05). Delayed hydrocephalus accompanied these findings in 10 patients (52.6%) in the group with SDG, versus 5 patients (10.4%) in the group without SDG (p&lt;0.05). On CT, compression of basal cisterns was observed in 14 members (73.7%) in the group with SDG and in 18 members of the group without SDG (37.5%) (p&lt;0.007). Furthermore, tearing of the arachnoid membrane, as observed on CT, was more common in all patients in the group with SDG (100%) than in the group without SDG (31 patients; 64.6%) (p&lt;0.05). GOS showed statistically significant difference in the clinical risk factors for SDG between the group with SDG and the group without SDG. Analysis of radiological factors indicated that a midline shifting exceeding 5 mm, SAH, delayed hydrocephalus, compression of basal cisterns, and tearing of the arachnoid membrane were significantly more common in patients with SDG. ","1557":"This investigation was conducted to evaluate a new, safe entry point for the C2 pedicle screw, determined using the anatomical landmarks of the C2 lateral mass, the lamina, and the isthmus of the pars interarticularis. Fifteen patients underwent bilateral C1 lateral mass-C2 pedicle screw fixation, combined with posterior wiring. The C2 pedicle screw was inserted at the entry point determined using the following method : 4 mm lateral to and 4 mm inferior to the transitional point (from the superior end line of the lamina to the isthmus of the pars interarticularis). After a small hole was made with a high-speed drill, the taper was inserted with a 30 degree convergence in the cephalad direction. Other surgical procedures were performed according to Harm's description. Preoperatively, careful evaluation was performed with a cervical X-ray for C1-C2 alignment, magnetic resonance imaging for spinal cord and ligamentous structures, and a contrast-enhanced 3-dimensional computed tomogram (3-D CT) for bony anatomy and the course of the vertebral artery. A 3-D CT was checked postoperatively to evaluate screw placement. Bone fusion was achieved in all 15 patients (100%) without screw violation into the spinal canal, vertebral artery injury, or hardware failure. Occipital neuralgia developed in one patient, but this subsided after a C2 ganglion block. C2 transpedicular screw fixation can be easily and safely performed using the entry point of the present study. However, careful preoperative radiographic evaluation, regardless of methods, is mandatory.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the visual outcome after early transsphenoidal surgery for the patients with pituitary apoplexy. We retrospectively reviewed the 31 patients with pituitary apoplexy who were admitted due to acute visual acuity or field impairment and treated by transsphenoidal surgery. Five patients were excluded because of the decreased conscious level. The visual acuity of each individual eye was evaluated by Snellen's chart. Visual fields were also checked using automated perimetry. To compare the visual outcome according to the surgical timing, we divided the patients into 2 groups. The first group, 21 of the patients have been undertaken transsphenoidal approach (TSA) within at least 48 hours after admission. The second group included 8 patients who have been undertaken TSA beyond 48 hours. All patients were monitored at least 12 months after surgery. Patients were 21 males and 8 females (M : F=2.6 : 1) with the mean age of 42.4 years. Among the enrolled 29 patients, 26 patients presented with decreased visual acuity and 23 patients revealed the defective visual field respectively. Postoperatively, improvement in the visual acuity was seen in 15 patients (83.3%) who underwent surgery within the first 48 hours of presentation, as compared to those in whom surgery was delayed beyond 48 hours (n=5; 62.5%) (p=0.014). Improvement in the visual field deficits was observed in 15 (88.2%) of patients who had been operated on within the first 48 hours of presentation, as compared to those in whom surgery was delayed beyond 48 hours (n=3; 50.0%) (p=0.037). This study suggests that rapid transsphenoidal surgery is effective to recover the visual impairment in patients with pituitary apoplexy. If there are associated abnormalities of visual acuity or visual fields in patients with hemorrhagic pituitary apoplexy, early neurosurgical intervention within 48 hours should be also required to recover visual impairment.

A total of 20 rats were divided into two groups. The group A did not receive human amniotic membrane implantation after laminectomy and group B underwent human amniotic membrane implantation after laminectomy. Gross and microscopic findings were evaluated and compared at postoperative 1, 3 and 8 weeks. The amount of scar tissue and tenacity were reduced grossly in group of rats with human amniotic membrane implantation (group B). On a microscopic evaluation, there were less inflammatory cell infiltration and fibroblast proliferation in group B. This experimental study shows that implantation of irradiated freeze-dried human amniotic membrane reduce epidural fibrosis and adhesion after spinal laminectomy in a rat model. ","1563":"The prevalence of osteoporosis has been increasing globally. Recently surgical indications for elderly patients with osteoporosis have been increasing. However, only few strategies are available for osteoporotic patients who need spinal fusion. Osteoporosis is a result of negative bone remodeling from enhanced function of the osteoclasts. Because bone formation is the result of coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, anti-resorptive agents that induce osteoclast apoptosis may not be effective in spinal fusion surgery, necessitating new bone formation. Therefore, anabolic agents may be more suitable for osteoporotic patients who undergo spinal fusion surgery. The instrumentations and techniques with increased pullout strength may increase fusion rate through rigid fixation. Studies on new osteoinductive materials, methods to increase osteogenic cells, strengthened and biocompatible osteoconductive scaffolds are necessary to enable osteoporotic patients to undergo spinal fusion. When osteoporotic patients undergo spinal fusion, surgeons should consider appropriate osteoporosis medication, instrumentation and technique.","1564":"Thalamoperforating artery aneurysms are rarely reported in the literature. We report an extremely rare case of ruptured distal anterior thalamoperforating artery aneurysm which was treated by endovascular obliteration in a patient with occlusion of both the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) : A 72-year-old woman presented with severe headache and loss of consciousness. Initial level of consciousness at the time of admission was drowsy and the Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14. Brain computed tomography (CT) scan was performed which revealed intracerebral hemorrhage in right basal ganglia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. The location of the aneurysm was identified as within the globus pallidus on CT angiogram. Conventional cerebral angiogram demonstrated occlusion of both the ICAs just distal to the fetal type of posterior communicating artery and the aneurysm was arising from right anterior thalamoperforating artery (ATPA). A microcatheter was navigated into ATPA and the ATPA proximal to aneurysm was embolized with 20% glue. Post-procedural ICA angiogram demonstrated no contrast filling of the aneurysm sac. The patient was discharged without any neurologic deficit. Endovascular treatment of ATPA aneurysm is probably a more feasible and safe treatment modality than surgical clipping because of the deep seated location of aneurysm and the possibility of brain retraction injury during surgical operation.","1565":"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a relatively rare condition characterized by severe, paroxysmal episodes of lancinating pain in the tongue, throat, ear, and tonsil. This disorder is assumed to be due to compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve by vascular structures. A 47-year-old woman complaining of sharp and lancinating pain in the right periauricular and submandibular areas visited our hospital. Swallowing, chewing, and lying on her right side triggered the pain. Her neurologic examination revealed no specific abnormalities. The results of routine hematologic and blood chemistry studies were all within normal limits. Carbamazepine and gabapentin were given, but her symptoms persisted. Her pain was temporarily relieved only by narcotic pain medication. MRI showed an arachnoid cyst located in the right cerebellomedullary cistern extending to the cerebellopontine cistern. Cyst removal was performed via a right retrosigmoid approach. Lateral suboccipital craniotomy was performed using the right park-bench position. After opening the dura and cerebellopontine angle, the arachnoid cyst was exposed. The arachnoid cyst was compressing the flattened lower cranial nerves at the right jugular fossa. Her symptoms resolved postoperatively. Two months after the operation, she was completely free from her previous symptoms.","1566":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can be used to assess the therapeutic response of brain abscess. A study was conducted on 10 consecutive patients with brain abscess. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffuse-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed at 3 and 6 weeks after surgical treatment and intravenous antibiotics therapy and FDG-PET at 6 weeks after treatment. The extent of the abscess, signal changes on MRI, and FDG-PET standardized uptake values were analyzed and correlated with the response to therapy. Aspiration or craniotomy with excision of the abscess followed by intravenous antibiotics for 6-8 weeks resulted in good recovery with no recurrence. In 10 patients, two had low signal intensity on the DWI; one had no uptake on FDG-PET imaging after 6 weeks antibiotics and discontinued intravenous treatment, but the other patient had diffuse, increased uptake on FDG-PET imaging after 6 weeks antibiotics and underwent an additional 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. The remaining eight patients had high signals on the DWI. Four had no uptake on FDG-PET imaging and the treatment period varied from 6 to 8 weeks (mean, 6.75 weeks). Among the other four patients, FDG was accumulated in a diffuse or local area corresponding to a high signal area within the DWI and 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics was added. MRI plus FDG-PET improved the accuracy of assessing therapeutic responses to antibiotics treatment of brain abscess and aided in optimizing therapy.

The careful operation to prevent structures can prevent this complication, but it is not enough and effective to prevent it. Authors present technical surgical considerations to prevent this complication with a review of our suprasellar arachnoid cyst patients who had postoperative endocrine dysfunction. From January 2002 to December 2009, eight patients who had suprasellar arachnoid cysts with visual impairment underwent surgery. The mean age was 57.1 years (range, 33-77). Preoperatively, their endocrine function was clinically normal, and laboratory hormonal levels were within normal ranges. Cyst fenestration was performed by craniotomy (n=6) or by a neuro-endoscopic procedure (n=2), and, simultaneously, along with a cyst wall biopsy. The surgery was uneventful in all eight patients, and there were no neurological morbidities. However, in four patients, endocrine dysfunction occurred postoperatively. We compared these four patients (group A) to the other 4 patients without endocrine dysfunction (group B) with intraoperative findings and with the histopathological findings of the cyst wall biopsy. The group A patients had more abundant vasculature on the cystic wall than the group B patients according to both the intraoperative findings and the histopathological findings. When performing a surgical cyst wall fenestration, surgeons should try to minimize the destruction of the cystic wall vasculature and not to make the fenestration at a site that contains many vascular striae. ","1570":"Successful coil embolization of anterior communicating (A-com) artery aneurysms requires good visualization and understanding of the entire H complex. Bilateral carotid angiography may optimize anatomical understanding and visualization of the H complex. We therefore assessed the efficacy of simultaneous bilateral internal carotid angiography during coil embolization for A-com artery aneurysms. Of the 153 patients with intracranial saccular aneurysms who underwent embolization between July 2008 and December 2009, 12 had A-com artery aneurysms and were embolized under bilateral carotid angiography. Patients were evaluated angiographically, immediately and 6 months (n=11) after embolization, using a 3-point scale (complete, residual neck, residual aneurysm). The safety, performance and efficacy of this approach were retrospectively evaluated. In all patients, bilateral internal carotid artery angiography provided more detailed anatomical information and understanding around the A-com artery, and, in complex situations, it allowed for more effective coil embolization through bilateral routes to the A-com artery. Angiography immediately after embolization showed occlusion of 11 of the 12 (92%) aneurysms, with none of these 11 showing evidence of recanalization at 6 months. These findings indicate that simultaneous bilateral carotid angiography during coil embolization of selected complex A-com artery aneurysms provided improved anatomical understanding, and resulted in more effective and safer procedures than typical unilateral angiography. ","1571":"Posterior cervical foraminotomy is an attractive therapeutic option in selected cases of cervical radiculopathy that maintains cervical range of motion and minimize adjacent-segment degeneration. The focus of this procedure is to preserve as much of the facet as possible with decompression. Posterior cervical inclinatory foraminotomy (PCIF) is a new technique developed to offer excellent results by inclinatory decompression with minimal facet resection. The highlight of our PCIF technique is the use of inclinatory drilling out for preserving more of facet joint. The operative indications are radiculopathy from cervical foraminal stenosis (single or multilevel) with persistent or recurrent root symptoms. The PCIFs were performed between April 2007 and December 2009 on 26 male and 8 female patients with a total of 55 spinal levels. Complete and partial improvement in radiculopathic pain were seen in 26 patients (76%), and 8 patients (24%), respectively, with preserving more of facet joint. We believe that PCIF allows for preserving more of the facet joint and capsule when decompressing cervical foraminal stenosis due to spondylosis. We suggest that our PCIF technique can be an effective alternative surgical approach in the management of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.","1572":"We describe here the first case of a concurrent brain abscess caused by Norcardia spp. and semi-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in an immunocompetent patient.

Most of these tumors have been reported as a single lesion in the spinal cord. The authors report the first case of intramedullary schwannoma accompanying by extramedullary beads-like daughter masses of the thoracic spine. A 68-year-old male presented with walking disturbance and decreased sensation below T10 dermatome. Imaging workup revealed an intramedullary mass at T6 and T7. T6 and T7 laminectomy and mass removal were performed. Intraoperatively, extramedullary beads-like daughter masses along the nerve roots adjacent to intramedullary mass were identified. Total removal of intramedullary lesion and partial resection of extramedullary masses were done. Histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. The patient could ambulate independently at postoperative 1 month without any neurological sequelae.

We report a unique patient who showed visual symptoms and normal imaging of the brain caused by isolated spinal neurocysticercosis. A 59-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency unit with a history of severe headache and progressive blurred vision. Brain computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging showed normal cerebral anatomy without hydrocephalus. The fundoscopic evaluation by an ophthalmologist showed bilateral papilledema. Perimetry studies revealed visual field defects in both eyes. With the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri, a lumbar tap was attempted; however, we could not drain the cerebrospinal fluid in spite of appropriate attempts. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging revealed multilevel intraspinal lesions that were confirmed histologically to be neurocysticercosis. An intraoperative lumbar puncture revealed an increased opening pressure and cytochemical analysis showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level. The headache resolved immediately after surgery. However, the visual symptoms remained and recovered only marginally despite antihelminthic medications after six months of operation.","1576":"A rare case of intraventricular meningioma that arose in the atrium of the left lateral ventricle was identified in a 51-year-old woman. Gross total removal was performed by transcortical approach. Histopathological findings showed meningothelial meningioma with a focal atypical area which had 8% of Ki-67 labeling index (LI). A large recurrence extending into the ipsilateral quadrigeminal cistern and opposite medial occipital lobe developed approximately 41 months after the first operation. The specimens obtained from the second resection showed atypical meningioma with 20% of Ki-67 LI but there were no anaplastic area. The patient underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. However, multiple local distant metastases were found in the occipital and cerebellar cortex suggesting cerebrospinal fluid dissemination apparently 24 months after the second operation. This report presents chronological progression of a rare intraventricular atypical meningioma with more aggressive transformation.","1577":"Persistent primitive olfactory artery (PPOA) is a rare anomaly of the anterior cerebral artery. We present one case of PPOA incidentally diagnosed with the aid of computed tomography (CT) angiography. A 24-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital after sudden onset of vertigo. Three-dimensional CT angiography revealed an anomalous artery arising from the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery. The proximal portion of the anomalous artery coursed anteromedially and made a hairpin turn posterosuperior to the midline. PPOA may be overlooked because of its rarity, but CT angiography can be useful in detecting this rare vascular anomaly. Follow-up study is necessary in our case to confirm whether an aneurysm occurs on the PPOA.","1578":null,"1579":"There were only a few reports of mercury on pulmonary artery. However, there is no data on surgery related mercury dissemination. The objective of the present article is to describe one case of postoperative injected mercury dissemination. A 19-year-old man presented severe neck pain including meningeal irritation sign and abdominal pain after injection of mercury for the purpose of suicide. Radiologic study showed injected mercury in the neck involving high cervical epidural space and subcutaneous layer of abdomen. Partial hemilaminectomy and open mercury evacuation of spinal canal was performed. For the removal of abdominal subcutaneous mercury, C-arm guided needle aspiration was done. After surgery, radiologic study showed disseminated mercury in the lung, heart, skull base and low spinal canal. Neck pain and abdominal pain were improved after surgery. During 1 month after surgery, there was no symptom of mercury intoxication except increased mercury concentration of urine, blood and hair. We assumed the bone work during surgery might have caused mercury dissemination. Therefore, we recommend minimal invasive surgical technique for removal of injected mercury. If open exposures are needed, cautious surgical technique to prohibit mercury dissemination is necessary and normal barrier should be protected to prevent the migration of mercury.","1580":"Sparganosis is a rare parasitic infection affecting various organs, including the central nervous system, especially the lumbar epidural space. This report describes the identification of disease and different strategies of treatments with preoperative information. A 42-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of urinary incontinence and impotence. He had a history of ingesting raw frogs 40 years ago. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed an intramedullary nodular mass at conus medullaris and severe inflammation in the cauda equina. A 51-year-old woman was admitted with acute pain in the left inguinal area. We observed a lesion which seemed to be a tumor of the lumbar epidural space on MR imaging. She also had a history of ingesting inadequately cooked snakes 10 years ago. In the first patient, mass removal was attempted through laminectomy and parasite infection was identified during intra-operative frozen biopsy. Total removal could not be performed because of severe arachnoiditis and adhesion. We therefore decided to terminate the operation and final histology confirmed dead sparganum infection. We also concluded further surgical trial for total removal of the dead worm and inflammatory grannulation totally. However, after seeing another physician at different hospital, he was operated again which resulted in worsening of pain and neurological deficit. In the second patient, we totally removed dorsal epidural mass. Final histology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed living sparganum infection and her pain disappeared. Although the treatment of choice is surgical resection of living sparganum with inflammation, the attempt to remove dead worm and adhesive granulation tissue may cause unwanted complications to the patients. Therefore, the result of preoperative ELISA, as well as the information from image and history, must be considered as important factors to decide whether a surgery is necessary or not.","1581":"Ganglion cysts usually arise from the tendon sheaths and tissues around the joints. It is usually associated with degenerative arthritic changes in older people. Ganglion cyst in the spine is rare and there is no previous report on case that located in the intervertebral foramen and compressed dorsal root ganglion associated severe radiculopathy. A 29-year-old woman presented with severe left thigh pain and dysesthesia for a month. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dumbbell like mass in the intervertebral foramen between second and third lumbar vertebrae on the left side. The lesion was removed after exposure of the L2-L3 intervertebral foramen. The histological examination showed fragmented cystic wall-like structure composed of fibromyxoid tissue but there was no lining epithelium. A ganglion cyst may compromise lumbar dorsal root ganglion when it located in the intervertebral foramen. Although it is very rare location, ganglion cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis for intervertebral foraminal mass lesions.","1582":"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common spinal disease in the elderly. The cardinal symptom of LSS is neurogenic claudication, but not all patients present with such typical symptom. The clinical symptoms are often confused with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, musculo-skeletal disease and other medical conditions in elderly patients. In particular, LSS presenting with rapid progression of leg weakness must be distinguished from other combined diseases. We report a case of rapid progressive leg weakness in a patient with LSS and iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency that was induced by obscure health supplement.","1583":"Chronic spinal epidural hematoma related to Kummell's disease is extremely rare. An 82-year-old woman who had been managed conservatively for seven weeks with the diagnosis of a multi-level osteoporotic compression fracture was transferred to our institute. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance images revealed vertebral body collapse with the formation of a cavitary lesion at L1, and a chronic spinal epidural hematoma extending from L1 to L3. Because of intractable back pain, a percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed. The pain improved dramatically and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging obtained three days after the procedure showed a nearly complete resolution of the hematoma. Here, we present the rare case of a chronic spinal epidural hematoma associated with Kummell's disease and discuss the possible mechanism.","1584":"Visual loss is one of the ocular symptoms resulting from a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF), but has rarely been reported as the sole manifestation in CCF. Visual impairment is known to be associated with a poor outcome unless timely intervention is employed. Herein, the authors report a patient with bilateral rapid progressing visual loss as a sole manifestation in CCF. Vision was successfully restored by transarterial embolization. The authors discuss the necessity of urgent fistula obliteration in patients with visual loss.","1585":"We report a case of spontaneous right carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) in a proximal segment of persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) and combined vascular anomalies such as left duplicated hypoplastic proximal posterior cerebral arteries and a variation of anterior choroidal artery supplying temporal and occipital lobe. A 45-year-old male presented with progressive right exophthalmos, diplopia, and ocular pain. With manual compression of the internal carotid artery, a cerebral angiography revealed a right CCF from a PPTA. Treatment involved the placement of detachable non-fibered and fibered coils, and use of a hyperglide balloon to protect against coil herniation into the internal carotid artery. A final angiograph revealed complete occlusion of PPTA resulted in no contrast filling of CCF.","1586":"Superior petrosal sinus (SPS) dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is one of tentorial DAVFs with significant morbidity, which usually drains into the petrosal vein and its tributaries. Unless there is a connection with venous sinus, surgical obliteration is required. We present two cases of SPS DAVF which were successfully treated with the presigmoid retrolabyrinthine approach.","1587":"This paper presents data from a retrospective study of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in patients with shunt malfunction and proposes a simple and reasonable post-operative protocol that can detect ETV failure. We enrolled 19 consecutive hydrocephalus patients (11 male and 8 female) who were treated with ETV between April 2001 and July 2010 after failure of previously placed shunts. We evaluated for correlations between the success rate of ETV and the following parameters : age at the time of surgery, etiology of hydrocephalus, number of shunt revisions, interval between the initial diagnosis of hydrocephalus or the last shunt placement and ETV, and the indwelling time of external ventricular drainage. At the time of ETV after shunt failure, 14 of the 19 patients were in the pediatric age group and 5 were adults, with ages ranging from 14 months to 42 years (median age, 12 years). The patients had initially been diagnosed with hydrocephalus between the ages of 1 month 24 days and 32 years (median age, 6 years 3 months). The etiology of hydrocephalus was neoplasm in 7 patients; infection in 5; malformation, such as aqueductal stenosis or megacisterna magna in 3; trauma in 1; and unknown in 3. The overall success rate during the median follow-up duration of 1.4 years (9 days to 8.7 years) after secondary ETV was 68.4%. None of the possible contributing factors for successful ETV, including age (p=0.97) and the etiology of hydrocephalus (p=0.79), were statistically correlated with outcomes in our series. The use of ETV in patients with shunt malfunction resulted in shunt independence in 68.4% of cases. Age, etiology of hydrocephalus, and other contributing factors were not statistically correlated with ETV success. External ventricular drainage management during the immediate post-ETV period is a good means of detecting ETV failure.

In addition, change in psychomotor development following these procedures is a very complex issue that has not yet been resolved. In this paper, the authors describe a surgical technique for immediate spontaneous shape correction of infantile scaphocephaly. There were significant differences between pre- and postoperative cephalic index. We also describe an improvement in the developmental quotient following surgery. Therefore, this expantile zigzag craniectomy should be recommended to correct for isolated sagittal craniosynostosis in infants.","1591":"Disseminated cysticercosis is a rare form of cysticercosis in which the cysticerci spread out through the whole body. We report the first case of a 39-year-old Mongolian with disseminated cysticercosis. He visited our hospital with generalized tonic-clonic seizure. After extensive investigation from brain computed tomography (CT), spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whole body MRI and pathologic biopsy, he was diagnosed as having cysticercosis involving the brain, subcutaneous tissue, and skeletal muscles through the whole body. We treated him with the albendazole in which case the followed MRI showed that numbers of cystic lesions were copiously decreased. We report an unsual case of disseminated cysticercosis treated with medical therapy.","1592":"In recent years the immunocompromised population has increased rapidly to include people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), drug abusers, and transplant patients. Accordingly, the incidence of intracranial fungal infection has increased. Our institution experienced 2 cases of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion due to invasion of the cavernous sinus by an intracranial fungal infection. The first case was a 60-year-old man who presented with headache, eye pain, conjunctival injection, right-sided diplopia, and blurred vision. Infected tissues within the frontal and ethmoid sinuses were removed via bifrontal craniotomy and endoscopic sinus surgery through the Caldwell Luc approach. The second case was a 63-year-old woman who developed right-sided facial pain after a tooth extraction. The infection was not controlled despite continuous use of antifungal agents, resulting in death from sepsis. We believe that when intracranial fungal infection is suspected in a patient with orbital symptoms and a focal neurologic deficit, immediate angiographic investigation of possible ICA occlusion is warranted. Aggressive treatment with antifungal agents is the only way to improve prognosis.","1593":"A case of radicular pain that resulted from a gas-filled intradural cyst in an 80-year-old male is described. Temporary improvement of radicular pain was observed after CT-guided aspiration. However, recurrent radicular pain led to surgical treatment. In this report, the authors document the radiologic and intraoperative features of a gas-filled intradural cyst that migrated into the nerve root, and propose an optimal treatment plan based on a review of the literature.","1594":"Congenital anomalies in arches of the atlas are rare, and are usually discovered incidentally. However, a very rare subgroup of patients with unique radiographic features is predisposed to transient quadriparesis after minor cervical or head trauma. A 46-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of tremor and hyperesthesia of the lower extremities after experiencing a minor head trauma. He said that he had been quadriplegic for about 2 weeks after that trauma. Radiographs of his cervical spine revealed bilateral bony defects of the lateral aspects of the posterior arch of C1 and a midline cleft within the anterior arch of the atlas. A magnetic resonance imaging revealed an increased cord signal at the C2 level on the T2-weighted sagittal image. A posterior, suboccipital midline approach for excision of the remnant posterior tubercle was performed. The patient showed significant improvement of his motor and sensory functions. Since major neurologic deficits can be produced by a minor trauma, it is crucial to recognize this anomaly.","1595":"Subdural empyema is a rare form of intracranial sepsis associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most frequent cause is extension of paranasal sinusitis through emissary veins or of mastoiditis through the mucosa, bone, and dura mater. Development of subdural empyema after pyogenic meningitis is known to be very unusual in adults. We report a rare case of fatal subdural empyema, an unusual complication of pyogenic meningitis. Our bitter experience suggests that subdural empyema should be borne in mind in patient with pyogenic meningitis who exhibit neurological deterioration.","1596":"Myeloid sarcoma is a solid, extramedullary tumor composed of leukemic myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells. Intraparenchymal myeloid sarcoma without the involvement of the skull or meninges is extremely rare. Here, we present the case of a 49-year-old man who developed intraparenchymal myeloid sarcoma on the left cerebellum after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). He received radiotherapy after complete removal of intraparenchymal myeloid sarcoma, but he was diagnosed spinal myeloid sarcoma three month later. Nine months after the operation, new intracranial and spinal myeloid sarcoma were diagnosed and the patient's condition had been worsened rapidly. Although the spinal myeloid sarcoma was not histologically diagnosed, this report provides valuable insights into the clinical course of progression of intraparenchymal myeloid sarcoma.","1597":"Isolated hypoglossal nerve paresis due to mechanical compression from a vascular lesion is very rare. We present a case of a 32-year-old man who presented with spontaneous abrupt-onset dysarthria, swallowing difficulty and left-sided tongue atrophy. Brain computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brainstem demonstrated an abnormal course of the left vertebral artery compressing the medulla oblongata at the exit zone of the hypoglossal rootlets that was relieved by microvascular decompression of the offending intracranial vertebral artery. This case supports the hypothesis that hypoglossal nerve palsy can be due to nerve stretching and compression by a pulsating normal vertebral artery. Microvascular decompression of the intracranial nerve and careful evaluation of the imaging studies can resolve unexpected isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy.","1598":"Both the paraspinal muscle sparing approach and percutaneous screw fixation are less traumatic procedures in comparison with the conventional midline approach. These techniques have been used with the goal of reducing muscle injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and to compare the safety and efficacy of the paraspinal muscle sparing technique and percutaneous screw fixation for the treatment of L5-S1 spondylolisthesis. Twenty patients who had undergone posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) at the L5-S1 segment for spondylolisthesis were prospectively studied. They were divided into two groups by screw fixation technique (Group I : paraspinal muscle sparing approach and Group II: percutaneous screw fixation). Clinical outcomes were assessed by Low Back Outcome Score (LBOS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain at different times after surgery. In addition, modified MacNab's grading criteria were used to assess subjective patients' outcomes 6 months after surgery. Postoperative midline surgical scarring, intraoperative blood loss, mean operation time, and procedure-related complications were analyzed. Excellent or good results were observed in all patients in both groups 6 months after surgery. Patients in both groups showed marked improvement in terms of LBOSs all over time intervals. Postoperative midline surgical scarring and intraoperative blood loss were lower in Group II compared to Group I although these differences were not statistically significant. Low back pain (LBP) and leg pain in both groups also showed significant improvement when compared to preoperative scores. However, at 7 days and 1 month after surgery, patients in Group II had significantly better LBP scores compared to Group I. In terms of LBP during the early postoperative period, patients who underwent percutaneous screw fixation showed better results compared to ones who underwent screw fixation via the paraspinal muscle sparing approach. Our results indicate that the percutaneous screw fixation procedure is the preferable minimally invasive technique for reducing LBP associated with L5-S1 spondylolisthesis. ","1599":"Vasospasm of cerebral vessels remains a major source of morbidity and mortality after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) for SAH-induced vasospasm. Eleven patients with an angiographically confirmed significant vasospasm (&gt;50% vessel narrowing and clinical deterioration) were studied. A total of 54 vessel segments with significant vasospasm were treated by TBA. Digital subtraction angiography was used to confirm the presence of vasospasm, and TBA was performed to dilate vasospastic arteries. Medical and angiographic reports were reviewed to determine technical efficacy and for procedural complications. TBA using Hyper-Glide or Hyper-Form balloons (MicroTherapeutics, Irvine, CA) was successfully accomplished in 88.9% vasospastic segments (48 of 54), namely, in the distal internal carotid artery (100%, n=7), the middle cerebral artery (100%), including the M1 (n=10), M2 (n=10), and M3 segments (n=4), in the vertebral artery (100%, n=2), basilar artery (100%, n=1), and in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), including the A1 (66%), A2 (66%), and A3 segments (100%). Vessel diameters significantly increased after TBA. There were no cases of vessel rupture or thromboembolic complications. GCS at one day after TBA showed an improvement in all patients except one. This study suggests that TBA using Hyper-Glide or Hyper-Form balloons is a safe and effective treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm. ","1600":null,"1601":null,"1602":"Compression of the ulnar nerve in Guyon's canal can result from repeated blunt trauma, fracture of the hamate's hook, and arterial thrombosis or aneurysm. In addition, conditions such as ganglia, rheumatoid arthritis and ulnar artery disease can rapidly compress the ulnar nerve in Guyon's canal. A ganglion cyst can acutely protrude or grow, which also might compress the ulnar nerve. So, clinicians should consider a ganglion cyst in Guyon's canal as a possible underlying cause of ulnar nerve compression in patients with a sudden decrease in hand strength. We believe that early decompression with removal of the ganglion is very important to promote complete recovery.","1603":"Pediatric patients with dissecting aneurysms usually present with ischemia rather than bleeding. We report a case of a 15-year-old boy with a dissecting aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) presenting with hemorrhage. He was first treated with stent-assisted coil embolization, in an attempt to avoid trapping of the PCA and preserve the perforators. After the procedure, he recovered well from general anesthesia, but rebleeding occurred from the same lesion 6 hours after the procedure, therefore endovascular segmental occlusion of the parent artery was performed secondarily. Apparently, a reconstructive method of stent-assisted coiling is worth trying to preserve the parent vessel and perforators, but it is not always efficient and durable for dissecting aneurysms.","1604":"We performed a percutaneous vertebroplasty at the compressed L2 vertebral body of a 73-year-old female using a left-sided unilateral extrapedicular approach. She complained severe radiating pain and a tingling sensation in her left leg two hours after the vertebroplasty. Spinal computed tomographic scan showed a large retroperitoneal hematoma, and a subsequent spinal angiography revealed a left L2 segmental artery injury. Bleeding was successfully controlled by endovascular embolization. Recently, extrapedicular approaches have been attempted, allowing for the avoidance of facet and pedicle injury with only a unilateral approach. With this approach, however, the needle punctures the vertebral body directly. Therefore, this procedure carries the potential risk of a spinal segmental artery.","1605":"The low lumbar spine is deeply located in flexible segments, and has a physiologic lordosis. Therefore, burst fractures of the low lumbar spine are uncommon injuries. The treatment for such injuries may either be conservative or surgical management according to canal compromise and the neurological status. However, there are no general guidelines or consensus for the treatment of low lumbar burst fractures especially in neurologically intact cases with severe canal compromise. We report a patient with a burst fracture of the fourth lumbar vertebra, who was treated surgically but without fusion because of the neurologically intact status in spite of severe canal compromise of more than 85%. It was possible to preserve motion segments by removal of screws at one year later. We also discuss why bone fusion was not necessary with review of the relevant literature.","1606":"A 43-year-old male presenting with headache and dizziness underwent craniotomy and gross total resection of an extraaxial tumor was achieved via left occipital interhemispheric approach. The tumor was diagnosed as papillary meningioma arising from the left falcotentorium with such pathologic characteristics of bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma. At postoperative day 40, he developed generalized tonic clonic seizure and then progressed to a status epilepticus pattern. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed irregular leptomeningeal enhancement with a significant peritumoral area. Through a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study, we identified the meningioma cells of the papillary type from the CSF. At the postoperative day 60, he fell into semicomatose state, and the computed tomography imaging showed low density on both cerebral hemispheres, except the basal ganglia and cerebellum, with overall brain swelling and an increased intracranial pressure. He died on the following day. We experienced a rare case of a papillary meningioma with leptomeningeal seeding.","1607":"We present a rare case of optochiasmatic cavernous angioma (CA) that progressed despite radiation therapy. A 31-year-old female patient presented with sudden loss of left visual acuity and right homonymous hemianopsia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a suprasellar mass and findings compatible with a craniopharyngioma or an optic glioma with bleeding. An open biopsy was conducted using the transcranial approach, and histological examination revealed gliosis. During the one-year follow-up period, imaging suggested intratumoral bleeding and the mass continued to grow. We recommended re-operation, but the patient refused due to fear of surgery. Consequently, the patient received fractionated radiation therapy (3,000 cGy) to the parasellar area. Despite the radiotherapy, the mass continued to grow for the following 6 years. The final MRI before definitive treatment revealed a multilobulated, multistage hematoma with calcification in the parasellar area, extending into the third ventricle and midbrain. The patient ultimately underwent reoperation due to the growth of the tumor. The mass was completely removed with transcranial surgery, and the pathologic findings indicated a cavernous angioma (CA) without evidence of glioma. As shown in our case, patients may suffer intratumoral hemorrhage after biopsy and radiotherapy. This case places the value of biopsy and radiotherapy for a remnant lesion into question. It also shows that reaching the correct diagnosis is critical, and complete surgical removal is the treatment of choice.","1608":"The surgical as well as endovascular treatment of blood-blister-like aneursysms (BBAs) is extremely difficult because of these pathological natures, such as small and the fragile necks. The optimal treatment of BBAs has remained uncertain. Stents are known to divert blood flow and induce thrombosis of intracranial aneurysms. We report 3 cases of successful obliteration of BBAs after multiple stents placement.","1609":"The intra-arterial administration of nimodipine (IAN) is commonly used for cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical treatments. We report two cases of vasogenic edema after IAN. Our patients with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage presented with vasospasm, which was treated by IAN. Consequently, vasogenic edema developed in the basal ganglia. Reperfusion following IAN for vasospasm may have the potential for inciting vasogenic edema in the ischemic brain.","1610":null,"1611":"Although there are several explanations for a duplicated middle cerebral artery (DMCA), its embryological origin is still an open question. We reviewed these anomalous vessels to postulate a theory of their different origins, sizes, and courses. A retrospective review of 1,250 cerebral angiographies, 1,452 computed tomography (CT)-angiographies, and 2,527 magnetic resonance (MR)-angiographies was performed to identify patients with DMCA. Twenty-five patients had 25 DMCAs. Conventional angiography detected nine patients with DMCA (9\/1250, 0.72%), MR-angiography detected seven patients with DMCA (7\/2527, 0.28%), and CT-angiography detected nine patients with DMCA (9\/1452, 0.62%). The DMCAs originated near the internal carotid artery terminal in eight patients (type A), and between the origin of the anterior choroidal artery and the terminal internal carotid artery in 17 patients (type B). The diameters of the eight type A DMCAs were the same or slightly smaller than those of the other branch of the DMCA. All type A DMCAs showed a course parallel to that of the other branch of the DMCA. The diameters of the 17 type B DMCAs were the same, slightly smaller, or very much smaller than that of the other branch of the DMCA. Nine type B DMCAs showed parallel courses, and the other eight curved toward the temporal lobe. The two branches of the type A DMCAs can be regarded as early bifurcations of the MCA. The branches of the type B DMCAs had parallel courses or a course that curved toward the temporal lobe. The type B DMCA can be regarded as direct bifurcations of the MCA trunk or the early ramification of the temporal branch of the MCA. ","1612":"It is technically difficult to treat wide-necked intracranial aneurysms by the endovascular method. Various tools and techniques have been introduced to overcome the related technical limitations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiologic and clinical results of wide-necked intracranial aneurysm treatment using the endovascular method. Fifteen aneurysms in 15 patients were treated by the endovascular method from October 2009 to August 2010. Seven patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), seven patients had unruptured aneurysms, and one patient had an intracerebral hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage due to an incompletely clipped aneurysm. The mean dome-to-neck ratio was 1.1 (range, 0.6-1.7) and the mean height-to-neck ratio was 1.1 (range, 0.6-2.0). We used double microcatheters instead of a stent or a balloon for the first trial. When we failed to make a stable coil frame with two coils, we used a stent-assisted technique. All aneurysms were successfully embolized. Eleven aneurysms (73%) were embolized by the double microcatheter technique without stent insertion, and four aneurysms (27%) were treated by stent-assisted coil embolization. One case had subclinical procedure-related intraoperative hemorrhage. Another case had procedure-related thromboembolism in the left distal anterior cerebral artery. During the follow-up period, one patient (7%) had a recanalized aneurysmal neck 12 months after coil embolization. The recurrent aneurysm was treated by stent-assisted coil embolization. We successfully treated 15 wide-necked intracranial aneurysms by the endovascular method. More clinical data with longer follow-up periods are needed to establish the use of endovascular treatment for wide-necked aneurysm. ","1613":null,"1614":"Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline-class antibiotic, has been well established to exert a neuroprotective effect in animal models and neurodegenerative disease through the inhibition of microglia. Here, we investigated the effects of minocycline on motor recovery and neuropathic pain in a rat model of spinal cord injury. To simulate spinal cord injury, the rats' spinal cords were hemisected at the 10th thoracic level (T10). Minocycline was injected intraperitoneally, and was administered 30 minutes prior surgery and every second postoperative day until sacrifice 28 days after surgery. Motor recovery was assessed via the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan test. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured throughout the 28-day post-operative course via the von Frey test. Microglial and astrocyte activation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at two sites: at the level of hemisection and at the 5th lumbar level (L5). In rats, spinal cord hemisection reduced locomotor function and induced a mechanical hyperalgesia of the ipsilateral hind limb. The expression of Iba1 and GFAP was also increased in the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord at the site of hemisection and at the L5 level. Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline facilitated overall motor recovery and attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia. The expression of Iba1 and GFAP in the spinal cord was also reduced in rats treated with minocycline. By inhibiting microglia and astrocyte activation, minocycline may facilitate motor recovery and attenuate mechanical hyperalgesia in individuals with spinal cord injuries. ","1615":"We report a case of pedicle screw loosening treated by modified transpedicular screw augmentation technique using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which used the anchoring effect of hardened PMMA. A 56-year-old man who had an L3\/4\/5 fusion operation 3 years ago complained of continuous low back pain after this operation. The computerized tomography showed a radiolucent halo around the pedicle screw at L5. We augmented the L5 pedicle screw with modified pedicle screw augmentation technique using PMMA and performed an L3\/4\/5 pedicle screw fixation without hook or operation field extension. This modified technique is a kind of transpedicular stiffness augmentation using PMMA for the dead space around the loosed screw. After filling the dead space with 1-2 cc of PMMA, we inserted a small screw. Once the PMMA hardened, we removed the small screw and inserted a thicker screw along the existing screw threading to improve the pedicle screws' pullout strength. At 10 months' follow-up, x-ray showed strong fusion of L3\/4\/5. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of his back pain was improved from 9 to 5. This modified transpedicular screw augmentation with PMMA using anchoring effect is a simple and effective surgical technique for pedicle screw loosening. However, clinical analyses of long-term follow-up and biomechanical studies are needed.","1616":"A 34-year-old female patient was presented with leg and hip pain for 6 months as well as voiding difficulty for 1 year. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-demarcated mass lesion at L2-3. The mass was hypo-intense on T1- and T2-weighted images with homogeneous gadolinium enhancement. Surgery was performed with the presumptive diagnosis of intradural extramedullary meningioma. Complete tumor removal was possible due to lack of dural adhesion of the tumor. Histologic diagnosis was clear cell meningioma, a rare and newly included World Health Organization classification of meningioma usually affecting younger patients. During postoperative 2 years, the patient has shown no evidence of recurrence. We report a rare case of cauda equina clear cell meningioma without any dural attachment.","1617":"Neuroblastoma is a common tumor of children. We report a patient with extensive calvarial metastases of a neuroblastoma as an initial presentation. A 2-year-old girl presented with a history of gradually increasing head size and fever. A brain CT showed a multilobulated, large, extra-axial tumor involving both frontotemporoparietal areas with a sunray-spiculated hyperostosis of the skull and marked contrast enhancement. A brain MRI demonstrated extensive calvarial lesions with simultaneous involvement of the orbits. A biopsy was performed and a ganglioneuroblastoma was diagnosed. On systemic evaluation, an enlarged abdominal mass was detected. After neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, most of the tumors disappeared except for a tumor in the left parietal area; there was a corresponding decrease in the circumference of the head. We performed surgery for the remnant mass. Intensive chemotherapy was administered and a bone marrow transplantation was performed. Adequate neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery to the neuroblatoma with extensive metastases to the skull and orbit may be helpful.","1618":"The detailed clinical characteristics of unilateral moyamoya disease (MMD) have not been fully elucidated. It has been reported that some patients with unilateral MMD progress to bilateral involvement, while others remain with the unilateral variant. In this series, we present a case of unilateral MMD that progressed to bilateral involvement over the course of just one month.","1619":"Upper thoracic vertebral bodies are difficult to access using standard anterior approaches. It may require sternotomy and claviculectomy, which carries significant possibility of morbidities. We report a case of inferiorly migrated cervicothoracic junction disc treated successfully by anterior upper-vertebral transcorporeal approach. This specific technique obviated the need of sternotomy, created favorable working space and saved the motion segment at cervicothoracic junction. This report is the first transcorporeal approach to a disc fragment at T1-2 space without fusion.","1620":"Ligamentum flavum hematoma (LFH) is a very rare condition of dural compression; most are observed in the mobile cervical and lumbar spine regions. A 67-year-old man who had a long level interbody fusion at L3-S1 four years ago presented with symptoms suggestive of dural compression. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a posterior semicircular mass located at the adjacent L2-L3 level. After decompression of the spinal canal and removal of the mass lesion, pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a hematoma within the ligamentum. The patient fully recovered to normal status after surgery. Here, we report our experience with a LFH in the adjacent segment after a long level fusion procedure and discuss the possible associated mechanisms.","1621":"We reported a unique case of posttraumatic giant infratentorial extradural intradiploic epidermoid cyst. A 54-year-old male, with a previous history of an open scalp injury and underlying linear skull fracture in the left occipital region in childhood, presented with a painful subcutaneous swelling, which had been developed gradually in the same region and moderate headache, nausea, vomiting and cerebellar ataxia. The duration of symptoms on admission was 3 months. Imaging studies revealed occipital bone destruction and giant extradural intradiploic lesion. The preoperative diagnosis was giant infratentorial extradural intradiploic epidermoid cyst. Surgery achieved total removal of the lesion, which was histologically confirmed and the postoperative course was uneventful. To our knowledge, this is the first case of giant infratentorial extradural intradiploic epidermoid cyst with a traumatic etiology described in the literature.","1622":"Traumatic intracranial aneurysms are rare, comprising 1% or less of all cerebral aneurysms. The majority of these aneurysms arise at the skull base or in the distal anterior and middle cerebral arteries or their branches following direct mural injury or acceleration-induced shearing force. We present a 50-year-old patient in whom subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was developed as a result of traumatic aneurysm rupture after a closed craniofacial injury. Through careful evaluation of the three-dimensional computed tomography and conventional angiographies, the possible mechanism of the traumatic internal carotid artery trunk aneurysm is correlated with a hit injury by the bony protuberances on the anterior and posterior clinoid processes. This traumatic aneurysm was successfully obliterated with clipping and wrapping technique. The possibility of a traumatic intracranial aneurysm should be considered when patient with SAH demonstrates bony protuberances on the clinoid process as a traumatic aneurysm may result from mechanical injury by the sharp bony edges.","1623":"Classical markers of infection cannot differentiate reliably between inflammation and infection after neurosurgery. This study investigated the dynamics of serum procalcitonin (PCT) in patients who had elective spine surgeries without complications. Participants were 103 patients (47 women, 56 men) who underwent elective spinal surgery. Clinical variables relevant to the study included age, sex, medical history, body mass index (BMI), site and type of surgery, and surgery duration. Clinical and laboratory data were body temperature, white blood cell count (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT, all measured preoperatively and postoperatively on days 1, 3, and 5. PCT concentrations remained at &lt;0.25 ng\/mL during the postoperative course except in 2 patients. PCT concentrations did not correlate with age, sex, DM, hypertension, BMI, operation time, operation site, or use of instrumentation. In contrast, CRP concentrations were significantly higher with older age, male, DM, hypertension, longer operation time, cervical operation, and use of instrumentation. PCT may be useful in the diagnosing neurosurgical patients with postoperative fever of unknown origin. ","1624":"The author measured levels of fluoroscopic radiation exposure to the surgeon's body based on the different beam directions during kyphoplasty. This is an observational study. A series of 84 patients (96 vertebral bodies) were treated with kyphoplasty over one year. The patients were divided into four groups based on the horizontal and vertical directions of the X-Ray beams. We measured radiation exposure with the seven dosimetry badges which were worn by the surgeon in each group (total of 28 badges). Twenty-four procedures were measured in each group. Cumulative dose and dose rates were compared between groups. Fluoroscopic radiation is received by the operator in real-time for approximately 50% (half) of the operation time. Thyroid protectors and lead aprons can block radiation almost completely. The largest dose was received in the chest irrespective of beam directions. The lowest level of radiation were received when X-ray tube was away from the surgeon and beneath the bed (dose rate of head, neck, chest, abdomen and knee : 0.2986, 0.2828, 0.9711, 0.8977, 0.8168 mSv, respectively). The radiation differences between each group were approximately 2.7-10 folds. When fluoroscopic guided-KP is performed, the X-Ray tube should be positioned on the opposite side of the operator and below the table, otherwise the received radiation to the surgeon's body would be 2.7-10 times higher than such condition. ","1625":"The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of symptomatic postdiscectomy pseudocyst (PP) after endoscopic discectomy and to compare the results of surgical and conservative management of them. Initial study participants were 1,503 cases (1,406 patients) receiving endoscopic lumbar discectomy by 23-member board of neurosurgeons from March 2003 to October 2008. All patients' postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated. On the postoperative MRI, cystic lesion of T2W high and T1W low at discectomy site was regarded as PP. Reviews of medical records and radiological findings were done. The PP patients were divided into two groups, surgical and conservative management by treatment modality after PP detection. We compared the results of the two groups using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain (LBP), VAS for leg pain (LP) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Among 1,503 cases of all male soldiers, the MRIs showed that pseudocysts formed in 15 patients, about 1.0% of the initial cases. The mean postoperative interval from surgery to PP detection was 53.7 days. Interlaminar approach was correlated with PP formation compared with transforaminal approach (p=0.001). The mean VAS for LBP and LP in the surgical group improved from 6.5 and 4.8 to 2.0 and 2.3, respectively. The mean VAS for LBP and LP in the conservative group improved from 4.4 and 4.4 to 3.9 and 2.3, respectively. There was no difference in treatment outcome between surgical and conservative management of symptomatic PP. Although this study was done in limited environment, symptomatic PP was detected at two months' postoperative period in about 1% of cases. Interlaminar approach seems to be more related with PP compared with transforaminal approach. ","1626":"The primary objective of this study was to perform a retrospective evaluation of the radiological and pathological features influencing the formation of peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) in meningiomas. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathology data for 86 patients with meningiomas, who underwent surgery at our institution between September 2003 and March 2009, were examined. We evaluated predictive factors related to peritumoral edema including gender, tumor volume, shape of tumor margin, presence of arachnoid plane, the signal intensity (SI) of the tumor in T2-weighted image (T2WI), the WHO histological classification (GI, GII\/GIII) and the Ki-67 antigen labeling index (LI). The edema-tumor volume ratio was calculated as the edema index (EI) and was used to evaluate peritumoral edema. Gender (p=0.809) and pathological finding (p=0.084) were not statistically significantly associated with peritumoral edema by univariate analysis. Tumor volume was not correlated with the volume of peritumoral edema. By univariate analysis, three radiological features, and one pathological finding, were associated with PTBE of statistical significance: shape of tumor margin (p=0.001), presence of arachnoid plane (p=0.001), high SI of tumor in T2WI (p=0.001), and Ki-67 antigen LI (p=0.049). These results suggest that irregular tumor margins, hyperintensity in T2WI, absence of arachnoid plane on the MRI, and high Ki-67 LI can be important predictive factors that influence the formation of peritumoral edema in meningiomas. By multivariate analysis, only SI of the tumor in T2WI was statistically significantly associated with peritumoral edema. Results of this study indicate that irregular tumor margin, hyperintensity in T2WI, absence of arachnoid plane on the MRI, and high Ki-67 LI may be important predictive factors influencing the formation of peritumoral edema in meningiomas. ","1627":"Due to longer life spans, patients newly diagnosed with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are increasing in number. This study aimed to evaluate how management of UIAs in patients age 65 years and older affects the clinical outcomes and post-procedural morbidity rates in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed 109 patients harboring 136 aneurysms across 12 years, between 1997 and 2009, at our institute. We obtained the following data from all patients : age, sex, location and size of the aneurysm(s), presence of symptoms, risk factors for stroke, treatment modality, and postoperative 1-year morbidity and mortality. We classified these patients into three groups : Group A (surgical clipping), Group B (coil embolization), and Group C (observation only). Among the 109 patients, 56 (51.4%) underwent clipping treatment, 25 (23%) patients were treated with coiling, and 28 observation only. The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 2.46% and 0%, respectively. The morbidity rate was 1.78% for clipping and 4% for coiling. Factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and family history of stroke were correlated with unfavorable outcomes. Two in the observation group refused follow-up and died of intracranial ruptured aneurysms. The observation group had a 7% mortality rate. Our results show acceptable favorable outcome of treatment-related morbidity comparing with the natural history of unruptured cerebral aneurysm. Surgical clipping did not lead to inferior outcomes in our study, although coil embolization is generally more popular for treating elderly patients. In the treatment of patients more than 65 years old, age is not the limiting factor.

Although fibrous dysplasia with aneurysmal bone cyst is rare, it should be taken into account in differential diagnosis of the osteolytic solitary skull lesion.","1632":"Spinal cysticercosis is a very uncommon manifestation of neurocysticercosis which is caused by the larvae of Taenia solium. However, it can develop as a primary infection through blood stream or direct larval migration. It can result in high recurrence and severe neurologic morbidity if not treated appropriately. We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with severe lower back pain and left leg radiating pain in recent 2 weeks. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of lumbar spine demonstrated extruded disc at the L5-S1 level combined with intradural extramedullary cystic lesion. We performed the open lumbar microdiscectomy (OLM) at L5-S1 on the left with total excision of cystic mass. After surgery, the patient showed an improvement of previous symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination as intradural extramedullary cysticercosis. We discuss clinical features, diagnostic screening, and treatment options of spinal cysticercosis.","1633":"Paraplegia following spinal epidural anesthesia is extremely rare. Various lesions for neurologic complications have been documented in the literature. We report a 66-year-old female who developed paraplegia after left knee surgery for osteoarthritis under spinal epidural anesthesia. In the recovery room, paraplegia and numbness below T4 vertebra was checked. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan showed a spinal thoracic intradural extramedullary (IDEM) tumor. After extirpation of the tumor, the motor weakness improved to the grade of 3\/5. If a neurologic deficit following spinal epidural anesthesia does not resolve, a MRI should be performed without delay to accurately diagnose the cause of the deficit and optimal treatment should be rendered for the causative lesion.","1634":"The purpose of this case report is to describe a rare case of a cervicothoracic spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) after anterior cervical spine surgery. A 60-year-old man complained of severe neck and arm pain 4 hours after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at the C5-6 level. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a postoperative SEH extending from C1 to T4. Direct hemostasis and drainage of loculated hematoma at the C5-6 level completely improved the patient's condition. When a patient complains of severe neck and\/or arm pain after anterior cervical spinal surgery, though rare, the possibility of a postoperative SEH extending to non-decompressed, adjacent levels should be considered as with our case.","1635":"Lumbar disc herniation is extremely uncommon in children below 10 years of age. A 7-year-old boy is reported who presented with low back pain and left leg radiating pain. The pain started seven days prior to presentation and was attributed to performing the jumping kick without any previous warm-up. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterolateral disc herniation at the L3-4 level and multiple degenerative changes. The patient received conservative treatment including limitation of sports activities, anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant medications as well as physical therapy. After three months of the aggressive treatment the child was symptom free. We present here a lumbar disc herniation in one of the youngest patient.","1636":"Spinal extradural meningeal cyst has been rarely reported, whose etiologies are assumed to be the communication of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between intradural subarchnoid space and cyst due to the congenital defect in dura mater. Although the CSF communication due to this defect can be found, in most case, few cases in which there is a lack of the communication have also been reported. We report a case of the huge extradural meningeal cyst occurring in the thoracolumbar spine (from T10 to L2) where there was a lack of the communication between the intradural subarachnoid space and cyst in a 46-year-old man who presented with symptoms that were indicative of progressive paraparesis and leg pain. The patient underwent laminectomy and cyst excision. On intraoperative findings, the dura was intact and there was a lack of the communication with intradural subarachnoid space. Immediately after the surgery, weakness and leg pain disappeared shortly.","1637":"We report a rare case of cavernous hemangioma (CH) which developed in adjacent location to a preexisting CH after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). A 36-year-old woman underwent GKRS for a CH in the left lentiform nucleus. Three-and-half years after radiosurgery, MRI revealed a new CH in the left caudate nucleus. Surgical excision of the new lesion was performed. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of CH. In radiosurgery for CH, it should be noted that a new CH may develop, which is likely to result from the interaction between radiation and predisposing factors of the patient.","1638":"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type IV is characterized by its clinical manifestations, which are easy bruising, thin skin with visible veins, and rupture of arteries, uterus, or intestines. Arterial complications are the leading cause of death in vascular EDS because they are unpredictable and surgical repair is difficult due to tissue fragility. The authors report a case presented with cervical radiculopathy due to a segmental fusiform aneurysm of the cervical vertebral artery. Transfemoral cerebral angiography (TFCA) was done to verify the aneurysmal dilatation. However, during TFCA, bleeding at the puncture site was not controlled, skin and underlying muscle was disrupted and profound bleeding occurred during manual compression after femoral catheter removal. Accordingly, surgical repair of the injured femoral artery was performed. At this time it was possible to diagnose it as an EDS with fusiform aneurysm on cervical vertebral artery. Particularly, cervical fusiform aneurysm is rare condition, and therefore, connective tissue disorder must be considered in such cases. If connective tissue disorder is suspected, the authors suggest that a noninvasive imaging modality, such as, high quality computed tomography angiography, be used to evaluate the vascular lesion to avoid potential arterial complications.","1639":"Temporary disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after cerebral angiography is presumably caused by nonionic radiographic contrast medium (CM). We hereby report a case of 58-year-old woman who developed decreased mentality, global aphasia and aggravated right hemiparesis after cerebral angiography. Brain CT examination demonstrated gyriform enhancement throughout the left cerebral cortex and thalamus. MR diffusion did not reveal acute infarction. MR angiography did not show any stenosis, spasm or occlusion at the major cerebral vessels. Follow-up CT scan after 1 day did not show any gyriform enhancement. Worsened neurologic signs and symptoms were improved completely after 7 days. In the present study, disruption of the BBB with contrast medium after angiography seems to be the causative factor of transient neurologic deterioration.","1640":"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is known to have a significant recurrence rate. There are different criteria defining the recurrence of CSDH. We evaluated the postoperative course of CSDH and tried to propose the reasonable criteria of recurrence. We retrospectively examined the medical records and pre- and postoperative CT scans of 149 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from January 2005 to December 2009. Diagnosis was confirmed by CT scanning or MRI. The postoperative courses were either resolved or recurrent. The resolved CSDH was one of the three types; early resolution, delayed resolution, or late resolution. The recurrent CSDH was one of the four types; recurrence without resolution, early recurrence after resolution, late recurrence after resolution, or recurrent-and-resolved type. The CSDH was resolved within 30 days after surgery in 58 (39%) patients, between 1 to 3 months in 62 (42%), and after 3 months in 11 (7%) patients. The CSDH was recurred in 18 (12%) patients. Late resolution or recurrence was more common in the aged. The recurrent hematoma was seen on the same side in 11 patients, on the different side in 7 patients. Recurrence was significantly more common in the thick hematomas. For a working criteria of the recurrence of CSDH, we propose the early recurrence as return of symptoms or reaccumulation of the hematoma after a surgery within 3 months regardless of the location, amount or repeated operations. The late recurrence can be defined as reappearance or enlargement of a liquefied hematoma within the cranial cavity surrounded by the membranes or persistent CSDH beyond 3 months after surgery. ","1641":"We investigated whether Disability Evaluation (DE) situations influence patients' neuropsychological test performances and psychopathological characteristics and which variable play a role to establish an explanation model using statistical analysis. Patients were 536 (56.6%) brain-injured persons who met inclusion and exclusion criteria, classified into the DE group (DE; n = 300, 56.0%) and the non-DE group (NDE; n = 236, 44.0%) according to the neuropsychological testing's purpose. Next, we classified DE subjects into DE cluster 1 (DEC1; 91, 17.0%), DE cluster 2 (DEC2; 125; 23.3%), and DE cluster 3 (DEC3; 84, 15.7%) via two-step cluster analysis, to specify DE characteristics. All patients completed the K-WAIS, K-MAS, K-BNT, SCL-90-R, and MMPI. In comparisons between DE and NDE, the DE group showed lower intelligence quotients and more severe psychopathologic symptoms, as evaluated by the SCL-90-R and MMPI, than the NDE group did. When comparing the intelligence among the DE groups and NDE group, DEC1 group performed worst on intelligence and memory and had most severe psychopathologic symptoms than the NDE group did. The DEC2 group showed modest performance increase over the DEC1 and DEC3, similar to the NDE group. Paradoxically, the DEC3 group performed better than the NDE group did on all variables. The DE group showed minimal \"faking bad\" patterns. When we divided the DE group into three groups, the DEC1 group showed typical malingering patterns, the DEC2 group showed passive malingering patterns, and the DEC3 group suggested denial of symptoms and resistance to treatment. ","1642":null,"1643":"Surgical treatment of lumbosacral foraminal stenosis requires an understanding of the anatomy of the lumbosacral area in individual patients. Unilateral facetectomy has been used to completely decompress entrapment of the L5 nerve root, followed in some patients by posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with stand-alone cages. We assessed 34 patients with lumbosacral foraminal stenosis who were treated with unilateral facetectomy and PLIF using stand-alone cages in our center from January 2004 to September 2007. All the patients underwent follow-up X-rays, including a dynamic view, at 3, 6, 12, 24 months, and computed tomography (CT) at 24 months postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were analyzed with the mean numeric rating scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Odom's criteria. Radiological outcomes were assessed with change of disc height, defined as the average of anterior, middle, and posterior height in plain X-rays. In addition, lumbosacral fusion was also assessed with dynamic X-ray and CT. Mean NRS score, which was 9.29 prior to surgery, was 1.5 at 18 months after surgery. The decrease in NRS was statistically significant. Excellent and good groups with regard to Odom's criteria were 31 cases (91%) and three cases (9%) were fair. Pre-operative mean ODI of 28.4 decreased to 14.2 at post-operative 24 months. In 30 patients, a bone bridge on CT scan was identified. The change in disc height was 8.11 mm, 10.02 mm and 9.63 mm preoperatively, immediate postoperatively and at 24 months after surgery, respectively. In the treatment of lumbosacral foraminal stenosis, unilateral facetectomy and interbody fusion using expandable stand-alone cages may be considered as one treatment option to maintain post-operative alignment and to obtain satisfactory clinical outcomes. ","1644":null,"1645":"To introduce the frequency and segment analysis of in-stent stenosis for intracranial stent assisted endovascular treatment on complex aneurysms. A retrospective study was performed in 158 patients who had intracranial complex aneurysms and were treated by endovascular stent application with or without coil embolization. Of these, 102 patients were evaluated with catheter based angiography after 6, 12, and 18 months. Aneurysm location, using stent, time to stenosis, stenosis rate and narrowing segment were analyzed. Among follow-up cerebral angiography done in 102 patients, 8 patients (7.8%) were shown an in-stent stenosis. Two patients have unruptured aneurysm and six patients have ruptured one. Number of Neuroform stents were 7 cases (7.5%) and Enterprise stent in 1 case (11.1%). Six patients demonstrated in-stent stenosis at 6 months after stent application and remaining two patients were shown at 12 months, 18 months, respectively. In-stent stenosis can be confronted after intracranial stent deployment. In our study, no patient showed symptomatic stenosis and there were no patients who required to further treatment except continuing antiplatets medication. In-stent stenosis has been known to be very few when they are placed into the non-pathologic parent artery during the complex aneurysm treatment, but the authors found that it was apt to happen on follow up angiography. Although the related symptom was not seen in our cases, the luminal narrowing at the stented area may result the untoward hemodynamic event in the specific condition. ","1646":"To evaluate the role of lumbar drainage in the prevention of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus after treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms by coil embolization in good-grade patients. One-hundred-thirty consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in good-grade patients (Hunt &amp; Hess grades I-III), who were treated by coil embolization between August 2004 and April 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Poor-grade patients (Hunt &amp; Hess grades IV and V), a history of head trauma preceding the development of headache, negative angiograms, primary subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and loss to follow-up were excluded from the study. We assessed the effects on lumbar drainage on the risk of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus related to coil embolization in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. One-hundred-twenty-six patients (96.9%) did not develop shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. The 2 patients (1.5%) who developed acute hydrocephalus treated with temporary external ventricular drainage did not require permanent shunt diversion. Overall, 4 patients (3.1%) required permanent shunt diversion; acute hydrocephalus developed in 2 patients (50%). There was no morbidity or mortality amongst the patients who underwent a permanent shunt procedure. Coil embolization of ruptured intracranial aneurysms may be associated with a lower risk for developing shunt-dependent hydrocephalus, possibly by active management of lumbar drainage, which may reflect less damage for cisternal anatomy than surgical clipping. Coil embolization might have an effect the long-term outcome and decision-making for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. ","1647":"A cervical radiculopathy is the most common symptom of cervical degenerative disease and its natural course is generally favorable. With a precise diagnosis using appropriate tools, the majority of patients will respond well to conservative treatment. Cervical radiculopathy with persistent radicular pain after conservative treatment and progressive or profound motor weakness may require surgery. Options for surgical management are extensive. Each technique has strengths and weaknesses, so the choice will depend on the patient's clinical profile and the surgeon's judgment.","1648":"Vertebral artery loop formation causing encroachment on cervical neural foramen and canal is a rare cause of cervical radiculopathy. We report a case of 61-year-old woman with vertebral artery loop formation who presented with right shoulder pain radiating to her arm for 2 years. Plain radiograph and computed tomography scan revealed widening of the right intervertebral foramen at the C5-6 level. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiogram confirmed the vertebral artery loop formation compressing the right C6 nerve root. We had considered microdecompressive surgery, but the patient's symptoms resolved after conservative management. Clinician should keep in mind that vertebral artery loop formation is one of important causes of cervical radiculopathy. Vertebral artery should be visualized using magnetic resonance angiography in suspected case.","1649":"The authors report a 58-year-old woman with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma primarily located in the right paravertebral area with extension to L4 neural foramen. The patient complained lower back pain with radiating pain along the posterolateral aspect of the right lower leg. She underwent subtotal surgical removal and Cyber Knife therapy. Diagnosis was made by strikingly characteristic microscopic appearance of a bland spindle cell sarcoma which contained numerous giant collagen rosettes and was also supported by immunohistological findings. The diagnostic image findings and literatures are reviewed and discussed.","1650":"We reviewed 9 cases of pyogenic spondylodiscitis following percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD). Microbiologic cultures revealed 6 causative organisms. Five patients were managed conservatively and four were treated surgically. The mean follow-up period was 20.6 months and the average length of hospitalization was 24 days. Radiological evidence of spinal fusion was noted and infection was resolved in all patients. Although PELD is a safe and effective procedure, the possibility of pyogenic spondylodiscitis should always be considered.","1651":"Traumatic atlantoaxial rotatory fixation (AARF) with accompanying odontoid and C2 articular facet fracture is a very rare injury, and only one such case has been reported in the medical literature. We present here a case of a traumatic AARF associated with an odontoid and comminuted C2 articular facet fracture, and this was treated with skull traction and halo-vest immobilization for 3 months. After removal of the halo-vest immobilization, his neck pain was improved and his neck motion was preserved without any neurologic deficits although mild torticolis was still observed in closer inspection.","1652":"Primary central nervous system (CNS) sarcomas are exceedingly rare, and, to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a report of intramedullary sarcoma. Here, we report a primary intradural intramedullary sarcoma of the spinal cord in a four-year-old boy who presented with low back pain and a radiculopathy involving both lower extremities. The tumor showed significant enhancement on magnetic resonance (MR) images due to its extreme vascularity. Gross total tumor removal was performed with microelectrical pulse recording, and the patient also received adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. After the operation, the patient's sensory deficits were improved. Because CNS dissemination is common, entire neuraxis evaluation is essential, although there was no evidence of dissemination in this case. The prognosis of primary CNS sarcoma is poor due to infiltrative nature and early CNS dissemination is common, and the treatment of choice is radical surgical resection. Adjuvant therapy is also beneficial with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","1653":"Pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) is a newly recognized variant of a pilocytic astrocytoma. This report describes a case of a pilomyxoid astrocytoma that occurred in the opticohypothalamus. The patient was a 18-year-old girl who complained decreased visual acuity and visual field over a period of two years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregular lobulated tumor with heterogeneous enhancement at the suprasellar region involving the hypothalamus. The mass was partially removed via the subfrontal approach. Its pathology was confirmed to be PMA. Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vincristine was started following tumor resection. After four cycles, the mass showed a partial response to the chemotherapy. Although long-term outcome is yet to be determined, the administration of combined cisplatin and vincristine treatment seems to be an effective regimen for a pilomyxoid astrocytoma.","1654":"Fibrous dysplasia (FD) of craniofacial structures is well documented, however, its involvement of the clivus is seldom described. We report a case of clival FD in a young man who presented with headache localized to the occipital area. The radiological studies revealed a monostotic disease confined to the clivus, with typical findings of hypointensity on magnetic resonance images and ground-glass density on computed tomography. The diagnosis of FD was confirmed on pathological examination of specimens taken through transsphenoidal surgery. The patient showed reduction of symptoms and no change of residual lesion on follow-up imaging taken 2.5 years later after surgery. This study includes clinical aspect, radiographic appearance, differential diagnosis and treatment strategy of this rare skull base lesion.","1655":null,"1656":"We report a unique case of bilateral mirror image M1 aneurysms, one of which was an unruptured aneurysm arising from the proximal end of right middle cerebral artery fenestration with long loop and the other ruptured aneurysm from the contralateral side.

The difficulties of identifying this unusual vascular anomaly and possible problems during the surgery of an aneurysm at the site of fenestration are discussed with a review of the literature.","1657":null,"1658":"Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is a distinct clinical syndrome that is characterized by the acute onset of shoulder and arm pain, weakness, and sensory loss. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical characteristics of NA and to determine appropriate diagnostic modalities. We reviewed the medical and radiologic records of 10 patients diagnosed with NA retrospectively. Neurophysiologic studies were performed in all patients and magnetic resonance neurography was performed in the last three patients. A total of 10 patients were enrolled in our study. All patients had clinical findings compatible with NA. The most common clinical presentation was severe shoulder pain and weakness in seven patients (70%). Neurophysiologic study results were abnormal in all patients. Brachial plexus magnetic resonance neurography showed that the affected brachial plexus showed a thickened and hyper-intense trunk. All patients were managed conservatively with analgesics and physical therapy. The pain and paralysis of all patients improved clinically within 6 months of the initiation of treatment. NA is a rare disease but the symptoms of NA can mimic those of other diseases. Neurophysiologic studies and magnetic resonance neurography are extremely useful tools for the diagnosis of NA. ","1659":"To analyze the clinical outcomes of computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopy-guided selective nerve root block (SNRB) for severe arm pain caused by acute cervical disc herniation. The authors analyzed the data obtained from 25 consecutive patients who underwent CT fluoroscopy-guided SNRB for severe arm pain, i.e., a visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 8 points or more, caused by acute soft cervical disc herniation. Patients with chronic arm pain, motor weakness, and\/or hard disc herniation were excluded. The series comprised 19 men and 6 women whose mean age was 48.1 years (range 35-72 years). The mean symptom duration was 17.5 days (range 4-56 days) and the treated level was at C5-6 in 13 patients, C6-7 in 9, and both C5-6 and C6-7 in 3. Twenty-three patients underwent SNRB in 1 session and 2 underwent the procedure in 2 sessions. No complications related to the procedures occurred. At a mean follow-up duration of 11.5 months (range 6-22 months), the mean VAS score and NDI significantly improved from 9 and 58.2 to 3.4 and 28.1, respectively. Eighteen out of 25 patients (72%) showed successful clinical results. Seven patients (28%) did not improve after the procedure, and 5 of these 7 underwent subsequent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. CT fluoroscopy-guided SNRB may play a role as a primary conservative treatment for severe arm pain caused by acute cervical disc herniation.

One-hundred-thirty-three patients with lumbar degenerative disease underwent lumbar fusion surgery between June 2006 and June 2007 and were followed for more than one year. Forty-eight (36.1%) were older than 65 years of age (group A) and 85 (63.9%) were under 65 years of age (group B). Diagnosis, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and perioperative complications were recorded. The analysis of clinical outcomes was based on the visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiological results were evaluated using plain radiographs. Clinical outcomes, radiological outcomes, length of hospital stay, and complication rates were analyzed in relation to lumbar fusion level, the number of comorbidities, bone mineral density (BMD), and age. The mean age of the patients was 61.2 years (range, 33-86 years) and the mean BMD was -2.2 (range, -4.8 to -2.8). The mean length of hospital stay was 15.0 days (range, 5-60 days) and the mean follow-up was 23.0 months (range, 18-30 months). Eighty-five (64.0%) patients had more than one preoperative comorbidities. Perioperative complications occurred in 27 of 133 patients (20.3%). The incidence of overall complication was 22.9% in group A, and 18.8% in group B but there was no statistical difference between the two groups. The mean VAS scores for the back and leg were significantly decreased in both groups (p &lt; 0.05), and bony fusion was achieved in 125 of 133 patients (94.0%). There was no significant difference in bony union rates between groups A and B (91.7% in group A vs. 95.3% in group B, p = 0.398). In group A, perioperative complications were more common with the increase in fusion level (p = 0.027). Perioperative complications in both groups A (p = 0.035) and B (p = 0.044) increased with an increasing number of comorbidities. Elderly patients with comorbidities are at a high risk for complications and adverse outcomes after lumbar spine surgery. In our study, clinical outcomes, fusion rates, and perioperative complication rates in older patients were comparable with those in younger populations. The number of comorbidities and the extent of fusion level were significant factors in predicting the occurrence of postoperative complications. However, proper perioperative general supportive care with a thorough fusion strategy during the operation could improve the overall postoperative outcomes in lumbar fusion surgery for elderly patients.

We investigated whether tiny enhancing foci ('Spot sign') on axial view of 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) source images can predict subsequent hematoma expansion in spontaneous ICH. During a 2-year period (March 2007-March 2009), we prospectively evaluated 3D-CTA of 110 patients with spontaneous ICH. Based on source images of 3D-CTA, patients were classified according to presence or absence of 'Spot sign'; 'Spot sign' (+) group, 'Spot sign' (-) group. Radiological factors and clinical outcomes were compared between two groups. Hematoma expansion occurred in 16 patients (15%). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of patients with hematoma expansion was significantly different compared to score of patients without hematoma expansion (5 vs. 9, p &lt; 0.001). Nineteen patients (16%) of 110 ICH patients demonstrated 'spot sign' on 3D-CTA. Among the 'spot sign' (+) group, 53% of patients developed hematoma expansion. Conversely 7% of patients without 'spot sign' demonstrated the hematoma expansion (p &lt; 0.001). Initial volume and location of hematoma were significantly not associated with hematoma expansion except shape of hematoma. Our study showed that patients with hematoma expansion of spontaneous ICH had significant clinical deterioration. And the fact that 'spot sign' (+) group have higher risk of hematoma expansion suggests the presence of 'spot sign' on source images of 3D-CTA can give a clue to predict hematoma expansion in spontaneous ICH.

A 70-year-old man with chronic renal failure and on maintenance hemodialysis with a left arteriovenous fistula presented with paresthesia of his right hand. A clinical diagnosis of right carpal tunnel syndrome was confirmed by ultrasonography and an electrophysiologic study. He underwent two-portal ECTR, and the paresthesia was much improved. However, he presented to us one month after operation with severe pain, a tender mass distal to the right wrist crease and more aggravation of the paresthesia in the ulnar nerve distribution. Doppler ultrasound was performed and revealed a hypoechoic lesion 20 mm in diameter in the right palm, with arterial Doppler flow inside connected to the palmar segment of the ulnar artery. An ulnar artery pseudoaneurysm was diagnosed and treated by ultrasound-guided percutaneous thrombin injection. Transverse color Doppler ultrasound image showed complete thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm and flow cessation after a total injection of 500 units of thrombin. The symptoms were also improved.","1666":"The Chiari 1.5 malformation is defined as a tonsillar herniation within a Chiari I malformation with additional caudal descent of the brainstem through the foramen magnum. We describe a patient with Chiari I malformation who evolved to Chiari 1.5 malformation during longitudinal follow-up. A 15-year-old girl presented with neck pain during exercise for two years. She had been diagnosed with Chiari I malformation with mild hydrocephalus after minor cervical trauma at the age of six years. At that time, she was asymptomatic. After she complained of aggravated neck pain, neuroimaging (nine years after first imaging) revealed caudal descent of the brainstem and syringomyelia in addition to progression of tonsillar herniation. Posterior fossa decompressive surgery resulted in complete resolution of neck pain. Based on neuroimaging and operative findings, she was diagnosed as Chiari 1.5 malformation. Neuroimaging performed seven months after surgery showed an increased anterior-posterior diameter of the medulla oblongata and markedly decreased syringomyelia. This case demonstrates progressive developmental process of the Chiari 1.5 malformation as an advanced form of the Chiari I malformation.","1667":"Cysticercosis is the most common parasitic infection affecting the central nervous system. Spinal neurocysticercosis (NCC) is very rare compared with intracranial NCC and requires more aggressive management because these lesions are poorly tolerated.

An aberrant VA which courses below the posterior arch of the atlas (C1) that does not pass through the C1 transverse foramen and without an osseous anomaly is rare. However, it is important to consider an abnormal course of the VA both preoperatively and intraoperatively in order to avoid critical vascular injuries in procedures which require exposure or control of the VA, such as the far-lateral approach and spinal operations.","1669":"Vertebral artery (VA) injury is a rare and serious complication of cervical spine surgery; this is due to difficulty in controlling hemorrhage, which can result in severe hypotension and cardiac arrest, and uncertain neurologic consequences. The authors report an extremely rare case of a 56-year-old woman who underwent direct surgical repair by end-to-end anatomosis of an unanticipated VA injury during C2 pedicle screwing. Postoperatively, the patient showed no neurological deterioration and computed tomography angiography of the VA demonstrated normal blood flow. Although direct occlusion of an injured VA by surgical ligation or endovascular embolization has been used for management of an unanticipated VA injury during surgery, these methods may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, despite its technical demand, microvascular primary repair can restore normal blood flow and minimizes the risk of immediate or delayed ischemic complications. Here we report an iatrogenic VA injury during C2 pedicle screwing, which was successfully treated by end-to-end anastomosis.","1670":"A sphenoid mucocele often presents late due to its deep seated anatomical site. And it has varied presentation due to its loose relationship to the cavernous sinus and the base of the skull. We describe a case of large sphenoid sinus mucocele. A middle aged old man suddenly developed third cranial nerve palsy. Brain imaging study revealed an isolated sphenoid sinus mucocele, compressing right cavernous sinus. Endoscopic marsupialization of the mucocele via transnasal approach led to complete resolution of the third cranial nerve palsy. Involvement of the third cranial nerve in isolated mucocele is rare but important neurosurgical implications which must be excluded. In addition, proper and timely treatment must be performed to avoid permanent neurologic deficit.","1671":"While a delayed intracerebral hemorrhage at the site of a ventricular catheter has occasionally been reported in literature, a delayed hemorrhage caused by venous infarction secondary to ventriculoperitoneal shunting has not been previously reported. In the present case, a 68-year-old woman underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting through a frontal burr hole, and developed a hemorrhagic transformation of venous infarction on the second postoperative day. This massive venous infarction was caused by bipolar coagulation and occlusion of a large paramedian cortical vein in association with atresia of the rostral superior sagittal sinus. Thus, to eliminate the risk of postoperative venous infarction, technical precautions to avoid damaging surface vessels in a burr hole are required under loupe magnification in ventriculoperitoneal shunting.","1672":null,"1673":"Iliac screw fixation has been used to prevent premature loosening of sacral fixation and to provide more rigid fixation of the sacropelvic unit. We describe our technique for iliac screw placement and review our experience with this technique. Thirteen consecutive patients who underwent spinopelvic fixation using iliac screws were enrolled. The indications for spinopelvic fixation included long segment fusions for spinal deformity and post-operative flat-back syndrome, symptomatic pseudoarthrosis of previous lumbosacral fusions, high-grade lumbosacral spondylolisthesis, lumbosacral tumors, and sacral fractures. Radiographic outcomes were assessed using plain radiographs, and computed tomographic scans. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and questionnaire about buttock pain. The median follow-up period was 33 months (range, 13-54 months). Radiographic fusion across the lumbosacral junction was obtained in all 13 patients. The average pre- and post-operative ODI scores were 40.0 and 17.5, respectively. The questionnaire for buttock pain revealed the following: 9 patients (69%) perceived improvement; 3 patients (23%) reported no change; and 1 patient (7.6%) had aggravation of pain. Two patients complained of prominence of the iliac hardware. The complications included one violation of the greater sciatic notch and one deep wound infection. Iliac screw fixation is a safe and valuable technique that provides added structural support to S1 screws in long-segment spinal fusions. Iliac screw fixation is an extensive surgical procedure with potential complications, but high success rates can be achieved when it is performed systematically and in appropriately selected patients. ","1674":"This study assessed the efficacy of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with cage alone compared with ACDF with plate instrumentation for radiologic and clinical outcomes in two-level cervical degenerative disease. Patients with cervical degenerative disc disease from September 2004 to December 2009 were assessed retrospectively. A total of 42 patients received all ACDF at two-level cervical lesion. Twenty-two patients who underwent ACDF with cage alone were compared with 20 patients who underwent ACDF with plate fixation in consideration of radiologic and clinical outcomes. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Robinson's criteria and posterior neck pain, arm pain described by a 10 point-visual analog scale. Fusion rate, subsidence, kyphotic angle, instrument failure and the degenerative changes in adjacent segments were examined during each follow-up examination. VAS was checked during each follow-up and Robinson's criteria were compared in both groups. Both groups showed no significant difference. Fusion rates were 90.9% (20\/22) in ACDF with the cage alone group, 95% (19\/20) in ACDF with the plate fixation group (p = 0.966). Subsidence rates of ACDF with cage alone were 31.81% (7\/22) and ACDF with plate fixation were 30% (6\/20) (p = 0.928). Local and regional kyphotic angle difference showed no significant difference. At the final follow-up, adjacent level disease developed in 4.54% (1\/22) of ACDF with cage alone and 10% (2\/20) of ACDF with plate fixation (p = 0.654). In two-level ACDF, ACDF with cage alone would be comparable with ACDF with plate fixation with regard to clinical outcome and radiologic result with no significant difference. We suggest that the routine use of plate and screw in 2-level surgery may not be beneficial. ","1675":"Anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion (ACF) or laminoplasty may be associated with substantial number of complications for treating multilevel cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) with significant cord compression. For more safe decompression and stabilization in multilevel cervical OPLL with prominent cord compression, we propose circumferential cervical surgery (selective ACF and laminoplasty) based on our favorable experience. Twelve patients with cervical myelopathy underwent circumferential cervical surgery and all patients showed multilevel OPLL with signal change of the spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A retrospective review of clinical, radiological, and surgical data was conducted. There were 9 men and 3 women with mean age of 56.7 years and a mean follow up period of 15.6 months. The average corpectomy level was 1.16 and laminoplasty level was 4.58. The average Japanese Orthopedic Association score for recovery was 5.1 points and good clinical results were obtained in 11 patients (92%) (p &lt; 0.05). The average space available for the cord improved from 58.2% to 87.9% and the average Cobb's angle changed from 7.63 to 12.27 at 6 months after operation without failure of fusion (p &lt; 0.05). Average operation time was 8.36 hours, with an estimated blood loss of 760 mL and duration of bed rest of 2.0 days. There were no incidences of significant surgical complications, including wound infection. Although the current study examined a small sample with relatively short-term follow-up periods, our study results demonstrate that circumferential cervical surgery is considered favorable for safety and effectiveness in multilevel OPLL with prominent cord compression. ","1676":"Residual aneurysm from incomplete clipping or slowly recurrent aneurysm is associated with high risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. We describe complete treatment of the lesions by surgical clipping or endovascular treatment. We analyzed 11 patients of residual or recurrent aneurysms who had undergone surgical clipping from 1998 to 2009. Among them, 5 cases were initially clipped at our hospital. The others were referred from other hospitals after clipping. The radiologic and medical records were retrospectively analyzed. All patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage at first time, and the most frequent location of the ruptured residual or recurrent aneurysm was in the anterior communicating artery to posterior-superior direction. Distal anterior cerebral artery, posterior communicating artery, and middle cerebral artery was followed. Repositioning of clipping in eleven cases, and one endovascular treatment were performed. No residual aneurysm was found in postoperative angiography, and no complication was noted in related to the operations. These results indicate the importance of postoperative or follow up angiography and that reoperation of residual or slowly recurrent aneurysm should be tried if such lesions being found. Precise evaluation and appropriate planning including endovascular treatment should be performed for complete obliteration of the residual or recurrent aneurysm. ","1677":"Traditionally, peritoneal catheter is inserted with midline laparotomy incision in ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunt procedures. Complications of V-P shunt is not uncommon and have been reported to occur in 5-37% of cases. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes and the operation time between laparotomy and laparoscopic groups. A total of 155 V-P shunt procedures were performed to treat hydrocephalic patients of various origins in our institute between June 2006 to January 2010; 95 of which were laparoscopically guided and 65 were not. We reviewed the operation time, surgery-related complications, and intraoperative and postoperative problems. In the laparoscopy group, the mean duration of the procedure (52 minutes) was significantly shorter (p &lt; 0.001) than the laparotomy group (109 minutes). There were two cases of malfunctions and one incidence of diaphragm injury in the laparotomy group. In contrast, there were neither malfunction nor any internal organ injuries in the laparoscopy group (p = 0.034). There were total of two cases of infections from both groups (p = 0.7). Laparoscopically guided insertions of distal shunt catheter is considered a fast and safe method in contrast to the laparotomy technique. This method allows the exact localization of the peritoneal catheter and a confirmation of its patency. ","1678":"The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between thromboembolic complications and antiplatelet drugs before and after neurointervention. Blood samples and radiographic data of patients who received a neurointervention (coil embolization, stent placement or both) were collected prospectively. Rapid platelet function assay-aspirin (RPFA-ASA) was used to calculate aspirin resistance in aspirin reaction units (ARU). For clopidogrel resistance, a P2Y12 assay was used to analyze the percentage of platelet inhibition. ARU &gt; 550 and platelet inhibition &lt; 40% were defined as aspirin and clopidogrel resistance, respectively. Both aspirin and clopidogrel oral pills were administered in fifty-three patients before and after neurointerventional procedures. The mean resistance values of all patients were 484 ARU and &lt; 39%. Ten (17.0%) of 53 patients showed resistance to aspirin with an average of 597 ARU, and 33 (62.3%) of 53 patients showed resistance to clopidogrel with an average of &lt; 26%. Ten patients demonstrated resistance to both drugs, 5 of which suffered a thromboembolic complication after neurointervention (mean values : 640 ARU and platelet inhibition &lt; 23%). Diabetic patients and patients with hypercholesterolemia displayed mean aspirin resistances of 513.7 and 501.8 ARU, and mean clopidogrel resistances of &lt; 33.8% and &lt; 40.7%, respectively. Identifying individuals with poor platelet inhibition using standard regimens is of great clinical importance and may help prevent cerebral ischemic events in the future. Neurointerventional research should focus on ideal doses, timing, choices, safety, and reliable measurements of antiplatelet drug therapy, as well as confirming the clinical relevance of aggregometry in cerebrovascular patients. ","1679":"The amount of hemorrhage observed on a brain computed tomography scan, or a patient's Fisher grade (FG), is a powerful risk factor for development of shunt dependent hydrocephlaus (SDHC). However, the influence of treatment modality (clipping versus coiling) on the rate of SDHC development has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we compared the risk of SDHC in both treatment groups according to the amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We retrospectively reviewed 839 patients with aneurysmal SAH for a 5-year-period. Incidence of chronic SDHC was analyzed using each treatment modality according to the FG system. In addition, other well known risk factors for SDHC were also evaluated. According to our data, Hunt-Hess grade, FG, acute hydrocephalus, and intraventricular hemorrhage were significant risk factors for development of chronic SDHC. Coiling group showed lower incidence of SDHC in FG 2 patients, and clipping groups revealed a significantly lower rate in FG 4 patients. Based on our data, treatment modality might have an influence on the incidence of SDHC. In FG 4 patients, the clipping group showed lower incidence of SDHC, and the coiling group showed lower incidence in FG 2 patients. We suggest that these findings could be a considerable factor when deciding on a treatment modality for aneurysmal SAH patients, particularly when the ruptured aneurysm can be occluded by either clipping or coiling.

Twenty-five 10-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats were used. Five rats were euthanized after two weeks, and BMD was measured in their femora. The other 20 rats were assigned to one of two groups : a sham group (n = 10), which underwent a sham operation, and an OVX group (n = 10), which underwent bilateral OVX at 12 weeks of age. After six weeks, five rats from each group were euthanized, and BMD was measured in their femora. The same procedures were performed in the remaining rats form each group eight weeks later. The femur BMD was significantly lower in the six-week OVX group than in the six-week sham group, and in the eight-week OVX group than in the eight-week sham group. Bilateral OVX is a safe method for creating an osteopenic rat model. The significant decrease in BMD appears six weeks after bilateral OVX.

A 54-year-old man presented with a pulsatile, cystic, and painless mass in the right anterior temporal region which developed three weeks after head fixation via Gardner traction. At the time of discovery, the mass was 10 mm in diameter, compressible and disappeared after manual compression of the proximal STA. A bruit was audible over the mass, which was thought to be a pseudoaneurysm. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) showed a pseudoaneurysm of the parietal division of the right STA. The tip of the pseudoaneurysm was thrombosed and was both red and tender. The pseudoaneurysm was thought to be filled with infected thrombus, and the mass was resected with ligation of the proximal and distal ends of the STA. A pseudoaneurysm of the STA should be suspected when there is a history of possible vessel injury, such as a history of head-pin fixation, and when a patient presents with a pulsatile, cystic mass near the temple. Pseudoaneurysms can be successfully treated by excision.","1685":"The common etiologies of pneumocephalus, presence of air in the intracranial cavity, are trauma and cranial surgery. Pneumocephalus after spinal surgery is an unusual postoperative complication. We report the case of a male 59-year-old man who developed a pneumacephalus after posterior lumbar surgery for spinal stenosis. Intraoperatively, a cerebrospinal fluid leak following a dural tear was noted and immediately repaired. The next day, the patient complained of headache and dizziness. Head and lumbar computed tomography scans revealed significant air in the frontal region, several cisterns, intraventricle, and extra-dural area in the spine canal. Symptoms were spontaneously resolved within 2 weeks with conservative management.","1686":"Although the spontaneous disappearance or decrease in size of a herniated disc is well known, that of a large extruded disc has rarely been reported.

The literature is reviewed and the possible mechanisms of spontaneous disc regression are discussed.","1687":"Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare complication associated with pain control procedures such as facet block, acupuncture, epidural injection, etc. Although it is an uncommon cause of acute myelopathy, and it may require surgical evacuation. We report four patients with epidural hematoma developed after pain control procedures. Two procedures were facet joint blocks and the others were epidural blocks. Pain was the predominant initial symptom in these patients while two patients presented with post-procedural neurological deficits. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma was performed in two patients while in remaining two patients, surgery was initially recommended but not performed since symptoms were progressively improved. Three patients showed near complete recovery except for one patient who recovered with residual deficits. Although, spinal epidural hematoma is a rare condition, it can lead to serious complications like spinal cord compression. Therefore, it is important to be cautious while performing spinal pain control procedure to avoid such complications. Surgical treatment is an effective option to resolve the spinal epidural hematoma.","1688":"Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of the soft tissue, with myxoid liposarcoma being the second most common subtype, tending to occur in the limbs, particularly in the thighs. Myxoid liposarcomas have an intermediate prognosis between well-differentiated and pleomorphic tumors. Spinal metastasis is usual but intradural involvement is extremely rare. We present an unusual case of a multicentric myxoid liposarcoma with intradural involvement. A 41-year-old woman complained of tingling sensation on her left arm. Radiological evaluation revealed multiple masses in her cervical spine, abdominal wall, liver, heart and right thigh, all of which were resected. She was histologically diagnosed with small round cell myxoid sarcoma and underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. However, magnetic resonance imaging analysis after 1 year revealed a large metastatic mass with bony invasion at the C6-T1 level. This mass consisted of extradural and intradural components causing severe compression of the spinal cord. She underwent resection via a posterior facetectomy of C6-7 and an anterior C7 corpectomy. However, the patient died of multiple metastases 18 months after the first diagnosis.","1689":null,"1690":null,"1691":"Although cerebellar hemangioblastomas are histopathologically benign, they yield a degree of malignant clinical behavior in long-term follow-up. We present two cases of long-term progression of renal cell carcinoma, which had been diagnosed as renal cysts during treatment for cerebellar hemangioblastoma. A 14-year-old male with von Hippel-Lindau disease was admitted for a cerebellar hemangioblastoma with multiple spinal hemangioblastomas and a renal cyst. After primary total resection of the cerebellar hemangioblastoma, the patient required two further surgeries after 111 and 209 months for a recurrent cerebellar hemangioblastoma. Furthermore, he underwent radical nephrectomy as his renal cyst had progressed to renal cell carcinoma 209 months after initial diagnosis. A 26-year-old male presented with multiple cerebellar hemangioblastomas associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease and accompanied by multiple spinal hemangioblastomas and multiple cystic lesions in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. He underwent primary resection of the cerebellar hemangioblastoma in association with craniospinal radiation for multiple intracranial\/spinal masses. Unexpectedly, a malignant glioma developed 83 months after discovery of the cerebellar hemangioblastoma. At the same time, renal cell carcinoma, which had developed from an initial renal cyst, was diagnosed, and a radical nephrectomy was performed. In the view of long term clinical course, cerebellar hemangioblastoma associated with von Hipple-Lindau disease may redevelop even after primary total resection. In addition, associated lesions such as renal cysts may also progress to malignancy after the passing of a sufficient length of time.","1692":"Large to giant middle cerebral artery aneurysm is a challenging disease, especially when incorporating important perforating arteries. Surgical risk increases by perforator infarction and anatomical complexity. In this clinical setting, extensive consideration of surgical options is needed. The two cases described here were unruptured and had rather stable wall. Because of their large and giant size, hardness and incorporated arteries, it was not affordable to isolate them by means of clipping or trapping. The procedure as the alternative to conventional treatment modalities, extracranial-intracranial bypass followed by clipping of only the efferent artery successfully treated the aneurysms.","1693":"Despite rapid evolution of shunt devices, the complication rates remain high. The most common causes are turning from obstruction, infection, and overdrainage into mainly underdrainage. We investigated the incidence of complications in a consecutive series of hydrocephalic patients. From January 2002 to December 2009, 111 patients underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting at our hospital. We documented shunt failures and complications according to valve type, primary disease, and number of revisions. Overall shunt survival time was 268 weeks. Mean survival time of gravity-assisted valve (GAV) was 222 weeks versus 286 weeks for other shunts. Survival time of programmable valves (264 weeks) was longer than that of pressure-controlled valves (186 weeks). The most common cause for shunt revision was underdrainage (13 valves). The revision rate due to underdrainage in patients with GAV (7 of 10 patients) was higher than that for other valve types. Of 7 patients requiring revision for GAV underdrainage, 6 patients were bedridden. The overall infection rate was 3.6%, which was lower than reported series. Seven patients demonstrating overdrainage had cranial defects when operations were performed (41%), and overdrainage was improved in 5 patients after cranioplasty. Although none of the differences was statistically significant, some of the observations were especially notable. If a candidate for VP shunting is bedridden, GAV may not be indicated because it could lead to underdrainage. Careful procedure and perioperative management can reduce infection rate. Cranioplasty performed prior to VP shunting may be beneficial. ","1694":null,"1695":"Radiofrequency (RF) medial branch neurotomy is an effective management of lumbar facet syndrome. However, pain may recur after period of time. When pain recurs, it can be repeated, but the successful outcome and duration of relief from repeated procedures are not clearly known. The objective of this study was to determine the success rate and duration of pain relief from repeated radiofrequency medial branch neurotomy for lumbar facet syndrome. A retrospective review of medical records was done on 60 consecutive patients, from March of 2006 to February of 2009, who had an initial successful RF neurotomy but subsequently underwent repeated procedures due to recurrence of pain. All procedures were done in carefully selected patients after at least two responsive medial branch nerve blocks. C-arm fluoroscopic guide, impedance, sensory and motor threshold monitoring tools were used for the precise placement of electrodes. Responses of repeated procedures were compared with initial radiofrequency neurotomy for success rates and duration of pain relief. There were 48 females and 12 males. Mean age was 52.4 years (range, 26-83). RF medial branch neurotomy was done on one side in 38 and both sides in 22 patients, each covering at least three segments. Average visual analog scale at last procedure was 6.8. Twelve patients had previous lumbar operations, including 4 patients with instrumentations. Fifty-five patients had two procedures and five patients had three procedures. Mean duration of successful pain relief (&gt; 50% of previous pain for at least 3 months period) after initial radiofrequency neurotomy was 10.9 months (range, 3-28) in 51 (85%) patients. From repeated procedures, successful pain relief was seen in 50 (91%) patients with average duration of 10.2 months (range, 3-24). Five patients had third procedure, which was successful in 4 (80%) patients with mean duration of 9.8 months (range, 5-16). This was not statistically different from initial results. There were no permanent neurological complications from the procedures. Results of this study indicate that the frequency of success and durations of relief from repeated RF medial branch neurotomy for lumbar facet syndrome are similar to initial results that provided relatively prolonged period of pain relief without major side effects. Each procedure seems to provide successful pain relief for about 10 months in more than 85% of carefully selected patients when properly done.

The patients of the middle intermediate period, which were subjected to changed surgical strategies, were excluded. The surgical outcome data from the initial and recent groups showed a much improved outcome for patients who underwent temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery over time. The number of patients with a good outcome (Engel class I-II) was much increased from 87.7% (178 TLE cases of Group I) to 94.8% (79 TLE cases of Group II) and this was statistically significant (p = 0.0324) on univariate analysis. Other remarkable changes were the decreased performance of intracranial invasive studies from 43.5% in Group I to 30.9% in Group II due to the advanced neuroimaging tools. The strip\/grid ratio was reduced from 131\/32 in Group I to 17\/25 in Group II, because of a markedly reduced mesial TLE surgery and an increased extratemporal epilepsy surgery. Our results show that surgical outcome of epilepsy surgery has improved over time and it has shown to be efficient to control medically intractable epilepsy. Appropriate patient selection, comprehensive preoperative assessments and more extensive resection are associated with good postoperative outcomes. ","1698":"The authors introduce a minimally invasive muscle sparing transmuscular microdiscectomy (MSTM) to treat herniated lumbar disc disease. Its results are compared with conventional subperiosteal microdiscectomy (CSM) to validate the effectiveness. Muscle sparing transmuscular microdiscectomy, which involves muscle dissection approach using the natural fat cleavage plane between the multifidus to expose the interlaminar space, was performed in 23 patients to treat a single level unilateral lumbar radiculopathy. The creatine phosphokinase (CPK)-MM serum levels were measured on admission and at 1, 3, and 5 days postoperatively. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) and recorded on admission and at 1, 3, and 5 days postoperatively. The results were compared to those from the conventional subperiosteal microdiscectomy (43 patients). The CPK-MM levels were significantly lower in the serum of the MSTM group compared to the CSM group on postoperative days three and five (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). The clinical scales for back pain using VAS were significantly lower in the MSTM group than in the CSM group on postoperative days three (p = 0.04). The mean VAS scores for leg pain in both groups showed no significant differences during the early postoperative period. Muscle sparing transmuscular microdiscectomy is a minimally invasive surgical option to treat lumbar radiculopathy due to herniated disc. The approach affected minimal injury to posterior lumbar supporting structures with alleviated postoperative back pain. ","1699":"A minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF) has recently been introduced. However, MIS TLIF is a technically challenging procedure. The authors performed retrospective analysis about MIS TLIF using a single interbody cage. Twenty-eight consecutive patients were treated by MIS TLIF. Of these 28 patients, 20 patients were included in this retrospective study. Perioperative, clinical, and radiologic outcomes were assessed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scores (VAS). Fusion rates and cross-sections of operated spinal canals were assessed by CT. Twelve patients underwent MIS TLIF at one segment and 8 patients at two segments (L3\/4: 4, L4\/5: 17, L5\/S1: 7). Operation time for a single segment was 131.7 min and for two segment was 201.4 min, and corresponding blood losses were 208.3 mL and 481.2 mL, respectively. ODI and VAS scores were significantly improved at 6 months postop (ODI from 30.32 to 15. 54, VAS from 7.80 to 2.20, p = 0.001). Twenty-two segments (78.6%) achieved grade I fusion, 4 segments (14.3%) achieved grade II, 2 segments (7.1%) achieved grade III and 0 segments achieved grade IV at 12 months. Postoperatively at 12 months, spinal canal cross sectional areas at disc spaces significantly increased from 157.5 to 294.3 mm(2) (p = 0.012). MIS TLIF achieved good clinical outcomes and high fusion rates. Our findings show that MIS TLIF performed with a single interbody cage and a tubular retractor system can be used as a standard MIS TLIF technique. ","1700":"Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is described as a clinical syndrome characterized by sudden headache, vomiting, visual impairment, and meningismus caused by rapid enlargement of a pituitary adenoma. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentation and surgical outcome in PA presenting with cranial neuropathy. Twelve cases (3.3%) of PA were retrospectively reviewed among 359 patients diagnosed with pituitary adenoma. The study included 6 males and 6 females. Mean age of patients was 49.0 years, with a range of 16 to 74 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 3 to 20 months, with an average of 12 months. All patients were submitted to surgery, using the transsphenoidal approach (TSA). Symptoms included abrupt headache (11\/12), decreased visual acuity (12\/12), visual field defect (11\/12), and cranial nerve palsy of the third (5\/12) and sixth (2\/12). Mean height of the mass was 29.0 mm (range 15-46). Duration between the ictus and operation ranged from 1 to 15 days (mean 7.0). The symptom duration before operation and the recovery period of cranial neuropathy correlated significantly (p = 0.0286). TSA resulted in improvement of decreased visual acuity in 91.6%, visual field defect in 54.5%, and cranial neuropathy in 100% at 3 months after surgery. PA is a rare event, complicating 3.3% in our series. Even in blindness following pituitary apoplexy cases, improvement of cranial neuropathy is possible if adequate management is initiated in time. Surgical decompression must be considered as soon as possible in cases with severe visual impairment or cranial neuropathy. ","1701":"To assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of the balloon-assisted technique with HyperForm balloon in the endovascular treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. A total of 34 patients with 34 wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated with endovascular coil embolization using balloon-assisted technique with Hyperform balloon. Twenty-nine aneurysms (85.3%) were located in the anterior circulation. The group of patients was comprised of 16 men and 18 women, aged 33 to 72 years (mean : 60.6 years). The size of aneurysms was in the range of 2.0 to 22.0 mm (mean 5.5 mm) and one of neck was 2.0 to 11.9 mm (mean 3.8 mm). The dome to neck ratio was ranged from 0.83 to 1.43 (1.15). Sixteen patients were treated for unruptured aneurysms and the remaining 18 presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the 34 aneurysms treated by the remodeling technique with HyperForm balloon, immediate angiographic results consisted of total occlusion in 31 cases (91.2%) and partial occlusion in three cases (8.8%). There were five procedure-related complications (14.7%), including two coil protrusions and three thromboembolisms; Except one patient, all were successfully resolved without permanent neurologic deficit. No new bleeding occurred during the follow-up. Twenty patients (59%) underwent angiographic follow-up from 2 to 33 months (mean 9.2 months) after treatment. Focal recanalization with coil compaction of the neck portion was observed in 5 cases (25%). Only one case showed major recanalization and underwent stent-assisted coil embolization. The balloon-assisted technique with Hyperform balloon is a feasible, safe, and effective endovascular treatment of wide-necked cerebral aneurysms. ","1702":"Paraclinoid segment internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms have historically been a technical challenge for neurovascular surgeons. The development of microsurgical approach, advances in surgical techniques, and endovascular procedures have improved the outcome for paraclinoid aneurysms. However, many authors have reported high complication rates from microsurgical treatments. Therefore, the present study reviews the microsurgical complications of the extradural anterior clinoidectomy for treating paraclinoid aneurysms and investigates the prevention and management of observed complications. Between January 2004 and April 2008, 22 patients with 24 paraclinoid aneurysms underwent microsurgical direct clipping by a cerebrovascular team at a regional neurosurgical center. Microsurgery was performed via an ipsilateral pterional approach with extradural anterior clinoidectomy. We retrospectively reviewed patients' medical charts, office records, radiographic studies, and operative records. IN OUR SERIES, THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES AFTER AN IPSILATERAL PTERIONAL APPROACH WITH EXTRADURAL ANTERIOR CLINOIDECTOMY FOR PARACLINOID ANEURYSMS WERE EXCELLENT OR GOOD (GLASGOWS OUTCOME SCALE : GOS 5 or 4) in 87.5% of cases. The microsurgical complications related directly to the extradural anterior clinoidectomy included transient cranial nerve palsy (6), cerebrospinal fluid leak (1), worsened change in vision (1), unplanned ICA occlusion (1), and epidural hematoma (1). Only one of the complications resulted in permanent morbidity (4.2%), and none resulted in death. Although surgical complications are still reported to occur more frequently for the treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms, the permanent morbidity and mortality resulting from a extradural anterior clinoidectomy in our series were lower than previously reported. Precise anatomical knowledge combined with several microsurgical tactics can help to achieve good outcomes with minimal complications. ","1703":"The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of possible complications of cervical lateral screw fixation and the achievements of bicortical purchase using the Roy-Camille, Magerl and the modified methods. Six fresh-frozen cervical spine segments were harvested. The Roy-Camille technique was applied to C3 and C4, and the Magerl technique was applied to C5, C6, and C7 of one side of each cadaver. The modified technique was applied to the other side of each cadaver. The nerve root injury, violation of the facet joint, vertebral artery injury, and the bicortication were examined at each screwing level. No vertebral artery injury was observed in any of the three methods. One nerve root injury was observed in each cervical spine segment using the Roy-Camille method (8.3%), the Magerl method (5.6%), and the modified method (3.3%). Facet joint injuries were observed in two cervical spinal segments using the Roy-Camille method (16.7%) and three with the Magerl method (16.7%), while five facet joint violations occurred when using the modified method (16.7%). Bicortical purchases were achieved on ten cervical spinal segments with the Roy-Camille method (83.3%) and Magerl method (55.6%), while twenty bicortical purchases were achieved in the modified method (66.7%). The advantages of the modified method are that it is performed by using given anatomical structures and that the complication rate is as low as those of other known methods. This modified method can be performed easily and safely without fluoroscopic assistance for the treatment of many cervical diseases.

Subsequent diagnostic evaluation with ultrasonographic imaging revealed the presence of a glomus tumor in the tender area. Glomus tumors are benign, occurring in the vascular hamartomatous tubercles of the glomus body, which is a myoarterial apparatus typically found in the reticular dermis of the skin. Distal glomus tumors are relatively uncommon, and account for approximately 1% of all hand tumors. Most of them are located in the subungual area because of its high concentration of glomus bodies. We report a case of a glomus tumor with a typical triad of symptoms, yet with a rare location : on the pulp of the ulnar aspect of the distal phalanx of the right little finger.","1706":"A case of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) misdiagnosed as an acute subdural hematoma is reported. A 37-year-old male patient presented with headache following head trauma 2 weeks earlier. Computerized tomography showed a diffuse high-density lesion along the left tentorium and falx cerebri. Initial chest X-rays revealed a small mass in the right upper lobe with right lower pleural thickening, which suggested lung cancer, such as an adenoma or mediastinal metastasis. During conservative treatment under the diagnosis of a subdural hematoma, left cranial nerve palsies were developed (3rd and 6th), followed by scleritis and uveitis involving both eyes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an unusual tentorium-falx enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images. Non-specific chronic inflammation of the pachymeninges was noticed on histopathologic examination following an open biopsy. Systemic steroid treatment was initiated, resulting in dramatic improvement of symptoms. A follow-up brain MRI showed total resolution of the lesion 2 months after steroid treatment. IHCP should be included in the differential diagnosis of subtentorial-enhancing lesions.","1707":"Giant serpentine aneurysms are rare and have distinct angiographic findings. The rarity, large size, complex anatomy and hemodynamic characteristics of giant serpentine aneurysms make treatment difficult. We report a case of a giant serpentine aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) that presented as headache. Treatment involved a superficial temporal artery (STA)-MCA bypass followed by aneurysm resection. The patient was discharged without neurological deficits, and early and late follow-up angiography disclosed successful removal of the aneurysm and a patent bypass graft. We conclude that STA-MCA bypass and aneurysm excision is a successful treatment method for a giant serpentine aneurysm.","1708":null,"1709":"Benign osteoblastoma is an uncommon primary bone tumor, extremely rare in calvarium.

A 53-year-old male patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, who was admitted to the department of oncology, was referred to department of neurosurgery because of sudden mental deterioration to semicoma with papillary anisocoria and decerebrate rigidity after transarterial chemoembolization for hepatoma. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed large amount of acute EDH with severe midline shifting. An emergent craniotomy and evacuation of EDH was performed. Active bleeding from middle cranial fossa floor was identified. There showed osteolytic change on the middle fossa floor with friable mass-like lesion spreading on the overlying dura suggesting metastasis. Pathological examination revealed anaplastic cells with sinusoidal arrangement which probably led to spontaneous hemorrhage and formation of EDH. As a rare cause of spontaneous EDH, dural metastasis from malignancy should be considered.","1711":"Intramedullary spinal cord metastases are very rare.

Despite its importance, there are no accurate statistics on primary CNS tumors in Korea. We analyzed primary CNS tumors diagnosed in 2005 from the nationwide registry. Data on primary CNS tumors diagnosed in 2005 were collected from the Korean Central Cancer Registry and the Korean Brain Tumor Society. Crude and age-standardized rates were calculated in terms of gender, age, and histological type. Tumors of uncertain histology were investigated individually at the corresponding hospitals and had their diagnoses confirmed. A total of 5,692 patients diagnosed with primary CNS tumors in 2005 were included in this study. CNS tumors occurred in females more often than in males (female to male, 1.43 : 1). The most common tumor was meningioma (31.2%). Glioblastoma accounted for 30.7% of all gliomas, and 19.3% of all malignant primary CNS tumors. In children under 19 years of age, both germ cell tumor and embryonal\/primitive\/medulloblastoma were the most common tumors.

","1715":"We report our surgical experience in the treatment of 16 consecutive patients with benign craniovertebral junction (CVJ) tumor, observed from 2003 to 2008 at our department. We had treated 6 foramen magnum meningiomas, 6 cervicomedullary hemangioblastomas, 1 accessory nerve schwannoma, 1 hypoglossal nerve schwannoma, 1 C2 root schwannoma, and 1 cavernous hemangioma. Clinical results were evaluated by Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and all patients underwent preoperative neuroradiological evaluation with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image (MRI). Angiography was performed in 15 patients and preoperative embolization was done in 2 patients. Five far-lateral, 1 supracondylar and 10 midline suboccipital approaches were performed. Gross total removal was achieved in 15 cases (94%) and subtotal removal in 1 patient (6%). None of the patients required occipitocervical fusion. Radiological follow-up showed no recurrence in cases totally removed. Postoperative decrease of KPS scores was recorded in only 1 patient. The treatment of cervicomedullary solid hemangioblastoma presented particular issues : by preoperative embolization, we removed tumor totally without an excessive bleeding or brainstem injury. In one of foramen magnum meningioma, we carried out subtotal removal due to hard tumor consistency and encasement of neurovascular structures. : The choice of surgical approaches and the extent of bone resection should be defined according to the location and size of individual tumors.

Recently, intralaminar screws have been used as a potentially safer alternative to traditional fusion constructs involving fixation of C2 and the cervicothoracic junction including C7. However, to date, there have been few clinical series of C7 laminar screw fixation in the literature. Thus, the purpose of this study is to report our clinical experiences using C7 laminar screw and the early clinical outcome of this rather new fixation technique. Thirteen patients underwent C7 intralaminar fixation to treat lesions from trauma or degenerative disease. Seventeen intralaminar screws were placed at C7. The patients were assessed both clinically and radiographically with postoperative computed tomographic scans. There was no violation of the screw into the spinal canal during the procedure and no neurological worsening or vascular injury from screw placement. The mean clinical and radiographic follow up was about 19 months, at which time there were no cases of screw pull-out, screw fracture or non-union. Complications included two cases of dorsal breech of intralaminar screw and one case of postoperative infection. Intralaminar screws can be potentially safe alternative technique for C7 fixation. Even though this technique cannot be used in the cases of C7 laminar fracture, large margin of safety and the ease of screw placement create a niche for this technique in the armamentarium of spine surgeons. ","1718":"The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal volume of injected cement and its distribution when used to treat vertebral compression fractures, and to identify factors related to subsequent vertebral fractures. A retrospective analysis of newly developing vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty was done. The inclusion criteria were that the fracture was a single first onset fracture with exclusion of pathologic fractures. Forty-three patients were included in the study with a minimum follow up period of six months. Patients were dichotomized for the analysis by volume of cement, initial vertebral height loss, bone marrow density, and endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation. None of the four study variables was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of a subsequent vertebral compression fracture. In particular, and injected cement volume of more or less that 3.5 cc was not associated with occurrence (p = 0.2523). No relation was observed between initial vertebral height loss and bone marrow density (p = 0.1652, 0.2064). Furthermore, endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation was also not found to be significantly associated with a subsequent fracture (p = 0.2860) by Fisher's exact test. Neither volume of cement, initial vertebral height loss, bone marrow density, or endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation was found to be significantly related to the occurrence of a subsequent vertebral compression fracture.

","1719":"Disc herniations at the L1-L2 and L2-L3 levels are different from those at lower levels of the lumbar spine with regard to clinical characteristics and surgical outcome. Spinal canals are narrower than those of lower levels, which may compromise multiple spinal nerve roots or conus medullaris. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and surgical outcomes of upper lumbar disc herniations. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of 41 patients who had undergone surgery for single disc herniations at the L1-L2 and L2-3 levels from 1998 to 2007. The affected levels were L1-L2 in 14 patients and L2-L3 in 27 patients. Presenting symptoms and signs, patient characteristics, radiologic findings, operative methods, and surgical outcomes were investigated. The mean age of patients with upper lumbar disc was 55.5 years (ranged 31 to 78). The mean follow-up period was 16.6 months. Most patients complained of back and buttock pain (38 patients, 92%), and radiating pain in areas such as the anterior or anterolateral aspect of the thigh (32 patients, 78%). Weakness of lower extremities was observed in 16 patients (39%) and sensory disturbance was presented in 19 patients (46%). Only 6 patients (14%) had undergone previous lumbar disc surgery. Discectomy was performed using three methods : unilateral laminectomy in 27 cases, bilateral laminectomy in 3 cases, and the transdural approach in 11 cases, which were performed through total laminectomy in 10 cases and unilateral laminectomy in 1 case. With regard to surgical outcomes, preoperative symptoms improved significantly in 33 patients (80.5%), partially in 7 patients (17%), and were aggravated in 1 patient (2.5%). Clinical features of disc herniations at the L1-L2 and L2-L3 levels were variable, and localized sensory change or pain was rarely demonstrated. In most cases, the discectomy was performed successfully by conventional posterior laminectomy. On the other hand, in large central broad based disc herniation, when the neural elements are severely compromised, the posterior transdural approach could be an alternative. ","1720":"Cerebral aneurysms which cause oculomotor nerve [cranial nerve (CN) III] palsy, are frequently found with a daughter sac of the aneurysm dome. We assumed that CN III might be compressed by the daughter sac and it would be more helpful not to fill the daughter sac with coils than vice versa during endosaccular embolization for recovering from CN III palsy, because it may give a greater chance for the daughter sac to shrink by itself later. We reviewed the initial results of our experiences of such cases. Among 9 aneurysms accompanied by CN III palsy, 7 (6 unruptured, 1 ruptured) showed a daughter sac. We tried to fill the main dome completely and spare the daughter sac from coil filling to increase the possibility of decompression. We evaluated the short-term effectiveness of this concept using medical records and angiograms. After initial embolization, all of CN III palsy caused by unruptured aneurysms (6\/6) resolved completely after various periods (3-90 days) of time. No adverse effects were noted during and after the procedures except for one case of harmless coil stretching during coil filling using double microcatheter. During the coil embolization of the cerebral aneurysm causing CN III palsy, sparing the daughter sac from coil packing while tightly packing the main dome, can be helpful in increasing the effectiveness of decompression. However, a long-term follow-up will be required. ","1721":"To evaluate the clinical outcome of coil embolization for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) with oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) compared with surgical clipping. A total of 19 patients presented with ONP caused by UIAs between Jan 2004 and June 2008. Ten patients underwent coil embolization and nine patients surgical clipping. The following parameters were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the differences in clinical outcome observed in both coil embolization and surgical clipping : 1) gender, 2) age, 3) location of the aneurysm, 4) duration of the symptom, and 5) degree of ONP. Following treatment, complete symptomatic recovery or partial relief from ONP was observed in 15 patients. Seven of the ten patients were treated by coil embolization, compared to eight of the nine patients treated by surgical clipping (p = 0.582). Patient's gender, age, location of the aneurysm, size of the aneurysm, duration of symptom, and degree of the ONP did not statistically correlate with recovery of symptoms between the two groups. No significant differences were observed in mean improvement time in either group (55 days in coil embolization and 60 days in surgical clipping). This study indicates that no significant differences were observed in the clinical outcome between coil embolization and surgical clipping techniques in the treatment of aneurysms causing ONP. Coil embolization seems to be more feasible and safe treatment modality for the relief and recovery of oculomotor nerve palsy. ","1722":"Some neurosurgeons intentionally ligate the branches of the superficial temporal artery (STA) that are not used in standard STA-to-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomosis for the purpose of improving the flow rate in the bypass graft. We investigated changes in bypass flow during temporary occlusion of such unused branches of the STA. Bypass blood flow was measured by a quantitative microvascular ultrasonic flow probe before and after temporary occlusion of branches of the STA that were not used for anastomosis. We performed measurements on twelve subjects and statistically assessed changes in flow. We also examined all the patients with digital subtraction angiography in order to observe any post-operative changes in STA diameter. Initial STA flow ranged from 15 mL\/min to 85 mL\/min, and the flow did not change significantly during occlusion as compared with pre-occlusion flow. The occlusion time was extended by 30 minutes in all cases, but this did not contribute to any significant flow change. The amount of bypass flow in the STA seems to be influenced not by donor vessel status but by recipient vessel demand. Ligation of the unused STA branch after completion of anastomosis does not contribute to improvement in bypass flow immediately after surgery, and furthermore, carries some risk of skin necrosis. It is better to leave the unused branch of the STA intact for use in secondary operation and to prevent donor vessel occlusion.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhanced and thickened pituitary stalk accompanying a suspicious mass. The provisional diagnoses were lymphoma, glioma, or other inflammatory conditions. Laboratory studies, including blood and hormonal studies, showed normal findings. Surgical resection was performed. In the pathological examination, degenerated parasitic wall structure was seen and its contents were composed of completely degenerated focal globular structures suggesting the scolex of cysticercus.

We report a case of RH that developed in a patient on anticoagulant therapy following endovascular coiling of a ruptured anterior communicating artery (AcoA) aneurysm. An 82-year-old man presented with a 12-day history of headache. Computed tomography (CT) on admission demonstrated slight subarachnoid hemorrhage, and left carotid angiography revealed an AcoA aneurysm. The next day, the aneurysm was occluded with coils via the femoral approach under general anesthesia. The patient received a bolus of 5,000 units of heparin immediately following the procedure, and an infusion rate of 10,000 units\/day was initiated. The patient gradually became hypotensive 25 hours after coiling. Abdominal CT showed a huge, high-density soft-tissue mass filling the right side of the retroperitoneum space. The patient eventually died of multiple organ failure five days after coiling. RH after interventional radiology for neurological disease is relatively rare and can be difficult to diagnose if consciousness is disturbed. This case demonstrates the importance of performing routine physical examinations, sequentially measuring the hematocrit and closely monitoring systemic blood pressures following interventional radiologic procedures in patients with abnormal mental status.","1726":"We experienced a rare case of solitary syphilitic osteomyelitis of the skull without any other clinical signs or symptoms of syphilis. A 20-year-old man was referred due to intermittent headache and mild tenderness at the right parietal area of the skull with a palpable coin-sized lesion of softened cortical bone. On radiological studies, the lesion was a radiolucent well enhanced mass (17 mm in diameter). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (52 mm\/h) and C-reactive protein (2.24 mg\/dL) were elevated on admission. Serum venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA) tests were positive. There were no clinical signs or symptoms of syphilis. After treatment with benzathine penicillin, we removed the lesion and performed cranioplasty. The pathologic finding of the skull lesion was fibrous proliferation with lymphoplasmocytic infiltration forming an osteolytic lesion. In addition, a spirochete was identified using the Warthin-starry stain. The polymerase chain reaction study showed a positive band for Treponema pallidum. Solitary osteomyelitis of the skull can be the initial presenting pathological lesion of syphilis.","1727":"The falcine sinus is an abnormal anatomic structure located in the falx cerebri that is closed after birth and is rarely observed. We describe two cases of persistent falcine sinus. A 60-year-old woman presented with headache. An 11-year-old girl presented with intermittent headache and a palpable scalp mass in the middle of the high parietal area. The straight sinuses were absent in both patients. In both patients, drainage of the galenic system took place through a sinus within the falx, also known as a falcine sinus. Suspicious dysplastic tentorium cerebelli was observed in one patient. It can be concluded that a mesenchymal disorder can be the primary cause for a persistent falcine sinus.","1728":"We present a case of hydrocephalus as the primary manifestation of neurosarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a rare disease in Korea and its incidence is much lower than that of tuberculosis. Diagnosis is made by pathologic findings and by exclusion of other granulomatous disorders. Neurosarcoidosis is observed in approximately 5% of sarcoidosis. Its common manifestations are facial palsy (50% of patients with neurosarcoidosis) and optic neuritis. Hydrocephalus is a very uncommon reported finding. Although the typical presentation of sarcoidosis such as facial palsy is not a diagnostic dilemma, more atypical presentations such as hydrocephalus with altered mentality in a tuberculosis patient can lead to a misdiagnosis.","1729":"Streptococcus pyogenes is a beta-hemolytic bacterium that belongs to Lancefield serogroup A, also known as group A streptococci (GAS). There have been five reported case in terms of PubMed-based search but no reported case of brain abscess caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as a result of penetrating skull injury. We present a patient who suffered from penetrating skull injury that resulted in a brain abscess caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. The patient was a 12-year-old boy who fell down from his bicycle while cycling and ran into a tree. A wooden stick penetrated his skin below the right lower eyelid and advanced to the cranium. He lost consciousness on the fifth day of the incident and his body temperature was measured as 40. While being admitted to our hospital, a cranial computed tomography revealed a frontal cystic mass with a perilesional hypodense zone of edema. There was no capsule formation around the lesion after intravenous contrast injection. Paranasal CT showed a bone defect located between the ethmoidal sinus and lamina cribrosa. Bifrontal craniotomy was performed. The abscess located at the left frontal lobe was drained and the bone defect was repaired. Any penetrating lesion showing a connection between the lamina cribrosa and ethmoidal sinus may result in brain abscess caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. These patients should be treated urgently to repair the defect and drain the abscess with appropriate antibiotic therapy started due to the fulminant course of the brain abscess caused by this microorganism. ","1730":"Bilateral pedicle stress fracture is a rare entity and few cases have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, the majority of these reports concern previous spine surgery or stress-related activities. Here, the authors report ankylosing spondylitis as a new cause of bilateral pedicle stress fractures accompanying spondylolysis. The reported case adds to the literature on bilateral pedicle stress fracture and spondylolysis by documenting that ankylosing spondylitis is another cause of this condition.","1731":"The management of lower cervical fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) differs from normal cervical fractures. Patients with AS are highly susceptible to extensive neurologic injuries and spinal deformities after cervical fractures from even minor traumatic forces. These injuries are uniquely complex, require careful imaging assessment, and aggressive surgical management to optimize spinal stability and functional outcomes.","1732":"Since the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for central nervous system neoplasms was declared in 2000, chordoid glioma of the third ventricle has been noted as a newly recognized tumor for central nervous system neoplasms. Although there is not enough universal experience to know the nature of this tumor due to its rarity, the origin of chordoid glioma was guardedly proposed to be the ependymal cells of the third ventricle. Such an idea has been primarily based on the specific location of the tumor, that is, third ventricle, suprasellae, and hypothalamus. However, we report a rare case of histologically confirmed chordoid glioma located in the left thalamus, not attached to any of the midline structures having unusual neuroradiological characteristics.","1733":"Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system in humans, caused by infection of the larval stage of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. However, cerebellar involvement is rarely reported. We report of a case of racemose cysticercosis in the cerebellar hemisphere. A 44-year-old man presented with headache and dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hydrocephalus and an ill-defined, multicystic cerebellar mass with hypersignal on T2-weighted images, hyposignal on T1-weighted images and rim enhancement after gadolinium injection. The patient underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy and the cyst resection was done through a craniotomy. In surgical field, cysts were conglomerated in a dense collagen capsule that were severely adherent to surrounding cerebellar tissue, and transparent cysts contained white, milky fluid. Histological findings confirmed the diagnosis of cysticercosis. He received antiparasitic therapy with praziquantel after surgery. Racemose cysticercosis is rare in the cerebellar hemisphere but neurocysticercosis should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis of multiple cystic lesions in the cerebellum.","1734":"The purpose of this study was to review the safety and durability of aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms with small parent vessels (&lt; 2.0 mm). Retrospective review of all ruptured aneurysm treated with stent assisted endovascular coiling between March 2005 and March 2009 at our institution was conducted. We report 11 cases of the Neuroform stent placement into cerebral vessels measuring less than 2.0 mm in diameter (range, 1.3-1.9 mm) in anterior cerebral artery. Clinical follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months and imaging follow-up was performed with cerebral angiography at 6 months and 12 months after discharge. Complete occlusion was achieved in 10 patients, and a remnant neck was evident in one. No stent displacement or no dislodgement occurred during stent placement. There was no evidence of thromboembolic complication, arterial dissection and spasm during procedure. We performed follow-up angiography in all patients at 6 months and\/or 12 months from the first procedure. The follow-up angiographic data showed successfully results except one in-stent stenosis case. All patients improved clinical performances except one patient with severe vasospasm who showed poor clinical condition initially. We have safely and successfully treated 11 vessels smaller than 2.0 mm in diameter with self-expanding stents with good short and intermediate term results. More clinical data with longer follow-ups are needed to establish the role of stent-assisted coiling in ruptured aneurysms with small parent vessels. ","1735":"In cervico-thoracic junction (CTJ), the use of strong fixation device such as pedicle screw-rod system is often required. Purpose of this study is to analyze the anatomical features of C7 and T1 pedicles related to screw insertion and to evaluate the safety of pedicle screw insertion at these levels. Nineteen patients underwent posterior CTJ fixation with C7 and\/or T1 included in fixation levels. Seventeen patients had tumorous conditions and two with post-laminectomy kyphosis. The anatomical features were analyzed for C7 and T1 pedicles in 19 patients using computerized tomography (CT). Pedicle screw and rod fixation system was used in 16 patients. Pedicle violation by screws was evaluated with postoperative CT scan. The mean values of the width, height, stable depth, safety angle, transverse angle, and sagittal angle of C7 pedicles were 6.9 +\/- 1.34 mm, 8.23 +\/- 1.18 mm, 30.93 +\/- 4.65 mm, 26.42 +\/- 7.91 degrees, 25.9 +\/- 4.83 degrees, and 10.6 +\/- 3.39 degrees. At T1 pedicles, anatomic parameters were similar to those of C7. The pedicle violation revealed that 64.1% showed grade I violation and 35.9% showed grade II violation, overall. As for C7 pedicle screw insertion, grade I was 61.5% and grade II 38.5%. At T1 level, grade I was 65.0% and grade II 35.0%. There was no significant difference in violation rate between the whole group, C7, and T1 group. C7 pedicles can withstand pedicle screw insertion. C7 pedicle and T1 pedicle are anatomically very similar. With the use of adequate fluoroscopic oblique view, pedicle screw can be safely inserted at C7 and T1 levels. ","1736":"Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) consists of the occipital bone that surrounds the foramen magnum, the atlas and the axis vertebrae. The mortality and morbidity is high for irreducible CVJ lesion with cervico-medullary compression. In a clinical retrospective study, the authors reviewed clinical and radiographic results of occipitocervical fusion using a various methods in 32 patients with CVJ instability. Thirty-two CVJ lesions (18 male and 14 female) were treated in our department for 12 years. Instability resulted from trauma (14 cases), rheumatoid arthritis (8 cases), assimilation of atlas (4 cases), tumor (2 cases), basilar invagination (2 cases) and miscellaneous (2 cases). Thirty-two patients were internally fixed with 7 anterior and posterior decompression with occipitocervical fusion, 15 posterior decompression and occipitocervical fusion with wire-rod, 5 C1-2 transarticular screw fixation, and 5 C1 lateral mass-C2 transpedicular screw. Outcome (mean follow-up period, 38 months) was based on clinical and radiographic review. The clinical outcome was assessed by Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score. Nine neurologically intact patients remained same after surgery. Among 23 patients with cervical myelopathy, clinical improvement was noted in 18 cases (78.3%). One patient died 2 months after the surgery because of pneumonia and sepsis. Fusion was achieved in 27 patients (93%) at last follow-up. No patient developed evidence of new, recurrent, or progressive instability. The authors conclude that early occipitocervical fusion to be recommended in case of reducible CVJ lesion and the appropriate decompression and occipitocervical fusion are recommended in case of irreducible craniovertebral junction lesion. ","1737":"With improved technology, the values of intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) have been reevaluated. We describe our early clinical experience with a mobile CT (mCT) system for iCT and discuss its clinical applications, advantages and limitations. Compared with intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging, this mCT system has no need for major reconstruction of a preexisting operating room for shielding, or for specialized instruments or equipment. Patients are placed on a radiolucent head clamp that fits within the gantry. Because it consists simply of a scanner and a workstation, it can be moved between locations such as an operating room, an intensive care unit (ICU) or an emergency room without difficulty. Furthermore, it can achieve nearly all types of CT scanning procedures such as enhancement, temporal bone imaging, angiography and three-dimensional reconstruction. For intracranial surgery, mCT can be used for intraoperative real-time neuronavigation by interacting with preoperative images. It can also be used for intraoperative confirmation of the extent of resection of intracranial lesions and for immediate checks for preventing intraoperative unexpected accidents. Therefore, the goals of maximal resection or optimal treatment can be achieved without any guesswork. Furthermore, mCT can achieve improved patient care with safety and faster diagnosis for patients in an ICU who might be subjected to a ventilator and\/or various monitoring devices. Our initial experience demonstrates that mCT with high-quality imaging offers very useful information in various clinical situations. ","1738":"We determined whether the expression of GRIM-19 is correlated with pathologic types and malignant grades in gliomas, and determined the function of GRIM-19 in human gliomas. Tumor tissues were isolated and frozen at -80 just after surgery. The tissues consisted of normal brain tissue (4), astrocytomas (2), anaplastic astrocytomas (2), oligodendrogliomas (13), anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (11), and glioblastomas (16). To profile tumor-related genes, we applied RNA differential display using a Genefishing DEG kit, and validated the tumor-related genes by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A human glioblastoma cell line (U343MG-A) was used for the GRIM-19 functional studies. The morphologic and cytoskeletal changes were examined via light and confocal microscopy. The migratory and invasive abilities were investigated by the simple scratch technique and Matrigel assay. The antiproliferative activity was determined by thiazolyl blue Tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and FACS analysis. Based on RT-PCR analysis, the expression of GRIM-19 was higher in astrocytic tumors than oligodendroglial tumors. The expression of GRIM-19 was higher in high-grade tumors than low-grade tumors or normal brain tissue; glioblastomas showed the highest expression. After transfection of GRIM-19 into U343MG-A, the morphology of the sense-transfection cells became larger and more spindly. The antisense-transfection cells became smaller and rounder compared with wild type U343MG-A. The MTT assay showed that the sense-transfection cells were more sensitive to the combination of interferon-beta and retinoic acid than U343MG-A cells or antisense-transfection cells; the anti-proliferative activity was related to apoptosis. GRIM-19 may be one of the gene profiles which regulate cell death via apoptosis in human gliomas. ","1739":"Allelic losses or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at many chromosomal loci have been found in the cells of meningiomas. The objective of this study was to evaluate LOH at several loci of different chromosomes (1p32, 17p13, 7q21, 7q31, and 22q13) in different grades of meningiomas. Forty surgical specimens were obtained and classified as benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas. After DNA extraction, ten polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to detect LOH. Medical and surgical records, as well as pathologic findings, were reviewed retrospectively. LOH at 1p32 was detected in 24%, 60%, and 60% in benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas, respectively. Whereas LOH at 7q21 was found in only one atypical meningioma. LOH at 7q31 was found in one benign meningioma and one atypical meningioma. LOH at 17p13 was detected in 4%, 40%, and 80% in benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas, respectively. LOH at 22q13 was seen in 48%, 60%, and 60% in benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas, respectively. LOH results at 1p32 and 17p13 showed statistically significant differences between benign and non-benign meningiomas. LOH at 1p32 and 17p13 showed a strong correlation with tumor progression. On the other hand, LOH at 7q21 and 7q31 may not contribute to the development of the meningiomas. ","1740":"The etiology and pathogenesis of moyamoya disease remain unclear. Furthermore, the definitive diagnostic protein-biomarkers for moyamoya disease are still unknown. The present study analyzed serum proteomes from normal controls and moyamoya patients to identify novel serological biomarkers for diagnosing moyamoya disease. We compared the two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns of sera from moyamoya disease patients and normal controls and identified the differentially-expressed spots by matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-time-of flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found and analyzed 22 differently-expressed proteomes. Two proteins were up-regulated. Twenty proteins were down-regulated. Complement C1 inhibitor protein and apolipoprotein C-III showed predominantly changed expressions (complement C1 inhibitor protein averaged a 7.23-fold expression in moyamoya patients as compared to controls, while apolipoprotein C-III averaged a 0.066-fold expression). Although our study had a small sample size, our proteomic data provide serologic clue proteins for understanding moyamoya disease. ","1741":"Notochordal cells in the intervertebral disc interact with nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and support the maintenance of disc homeostasis by regulation of matrix production. However, the influence of notochordal cells has not been evaluated in the annulus fibrosus (AF), which is the primary pain generator in the disc. We hypothesized that the notochordal cell has the capacity to modulate inflammatory mediators secreted by AF cells secondary to stimulation. Notochordal and AF cells were isolated from adult New Zealand white rabbits. AF pellets were cultured with notochordal cell clusters or in notochordal cell-conditioned media (NCCM) for 24 or 48 hours with proinflammatory cytokines at varying concentrations. Gene expression in AF pellets were assayed for nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2, and interleukin (IL)-6 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AF pellet in NCCM significantly decreased the iNOS and COX-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels compared to AF pellets alone and AF pellets with notochordal cells (p &lt; 0.05). AF pellet resulted in dose-dependent iNOS and COX-2 expression in response to IL-1beta, stimulation, demonstrating that 1 ng\/ml for 24 hours yielded a maximal response. AF pellet in NCCM significantly decreased the expression of iNOS and COX-2 in response to 1ng\/ml IL-1beta, stimulation at 24 hours (p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in IL-6 expression compared to AF pellets alone or AF pellets with notochordal cell clusters. We conclude that soluble factors from notochordal cells mitigate the gene expression of inflammatory mediators in stimulated AF, as expected after annular injury, suggesting that notochordal cells could serve as a novel therapeutic approach in symptomatic disc development.

One month after surgery, the patient complained of tinnitus, and progressive extradural pneumatoceles without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was observed. Revision surgery was performed and the opened mastoid air cell was completely sealed with muscle patch and glue. The patient's symptoms were resolved, with no recurrence of pneumatoceles at 6 month follow up. Progressive extradural pneumatocele without CSF leakage after posterior fossa surgery is a very rare complication.

We report two cases of intractable pain associated with cauda equina syndrome (CES) that were treated successfully by SNS. The first patient suffered from intractable pelvic pain with urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence after surgery for a herniated lumbar disc. The second patient underwent surgery for treatment of a burst fracture and developed intractable pelvic area pain, right leg pain, excessive urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, voiding difficulty and constipation one year after surgery. A SNS trial was performed on both patients. Both patients' pain was significantly improved and urinary symptoms were much relieved. Neuromodulation of the sacral nerves is an effective treatment for idiopathic urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence. Sacral neuromodulation has also been used to control various forms of pelvic pain. Although the mechanism of action of neuromodulation remains unexplained, numerous clinical success reports suggest that it is a therapy with efficacy and durability. From the results of our research, we believe that SNS can be a safe and effective option for the treatment of intractable pelvic pain with incomplete CES.","1745":"Subdural empyema of the brain is an uncommon disorder that occurs more frequently in children than in adult. Authors report a very rare of subdural empyema following the subdural hygroma after mild head injury. The exact mechanism of infection is not known.

There has been no report on traumatic cervical spinal subdrual hematoma not related to intracranial injury. A 27-year-old female patient was admitted to our emergency room due to severe neck pain and right arm motor weakness after car collision. On admission, she presented with complete monoplegia and hypoesthesia of right arm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed subdural hematoma compressing spinal cord. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 210,000 red blood cells\/mm(3). She was managed conservatively by administrations of steroid pulse therapy and CSF drainage. Her muscle power of right arm improved to a Grade III 16 days after admission. Follow-up MRI taken 16th days after admission revealed almost complete resolution of the hematoma.

Emergency evacuation of the EDH was performed, and the hemorrhage was determined to be secondary to skull base metastasis of HCC.","1749":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), a disorder of the phagocytic system, is a rare condition. Moreover, spinal involvement causing myelopathy is even rare and unusual. Here, we report a case of atypical LCH causing myelopathy, which was subsequently treated by corpectemy and fusion. A 5-year-old boy presented with 3 weeks of severe neck pain and limited neck movement accompanying right arm motor weakness. CT scans revealed destruction of C7 body and magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumoral process at C7 with cord compression. Interbody fusion using cervical mesh packed by autologus iliac bone was performed. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of LCH. After the surgery, the boy recovered from radiating pain and motor weakness of right arm. Despite the rarity of the LCH in the cervical spine, it is necessary to maintain our awareness of this condition. When neurologic deficits are present, operative treatment should be considered.","1750":"Pure ventral midline giant schwannoma is an extremely rare entity. Spinal intradural extramedullary schwannomas commonly occur posterolateral or anterolateral to the spinal cord. A case of a pure midline ventrally situated giant pan cervical extramedullary schwannoma in an 18-year-old male patient with compressive myelopathy and sphincter involvement is presented. Spinal MR imaging showed a midline ventrally situated extramedullary tumor with severe spinal cord compression extending from clivus to C7 vertebra. It was resected through a posterolateral approach.

The created intact model was validated by comparing the flexion-extension response without pre-load with the corresponding results obtained from the published experimental studies. The validated intact lumbar model was tested after implantation of three artificial discs at L4-5. Each implanted model was subjected to a combination of 400 N follower load and 5 Nm of flexion\/extension moments. ABAQUS version 6.5 (ABAQUS Inc., Providence, RI, USA) and FEMAP version 8.20 (Electronic Data Systems Corp., Plano, TX, USA) were used for meshing and analysis of geometry of the intact and implanted models. Under the flexion load, the intersegmental rotation angles of all the implanted models were similar to that of the intact model, but under the extension load, the values were greater than that of the intact model. The facet contact loads of three implanted models were greater than the loads observed with the intact model. Under the flexion load, three types of the implanted model at the L4-5 level showed the intersegmental rotation angle similar to the one measured with the intact model. Under the extension load, all of the artificial disc implanted models demonstrated an increased extension rotational angle at the operated level (L4-5), resulting in an increase under the facet contact load when compared with the adjacent segments. The increased facet load may lead to facet degeneration. ","1752":"The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of microvascular decompression (MVD) for hemifacial spasm (HFS) in elderly patients. Between 1997 and June 2008, 1,174 patients had undergone MVD for HFS at our institute. Among these, 53 patients were older than 65 years. We retrospectively reviewed and compared the complication and the cure rates of these patients with those of younger patients. There were 38 females and 15 males. The mean duration of symptoms of HFS of these patients was 94.6 months (range, 12-360 months), compared with 67.2 months (range, 3-360 months) in the younger group. The overall cure rate in elderly patients who underwent MVD for HFS during this period was 96.2%. Permanent cranial nerve dysfunctions, such as hearing loss and facial palsy, were seen in 2 patients (3.8%, 2\/53) in the elderly group and 19 patients (1.7%, 19\/1121) in the younger group. The difference in permanent cranial nerve dysfunction between the two groups was not statistically significant. There was no operative mortality in either group. Microvascular decompression is the most effective surgical modality available for the treatment of HFS. Results of this study indicate that such technique can be performed in the elderly without higher rates of morbidity or mortality. Any patient with HFS, whose general health is acceptable for undergoing general anesthesia, should be considered as a candidate for MVD. ","1753":"The precise intra- vs. extradural localization of aneurysms involving the paraclinoid internal carotid artery is critical for the evaluation of patients being considered for aneurysm surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of T2-weighted three-dimensional (3-D) fast spin-echo (FSE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of unruptured paraclinoid aneurysms. Twenty-eight patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms in their paraclinoid regions were prospectively evaluated using a T2-weighted 3-D FSE MR imaging technique with oblique coronal sections. The MR images were assessed for the location of the cerebral aneurysm in relation to the dural ring and other surrounding anatomic compartments, and were also compared with the surgical or angiographic findings. All 28 aneurysms were identified by T2-weighted 3D FSE MR imaging, which showed the precise anatomic relationships in regards to the subarachnoid space and the surrounding anatomic structures. Consequently, 13 aneurysms were determined to be intradural and the other 15 were deemed extradural as they were confined to the cavernous sinus. Of the 13 aneurysms with intradural locations, three superior hypophyseal artery aneurysms were found to be situated intradurally upon operation. High-resolution T2-weighted 3-D FSE MR imaging is capable of confirming whether a cerebral aneurysm at the paraclinoid region is intradural or extradural, because of the MR imaging's high spatial resolution. The images may help in identifying patients with intradural aneurysms who require treatment, and they also can provide valuable information in the treatment plan for paraclinoid aneurysms. ","1754":"Arachnoid cysts (ACs) can be cured by making the definite and wide communication between the cyst and arachnoid space using endoscopy, but often it is impossible only through the usual working-channel (intra-channel) procedures. We discuss and propose a more valuable endoscopic technique with the presentation of our series of cases. We treated 9 patients with cortical AC in various locations with extra-channel endoscopic techniques. The patients ranged in age from 3 years to 60 years (mean age, 37.2 yrs). The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 26 months (mean follow-up duration, 17.2 months). All patients had large AC compressing the adjacent brain with clinical symptoms or signs. The authors performed extensive fenestration via single burr hole with the aid of endoscope. Being bypassed the rigid endoscope, through the space between the shaft of endoscope and guiding cannula (extra-channel method), fenestration procedures were done in the dry fields. Eight (88.9%) patients had been treated successfully with endoscope. One patient required shunt procedure. Among the eight patients who were treated with endoscopic procedure, 6 patients (66.7%) showed cyst reduction, and two (22.2%) showed disappearance of cyst. We suggest that extra-channel method will be simple and easy to perform using more valuable instruments with wider working area, and may promise better results compared to the conventional intra-channel endoscopic procedures. ","1755":"An effective intervention has not yet been established for patients with acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The aim of our study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of emergent stent placement of carotid artery to improve neurologic symptoms and clinical outcome. Of 84 consecutive patients with severe ICA stenosis who were admitted to our institution from March 2006 to May 2009, 10 patients with acute ICA occlusion (11.9%) underwent emergency carotid artery stent placement. We reviewed their records for neurologic outcome using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, before and at 7 days after stent placement; clinical outcome using the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS); frequency of procedure-related complications; and recurrence rate of ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 90 days. Carotid lesions were dilated completely in all patients. Median NIHSS scores before emergency stent placement and at 7 days were 16.6 and 6, respectively, showing significant improvement. Eight patients (80%) had favorable outcomes (mRS score 0-2 and GOS 4-5). Complications occurred in two patients (20%): stent insertion failed in one and an intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in the other. Ipsilateral ischemic stroke did not recur within 3 months. Emergency carotid artery stent placement can improve the 7-day neurologic outcome and the 90-day clinical outcome in selected patients with acute cerebral infarction. ","1756":"Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) are more common on the left hemisphere than on the right. We verified this left predilection of CSDH and tried to explain the reason for this discrepancy. We investigated the laterality of CSDH in 182 patients who were treated from January 2005 to December 2009. We examined the symmetry of the cranium and the location of the lesion. CSDH was more common on the left-side. The cranium was symmetric in 63 patients, asymmetric in 119 patients. The asymmetric crania were flat on the right-side in 77 patients, on the left-side in 42 patients. The density of the CSDHs was hypodense in 29 patients, isodense 132 patients, and the others in 21 patients. Bilateral hematomas were more common in the hypodense group. In the right flat crania, the hematoma was more commonly located on the opposite side of the flat side. While in the left flat crania, the hematoma was more common on the same side. CSDHs occurred more frequently on the left side. The anatomical asymmetry of the cranium influences the left predilection of CSDH. ","1757":"Peripheral nerve injury often leads to neuropathic pain, which is characterized by burning pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in neuropathic pain is a complex and controversial issue. It is generally accepted that the alpha adrenoreceptor (AR) in sympathetic nerve system plays a significant role in the maintenance of pain. Among alpha adrenoreceptor, alpha-1 receptors play a major role in the sympathetic mediated pain. The primary goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that sympathetically maintained pain involves peripheral alpha-2 receptors in human. The study was a randomized, prospective, double-blinded, crossover study involving twenty patients. The treatments were : Yohimbine (30 mg mixed in 500 mL normal saline), and Phentolamine (1 mg\/kg in 500 mL normal saline) in 500 mL normal saline at 70 mL\/hr initially then titrated. The patients underwent infusions on three different appointments, at least one month apart. Thus, all patients received all 2 treatments. Pain measurement was by visual analogue scale, neuropathic pain questionnaire, and McGill pain questionnaire. There were significant decreases in the visual analogue scale, neuropathic score, McGill pain score of yohimnine, and phentolamine. We conclude that alpha-2 adrenoreceptor, along with alpha-2 adrenoreceptor, may be play role in sympathetically maintained pain in human. ","1758":"It is usually difficult to perform the neuroendoscopic procedure in patients without hydrocephalus due to difficulties with ventricular cannulation. The purpose of this study was to find out the value of navigation guided neuroendoscopic biopsy in patients with peri- or intraventricular tumors without hydrocephalus. Six patients with brain tumors without hydrocephalus underwent navigation-guided neuroendoscopic biopsy. The procedure was indicated for verification of the histological diagnosis of the neoplasm, which was planned to be treated by chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy as the first line treatment, or establishment of the pathological diagnosis for further choice of the most appropriate treatment strategy. Under the guidance of navigation, targeted lesion was successfully approached in all patients. Navigational tracking was especially helpful in entering small ventricles and in approaching the third ventricle through narrow foramen Monro. The histopathologic diagnosis was established in all of 6 patients : 2 germinomas, 2 astrocytomas, 1 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor and 1 pineocytoma. The tumor biopsy sites were pineal gland (n = 2), suprasellar area (n = 2), subcallosal area (n = 1) and thalamus (n = 1). There were no operative complications related to the endoscopic procedure. Endoscopic biopsy or resection of peri- or intraventricular tumors in patients without hydrocephalus is feasible. Image-guided neuroendoscopic procedure improved the accuracy of the endoscopic approach and minimized brain trauma. The absence of ventriculomegaly in patients with brain tumor may not be served as a contraindication to endoscopic tumor biopsy. ","1759":"Middle cerebral artery (MCA) fusiform aneurysms often have an unfavorable geometry that may limit surgical or endovascular treatment. Herein, we present a case of a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal MCA, which was successfully treated using stent-assisted coil embolization. A 42-year-old man presented with repeated headache and syncope. Five years earlier, a right MCA aneurysm had been treated by aneurismal wrapping. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) revealed a partially-thrombosed proximal MCA aneurysm at the right perisylvian region. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a multilobulated fusiform-shaped aneurysm. The patient underwent stent-assisted coil embolization under general anesthesia and symptoms resolved postoperatively. A three-month follow-up angiography revealed no recanalization of the aneurysm and indicated tolerable blood flow through the right MCA, as compared to the preoperative angiography. We suggest that in selected patients, stent-assisted coil embolization of proximal MCA fusiform aneurysms can be an effective treatment modality.","1760":"A rare case of solitary intraspinal epidural lymphangioma is described with a review of the literature. A 16-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with a history of two-year of progressive paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging study revealed a 2 x 2 x 6 cm sized epidural cystic mass in the thoracic spine. Surgical total removal and biopsy were performed. The final pathologic report on the mass indicated lymphangioma.","1761":"Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem and it mainly affects postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis associated with pregnancy or lactation is a rare condition. The incidence and mechanism of this phenomenon has not been clarified, but it can cause one or more vertebral compression fractures with severe, prolonged back pain in the affected women. We experienced this uncommon case, treated it with percutaneous vertebroplasty. A 35-old-woman visited our hospital with complaints of severe back pain and flank pain 2 months after normal vaginal delivery. She was diagnosed with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures on the T5, 8, 9 and 11 vertebral bodies and we performed percutaneous vertebroplasty on the T8, 9 and 11 vertebrae with a good result. We present here an unusual case of pregnancy-associated compression fractures treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty.","1762":"The majority of cases of pneumocephalus are secondary to trauma or medical intervention. Spontaneous, non-traumatic pneumocephalus is an uncommon condition. Most cases of spontaneous pneumocephalus require surgery. However, if there is no evidence of infection or cerebrospinal fluid leak, bed rest and follow-up imaging is an alternative treatment. Herein, we report a 31-year-old man with spontaneous pneumocephalus associated with pneumosinus dilatans.","1763":"Trochlear nerve palsy associated with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is known to be a rare malady. We report here on a patient who suffered with left trochlear nerve palsy following rupture of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm. A 56-year-woman visited our emergency department with stuporous mental change. Her Hunt-and-Hess grade was 3 and the Fisher grade was 4. Cerebral angiography revealed a ruptured aneurysm of the right posterior communicating artery. The aneurysm was clipped via a right pterional approach on the day of admission. The patient complained of diplopia when she gazed to the left side, and the ophthalmologist found limited left inferolateral side gazing due to left superior oblique muscle palsy on day 3. Elevated intracranial pressure, intraventricular hemorrhage or a dense clot in the basal cisterns might have caused this trochlear nerve palsy.","1764":"Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare hematologic disorder with sustained eosinophilia. Peripheral blood eosinophilia without an underlying etiology and with organs dysfunction has been designated hypereosinophilic syndrome. We report a rare case of symptomatic spinal infiltration of eosinophils at osteolytic T5 in patient with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.","1765":"Intracranial granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors, which are composed of immature granulocytic cells. Although it has been well known that these tumors are associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), they have been almost always related to bone marrow relapse. However, isolated recurrence of granulocytic sarcoma following complete remission from prior AML is extremely rare, especially in the central nervous system. A 44-year-old male presented with isolated recurrence of granulocytic sarcoma mimicking a falx meningioma two years after complete remission by allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transfusion (PBSCT) in the acute myelomonoblastic leukemia (FAB, M4). Because of depressed mental state and mass effect, total surgical resection was performed. Pathological findings were compatible with the granulocytic sarcoma. There was no evidence of leukemic relapse in the peripheral blood. We suggest that this phenomenon can be explained by the hypothesis that a certain barrier effect such as blood brain barrier might lead to the proliferation of intracranial leukemic cells which metastasized before PBSCT.","1766":"Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) causing acute myelopathy is rare. The usual clinical presentation of a SEH is sudden severe neck or back pain that progresses toward paraparesis or quadriparesis, depending on the level of the lesion. Recent studies have shown that early decompressive surgery is very important for patient's recovery. We experienced five patients of cervico-thoracic epidural hematomas associated with neurologic deficits that were treated successfully with surgical intervention.","1767":"The abducens nerve usually travels from the brainstem to the lateral rectus muscle as a single trunk. However, it has been reported that this nerve could split into branches occasionally. We attempted to show the aberrant course of abducens nerve in a specimen with unilateral duplicated abducens nerve and review relevant literatures. The micro-dissections were performed in a head specimen injected with colored latex under the microscope. The abducens nerve was duplicated unilaterally. This nerve emerged from the pontomedullary sulcus as a single trunk and splitted into two branches in the prepontine cistern. These two separate branches were piercing the cerebral dura of the petroclival region respectively. The slender lower branch passed between the petroclinoid and petrosphenoid ligaments and the thick lower one passed under the petrosphenoid ligament. These two branches united just lateral to the ascending segment of internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus. The fact that there are several types of aberrant abducens nerve is helpful to perform numerous neurosurgical procedures in the petroclival region and cavernous sinus without inadvertent neurovascular injuries.","1768":"Although unilateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is widely used because of its benefits, it does have some technical limitations. Removal of disk material and endplate cartilage is difficult, but essential, for proper fusion in unilateral surgery, leading to debate regarding the surgery's limitations in removing the disk material on the contralateral side. Therefore, authors have conducted a randomized, comparative cadaver study in order to evaluate the efficiency of the surgery when using conventional instruments in the preparation of the disk space and when using the recently developed high-pressure water jet system, SpineJet XL. Two spine surgeons performed diskectomies and disk preparations for TLIF in 20 lumbar disks. All cadaver\/surgeon\/level allocations for preparation using the SpineJet XL (HydroCision Inc., Boston, MA, USA) or conventional tools were randomized. All assessments were performed by an independent spine surgeon who was unaware of the randomizations. The authors measured the areas (cm(2)) and calculated the proportion (%) of the disk surfaces. The duration of the disk preparation and number of instrument insertions and withdrawals required to complete the disk preparation were recorded for all procedures. The proportion of the area of removed disk tissue versus that of potentially removable disk tissue, the proportion of the area of removed endplate cartilage, and the area of removed disk tissue in the contralateral posterior portion showed 74.5 +\/- 17.2%, 18.5 +\/- 12.03%, and 67.55 +\/- 16.10%, respectively, when the SpineJet XL was used, and 52.6 +\/- 16.9%, 22.8 +\/- 17.84%, and 51.64 +\/- 19.63%, respectively, when conventional instrumentations were used. The results also showed that when the SpineJet XL was used, the proportion of the area of removed disk tissue versus that of potentially removable disk tissue and the area of removed disk tissue in the contralateral posterior portion were statistically significantly high (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Also, compared to conventional instrumentations, the duration required to complete disk space preparation was shorter, and the frequency of instrument use and the numbers of insertions\/withdrawals were lower when the SpineJet XL was used. The present study demonstrates that hydrosurgery using the SpineJet XL unit allows for the preparation of a greater portion of disk space and that it is less traumatic and allows for more precise endplate preparation without damage to the bony endplate. Furthermore, the SpineJet XL appears to provide tangible benefits in terms of disk space preparation for graft placement, particularly when using the unilateral TLIF approach. ","1769":"There has been inconsistency about definition of the temporal stem despite of several descriptions demonstrating its microanatomy using fiber dissection and\/or diffusion tensor tractography. This study was designed to clarify three dimensional configurations of the temporal stem. The fronto-temporal regions of several formalin-fixed human cerebral hemispheres were dissected under an operating microscope using the fiber dissection technique. The consecutive coronal cuts of the dissected specimens were made to define the relationships of white matter tracts comprising the temporal stem and the subcortical gray matters (thalamus, caudate nucleus, amygdala) with inferior limiting (circular) sulcus of insula. The inferior limiting sulcus of insula, limen insulae, medial sylvian groove, and caudate nucleus\/amygdala were more appropriate anatomical structures than the roof\/dorso-lateral wall of the temporal horn and lateral geniculate body which were used to describe previously for delineating the temporal stem. The particular space located inside the line connecting the inferior limiting sulcus of insula, limen insulae, medial sylvian groove\/amygdala, and tail of caudate nucleus could be documented. This space included the extreme capsule, uncinate fasciculus, inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus, anterior commissure, ansa peduncularis, and inferior thalamic peduncle including optic radiations, whereas the stria terminalis, cingulum, fimbria, and inferior longitudinal fiber of the temporal lobe were not passing through this space. Also, this continued posteriorly along the caudate nucleus and limiting sulcus of the insula. The temporal stem is white matter fibers passing through a particular space of the temporal lobe located inside the line connecting the inferior limiting sulcus of insula, limen insulae, medial sylvian groove\/amygdala, and tail of caudate nucleus. The three dimensional configurations of the temporal stem are expected to give the very useful anatomical and surgical insights in the temporal lobe. ","1770":"Morphometric data on dorsal cervical anatomy were examined in an effort to protect the nerve root near the lateral mass during posterior foraminotomy. Using 25 adult formalin-fixed cadaveric cervical spines, measurements were taken at the lateral mass from C3 to C7 via a total laminectomy and a medial one-half facetectomy. The morphometric relationship between the nerve roots and structures of the lateral mass was investigated. Results from both genders were compared. Following the total laminectomy, from C3 to C7, the mean of the vertical distance from the medial point of the facet (MPF) of the lateral mass to the axilla of the root origin was 3.2-4.7 mm. The whole length of the exposed root had a mean of 4.2-5.8 mm. Following a medial one-half facetectomy, from C3 to C7, the mean of the vertical distance to the axilla of the root origin was 2.1-3.4 mm, based on the MPF. Mean vertical distances from the MPF to the medial point of the root that crossed the inferior margin of the intervertebral disc were 1.2-2.7 mm. The mean distance of the exposed root was 8.2-9.0 mm, and the mean angle between the dura and the nerve root was significantly different between males and females, at 53.4-68.4 degrees . These data will aid in reducing root injuries during posterior cervical foraminotomy. ","1771":"This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) using two different stand-alone cages in the treatment of lumbar intervertebral foraminal stenosis (IFS). A total of 28 patients who underwent ALIF at L5-S1 using stand-alone cage were studied [Stabilis(R) (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA); 13, SynFix-LR(R) (Synthes Bettlach, Switzerland); 15]. Mean follow-up period was 27.3 +\/- 4.9 months. Visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were assessed. Radiologically, the change of disc height, intervertebral foraminal (IVF) height and width at the operated segment were measured, and fusion status was defined. Final mean VAS (back and leg) and ODI scores were significantly decreased from preoperative values (5.6 +\/- 2.3 --&gt; 2.3 +\/- 2.2, 6.3 +\/- 3.2 --&gt; 1.6 +\/- 1.6, and 53.7 +\/- 18.6 --&gt; 28.3 +\/- 13.1, respectively), which were not different between the two devices groups. In Stabilis(R) group, postoperative immediately increased disc and IVF heights (10.09 +\/- 4.15 mm --&gt; 14.99 +\/- 1.73 mm, 13.00 +\/- 2.44 mm --&gt; 16.28 +\/- 2.23 mm, respectively) were gradually decreased, and finally returned to preoperative value (11.29 +\/- 1.67 mm, 13.59 +\/- 2.01 mm, respectively). In SynFix-LR(R) group, immediately increased disc and IVF heights (9.60 +\/- 2.82 mm --&gt; 15.61 +\/- 0.62 mm, 14.01 +\/- 2.53 mm --&gt; 21.27 +\/- 1.93 mm, respectively) were maintained until the last follow up (13.72 +\/- 1.21 mm, 17.87 +\/- 2.02 mm, respectively). The changes of IVF width of each group was minimal pre- and postoperatively. Solid arthrodesis was observed in 11 patients in Stabilis group (11\/13, 84.6%) and 13 in SynFix-LR(R) group (13\/15, 86.7%). ALIF using stand-alone cage could assure good clinical results in the treatment of symptomatic lumbar IFS in the mid-term follow up. A degree of subsidence at the operated segment was different depending on the device type, which was higher in Stabilis(R) group. ","1772":"In this study, the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program was applied to patients presenting with depression and anxiety after surgery from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the effects were assessed. The subjects were patients admitted for cerebral aneurysm rupture and treated by means of surgery from March to December, 2007. More than 6 months had passed after surgery, without any special lesions showing up on computed tomography (CT), and the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) was 5 points. Among patients with anxiety and depression symptoms, 11 patients completed the program. The MBSR program was conducted once a week, 2.5 hours each, for 8 weeks. The evaluation criteria were : 1) the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): it measures the type and level of depression, 2) the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory : the anxiety state of normal adults without mental disorder, and 3) Heart Rate Variability (HRV) : the influence of the autonomous nervous system on the sinoarterial node varies continuously in response to the change of the internal\/external environment. The BDI value was decreased from 18.5 +\/- 10.9 to 9.5 +\/- 7.1 (p = 0.013) : it was statistically significant, and the depression level of patients was lowered. The state anxiety was decreased from 51.3 +\/- 13.9 to 42.3 +\/- 15.2; the trait anxiety was reduced from 50.9 +\/- 12.3 to 41.3 +\/- 12.8, and a borderline significant difference was shown (p = 0.091, p = 0.056). In other words, after the treatment, although it was not statistically significant, a decreased tendency in anxiety was shown. In the HRV measurement, standard deviation normal to normal (SDNN), square root of the square root of the mean sum of squared differences between adjacent normal to normal intervals (RMSSD), and total power (TP) showed significant increase, Physical Stress Index (PSI) showed a significant reduction, and thus an improvement in the homeostatic control mechanism of the autonomic nervous system was ween. The MBSR program was applied to the patients showing anxiety and depression reaction after SAH treatment, and a reduction in depression symptoms and physiological reactions were observed. The application of the MBSR program may be considered as a new tool in improving the quality of life for patients after surgery. ","1773":"This study assessed the safety and efficacy of one level unilateral laminotomy bilateral decompression (ULBD) with the placement of a device for intervertebral assisted motion (DIAM) compared with one level ULBD only in elderly patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS). A non randomized prospective analysis was performed on 16 patients who underwent one level ULBD with DIAM (Group A) and 20 patients with one level ULBD only (Group B) between February 2007 and March 2008. Radiographic imaging, visual analog scale (VAS) and MacNab outcome scale were obtained before and after surgery at a mean interval of 21 months (range 17-27 months). The disc height, interpedicular distance, slip distance and segmental lordotic angle were similar between two groups. In the group A, there was no significant difference between the pre- and post-operative imaging in terms of the sagittal balance and disc height. Both groups showed significant improvement in the clinical outcomes. In addition, there was significantly less low-back pain in the group A than in the group B at the last follow up, while the clinical improvement of the leg pain and MacNab outcome scale showed no significant difference in the two groups. There were no major complications or DIAM associated complications. ULBD with DIAM is a safe and efficacious treatment for selective elderly patients with DLSS, particularly for relieving low back pain comparing to ULBD. ULBD with DIAM did not alter the disc height or sagittal alignment at the mean 21 months follow-up interval. ","1774":"Although a transradial angiography is accepted as the gold standard for cardiovascular procedures, cerebral angiography has been performed via transfemoral approach in most institutions. The purpose of this study is to present our experience concerning the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a transradial approach to cerebral angiography as an alternative to a transfemoral approach. Between February 2007 and October 2009, a total of 1,240 cerebral angiographies were performed via a transradial approach in a single center. The right radial approach was used as an initial access route. The procedure continued only after the ulnar artery was proven to provide satisfactory collateral perfusion according to two tests (a modified Allen's test and forearm angiography). The procedural success rate was 94.8% with a mean duration of 28 minutes. All supra-aortic vessels were successfully catheterized with a success rate of 100%. The success rates of selective catheterization to the right vertebral artery, right internal carotid artery, left internal carotid artery, and left vertebral artery were 96.1%, 98.6%, 82.6% and 52.2%, respectively. The procedure was performed more than twice in 73 patients (5.9%), including up to 4 times in 2 patients. The radial artery occlusion was found in 4 patients (5.4%) on follow-up cerebral angiography, but no ischemic symptoms were observed in any of the cases. This study suggests that cerebral angiography using a transradial approach can be performed with minimal risk of morbidity. In particular, this procedure might be useful for follow-up angiographies and place less stress on patients. ","1775":"We retrospectively evaluated the survival outcome of patients with brain metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Between 1991 and 2007, a total of 20 patients were diagnosed as having brain metastasis from HCC. The mean age of the patients was 55 +\/- 13 years, and 17 (85.0%) were men. Seventeen (85.0%) patients had already extracranial metastases. The median time from diagnosis of HCC to brain metastasis was 18.5 months. Fourteen (70.0%) patients had stroke-like presentation due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Ten (50.0%) patients had single or solitary brain metastasis. Among a total of 34 brain lesions, 31 (91.2%) lesions had the hemorrhagic components. The median survival time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 5.08-10.92), and the actuarial survival rates were 85.0%, 45.0%, 22.5%, and 8.4% at 4, 12, 24, and 54 weeks. Age &lt; 60 years, treatment of the primary and\/or extracranial lesions, and recurrent ICH were the possible prognostic factors (p = 0.044, p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0.111, respectively). The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 3 months (95% CI, 0.95-5.05). The overall survival of the patients with brain metastasis from HCC was very poor with median survival time being only 8 weeks. However, the younger patients less than 60 years and\/or no extracranial metastases seem to be a positive prognostic factor. ","1776":"We report a rare case of intracranial hypotension that was complicated by a subdural hematoma following spine surgery. Intraoperatively, we did not notice any breach of the dura. However, the patient continued to have fluid leakage from the inferior edge of the lumbar incision. During revision surgery, a small dural tear was identified and repaired. It is likely that a small dural tear was overlooked or the dura was weakened during the initial operation and caused a subdural hematoma associated with intracranial hypotension.","1777":"Osteochondromas are common, benign tumors in the long bones, but osteochondromas are rare in the vertebrae. Most vertebral osteochondromas arise from the cervical or upper thoracic spine. However, lumbar osteochondromas have rarely been reported. In this report, a rare case of a lumbar osteochondroma arising from the spondylolytic L3 lamina in a 57-year-old woman is presented. She also had a ruptured disc and lumbar canal stenosis at L4-5-S1. The osteochondroma was completely removed and a posterior lumbar interbody fusion and instrumentation were performed. Considering the rarity of osteochondromas in the lumbar vertebrae, especially the L3 vertebra, it is possible that the pre-existing lumbar spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis was one of the factors affecting the occurrence or progression of the osteochondroma.","1778":"A 51-year-old man presented with a pulsatile scalp mass over the right occipital region, which had increased in size over the previous 1 month. He had no previous history of head trauma. Three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) angiography of the brain revealed a 3.0 x 1.5 cm occipital artery aneurysm arising from the occipital artery. The occipital artery aneurysm was removed following the ligation of the proximal and distal portion of the occipital artery aneurysm. The histological diagnosis was true aneurysm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the literature.","1779":"We recently experienced a case of synovial sarcoma in the posterior neck, which involved adjacent bony structures. Synovial sarcoma is rare, malignant soft tissue tumor that occur predominantly in the lower extremities. Wide surgical excision with involved tissue is the treatment of first choice, because most synovial sarcomas reveal aggressive features. We removed the tumor with involved bony structures and patient was given postoperative radiation therapy. Despite these treatment options, the patient died 1 year after surgery. We report this case with a review of the literature.","1780":"Hodgkin's disease presenting with spinal cord compression owing to extradural and bone involvement is extremely unusual. A 48-year-old man presented with progressive lower extremity weakness resulting from spinal cord compression attributable to an epidural mass in the thoracic vertebrae. The patient underwent decompressive surgery, and was then treated with chemotherapy for Langerhans cell histiocytosis. However, the disease progressed, and we performed second decompressive surgery with stabilization. Subsequent histopathological investigations revealed Hodgkin's lymphoma of the bone. Here, we describe an unusual case of spinal Hodgkin's lymphoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis to draw attention to this combination as a possible diagnosis in patients with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate lesions in the spine.","1781":"Degenerated conditions such as herniated disc or spinal stenosis are common etiologies of lumbar radiculopathy. Less common etiologies include spinal extradural cyst such as synovial cysts and ganglion cysts. Ganglion cyst of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) of the spine is a rare entity that can result in classical sciatica. Posterior longitudinal ligament cyst has no continuity with the facet joint and has no epithelial lining. Two young male patients presented with unilateral sciatica and were found to have intraspinal cystic lesions causing lumbar radiculopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated rounded, cystic lesions (i.e., hypointense on T1- but hyperintense on T2-weighted images) adjacent to minimally dehydrated, nonherniated disc spaces in both cases. These patients underwent posterior decompression and cysts were excised, and their sciatic symptoms were completely resolved. Histological examination showed typical features of ganglion cysts in these cases.","1782":"Candida is a relatively rare cause of spinal infections that commonly affects immunocompromised patients. A 70-year-old woman, who underwent a lumbar discectomy on L5-S1 two months earlier, was admitted to our department complaining of persistent back and leg pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed irregular enhancing mass lesion in L5-S1 intervertebral space, suggest of pyogenic discitis with epidural abscess. The surgery was performed via retroperitoneal approach and the infected material at L5-S1 intervertebral space was removed. The histological examination of the specimen revealed chronic inflammation involving the bone and soft tissue, and a culture of the excised material was positive for Candida parapsilosis. The patient received intravenous fluconazole for 4 weeks after surgery and oral fluconazole 400 mg\/day for 3 months after surgery. The patient made a full recovery with no symptoms 6 months after surgery. We present a rare case of spondylodiscitis after a lumbar discectomy due to Candida parapsilosis and discuss treatment option with a review of the literatures.","1783":"Authors experienced intra-root cavernous angioma which is very rare case among cavernous angiomas of cauda equina. Our intra-root cavernous angioma was confirmed by findings from operating field and microscopic examination. We report this case with review of the literature.","1784":"The authors evaluated the accuracies and ease of use of several commonly used microanastomosis training models (synthetic tube, chicken wing, and living rat model). A survey was conducted among neurosurgeons and neurosurgery residents at a workshop held in 2009 at the authors' institute. Questions addressed model accuracy (similarity to real vessels and actual procedures) and practicality (availability of materials and ease of application in daily practice). Answers to each question were rated using a 5-point scale. Participants were also asked what types of training methods they would chose to improve their skills and to introduce the topic to other neurosurgeons or neurosurgery residents. Of the 24 participants, 20 (83.3%) responded to the survey. The living rat model was favored for model accuracy (p &lt; 0.001; synthetic tube -0.95 +\/- 0.686, chicken wing, 0.15 +\/- 0.587, and rat, 1.75 +\/- 0.444) and the chicken wing model for practicality (p &lt; 0.001; synthetic tube -1.55 +\/- 0.605, chicken wing, 1.80 +\/- 0.523, and rat, 1.30 +\/- 0.923). All (100%) chose the living rat model for improving their skills, and for introducing the subject to other neurosurgeons or neurosurgery residents, the chicken wing and living rat models were selected by 18 (90%) and 20 (100%), respectively. Of 3 methods examined, the chicken wing model was found to be the most practical, but the living rat model was found to represent reality the best. We recommend the chicken wing model to train surgeons who have mastered basic techniques, and the living rat model for experienced surgeons to maintain skill levels. ","1785":"The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of lumbar disc herniation surgery for low back pain on the erectile functioning. Thirty-eight patients, with age ranging from 22 to 56 years, who had presented with pain due to herniated lumbar discs were included in the study. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Short Form questionnaire was used to evaluate the erectile functioning. Patient visits on the 1st week,1st month and 3rd month postoperatively were analyzed. Pain scores were also noted together with side effects and the complications of the surgery. Of the 38 patients, 18 patients had reported erectile dysfunction; 10 patients mild and 8 patients moderate erectile dysfunction. Twenty patients did not report erectile problems. The herniation levels mostly were L5-S1 in 12 (31.6%). Overall, erectile dysfunction rates have improved in 31.7% of those previously with erectile dysfunction in a 3 month period after the surgery. Best results were obtained in those patients with mild erectile dysfunction preoperatively. Mild erectile dysfunction together with radiculopathy tends to improve after lumbosacral disc surgery. Moderate and severe erectile dysfunction may be related to a more severe nerve injury or to vascular and\/or psychiatric factors. An evaluation of erectile functioning should routinely be performed in patients with lumbosacral disc disease both for data accumulation and for medico legal causes since the documentation of the correlation between erectile dysfunction and lumbosacral disc disease is still lacking. ","1786":"For the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is currently widely used as an effective and relatively safe procedure. However, some patients do not experience pain relief after PVP. We performed several additional PVP procedures in those patients who did not have any improvement of pain after their initial PVP and we obtained good results. Our purpose is to demonstrate the effective results of an additional PVP procedure at the same previously treated level. We reviewed the medical records and the radiologic data of the PVP procedures that were performed at our hospital from November 2005 to May 2008 to determine the patients who had undergone additional PVP. We identified ten patients and we measured the clinical outcomes according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the radiologic parameters, including the anterior body height and the kyphotic angulation. The mean volume of polymethylmethacrylate injected into each vertebrae was 4.3 mL (range: 2-8 mL). The mean VAS score was reduced from 8 to 2.32. The anterior body height was increased from 1.7 cm to 2.32 cm. The kyphotic angulation was restored from 10.14 degrees to 2.32 degrees. There were no complications noted. The clinical and radiologic outcomes suggest that additional PVP is effective for relieving pain and restoring the vertebral body in patients who have unrelieved pain after their initial PVP. Our study demonstrates that additional PVP performed at the previously-treated vertebral levels could provide therapeutic benefit. ","1787":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical characteristics and surgical outcome of cerebellopontine angle (CPA) epidermoids presenting with trigeminal neuralgia. Between 1996 and 2004, 10 patients with typical symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia were found to have cerebellopontine angle epidermoids and treated surgically at our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the clinico-radiological records of the patients. Total resection was done in 6 patients (60%). Surgical removal of tumor and microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve were performed simultaneously in one case. One patient died due to postoperative aseptic meningitis. The others showed total relief from pain. During follow-up, no patients experienced recurrence of their trigeminal neuralgia (TN). The clinical features of TN from CPA epidermoids are characterized by symptom onset at a younger age compared to TN from vascular causes. In addition to removal of the tumor, the possibility of vascular compression at the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve should be kept in mind. If it exists, a microvascular decompression (MVD) should be performed. Recurrence of tumor is rare in both total and subtotal removal cases, but long-term follow-up is required. ","1788":"The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between asymptomatic urinary tract infection (aUTI) and postoperative spine infection. A retrospective review was done in 355 women more than 65 years old who had undergone laminectomy and\/or discectomy, and spinal fusion, between January 2004 and December 2008. Previously postulated risk factors (i.e., instrumentation, diabetes, prior corticosteroid therapy, previous spinal surgery, and smoking) were investigated. Furthermore, we added aUTI that was not previously considered. Among 355 patients, 42 met the criteria for aUTI (Bacteriuria &gt;\/= 10(5) CFU\/mL and no associated symptoms). A postoperative spine infection was evident in 15 of 355 patients. Of the previously described risk factors, multi-levels (p &lt; 0.05), instrumentation (p &lt; 0.05) and diabetes (p &lt; 0.05) were proven risk factors, whereas aUTI (p &gt; 0.05) was not statistically significant. However, aUTI with Foley catheterization was statistically significant when Foley catheterization was added as a variable to the all existing risk factors. aUTI is not rare in elderly women admitted to the hospital for lumbar spine surgery. The results of this study suggest that aUTI with Foley catheterization may be considered a risk factor for postoperative spine infection in elderly women. Therefore, we would consider treating aUTI before operating on elderly women who will need Foley catheterization. ","1789":"The objectives of this study were to analyze the outcome and hemorrhagic risk of intravenous (IV) argatroban in patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting beyond six hours of ischemic symptom onset. Eighty patients with acute ischemic stroke who were admitted to the hospital beyond six hours from ischemic symptom onset were retrospectively analyzed. We could not perform IV thrombolysis or intra-arterial thrombolysis because of limited time window. So, IV argatroban was performed to prevent recurrent thrombosis and progression of infarcted area. The outcome was assessed by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and related hemorrhagic risk was analyzed. Also, each outcome was analyzed according to the initial stroke severity, subtype, and location. The median NIHSS was 8.0 at admission, 4.1 upon discharge, and 3.3 after three months. A good outcome was achieved in 81% of patients upon discharge and 88% after three months. Symptomatic hemorrhage occurred in only two patients (3%). IV argatroban was effective regardless of initial stroke severity, subtype, and location. IV argatroban may be an effective and safe treatment modality for acute ischemic stroke presenting beyond six hours of ischemic symptom onset. ","1790":"Barbiturate coma therapy (BCT) is a useful method to control increased intracranial pressure (IICP) patients. However, the complications such as hypotension and hypokalemia have caused conditions that stopped BCT early. The complications of low dose BCT with Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and those of high dose BCT without BIS monitoring have been compared to evaluate the efficacy of low dose BCT with BIS monitoring. We analyzed 39 patients with high dose BCT group (21 patients) and low dose BCT group (18 patients). Because BIS value of 40-60 is general anesthesia score, we have adjusted the target dose of thiopental to maintain the BIS score of 40-60. Therefore, dose of thiopental was kept 1.3 to 2.6 mg\/kg\/hour during low dose BCT. However, high dose BCT consisted of 5 mg\/kg\/hour without BIS monitoing. The protocol of BCT was successful in 72.2% and 38.1% of low dose and high dose BCT groups, respectively. The complications such as QT prolongation, hypotension and cardiac arrest have caused conditions that stopped BCT early. Hypokalemia showed the highest incidence rate in complications of both BCT. The descent in potassium level were 0.63 +\/- 0.26 in low dose group, and 1.31 +\/- 0.48 in high dose group. The treatment durations were 4.89 +\/- 1.68 days and 3.38 +\/- 1.24 days in low dose BCT and high dose BCT, respectively. It was proved that low dose BCT showed less severe complications than high dose BCT. Low dose BCT with BIS monitoring provided enough duration of BCT possible to control ICP. ","1791":"Selective neurotomy is generally a safe, effective, and long-lasting treatment for patients with spastic equinovarus foot deformity. We retrospectively analyzed the results of microsurgical selective tibial neurotomy (STN) for spastic feet in adults and children. A neurosurgeon selected 32 patients with 45 spastic feet (adults : 13, children : 32) to undergo microsurgical STN between October 1998 and September 2007. A physician of rehabilitation assessed spasticity pre- and postoperatively, that was based on the Ashworth scale, ankle clonus, and the amplitude of ankle dorsiflexion. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 36.7 months in adults and 42.5 months in children. Spastic components of the feet were corrected immediately after surgery in both the adult and child groups. The mean Ashworth's grade changed from 3.6 +\/- 0.40 to 1.6 +\/- 0.70 in adults and from 3.7 +\/- 0.69 to 1.4 +\/- 0.49 in children. Mean ankle clonus decreased markedly, from 1.6 +\/- 0.79 to 0.3 +\/- 0.42 in adults and from 1.7 +\/- 0.65 to 0.3 +\/- 0.56 in children. The mean amplitude of ankle dorsiflexion was improved, but eight (adults: 4, children: 4) contracted feet needed complementary orthopedic correction for acceptable results. STN can be effective in the long-term for improving lower limb function and reduction of equinovarus deformity. Our results demonstrate that STN might be an effective procedure for treating localized harmful spastic feet in adults and children. ","1792":"We present a case of tuberculous spondylitis in which diagnosis was masked by a concomitant pyogenic infection. The patient had undergone percutaneous needle aspiration of an abscess in the cavity of the psoas muscle. Early results from the culture regimen showed isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After eight weeks, mycobacterium tuberculosis was grown at regimen which was cultured at the same site. Initial isolation of pyogenic bacteria, considered to be highly virulent organisms, led to delayed diagnosis and treatment of the tuberculosis.","1793":"Gas pseudocysts are a rare cause of lumbar radiculopathy and most symptomatic gas pseudocysts are found within the confines of the spinal canal. A gas pseudocyst in the foramen causing lumbar radiculopathy is very rare. We present a case of a 67-year-old woman suffering from severe pain in the right leg. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a gas pseudocyst compressing the L2 root at the right L2-3 foramen. The patient underwent cyst excision using the lateral transmuscular approach and her leg pain was improved after the operation.","1794":"Posttraumatic syringomyelia may result from a variety of inherent conditions and traumatic events, or from some combination of these. Many hypotheses have arisen to explain this complex disorder, but no consensus has emerged. A 28-year-old man presented with progressive lower extremity weakness, spasticity, and decreased sensation below the T4 dermatome five years after an initial trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large, multi-septate syrinx cavity extending from C5 to L1, with a retropulsed bony fragment of L2. We performed an L2 corpectomy, L1-L3 interbody fusion using a mesh cage and screw fixation, and a wide decompression and release of the ventral portion of the spinal cord with an operating microscope. The patient showed complete resolution of his neurological symptoms, including the bilateral leg weakness and dysesthesia. Postoperative MRI confirmed the collapse of the syrinx and restoration of subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. These findings indicate a good correlation between syrinx collapse and symptomatic improvement. This case showed that syringomyelia may develop through obstruction of the subarachnoid CSF space by a bony fracture and kyphotic deformity. Ventral decompression of the obstructed subarachnoid space, with restoration of spinal alignment, effectively treated the spinal canal encroachment and post-traumatic syringomyelia.","1795":"Small bowel injury resulting from unforeseen penetration of the anterior annulus fibrosus and longitudinal ligament is a rare complication of lumbar microdiscectomy. The patient complained of abdominal tenderness and distention immediately after microdiscectomy for L4-5 and L5-S1 disc herniation. Using abdominal computed tomography, we found several foci of air overlying the anterior aspect of the vertebral body at the L5-S1 level. Segmental resection of the small bowel including small tears and primary anastomosis of the jejunum were performed. Here, we present a case of intestinal perforation after lumbar microdiscectomy and discuss technical methods to prevent this complication with a review of literature.","1796":"C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle (C1LM-C2P) fixation is a relatively new technique for atlantoaxial stabilization. Complications from C1LM-C2P fixation have been rarely reported. The authors report unilateral rod migration into the posterior fossa as a rare complication after this posterior C1-C2 stabilization technique. A 23-year-old man suffered severe head trauma and cervical spine injury after vehicle accident. He was unconscious for 2 months and regained consciousness. He underwent C1LM-C2P fixation for stabilization of type II odontoid process fracture described by Harms. The patient recovered without a major complication. Twenty months after operation, brain computed tomogram performed at psychology department for disability evaluation showed rod migration into the right cerebellar hemisphere. The patient had mild occipital headache and dizziness only regarding the misplaced rod. He refused further operation for rod removal. To our knowledge, this complication is the first report regarding rod migration after Harms method. We should be kept in mind the possibility of rod migration, and C1LM-C2P fixation should be performed with meticulous technique and long-term follow-up.","1797":"A 73-year-old male presented with a rare dorsally sequestrated lumbar disc herniation manifesting as severe radiating pain in both leg, progressively worsening weakness in both lower extremities, and urinary incontinence, suggesting cauda equina syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested the sequestrated disc fragment located in the extradural space at the L4-L5 level had surrounded and compressed the dural sac from the lateral to dorsal sides. A bilateral decompressive laminectomy was performed under an operating microscope. A large extruded disc was found to have migrated from the ventral aspect, around the thecal sac, and into the dorsal aspect, which compressed the sac to the right. After removal of the disc fragment, his sciatica was relieved and the patient felt strength of lower extremity improved.","1798":"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common condition that often leads to death or disability. Accurate prediction of the outcome and decisions regarding the treatment of ICH patients are important issues. We report a case of thalamic hemorrhage with an intraventricular hemorrhage that was suddenly migrated into the third and fourth ventricles in its entirety 8 hours after symptom onset. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of spontaneous migration of thalamic ICH into ventricles, and we suggest a possible mechanism for this case with a brief review of the literature.","1799":"Sildenafil citrate (Viagra(R); Pfeizer US Pharmaceutical Group, New York, NY, USA) is a potent vasodilating agent to treat male erectile dysfunction. Among its adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke has not been widely reported yet. We present a case of a 33-year-old healthy man who ingested 50 mg sildenafil a half hour before onset of headache, nervousness and speech disturbance. Head computed tomogram of this stuporous man showed huge intracerebral hemorrhage and thick subarachnoid hemorrhage, but angiography failed to disclose any vascular anomalies. Subsequent surgical procedure was followed, and rehabilitation was provided thereafter. Sildenafil seems to act by redistributing arterial blood flow, and concurrent sympathetic hyperactivity, which lead to such hemorrhagic presentation. Extreme caution should be paid on even in a young adult male patient wven without known risk factors.","1800":"The purpose of study was to evaluate the feasibility of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images of the rat obtained using a 1.5T MR machine in several blood-brain barrier (BBB) experiments. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. MR images were obtained using a clinical 1.5T MR machine. A microcatheter was introduced via the femoral artery to the carotid artery. Normal saline (group 1, n = 4), clotted autologous blood (group 2, n = 4), triolein emulsion (group 3, n = 4), and oleic acid emulsion (group 4, n = 4) were infused into the carotid artery through a microcatheter. Conventional and diffusion-weighted images, the apparent coefficient map, perfusion-weighted images, and contrast-enhanced MR images were obtained. Brain tissue was obtained and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed in group 2. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran images and endothelial barrier antigen (EBA) studies were performed in group 4. The MR images in group 1 were of good quality. The MR images in group 2 revealed typical findings of acute cerebral infarction. Perfusion defects were noted on the perfusion-weighted images. The MR images in group 3 showed vasogenic edema and contrast enhancement, representing vascular damage. The rats in group 4 had vasogenic edema on the MR images and leakage of dextran on the FITC-labeled dextran image, representing increased vascular permeability. The immune reaction was decreased on the EBA study. Clinical 1.5T MR images using a rat depicted many informative results in the present study. These results can be used in further researches of the BBB using combined clinical MR machines and immunohistochemical examinations. ","1801":"Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that is mainly performed for refractory pain due to osteoporotic compression fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of balloon kyphoplasty performed at different times after an injury. In this retrospective study, the records of 99 patients who underwent one level of balloon kyphoplasty between January 2005 and December 2007 were reviewed. The patients were divided into three groups : 21 patients treated within 3 weeks of an injury (the acute group), 49 treated within 3 weeks to 2 months of an injury (the subacute group), and 29 patients treated at more than 2 months after an injury (the chronic group). Clinical outcomes were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, modified MacNab's grading criteria was used to assess the subjective patient outcome. The radiology findings, including vertebral height restoration and procedure related complications, were analyzed based on the different time intervals after the injury. Patients in all three groups achieved marked pain relief in terms of the VAS within 7 days of the procedure. Good or excellent results were achieved by most patients in all three groups. However, the height restoration, the main advantage to performing a balloon kyphoplasty, was not achieved in the chronic group. Moreover, evidence of complications including cement leakage was observed significantly less frequently in the subacute group compared to the other two groups. Although balloon kyphoplasty is an effective treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures, with regard to pain relief, the subacute stage appears to be optimal for treating patients with a balloon kyphoplasty in terms of achieving the best outcomes with minimal complications. ","1802":"This study is planned to determine the neurocognitive difficulties of hydrocephalic adults. THE RESEARCH GROUP CONTAINED HEALTHY ADULTS (CONTROL GROUP, N : 15), and hydrocephalic adults (n : 15). Hydrocephalic group consisted of patients with idiopathic aquaduct stenosis and post-meningitis hydrocephalus. All patients were followed with shunted hydrocephalus and not gone to shunt revision during last two years. They were chosen from either asymptomatic or had only minor symptoms without motor and sensorineural deficit. A neuropsychological test battery (Raven Standart Progressive Matrices, Bender-Gestalt Test, Cancellation Test, Clock Drawing Test, Facial Recognition Test, Line Orientation Test, Serial Digit Learning Test, Stroop Color Word Interference Test-TBAG Form, Verbal Fluency Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Visual-Aural Digit Span Test-B) was applied to all groups. Neuropsychological assessment of hydrocephalic patients demonstrated that they had poor performance on visual, semantic and working memory, visuoconstructive and frontal functions, reading, attention, motor coordination and executive function of parietal lobe which related with complex and perseverative behaviour. Eventually, these patients had significant impairment on the neurocognitive functions of their frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. On the other hand, the statistical analyses performed on demographic data showed that the aetiology of the hydrocephalus, age, sex and localization of the shunt (frontal or posterior parietal) did not affect the test results. This prospective study showed that adult patients with hydrocephalus have serious neuropsychological problems which might be directly caused by the hydrocephalus; and these problems may cause serious adaptive difficulties in their social, cultural, behavioral and academic life. ","1803":"The aneurysm remnants rate was evaluated via three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) in the postoperative evaluation of clipped aneurysms. Data on surgically clipped aneurysms of anterior circulation obtained via postoperative 3D-DSA from February 2007 to March 2009 were gathered. The results of the postoperative 3D-DSA and of two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2D-DSA) for the detection of aneurysm remnants were compared, and an investigation was performed as to why 2D-DSA had missed some aneurysm remnants that were detected in the 3D-DSA. Various surgical factors that revealed aneurysm remnants in the 3D-DSA were also evaluated. A total of 39 neck remnants of 202 clipped aneurysms (19.3%) were confirmed in 3D-DSA, and these were classified according to Sindou's classification of aneurysm remnants. Patients with only a neck remnant found in the 3D-DSA represented 17.3% (35\/202 aneurysms) of the whole series, and those with a residuum of neck plus sac found in the 3D-DSA represented 1.9% (4\/202 aneurysms). The causes of aneurysm remnants were no full visualization (14\/39, 35.9%), parent and perforator artery protection (10\/39, 25.6%), clip design problems (8\/39, 20.5%), and broad-necked aneurysm (7\/39, 17.9%). Patients with &lt;\/= 2 mm aneurysm remnants showed an increased risk of undetectable aneurysm remnants in the 2D-DSA. The most frequent location of the missed aneurysm in 2D-DSA was the anterior communicating artery. 3D-DSA showed more aneurysm remnants than what is indicated in the existing literature, the 2D-DSA. ","1804":"To prevent temporal depression after the pterional craniotomy, this study was designed to examine the safety and aesthetic efficacy of the brushite calcium phosphate cement (CPC) in the repair and augmentation of bone defects following the pterional craniotomy. The brushite CPC was used for the repair of surgically induced cranial defects, with or without augmentation, in 17 cases of pterional approach between March, 2005 and December, 2006. The average follow-up month was 20 with range of 12-36 months. In the first 5 cases, bone defects were repaired with only brushite CPC following the contour of the original bone. In the next 12 cases, bone defects were augmented with the brushite CPC rather than original bone contour. For a stability monitoring of the implanted brushite CPC, post-implantation evaluations including serial X-ray, repeated physical examination for aesthetic efficacy, and three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) were taken 1 year after the implantation. The brushite CPC paste provided precise and easy contouring in restoration of the bony defect site. No adverse effects such as infection or inflammation were noticed during the follow-up periods from all patients. 3D-CT was taken 1 year subsequent to implantation showed good preservation of the brushite CPC restoration material. In the cases of the augmentation group, aesthetic outcomes were superior compared to the simple repair group. The results of this clinical study indicate that the brushite CPC is a biocompatible alloplastic material, which is useful for prevention of temporal depression after pterional craniotomy. Additional study is required to determine the long-term stability and effectiveness of the brushite calcium phosphate cement for the replacement of bone. ","1805":"Cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy are performed by physicians in various disciplines. It is important to know the comprehensive anatomy of the laryngotracheal region. Hemorrhage, esophageal injury, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, pneumothorax, hemothorax, false passage of the tube and tracheal stenosis after decannulation are well known complications of the cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy. Cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy should be performed without complications and as quickly as possible with regards the patients' clinical condition. A total of 40 cadaver necks were dissected in this study. The trachea and larynx and the relationship between the trachea and larynx and the surrounding structures was investigated. The tracheal cartilages and annular ligaments were counted and the relationship between tracheal cartilages and the thyroid gland and vascular structures was investigated. We performed cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy in eleven cadavers while simulating intensive care unit conditions to determine the duration of those procedures. There were 11 tracheal cartilages and 10 annular ligaments between the cricoid cartilage and sternal notch. The average length of trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch was 6.9 to 8.2 cm. The cricothyroid muscle and cricothyroid ligament were observed and dissected and no vital anatomic structure detected. The average length and width of the cricothyroid ligament was 8 to 12 mm and 8 to 10 mm, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the surgical time required for cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy (p &lt; 0.0001). Tracheostomy and cricothyrotomy have a low complication rate if the person performing the procedure has thorough knowledge of the neck anatomy. The choice of tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy to establish an airway depends on the patients' clinical condition, for instance; cricothyrotomy should be preferred in patients with cervicothoracal injury or dislocation who suffer from respiratory dysfunction. Furthermore; if a patient is under risk of hypoxia or anoxia due to a difficult airway, cricothyrotomy should be preferred rather than tracheostomy. ","1806":"The normal anatomic relationships characteristic of the pituitary stalk area were previously thought to involve only one location. The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate the anatomic location of the pituitary stalk and possible varying locations in relation to the tuberculum sellae and dorsum sellae using morphometric evaluation and anatomic dissection of human cadaveric specimens. The surgical implications of the variations are discussed. The calvaria were removed via routine autopsy dissections, and the brains were removed from the skull while preserving the pituitary stalk. The diaphragma sellae, tuberculum sellae, and the location of the pituitary stalk were examined in 60 human cadaveric heads obtained from fresh adult cadavers. Empty sellae were excluded. The openings of the diaphragma sellae averaged 6.62 +\/- 1.606 mm (range, 3-9 mm). The distance between the tuberculum sellae and the posterior part of the pituitary stalk was 1 to 8 mm. The upper face of the diaphragma sellae appeared flat in 26 (43%), concave in 24 (40%), and convex in 6 cases (10%), with a prominent tuberculum sellae in 4 cases (7%). The location of the chiasm was normal in 47 cases (78%), with a prefixed chiasm in 3 cases (5%) and a postfixed chiasm (17%) in the 10 cases. Four cadaver specimens had prominent tuberculum sellae and other parameters were not evaluated. When opening the chiasmatic cistern, neurosurgeons should be aware about the relationship between the pituitary stalk and the surrounding structures to prevent inadvertent injury to the pituitary stalk. ","1807":"The authors present a case of multiple intracranial calcifications after the procedure of external ventricular drain placement in a 50-year-old man with pericallosal artery aneurysm. We believe that calcifications formed dust that had fallen into the track during the external ventricular drain procedure. The clinical features and radiological findings are presented with review of literature.","1808":"Anterior cranial fossa dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVFs) are very rare and the bleeding rate is very high, especially in the presence of leptomeningeal draining vein and aneurysmal varix formation. A 85-year-old male patient presented with subdural hematoma (SDH). Magnetic resonance image (MRI) and transfemoral carotid angiography (TFCA) disclosed DAVF at the anterior cranial fossa with bilateral arterial feeders and leptomeningeal draining vein with varix formation. The lesion was treated by simple ligation of pial connecting vein using low frontal craniotomy. In comparison with DAVFs of the other sites, the anterior cranial fossa DAVF is difficult to manage by endovascular treatment due to not only the difficulty of transvenous access but the risk of visual impairment when using transarterial route. Surgical ligation of pial connecting vein is feasible and effective treatment.","1809":"The efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for treatment of various chronic painful conditions is well established. Very few reports have documented the use of SCS for treatment of chronic pain after spinal cord injury. We present a case showing a good outcome after such treatment, and suggest that high cervical stimulation may be efficacious. A 53-year-old male underwent SCS on the C1-3 level for treatment of intractable neuropathic pain below the T3 level, and in the upper extremities, arising from spinal cord injury resulting from transverse myelitis caused by schistosomiasis. High cervical SCS significantly improved the pain in the upper extremities and at the T3-T10 dermatome level. The patient continues to report excellent pain relief 9 months later. The present case suggests that high cervical stimulation may improve chronic pain in the upper extremities and the T3-T10 dermatome level arising from spinal cord injury.","1810":"Osteolipoma is an ossified lipoma with distinct components of fat and bone. We present a case of interhemispheric osteolipoma associated with total agenesis of the corpus callosum. A 20-year-old man complained of severe headache, nausea and vomiting. Brain computed tomography showed a low-density mass in an interhemispheric fissure, with high T1 and T2 magnetic resonance signals compatible with fat. The mass measured 4.9 x 2.9 cm in size and showed peripheral calcifications. There was another small piece of same signal mass within the lateral ventricular choroid plexus. The interhemispheric lesion was removed by an interhemispheric approach. Osteolipoma is rare in interhemispheric region, however, it should be a differential diagnosis of lesions with fat intensity mass and calcifications.","1811":"We report here on an uncommon case of metastatic choriocarcinoma to the lung, brain and lumbar spine. A 33-year-old woman was admitted to the pulmonary department with headache, dyspnea and hemoptysis. There was a history of cesarean section due to intrauterine fetal death at 37-weeks gestation and this occurred 2 weeks before admission to the pulmonary department. The radiological studies revealed a nodular lung mass with hypervascularity in the left upper lobe and also a brain parenchymal lesion in the parietal lobe with marginal bleeding and surrounding edema. She underwent embolization for the lung lesion, which was suspected to be an arteriovenous malformation according to the pulmonary arteriogram. Approximately 10 days after discharge from the pulmonary department, she was readmitted due to back pain and progressive paraparesis. The neuroradiological studies revealed a hypervascular tumor occupying the entire L3 vertebral body and pedicle, and the tumor extended to the epidural area. She underwent embolization of the hypervascular lesion of the lumbar spine, and after which injection of polymethylmethacrylate in the L3 vertebral body, total laminectomy of L3, subtotal removal of the epidural mass and screw fixation of L2 and L4 were performed. The result of biopsy was a choriocarcinoma.","1812":"Acupuncture appears to be a clinically effective treatment for acute and chronic pain. A considerable amount of research has been conducted to evaluate the role that acupuncture plays in pain suppression; however, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the side effects of the acupuncture procedure. This case report describes a suspected postdural puncture headache following acupuncture for lower back pain. Considering the high opening pressure, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and the patient's history of acupuncture in the lower back area, our diagnosis was iatrogenic postdural puncture headache. Full relief of the headache was achieved after administration of an epidural blood patch.","1813":"A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) associated with negative finding on four-vessel angiography is seen in 5 to 30% of patients with intracranial SAH. A previously silent lesion in the spinal canal may be responsible for the angiographically negative finding for cause of intracranial SAH. We report a case of upper cervical (C1-2) intradural schwannoma presenting with acute intracranial SAH. Repeated cerebral angiographic studies were negative, but cervical magnetic resonance imaging study and tissue pathology revealed a intradural-extramedullary schwannoma in C1-2 level. This case illustrates the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for spinal disease in angiographically negative intracranial SAH patients.","1814":"Bow hunter's stroke is a rare symptomatic vertebrobasilar insufficiency in which vertebral artery (VA) is mechanically occluded during head rotation. Various pathologic conditions have been reported as causes of bow hunter's stroke. However, bow hunter's stroke caused by facet hypertrophy of C1-2 has not been reported. A 71-year-old woman presented with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Spine computed tomography showed massive facet hypertrophy on the left side of C1-2 level. A VA angiogram with her head rotated to the right revealed significant stenosis of left VA. C1-2 posterior fixation and fusion was performed to prevent serious neurologic deficit from vertebrobasilar stroke.","1815":"The secondary verification of Leksell Gamma Knife treatment planning system (LGP) (which is the primary verification system) is extremely important in order to minimize the risk of treatment errors. Although prior methods have been developed to verify maximum dose and treatment time, none have studied maximum dose coordinates and treatment volume. We simulated the skull shape as an ellipsoid with its center at the junction between the mammillary bodies and the brain stem. The radiation depths of the beamlets emitted from 201 collimators were calculated based on the relationship between this ellipsoid and a single beamlet expressed as a straight line. A computer program was coded to execute the algorithm. A database system was adopted to log the doses for 31x31x31 or 29,791 matrix points allowing for future queries to be made of the matrix of interest. When we compared the parameters in seven patients, all parameters showed good correlation. The number of matrix points with a dose higher than 30% of the maximal dose was within +\/- 2% of LGP. The 50% dose volume, which is generally the target volume, differs maximally by 4.2%. The difference of the maximal dose ranges from 0.7% to 7%. Based on the results, the variable ellipsoid modeling technique or variable ellipsoid modeling technique (VEMT) can be a useful and independent tool to verify the important parameters of LGP and make up for LGP. ","1816":"The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) worldwide varies considerably. In spite of many reports about the incidence of SAH, there has been no report about the incidence of SAH on the basis of the Korean population. The purpose of this hospital-based study was to assess the actual incidence rates of aneurysmal SAH in Gwangju city and Jeollanamdo province. All cases of SAH confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) between January 2007 and December 2007 were selected for analysis. For the data collection, three major training hospital and ten general hospitals working the CT in Gwangju city and four major general hospitals in Jeollanamdo province participate in this study. According to the official census of Korea, the population was 1,413,444 in Gwangju city and 1,929,836 in Jeollanamdo province in 2007. There were 163 patients in Gwangju city and 266 patients in Jeollanamdo province confirmed SAH by CT in 2007. The crude and the age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rates per 100,000 population for all ages in Gwangju city were 11.5 and 12.4 for aneurysmal SAH and in Jeollanamdo province were 13.8 and 10.8. The incidence was higher in women and increased with age. The gender distribution varied with age. At young ages, the incidence was higher in men while after the age of 40 years, the incidence was higher in women. In the present study, the age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence rates is 11.8 in Gwangju city and Jeollanamdo province. The incidence was higher in women and increased with age. ","1817":"Aneurysmal rebleeding is a major cause of death and disability. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of rebleeding, and the factors related with patient's outcome. During a period of 12 years, from September 1995 to August 2007, 492 consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) underwent surgery at our institution. We reviewed the patient's clinical records, radiologic findings, and possible factors inducing rebleeding. Also, we statistically analyzed various factors between favorable outcome group (FG) and unfavorable outcome group (UG) in the rebleeding patients. Rebleeding occurred in 38 (7.7%) of 492 patients. Male gender, location of aneurysm (anterior communicating artery) were statistically significant between rebleeding group and non-rebleeding group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). Rebleeding occurred in 26 patients (74.3%) within 2 hours from initial attack. There were no statistically significant factors between FG and UG. However, time interval between initial SAH to rebleeding was shorter in the UG compared to FG (FG = 28.71 hrs, UG = 2.9 hrs). Rebleeding occurs more frequently in the earlier period after initial SAH. Thus, careful management in the earlier period after SAH and early obliteration of aneurysm will be necessary. ","1818":"There have been no clinical studies regarding the epidemiology and treatment outcome for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) in South Korea yet. Thus, The Korean Society of Cerebrovascular Surgery (KSCVS) decided to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics, and outcome of the treatment of UIA in 2006, using the nationwide multicenter survey in South Korea. A total of 1,696 cases were enrolled retrospectively over one year at 48 hospitals. The following data were obtained from all patients : age, sex, presence of symptoms, location and size of the aneurysm, treatment modality, presence of risk factors for stroke, and the postoperative 30-day morbidity and mortality. The demographic data showed female predominance and peak age of seventh and sixth decades. Supraclinoid internal carotid artery was the most common site of aneurysms with a mean size of 5.6 mm. Eight-hundred-forty-six patients (49.9%) were treated with clipping, 824 (48.6%) with coiling, and 26 with combined method. The choice of the treatment modalities was related to hospital (p = 0.000), age (p = 0.000), presence of symptom (p = 0.003), and location of aneurysm (p = 0.000). The overall 30-day morbidity and mortality were 7.4% and 0.3%, respectively. The 30-day mortality was 0.4% for clipping and 0.2% for coiling, and morbidity was 8.4% for clipping and 6.3% for coiling. Age (p = 0.010), presence of symptoms (p = 0.034), size (p = 0.000) of aneurysm, and diabetes mellitus (p = 0.000) were significant prognostic factors, while treatment modality was not. This first nation-wide multicenter survey on UIAs demonstrates the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, outcome and the prognostic factors of the treatment of UIAs in South Korea. The 30-day postoperative outcome for UIAs seems to be reasonable morbidity and mortality in South Korea. ","1819":"It has been demonstrated that cervical laminoplasty is an effective and safe method of treating multi-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. However, recent reports have suggested that axial neck pain is frequently encountered after cervical laminoplasty. The aim of the present study was to determine clinical significance of the C7 spinous process on axial neck pain after cervical laminoplasty. A total of 31 consecutive patients that underwent cervical laminoplasty between March 2002 and December 2008 were reviewed. The authors evaluated and compared axial neck pain and lordotic angle in patients that underwent C7 spinous process preserving surgery (group 1, n = 16) and in patients in which the C7 spinous process was sacrificed (group 2, n = 15). Severe or moderate early axial pain occurred in 56.2% of patients in group 1 and in 86.6% in group 2. Severe or moderate late axial pain occurred in 12.5% in group 1 and in 73.3% in group 2. Eighty-Six percent of patients in group 2 and 43% in group 1 experienced aggravation of their axial neck pain during the early postoperative period. Aggravation of axial neck pain during early postoperative period was less common in group 1 but not statistically significant (p = 0.073). Sixty-six percent of patients in group 2 and 12% in group 1 had aggravated axial neck pain at late postoperative period and aggravation of late axial neck pain was significantly less common in group 1 (p = 0.002). The present study demonstrates that C7 spinous process preserving laminoplasty decreases the incidence of aggravated axial neck pain after cervical laminoplasty. ","1820":"To evaluate the clinical results of gross total resection in the surgical approach to spinal ependymoma. Between June 1995 and May 2009, 13 males and 8 females (mean age 34) diagnosed with intramedullary or extramedullary spinal ependymoma were surgically treated at our centre. The neurological and functional state of each patient were evaluated according to the modified McCormick scale. The average follow-up duration was 54 months (ranging from 12 to 168 months). The locations of the lesions were: thoracic region (4, 19%), lumbar region (7, 34%), cervical region (4, 19%), cervicothoracic region (3, 14%) and conus medullaris (3, 14%). Four patients (19%) had deterioration of neurological function in the early postoperative period. The neurological function of three patients was completely recovered at the 6th postoperative month, while that of another patient was recovered at the 14th month. In the last assessment of neurological function, 20 patients (95%) were assessed as McCormick grade 1. No perioperative complications developed in any of our patients. In one patient's 24-month assessment, tumour recurrence was observed. Re-operation was not performed and the patient was taken under observation. Two determinants of good clinical results after spinal ependymoma surgery are a gross total resection of the tumour and a good neurological condition before the operation. Although neurological deficits in the early postoperative period can develop as a result of gross total tumour resection, significant improvement is observed six months after the operation. ","1821":"Clinical, radiographic, and outcomes assessments, focusing on complications, were performed in patients who underwent pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) to assess correction effectiveness, fusion stability, procedural safety, neurological outcomes, complication rates, and overall patient outcomes. We analyzed data obtained from 13 consecutive PSO-treated patients presenting with fixed sagittal imbalances from 1999 to 2006. A single spine surgeon performed all operations. The median follow-up period was 73 months (range 41-114 months). Events during perioperative course and complications were closely monitored and carefully reviewed. Radiographs were obtained and measurements were done before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the most recent follow-up examinations. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index and subjective satisfaction evaluation. Following surgery, lumbar lordosis increased from -14.1 degrees +\/- 20.5 degrees to -46.3 degrees +\/- 12.8 degrees (p &lt; 0.0001), and the C7 plumb line improved from 115 +\/- 43 mm to 32 +\/- 38 mm (p &lt; 0.0001). There were 16 surgery-related complications in 8 patients; 3 intraoperative, 3 perioperative, and 10 late-onset postoperative. The prevalence of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) was 23% (3 of 13 patients). However, clinical outcomes were not adversely affected by PJK. Intraoperative blood loss averaged 2,984 mL. The C7 plumb line values and postoperative complications were closely correlated with clinical results. Intraoperative or postoperative complications are relatively common following PSO. Most late-onset complications in PSO patients were related to PJK and instrumentation failure. Correcting the C7 plumb line value with minimal operative complications seemed to lead to better clinical results. ","1822":"To evaluate the role of cranial sonography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage and hypoxic-ischemic injury in an Indian set-up. The study included 100 neonates who underwent cranial sonography and computed tomography (CT) in the first month of life for suspected intracranial ischemia and hemorrhage. Two observers rated the images for possible intracranial lesions and a kappa statistic for interobserver agreement was calculated. There was no significant difference in the kappa values of CT and ultrasonography (USG) for the diagnosis of germinal matrix hemorrhage\/intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH\/IVH) and periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) and both showed good interobserver agreement. USG, however detected more cases of GMH\/IVH (24 cases) and PVL (19) cases than CT (22 cases and 16 cases of IVH and PVL, respectively). CT had significantly better interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic injury (HII) in term infants and also detected more cases (33) as compared to USG (18). CT also detected 6 cases of extraaxial hemorrhages as compared to 1 detected by USG. USG is better modality for imaging preterm neonates with suspected IVH or PVL. However, USG is unreliable in the imaging of term newborns with suspected HII where CT or magnetic resonance image scan is a better modality.

It remains a challenging problem to clinicians despite aggressive debridement surgery and antifungal therapy. The authors describe a case of ROC mucormycosis with pericranial abscess occurring in a female patient with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The infection initially developed in the right-sided nasal sinus and later progressed through the paranasal sinuses with the invasion of the peri-orbital and frontotemporal region, due to the delayed diagnosis and treatment. Numerous non-septate hyphae of the zygomycetes were identified by a punch biopsy from the nasal cavity and by an open biopsy of the involved dura. The patient was treated successfully with extensive debridement of her necrotic skull and surrounding tissues, drainage of her pericranial abscess and antifungal therapy, including intravenous amphotericin B for 61 days and oral posaconazole for the following 26 days. She returned to a normal life and has had no recurrence since the end of her treatment 15 months ago.","1825":"A 28-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a sudden, very severe headache. Brain computed tomographic angiography showed a saccular cerebral aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery and infraoptic courses of both anterior cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral arteries were seen to arise from the ipsilateral internal cerebral arteries at the level of the origin of the ophthalmic artery, passed underneath the ipsilateral optic nerve, and turned upward at ventral portion of the optic chiasm.Infraoptic course of the proximal anterior cerebral artery is an extremely rare anomaly and is often associated with cerebral aneurysms. We report the clinical features, radiological findings, and possible genesis of this anomaly with a literature review.","1826":"We report a case of intracranial dissemination developing approximately 4 months after partial removal of a spinal cord anplastic astrocytoma in a 22-year-old male. He presented with paraplegia on initial admission at a local hospital. Spinal magnetic resonance (MR) images disclosed multiple intramedullary lesions at the T3-11. The tumor was partially removed. The final histologic diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma. Four months after the operation, he was admitted with the symptoms of headache and deterioration of consciousness. MR images showed enhanced lesions in the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle, and septum pellucidum. He underwent computed tomography-guided stereotactic biopsy and histological appearance was consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma. The clinical course indicates that the tumor originated in the spinal cord and extended into the subarachnoid space, first the spinal canal and later intracranial.","1827":"Although very rare, a few cases of intradural extramedullary (IDEM) spinal tumor migration have been reported since Tomimatsu first reported a mobile schwannoma of the cervical cord in 1974. Schwannoma is a neurogenic tumor which originates from nerve sheath that it is relatively well-marginated tumor with little attachment or adhesion to surrounding tissue. Mobility of tumor in spinal canal sometimes can result in negative exploration at the expected area. We found three interesting cases in which different tumor locations observed in repeated magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings. All tumors were intradural and extramedullary schwannoma. We reviewed the literature about moving tumor in the spine through PUBMED search.","1828":"Sacral insufficiency fracture is a debilitating injury not easily found in general radiologic examinations and is rarely diagnosed, since its symptoms are obscure. It is known to frequently occur in patients with osteoporosis, but the treatment has not yet been established and various kinds of treatment methods are being attempted. Sacroplasty is sometimes performed by applying percutaneous vertebroplasty which is known to be a less invasive treatment. Since the course of diagnosis of sacral insufficiency fracture is difficult and clear guidelines for treatments have not yet been established, many spine surgeons fail to diagnose patients or speculate on treatment methods. We report our experience in diagnosing a sacral insufficiency fracture in a 54-year-old healthy female patient using MRI and treating her with sacroplasty. From a therapeutic point of view, we then cover the usefulness, effects and characteristics relating to the complications of sacroplasty, along with literature review.","1829":"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in the thoracic spine is rare, even in the Far East. A 45-year-old female presented with a 4-month history of progressive motor weakness in the lower extremities, numbness below the midthoracic area, and spastic gait disturbance. Neuroradiological examinations revealed massive OPLLs at the T4-T6 levels with severe anterior compression of the spinal cord. Anterior decompressive corpectomies with bone grafts were performed from T4 to T6 using a trans-thoracic approach. After surgery, the patient made an uneventful recovery. However, eleven years after surgery, the patient developed recurrent lower extremity weakness and spastic gait disturbance. De novo OPLLs at the C6-T2 levels were responsible for the severe spinal cord compression on this occasion. After second surgery, paralysis in both legs was resolved. We present a rare case of late cervicothoracic OPLL in a patient surgically treated for thoracic OPLL.","1830":"Surgery has a key role in the treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), but the resectability of paraspinal MPNSTs is only 20%. Therefore, spinal MPNSTs show frequent recurrence and poor prognosis. Local recurrence is much more common than metastasis for MPNSTs, and surgery still has a key role in the treatment of local recurrence. Therefore, it is important that recurrence must be detected before resectability is lost. However, no evidence-based follow-up protocol has been established for MPNST. The authors performed gross total resection in a 34-year-old woman presented with thoracic MPNST. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were not administered since these adjuvant therapies generally do not improve survival in MPNST and may cause additional neurovascular damage. Instead, the authors monitored the primary site every 3 months using magnetic resonance imaging to detect local recurrence at the earliest opportunity. The tumor recurred locally on two occasions without overt symptoms at 21 and 24 months postoperatively. These recurrences were treated successfully by gross total removal.","1831":"Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is often idiopathic. We report on a patient presenting with symptomatic intracranial hypotension and pain radiating to the right leg caused by a transdural lumbar disc herniation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain revealed classic signs of intracranial hypotension, and an additional spinal MR confirmed a lumbar transdural herniated disc as the cause. The patient was treated with a partial hemilaminectomy and discectomy. We were able to find the source of cerebrospinal fluid leak, and packed it with epidural glue and gelfoam. Postoperatively, the patient's headache and log radiating pain resolved and there was no neurological deficit. Thus, in this case, lumbar disc herniation may have been a cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.","1832":"To investigate the morphometric characteristics of the pituitary gland and diaphragma sellae in Korean adults. Using the 33 formaline fixed adult cadavers (23 male, 10 female), the measurements were taken at the diaphragma sellae and pituitary gland. The authors investigated the relationship between dura and structures surrounding pituitary gland, morphometric aspects of pituitary gland and stalk, and morphometric aspect of central opening of diaphragma sellae. The boundary between the lateral surface of pituitary gland and the medial wall of cavernous sinus was formed by the thin dural layer and pituitary capsule. The pituitary capsule adherent tightly to the pituitary gland was observed to continue from the diaphragma sellae. Mean width, length, and height of the pituitary gland were 14.3 +\/- 2.1, 7.9 +\/- 1.3, and 6.0 +\/- 0.9 mm in anterior lobes, and 8.7 +\/- 1.7, 2.9 +\/- 1.1, and 5.8 +\/- 1.0 mm in posterior lobes, respectively. Although all dimensions of anterior lobe in female were slightly larger than those in male, statistical significance was noted in only longitudinal dimension. The ratio of posterior lobe to the whole length of pituitary gland was about 27%. The mean thickness of pituitary stalk was 2 mm. The diaphragmal opening was 5 mm or more in 26 (78.8%) of 33 specimen. The opening was round in 60.6% of the specimen, and elliptical oriented in an anterior-posterior or transverse direction in 39.4%. These results provide the safe anatomical knowledge during the transsphenoidal surgery and may be helpful to access the possibility of the development of empty sella syndrome. ","1833":"The aim of this study was to investigate the morphological characteristics of the thalamoperforating arteries that arise from the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery. Thalamoperforating arteries located in the interpeduncular fossa were dissected in 26 formalin-fixed human cadaver brains. We investigated the origin site of thalamoperforating arteries from the P1 segment, number and diameter, and variations in their origin. Thalamoperforating arteries arose from the superior, posterior or posterosuperior surfaces of the P1 segment at the mean 1.93 mm (range, 0.41-4.71 mm) distance from the basilar apex and entered the brain through the posterior perforated substance. The average number was 3.6 (range 1-8) and mean diameter was 0.70 mm (range 0.24-1.18 mm). Thalamoperforating arteries could be classified into five different types according to their origin at the P1 segment : Type I (bilateral multiple), 38.5%; Type II (unilateral single, unilateral multiple), 26.9%; Type III (bilateral single), 19.2%; Type IV (unilateral single), 11.5%; Type V (unilateral multiple), 3.8%. In 15.4% of all specimens, thalamoperforating arteries arose from the only one side of P1 segment and were not noted in the other side. In such cases, the branches arising from the one side of P1 segment supplied the opposite side. Variations in the origin of the thalamoperforating arteries should be keep in mind to perform the surgical clipping, endovascular treatment or operation involving the interpeduncular fossa. In particular, unilateral single branch seems to be very risky and significant for surgical technique or endovascular treatment. ","1834":"The purpose of this study is to explain the effect and reciprocal action among tumor necrosis factor (TNF) like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on degeneration of human intervertebral disc (IVD). Human intervertebral disc tissues and cells were cultured with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium\/Nutrient F-12 Ham (DMEM\/F-12) media in 37, 5% CO(2) incubator. When IVD tissues were cultured with TWEAK, Fn14 that is an antagonistic receptor for TWEAK and TGF-beta1, the level of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) was estimated by dimethyl methyleneblue (DMMB) assay and sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 9 (Sox9) and versican messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were estimated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). When human IVD tissue was cultured for nine days, the sGAG content was elevated in proportion to culture duration. The sGAG was decreased significantly by TWEAK 100 ng\/mL, however, Fn14 500 ng\/mL did not change the sGAG production of IVD tissue. The Fn14 increased versican and Sox9 mRNA levels decreased with TWEAK in IVD tissue TGF-beta1 20 ng\/mL elevated the sGAG concentration 40% more than control. The sGAG amount decreased with TWEAK was increased with Fn14 or TGF-beta1 but the result was insignificant statistically. TGF-beta1 increased the Sox9 mRNA expression to 180% compared to control group in IVD tissue. Sox9 and versican mRNA levels decreased by TWEAK were increased with TGF-beta1 in primary cultured IVD cells, however, Fn14 did not show increasing effect on Sox9 and versican. This study suggests that TWEAK would act a role in intervertebral disc degeneration through decreasing sGAG and the mRNA level of versican and Sox9. ","1835":"Recurrent lumbar disc herniation has been reported to occur in 5% to 15% of surgically treated primary lumbar disc herniation cases. We investigated the molecular biologic characteristics of primary herniated discs and recurrent discs to see whether the recurrent discs has the similar biological features with primary herniated discs. Primary herniated disc and recurrent disc cells were obtained by discectomy of lumbar disc patients and cells were isolated and then taken through monolayer cultures. We compared chondrogenic and osteogenic mRNA gene expression, and western blot between the two groups. The mRNA gene expression of recurrent disc cells were increased 1.47* times for aggrecan, 1.38 times for type I collagen, 2.04 times for type II collagen, 1.22 times for both Sox-9 and osteocalcin, and 1.31 times for alkaline phosphatase, respectively, compared with the primary herniated lumbar disc cells (*indicates p &lt; 0.05). Western blot results for each aggrecan, type I collagen, type II collagen, Sox-9, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase were similar between the primary herniated disc cells and recurrent disc cells. These results indicate that the recurrent disc cells have similar chondrogenic and osteogenic gene expression compared to primary herniated disc cells. Therefore, we assumed that the regeneration of remaining discs could fill the previous discectomy space and also it could be one of the factors for disc recurrence especially in the molecular biologic field. ","1836":"The focus of this study is brain plasticity associated with semantic aspects of language function in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Using longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), patterns of brain activation were observed in twelve left and seven right unilateral mTLE patients during a word-generation task relative to a pseudo-word reading task before and after anterior temporal section surgery. No differences were observed in precentral activations in patients relative to normal controls (n = 12), and surgery did not alter the phonological-associated activations. The two mTLE patient groups showed left inferior prefrontal activations associated with semantic processing (word-generation &gt; pseudo-word reading), as did control subjects. The amount of semantic-associated activation in the left inferior prefrontal region was negatively correlated with epilepsy duration in both patient groups. Following temporal resection, semantic-specific activations in inferior prefrontal region became more bilateral in left mTLE patients, but more left-lateralized in right mTLE patients. The longer the duration of epilepsy in the patients, the larger the increase in the left inferior prefrontal semantic-associated activation after surgery in both patient groups. Semantic activation of the intact hippocampus, which had been negatively correlated with seizure frequency, normalized after the epileptic side was removed. These results indicate alternation of semantic language network related to recruitment of left inferior prefrontal cortex and functional recovery of the hippocampus contralateral to the epileptogenic side, suggesting an intra- and inter-hemispheric reorganization following surgery. ","1837":"Abnormalities of the bone are frequently encountered in patients with meningioma, and hyperostosis and endostosis are common bone alterations in these tumors. Extensive bony destruction is very unusual in patients with meningioma. We report six cases of intracranial meningioma associated with an osteolytic lesion of the skull and discuss the underlying mechanisms that may be responsible for bone destruction in patients with meningioma. Six patients were classified into three groups, severe, moderate and mild, according to the degree of osteolytic bony destruction. The tumor was classified as intracranial or extracranial, depending on its location. We investigated the potential role of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) in meningioma-associated osteolysis. The levels of MMP expression were determined by gelatin zymography, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis. Complete surgical removal of the lesion was performed in each patient. Histological examination revealed benign meningioma in four cases, and two cases of atypical meningioma. Patients did not have a poor prognosis except one case of recurred atypical meningioma. Gelatin zymography and RT-PCR detected high levels of MMP-2 in almost all extracranial masses in comparison with the intracranial masses and MMP-9 in two. There was no difference in the severity of bone destruction. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed MMP-2 expression in the vicinity of the bone destruction, and a few MMP-9-positive stainings were observed. Osteolysis of the skull in patients with meningiomas might not be indicative of malignant pathological features and poor prognosis. Invasion to the extracranial portion and osteolysis might be associated with MMP-2 expression in meningioma. ","1838":"In this study, we present a simple closed head injury model as a two-stage experiment. The height of the weight drop enables gradation of head trauma severity. The head injury device consists of three parts and there are three adjustable parameters-weight (100-600 g), height of fall (5-100 cm) and elasticity of the springs. Thirty male Wistar rats underwent monitoring of intracranial pressure with and without induction of the head injury. The weight drop from 45 to 100 cm led to immediate seizure activity and early death of the experimental animals. Severe head injury was induced from 40 cm weight drop. There was 50% mortality and all surviving rats had behavioral deterioration. Intracranial pressure was 9.3 +\/- 3.76 mmHg. Moderate head injury was induced from 35 cm, mortality decreased to 20-40%, only half of the animals showed behavioral pathology and intracranial pressure was 7.6 +\/- 3.54 mmHg. Weight drop from 30 cm caused mild head injury without mortality and neurological deterioration. Intracranial pressure was slightly higher compared to sham group- 5.5 +\/- 0.74 mmHg and 2.9 +\/- 0.81 mmHg respectively. This model is an eligible tool to create graded brain injury with stepwise intracranial pressure elevation. ","1839":"On the basis of preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, we studied the change of the size of anterior primary division (APD) of the L5 spinal root in the presence of foraminal\/extraforaminal entrapment of the L5 spinal root. Two independent radiologists retrospectively reviewed the preoperative CT scans of 27 patients treated surgically and compared the sizes of the APDs on bilateral L5 spinal roots. If one side APD size was larger than the other side APD size, it was described as left or right \"dominancy\" and regarded this as \"consensus (C)\" in case that there was a consensus between the larger APD and the location of sciatica, and regarded as \"non-consensus (NC)\" in case that there was not a consensus. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were used for preoperative and postoperative evaluation. On CT scans, twenty-one (77%) of 27 patients were the consensus group (APD swelling) and 6 (22%) were a non-consensus group (APD no swelling). In 9 patients with acute foraminal disc herniations, asymmetric enlargement of the APD on L5 spinal root was detected in all cases (100%) and detected in 11 (64%) of 17 patients with stenosis. Preoperative ODI score was 75-93 (mean 83) and postoperative ODI scores were improved to 13-36 (mean 21). The mean follow-up period was 6 months (range, 3-11 months). An asymmetric enlargement of the APD on L5 spinal root on CT scans is meaningfully associated with a foraminal or extraforaminal entrapment of the L5 spinal root on the lumbosacral junction. ","1840":"Cerebellar hemorrhage is an unusual complication of supratentorial neurosurgery. To the best of our knowledge, only three case reports have described the occurrence of cerebellar hemorrhage after burr hole drainage for the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (SDH). We present the case of a patient with this rare postoperative complication of cerebellar hemorrhage after burr hole drainage of a chronic SDH. Although burr hole drainage for the treatment of chronic SDH is rare complication, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of cerebellar hemorrhage after supratentorial surgery, even with limited surgery such as burr hole drainage of a chronic SDH.","1841":null,"1842":"Although most authors regard contralateral pedicular fracture with unilateral spondylolysis as an unstable condition and recommend surgical management when immobilization fails in promoting bony healing of the fracture, few researchers have investigated the natural history of pedicle fracture or the causal relationship between symptoms and the fracture. In addition, there are no detailed guidelines that address the management of this disease. We report a rare case of contralateral pedicular fracture associated with unilateral spondylolysis at the L5 level which was successfully treated by rehabilitation with activity modification.","1843":"Abducens nerve palsy associated with spinal surgery is extremely rare. We report an extremely rare case of abducens nerve palsy after lumbar spinal fusion surgery with inadvertent dural tearing, which resolved spontaneously and completely. A 61-year-old previous healthy man presented with chronic lower back pain of 6 weeks duration and 2 weeks history of bilateral leg pain. He was diagnosed as having isthmic spondylolisthesis at L4-5 and L5-S1, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion was conducted on L4-5 and L5-S1. During the operation, inadvertent dural tearing occurred, which was repaired with a watertight dural closure. The patient recovered uneventfully from general anesthesia and his visual analogue pain scores decreased from 9 pre-op to 3 immediately after his operation. However, on day 2 he developed headache and nausea, which were severe when he was upright, but alleviated when supine. This led us to consider the possibility of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and thus, he was restricted to bed. After an interval of bed rest, the severe headache disappeared, but four days after surgery he experienced diplopia during right gaze, which was caused by right-side palsy of the abducens nerve. Under conservative treatment, the diplopia gradually disappeared and was completely resolved at 5 weeks post-op.","1844":"A 47-year-old man presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and right cerebellar hematoma was referred for evaluation. Cerebral angiography revealed a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysm associated with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Successful obliteration and complete removal of the aneurysm and AVM were obtained using transcortical approach under the guidance of neuronavigation system. The association of a peripheral AICA aneurysm and a cerebellar AVM by the same artery is unique. The reported cases of conventional surgery for this disease complex are not common and their results are variable. Less invasive surgery using image-guided neuronavigation system would be helpful and feasible for a peripheral aneurysm combining an AVM of the posterior fossa in selective cases.","1845":"Detachable balloon-based endovascular fistula occlusion is a widely accepted treatment for traumatic carotid cavernous fistulas (CCF). However, more recently coils have been used to obliterate the lesion, especially in case detachable balloon is not available. We failed balloon-assisted coil embolization for CCF because of large fistulas and herniation of coil loops into the parent artery. The authors describe our experiences of balloonexpandable graft-stents to treat CCF, and place emphasis on arterial wall reconstruction. Three traumatic CCF patients were treated using a graft-stent with\/without coils, and underwent angiographic follow-up to evaluate the patency of the internal carotid artery (ICA). In all cases, symptoms related to CCF regressed after stent deployment and did not recur during follow-up. Follow-up angiography revealed good patency of the ICA in all patients. Graft-stents should be considered as an alternative means of treating CCF and preserving the parent artery by arterial wall reconstruction especially in patients with a fistula that cannot be successfully occluded with detachable balloons or coils.","1846":"Accessory middle cerebral artery (MCA) is an infrequent vascular anomaly of the brain. Cerebral aneurysms associated with this anomalous artery are also very rare. To our knowledge, there have only been ten previous reports of an aneurysm associated with accessory MCA. The authors present two patients with accessory MCA-related aneurysms. A 38-year-old male and a 59-year-old female both presented with sudden-onset severe headache. In both patients, computed tomography (CT) scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subsequent angiogram demonstrated an accessory MCA arising from the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and a saccular aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) complex associated with an accessory MCA. Surgical clipping allowed for complete exclusion of the aneurysm from the arterial circulation. Based on our review of the ten cases of aneurysms associated with accessory MCA documented in the literature, we suggest that accessory MCA-related aneurysms can be classified according to whether the accessory MCA originates from the proximal A1 segment or from the ACoA complex. We also emphasize the importance of precise interpretation of preoperative angiograms and intraoperative precaution in determining the presence of this anomalous artery prior to temporary clip placement.","1847":"Early delayed radiation effects are known to occur within several months after completing radiotherapy for brain tumors. We present marked changes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that occurred one month after radiotherapy in a patient with a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which was eventually diagnosed as an early delayed radiation effect. Such an early development of dramatic MRI change has not been reported in patients treated with radiotherapy for pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas.","1848":"Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder, characterized by progressive occlusion at the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery. Incidence of the disease is high in East Asia and familial MMD accounts for about 15% of the disease. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, association of HLA class I or II alleles with MMD has been reported with conflicting results. We investigated whether there is a difference in HLA class II association between familial and non-familial forms of the disease. A total of 70 Korean children with MMD, including 16 familial cases (10 probands), and 207 healthy controls were studied. Among familial cases, only 10 probands were used for the HLA frequency analysis. High resolution HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridization and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism methods. The phenotype frequencies of HLA-DRB1(*)1302 (70.0%) and DQB1(*)0609 (40.0%) were significantly increased in familial MMD compared to both controls [vs. 15.5%, corrected p (p(c)) = 0.008, odds ratio (OR) = 12.76; vs. 4.3%, p(c) = 0.02, OR = 14.67] and non-familial MMD patients (vs. 14.8%, p(c) = 0.02, OR = 13.42; vs. 1.9%, p(c) = 0.02, OR = 35.33). The frequencies of DRB1 and DQB1 alleles in non-familial MMD patients were not significantly different from those in controls. Our findings suggest that the genetic polymorphism of HLA class II genes or other closely linked disease relevant gene(s) could be a genetic predisposing factor for familial MMD. ","1849":"Interferon-beta, (IFN-beta) has been used in the treatment of cancers. Inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) with celecoxib had a significantly suppressive effect on tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in a variety of tumors. The aim of this study was to elucidate the antiglioma effect of combined treatment with IFN-beta and celecoxib in U87 glioma model. The in vitro effects of IFN-beta (50-1,000 IU\/mL) and celecoxib (50-250 microM) alone or combination of both on the proliferation and apoptosis of U87 cells were tested using MTT assay, FACS analysis and DNA condensation. To determine the in vivo effect, nude mice bearing intracerebral U87 xenograft inoculation were treated with IFN-beta intraperitoneally (2x10(5) IU\/day for 15 days), celecoxib orally (5, 10 mg\/kg) or their combination. IFN-beta or celecoxib showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of U87 cells. When U87 cells were treated with IFN-beta and celecoxib combination, it seemed that IFN-beta interrupted the antiproliferative and apoptotic activity of celecoxib. No additive effect was observed on the survival of the tumor bearing mice by the combination of IFN-beta and celecoxib. These results suggest that IFN-beta seems to inhibit the antiglioma effect of celecoxib, therefore combination of IFN-beta and celecoxib may be undesirable in the treatment of glioma. ","1850":"Complex aneurysms such as fusiform and very small aneurysms (&lt; 3 mm) are challenging in neurovascular and endovascular surgery. Author reports follow-up results of 9 cases treated by sole stent technique with pertinent literature review. A retrospective study was made of 9 patients who were treated by sole stenting technique for cerebral aneurysm between January 2003 and January 2009. Two of them had fusiform aneurysm, 5 had very small aneurysm, and 2 had small saccular aneurysm. Five patients had ruptured aneurysms and four had unruptured aneurysms. Seven aneurysms were located in the internal carotid artery (ICA), 1 in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and 1 in the basilar artery. Follow-up cerebral angiography was performed at post-procedure 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Mean follow-up period is 30 months (ranged from 3 days to 30 months). Aneurysm size was decreased in 6 of 9 cases on follow-up images and was not changed in 3 cases. Although total occlusion was not seen, patients had stable neurological condition and angiographic result. The procedural complication occurred in 2 cases. One was coil migration and the other was suboptimal deployment of stent, and both were asymptomatic. Re-bleeding and thromboembolic complication had not been occurred. Sole stenting technique is relatively effective and safe as an alternative treatment for fusiform and very small aneurysms. ","1851":"Primary treatment of spinal metastasis has been external beam radiotherapy. Recent advance of technology enables radiosurgery to be extended to extracranial lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery using Cyberknife in spinal metastasis. From June, 2002 to December, 2007, 129 patients with 167 spinal metastases were treated with Cyberknife. Most of the patients (94%) presented with pain and nine patients suffered from motor deficits. Twelve patients were asymptomatic. Fifty-three patients (32%) had previous radiation therapy. Using Cyberknife, 16-39 Gy in 1-5 fractions were delivered to spinal metastatic lesions. Radiation dose was not different regarding the tumor pathology or tumor volume. After six months follow-up, patient evaluation was possible in 108 lesions. Among them, significant pain relief was seen in 98 lesions (91%). Radiological data were obtained in 83 lesions. The mass size was decreased or stable in 75 lesions and increased in eight lesions. Radiological control failure cases were hepatocellular carcinoma (5 cases), lung cancer (1 case), breast cancer (1 case) and renal cell carcinoma (1 case). Treatment-related radiation injury was not detected. Cyberknife radiosurgery is clinically effective and safe for spinal metastases. It is true even in previously irradiated patients. Compared to conventional radiation therapy, Cyberknife shows higher pain control rate and its treatment process is more convenient for patients. Thus, it can be regarded as a primary treatment modality for spinal metastases. ","1852":"Recently, motion preservation has come to the forefront of emerging technologies in spine surgery. This is the important background information of the emergence of cervical arthroplasty as an alternative to arthrodesis that offers the promise of restoring normal spinal movement and reduces a kinematic strain on adjacent segments. The study was designed to evaluate early surgical outcome and radiological effects of Bryan(R) cervical disc prosthesis. The authors retrospectively reviewed radiographic and clinical outcomes in 52 patients who received the Bryan(R) Cervical Disc prosthesis, for whom follow-up data were available. Static and dynamic radiographs were measured by computer to determine the angles formed by the endplates of the natural disc preoperatively, those formed by the shells of the implanted prosthesis, the angle of functional spine unit (FSU), and the C2-7 Cobb angle. The range of motion (ROM) was also determined radiographically, whereas clinical outcomes were assessed using Odom's criteria, visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and neck disability index (NDI). A total of 71 Bryan(R) disc were placed in 52 patients. A single-level procedure was performed in 36 patients, a two-level procedure in 13 patients, and a three-level procedure in 3. Radiographic and clinical assessments were made preoperatively. Mean follow-up duration was 29.2 months, ranging from 6 to 36 months. All of the patients were satisfied with the surgical results by Odom's criteria, and showed significant improvement by VAS and NDI score (p &lt; 0.05). The postoperative ROM of the implanted level was preserved without significant difference from preoperative ROM of the operated level (p &lt; 0.05). 97% of patients with a preoperative lordotic sagittal orientation of the FSU were able to maintain lordosis. The overall sagittal alignment of the cervical spine was preserved in 88.5% of cases at the final follow up. Interestingly, preoperatively kyphotic FSU resulted in lordotic FSU in 70% of patients during the late follow up, and preoperatively kyphotic overall cervical alignment resulted in lordosis in 66.6% of the patients postoperatively. Arthroplasty using the Bryan(R) disc seemed to be safe and provided encouraging clinical and radiologic outcome in our study. Although the early results are promising, this is a relatively new approach, therefore long-term follow up studies are required to prove its efficacy and its ability to prevent adjacent segment disease. ","1853":"Although gadolinium enhancement of compression fractures is well known, the enhancement pattern of the acute stage of a fracture is not completely understood. Here, we investigated the enhancement pattern of acute vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). We conducted a retrospective study of patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs admitted to hospital between January 2004 and December 2005. The demographic details, stage of the fracture, management data, and results were analyzed. There were nine men and 22 women, and the mean age was 71 years (range, 53-92 years). According to the onset of pain, patients were divided into the following four groups : Group I (less than 3 days), Group II (4-7 days), Group III (8-14 days), and Group IV (14-30 days). All patients had central low-signal intensity of the nonenhancing part of vertebral bodies on T1 images. Enhancing box sign (EBS) was seen 7 days of VCF development. After 7 days of onset (Groups III and IV), patch or Kummell's enhancements occurred. EBS has been statistically correlated with stage of compression fracture (Pearson's correlation = -0.774). However, EBS had no statistically significant correlation with prognosis in our study (Pearson's correlation = 0.059). EBS represents a characteristic sign 7 days of VCF development. ","1854":"Atlantal arch defects are rare. Few cadaveric and imaging studies have been reported on the variations of such anomalies. Our goal in this study was to examine the incidence and review the clinical implications of this anomaly. A retrospective review of 1,153 neck or cervical spine computed tomography (CT) scans was performed to identify patients with atlantal arch defects. Neck CT scans were performed in 650 patients and cervical spine CT scans were performed in 503 patients. Posterior arch defects of the atlas were grouped in accordance with the classification of Currarino et al. In patients exhibiting this anomaly, special attention was given to defining associated anomalies and neurological findings. Atlantal arch defects were found in 11 (11\/1153, 0.95%) of the 1,153 patients. The type A posterior arch defect was found in nine patients and the type B posterior arch defect was found in two patients. No type C, D, or E defects were observed. One patient with a type A posterior arch defect had an anterior atlantal-arch midline cleft (1\/1153, 0.087%). Associated cervical spine anomalies observed included one C(6-7) fusion and two atlantal assimilations. None of the reviewed patients had neurological deficits because of atlantal arch anomalies. Most congenital anomalies of the atlantal arch are found incidentally during investigation of neck mass, neck pain, radiculopathy, and after trauma. ","1855":"The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) and open lumbar microdiscectomy (OLM) for recurrent disc herniation. Fifty-four patients, who underwent surgery, either PELD (25 patients) or repeated OLM (29 patients), due to recurrent disc herniation at L4-5 level, were divided into two groups according to the surgical methods. Excluded were patients with sequestrated disc, calcified disc, severe neurological deficit, or instability. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Radiological variables were assessed using plain radiography and\/or magnetic resonance imaging. Mean operating time and hospital stay were significantly shorter in PELD group (45.8 minutes and 0.9 day, respectively) than OLM group (73.8 minutes and 3.8 days, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001). Complications occurred in 4% in PELD group and 10.3% in OLM group in the perioperative period. At a mean follow-up duration of 34.2 months, the mean improvements of back pain, leg pain, and functional improvement were 4.0, 5.5, and 40.9% for PELD group and 2.3, 5.1, and 45.0% for OLM group, respectively. Second recurrence occurred in 4% after PELD and 10.3% after OLM. Disc height did not change after PELD, but significantly decreased after OLM (p = 0.0001). Neither sagittal rotation angle nor volume of multifidus muscle changed significantly in both groups. Both PELD and repeated OLM showed favorable outcomes for recurrent disc herniation, but PELD had advantages in terms of shorter operating time, hospital stay, and disc height preservation.

We recently experienced a case of RCH in a 61-year-old man who showed mental deterioration after lumbar spinal surgery. There was dural tearing with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) loss during the surgery. Brain computed tomography scan revealed cerebellar hemorrhage, 3rd and 4th ventricular hemorrhage and pneumocephalus. He underwent suboccipital craniectomy and hematoma removal. The most important pathomechanism leading to RCH after spinal surgery has been known to be venous bleeding due to caudal sagging of cerebellum by rapid leak of large amount of CSF which seems to be related with this case. Dural repair and minimizing CSF loss after intraoperative dural tearing would be helpful to prevent postoperative RCH.","1859":"Dual origin and fenestration of the vertebral artery (VA) are very rare anomalies. Understanding of these variations, however, is important because they can be misdiagnosed as a VA dissection. A 42-year-old woman presented with motor weakness and sensory disturbance of the right upper extremity. Radiologic evaluations showed ectatic change in the right VA and an arteriovenous fistula between the right VA and the vertebral vein. We decided on endovascular occlusion of the proximal right VA and its fistulous portion. During the endovascular procedure, we had misunderstood the dual origin and fenestration of the VA as a dissection. Thus, failure to recognize these anomalies might result in unnecessary anticoagulation or therapeutic intervention. Clinicians should be alert to such VA variations when making a diagnosis and when planning any intervention or surgery involving the proximal VA.","1860":"Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) for carotid stenosis has been increasingly used as an alternative treatment in patients not eligible for surgery. Even though CAS can be performed relatively simply in many cases, various complications can occur. We report four cases of CAS using the Carotid Wallstent, which were complicated by delayed shortening of the stent, resulting in restenosis after successful CAS.","1861":"The authors report a case of recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after complete occlusion of an intracranial aneurysm. It is known that regrowth of an aneurysm after the complete clipping is a rare event. For detection of recurrence, however, it may be necessary to follow up with the patient regularly after the initial operation for intracranial aneurysms, because re-rupture of an aneurysm can cause a fatal result, and the cumulative risk of a recurrent SAH is thought to be not low over time.","1862":"A 31-year-old man presented with right hemiparesis, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small infarct at left basal ganglia. Digital subtraction angiography showed left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and severe stenosis of the ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA) with collateral cerebral circulation fed by ECAs. Based on the results of a functional evaluation of cerebral blood flow, we performed preventive ECA angioplasty and stenting for advanced ECA stenosis to ensure sufficient blood flow to the superficial temporal artery. Eight weeks later, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis was performed. His postoperative course was uneventful and no additional transient ischemic attacks have occurred. To our knowledge, this is the first report of preventive angioplasty and stenting for advanced narrowing of an ECA before STA-MCA anastomosis for ipsilateral ICA occlusion.","1863":"It is not uncommon for hemangiomas to occur in the calvarium, accounting for about 10% of the benign skull tumors. A 46-year-old man was presented with a palpable scalp mass on the left parietal region. Past medical history indicated that he had undergone cranioplasty 25 years prior due to a depressed skull fracture suffered from a traffic accident. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed mixed signal intensity mass on T1 -and T2-weighted images pushing a linear signal void lesion outward in the left parietal region. After total surgical removal along with cranioplasty, he was discharged without neurological deficits. Histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a cavernous hemangioma. A skull hemangioma occurring at the site of a cranioplasty has not yet been reported. Therefore, authors report this case in combination with a pertinent literature review.","1864":"A mouse model of spinal cord injury (SCI) could further increase our basic understanding of the mechanisms involved in injury and repair of the nervous system. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether methods used to produce and evaluate photochemical graded ischemic SCI in rats, could be successfully adapted to mice, in a reliable and reproducible manner. Thirty female imprinting control region mice (weighting 25-30 g, 8 weeks of age) were used in this study. Following intraperitoneal injection of Rose bengal, the translucent dorsal surface of the T8-T9 vertebral laminae of the mice were illuminated with a fiber optic bundle of a cold light source. The mice were divided into three groups; Group 1 (20 mg\/kg Rose bengal, 5 minutes illumination), Group 2 (20 mg\/kg Rose bengal, 10 minutes illumination), and Group 3 (40 mg\/kg Rose bengal, 10 minutes illumination). The locomotor function, according to the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, was assessed at three days after the injury and then once per week for four weeks. The animals were sacrificed at 28 days after the injury, and the histopathology of the lesions was assessed. The mice in group 1 had no hindlimb movement until seven days after the injury. Most mice had later recovery with movement in more than two joints at 28 days after injury. There was limited recovery of one joint, with only slight movement, for the mice in groups 2 and 3. The histopathology showed that the mice in group 1 had a cystic cavity involving the dorsal and partial involvement of the dorsolateral funiculi. A larger cavity, involving the dorsal, dorsolateral funiculi and the gray matter of the dorsal and ventral horns was found in group 2. In group 3, most of the spinal cord was destroyed and only a thin rim of tissue remained. The results of this study show that the photochemical graded ischemic SCI model, described in rats, can be successfully adapted to mice, in a reliable and reproducible manner. The functional deficits are correlated an increase in the irradiation time and, therefore, to the severity of the injury. The photothrombotic model of SCI, in mice with 20 mg\/kg Rose bengal for 5 minutes illumination, provides an effective model that could be used in future research. This photochemical model can be used for investigating secondary responses associated with traumatic SCI. ","1865":"Hyaluronidase (HAse), a degrading enzyme of hyaluronic acid (HA), is highly expressed in patients with malignant glioma. The purpose of this study was to verify whether HAse is related to the invasion of glioma cells. We also investigated if glioma cells with higher mobility in 2-dimensioal (2-D) method have also higher mobility at 3-dimensional (3-D) environment. Malignant glioma cell lines (U87MG, U251MG, U343MG-A, and U373MG) were used, and their HAse expressions were evaluated by HA zymography. The migration ability was evaluated by simple scratch technique. The invasiveness of each cell lines was evaluated by Matrigel invasion assay and HA hydrogel invasion assay. In HA hydrogel invasion assay, colonies larger than 150 microm were regarded as positive ones and counted. Statistical analysis of migration ability and invasion properties of each cell lines was performed using t-test. In scratch test to examine migration ability of each cell lines, U87MG cells were most motile than others, and U343MG-A least motile. The HAse was expressed in U251MG and U343MG-A cell lines. However, U87MG and U373MG cell lines did not express HAse activity. In Matrigel invasion assay, the cell lines expressing HAse (U251MG and U343MG-A) were more invasive in the presence of HA than HAse deficient cell lines (U87MG and U373MG). In HA hydrogel invasion assay, the HAse-expressing cell lines formed colonies more invasively than HAse-deficient ones. Malignant Glioma cells expressing HAse were more invasive than HAse-deficient ones in 3-dimensional environment. Therefore, it might be suggested that invasion of malignant gliomas is suppressed by inhibition of HAse expression or HA secretion. Additionally, the ability of 2-D migration and 3-D invasion might not be always coincident to each other in malignant glioma cells. ","1866":"The adolescent presentation of tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is well-recognized, but continues to pose significant diagnostic and management controversies. The authors conducted a retrospective study of clinical outcomes after surgical intervention in 24 school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with TCS. All 83 patients with a lipomyelomeningocele (LMMC) underwent untethering surgery for caudal cord tethering between 1987 and 2007. The clinical charts and follow-up data were reviewed. Of these patients, 24 school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with TCS were studied with respect to the clinical, radiologic, pathologic features, and surgical outcomes. Untethering procedures were performed in 24 patients (age range, 7-25 years) for TCS of various origins (lipoma, lipomyelomeningocele, and tight filum terminale). Specific circumstances involving additional tugging of the already tight conus, and direct trauma to the back precipitated the onset of symptom in 50% of the patients. Diffuse and non-dermatomal leg pain, often referred to the anorectal region, was the most common presenting symptom. Progressive sensorimotor deficits in the lower extremities, as well as bladder and bowel dysfunction, were also common findings, but progressive foot and spinal deformities were noted less frequently. The most common tethered lesions were intradural lipomas, thickened filum and fibrous band adhesions into the placode sac. The surgical outcome was gratifying in relation to pain and motor weakness, but disappointing with respect to resolution of bowel and bladder dysfunction. Of the 24 patients with TCS, pre-operative deficits improved after surgery in 14 (58.3%), remained stable in 8 (33.4%), and worsened in 2 (8.3%). The pathologic lesions of tethered cord syndrome in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults, are mostly intradural lipomas and tight filum. It is suggested that the degree of cord traction results in neurologic dysfunction in late life due to abnormal tension, aggravated by trauma or repeated tugging of the conus during exercise. Early diagnosis and adequate surgical release might be the keys to the successful outcome in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with TCS. ","1867":"The purpose of this study was to assess memory dysfunction in patients with mild and moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) with and without frontal lobe injury (FLI). The subjects were 110 TBI patients, who had recovered from the acute clinical phase, and comprised 20 (18.2%) mild TBI (MTBI) patients with FLI, 16 (14.5%) MTBI patients without FLI, 51 (46.4%) moderate TBI (MOTBI) patients with FLI and 23 (20.9%) MTBI patients without FLI. All patients were administrated the Korean version of the Memory Assessment Scale (K-MAS). Almost all the Summary Scale scores on the K-MAS failed to show any differences between TBI patients with and without FLI, but differences did emerge by types at severities. TBI patients with FLI showed higher Global Memory ability than TBI patients without FLI if their TBI was only mild, but when their TBI was more severe, this finding was reversed, and TBI patients with FLI showed lower Verbal and Global Memory abilities than TBI patients without FLI. Different kinds of assessment tools are needed for the measurement of memory abilities in TBI patients with FLI, and that the selection of the appropriate tool depends on the severity of the TBI.

The patients' initial computerized tomography (CT) findings were reviewed and clinical findings that were associated with intracranial lesions were analyzed. GCS score, loss of consciousness (LOC), age and skull fracture were identified as independent risk factors for intracranial lesions. Based on the data analysed in this study, MHI patients were divided into four subgroups : very low risk MHI patients are those with a GCS score of 15 and without a history of LOC or headache; low risk MHI patients have a GCS score of 15 and with LOC and\/or headache; medium risk MHI patients are those with a GCS score of 15 and with a skull fracture, neurological deficits or with one or more of the risk factors; high risk MHI patients are those with a GCS score of 15 with abnormal CT findings and GCS score of 14 and 13. A more detailed classification of MHI based on brain CT scan findings and clinical risk factors can potentially improve patient diagnosis.

Sagittal (ADS) and coronal (ADC) angles for adjacent segments were measured from two disc spaces above lesions at the upper margins, to two disc spaces below lesions at the lower margins. Sagittal (TLS) and coronal (TLC) angles of the thoracolumbar junction were measured from the lower margin of the 11th thoracic vertebra body to the upper margin of the 2nd lumbar vertebra body on plane radiographs. Adjacent segment disc heights and disc signal changes were determined using simple spinal examinations and by magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical outcome indices were determined using a visual analog scale. The three groups demonstrated statistically significant differences in terms of angle changes by ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05). All angles in group I showed significantly smaller angles changes than in groups II and III by Turkey's multiple comparison analysis. Coronal Cobb's angles of the thoracolumbar spine (TLC) were not significantly different in the three groups. Postoperative sagittal balance is expected to change in the adjacent and thoracolumbar areas after thoracic spine fusion. However, its prevalence seems to be higher when the thoracolumbar spine is included in instrumented fusion.

BioFlex System is a flexible rod system which has been used to preserve motion at the area of implantation. There has not been a scientific study showing how much motion is preserved after implantation. A total of 12 consecutive patients underwent posterior dynamic stabilization using the BioFlex System. Six patients were treated using a L3-4-5 construct and other six patients using a L4-5-S1 construct. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 33 months and standing neutral lateral, extension, flexion and posteroanterior (PA) radiographs were obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and at more than 12 months postoperatively. Range of motion (ROM), whole lumbar lordosis, and ROMs of motion segments from L2 to S1 were determined. Patients with a L3-4-5 construct demonstrated a decrease in mean ROM for whole lumbar decreased from 40.08 to 30.77. Mean ROM for L3-4 (6.12 to 2.20) and L4-5 (6.55 to 1.67) also decreased after one year. Patients with a L4-5-S1 construct demonstrated L4-5 (8.75 to 2.70) and L5-S1 (9.97 to 3.25) decrease of mean ROM at one year postoperatively. Lumbar lordosis was preserved at both L3-4-5 and L4-5-S1 constructs. Clinical results showed significant improvements in both study groups. The present study provides preliminary information regarding the BioFlex motion preservation system. We conclude that the BioFlex System preserves functional motion to some degree at instrumented levels. However, although total lumbar lordosis was preserved, ROMs at implantation segments were lower than preoperative values. ","1872":"The present study analyzed the risk factors, prevalence and clinical results following revision surgery for adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) in patients who had undergone lumbar fusion. Over an 8-year period, we performed posterior lumbar fusion in 81 patients. Patients were followed a minimum of 2 years (mean 5.5 years). During that time, 9 patients required revision surgery due to ASD development. Four patients underwent autogenous posterolateral arthrodesis and extended transpedicle screw fixation, 4 patients underwent decompressive laminectomy and interspinous device implantation, and 1 patient underwent simple decompression. Of the 9 of patients with clinical ASD, 33.3% (3 of 9) of patients did not have radiographic ASD on plain radiographs. Following revision surgery, the clinical results were excellent or good in 8 patients (88.9%). Age &gt; 50 years at primary surgery was a significant risk factor for ASD development, while number of fusion levels, initial diagnosis and type of fusion were not. The incidence of ASD development after lumbar surgery was 11.1% (9 of 81) in this study. Age greater than 50 was the statistically significant risk factor for ASD development. Similar successful clinical outcomes were observed after extended fusion with wide decompression or after interspinous device implantation. Given the latter procedure is less invasive, the findings suggest it may be considered a treatment alternative in selected cases but it needs further study.

Of these patients, 3 patients had traumatic brain injury, 3 cerebral infarction, and one subarachnoid hemorrhage due to aneurysmal rupture. In situ floating resin cranioplasty for cerebral decompression can reduce complications related to the absence of a bone flap and allow reconstruction by secondary cranioplasty without difficulty. Furthermore, it provides cerebral protection and selectively eliminates the need for secondary cranioplasty in elderly patients or patients who have experienced unfavorable outcome.","1874":"Since the start of the antibiotic era, syphilis has become rare. However, in recent times, it has tended to be prevalent concomitantly with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and coinfection in North America and Europe. Now, such cases are expected to increase in elsewhere including Korea. A 40-year-old male patient visited hospital complaining of a headache for about one month. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, showed leptomeninged enhancing mass with edema an right porisylvian region, which was suspected to be glioma. Patient underwent a blood test and was diagnosed with syphilis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Partial cortical and subcortical resection were performed after small craniotomy. The dura was thick, adhered to the brain cortex, and was accompanied by hyperemic change of the cortex. The pathologic diagnosis was meningovascular syphilis (MS) in HIV infection. After the operation, the patient was treated with aqueous penicillin G. Thereafter, he had no neurological deficit except intermittent headache. At first, this case was suspected to be glioma, but it was eventually diagnosed as MS in HIV coinfection. At this point the case was judged to be worth reporting.","1875":"There are several mechanisms for the dissemination of lipid material from a mature teratoma into the subarachnoid space or ventricles, including iatrogenic or traumatic rupture, but spontaneous rupture of a mature teratoma is rare.

However, at surgery, there was no definite evidence of rupture into the perimedullary cerebrospinal fluid. We postulate that the central canal could be a migration pathway for ruptured material into the brain.","1876":"A case of spinal intraosseous schwannoma (SIS) in the lumbar vertebra is reported. Clinical and radiologic characteristics of 16 reported cases of SIS were reviewed. SIS can be a rare differential diagnosis for intraosseous tumors.","1877":"In this study, the authors assessed the ability of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMDMSCs), in the presence of a growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4) and hydroxyapatite, to act as a scaffold for posterolateral spinal fusion in a rat model. Using a rat posterolateral spine fusion model, the experimental study comprised 3 groups. Group 1 was composed of 6 animals that were implanted with 0.08 gram hydroxyapatite only. Group 2 was composed of 6 animals that were implanted with 0.08 gram hydroxyapatite containing 1 x 10(6)\/ 60 microL rat of BMDMSCs. Group 3 was composed of 6 animals that were implanted with 0.08 gram hydroxyapatite containing 1 x 10(6)\/ 60 microL of rat BMDMSCs and FGF-4 1 microG to induce the bony differentiation of the BMDMSCs. Rats were assessed using radiographs obtained at 4, 6, and 8 weeks postoperatively. After sacrifice, spines were explanted and assessed by manual palpation, high-resolution microcomputerized tomography, and histological analysis. Radiographic, high-resolution microcomputerized tomographic, and manual palpation revealed spinal fusion in five rats (83%) in Group 2 at 8 weeks. However, in Group 1, three (60%) rats developed fusion at L4-L5 by radiography and two (40%) by manual palpation in radiographic examination. In addition, in Group 3, bone fusion was observed in only 50% of rats by manual palpation and radiographic examination at this time. The present study demonstrates that 0.08 gram of hydroxyapatite with 1 x 10(6)\/ 60 microL rat of BMDMSCs induced bone fusion. FGF-4, added to differentiate primitive 1 x 10(6)\/ 60 microL rat of BMDMSCs did not induce fusion. Based on histologic data, FGF-4 appears to induce fibrotic change rather than differentiation to bone by 1 x 10(6)\/ 60 microL rat of BMDMSCs. ","1878":"Triptolide (TP) has been reported to suppress the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), of which main function is to inactivate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1\/2 (ERK-1\/2), the p38 MAPK and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1\/2 (JNK-1\/2), and to exert antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. However, the mechanisms underlying antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of TP are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the down-regulation of MKP-1 expression by TP would account for antiproliferative activity of TP in immortalized HT22 hippocampal cells. MKP-1 expression and MAPK phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blot. Cell proliferation was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MKP-1, vanadate (a phosphatase inhibitor), U0126 (a specific inhibitor for ERK-1\/2), SB203580 (a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK), and SP600125 (a specific inhibitor for JNK-1\/2) were employed to evaluate a possible mechanism of antiproliferative action of TP. At its non-cytotoxic dose, TP suppressed MKP-1 expression, reduced cell growth, and induced persistent ERK-1\/2 activation. Similar growth inhibition and ERK-1\/2 activation were observed when MKP-1 expression was blocked by MKP-1 siRNA and its activity was inhibited by vanadate. The antiproliferative effects of TP, MKP-1 siRNA, and vanadate were significantly abolished by U0126, but not by SB203580 or SP600125. Our findings suggest that TP inhibits the growth of immortalized HT22 hippocampal cells via persistent ERK-1\/2 activation by suppressing MKP-1 expression. Additionally, this study provides evidence supporting that MKP-1 may play an important role in regulation of neuronal cell growth. ","1879":"We analyzed the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter in World Health Organization (WHO) grade III gliomas in association with other molecular markers to evaluate their prevalence. The samples of a total of 36 newly WHO grade III glioma patients including 19 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AO), 7 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (AOA), and 10 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) were analyzed. The methylation status of the MGMT gene promoter was confirmed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The 1p\/19q chromosomal deletion status and EGFR amplification were assessed by Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization. MGMT, EGFR, EGFRvIII, and p53 expression were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The MGMT gene promoter was methylated in 32 (88.9%) and unmethylated in 4 (11.2%). Among them, all of the AO and AOA had methylated MGMT gene promoter without exception. Significant associations between MGMT gene promoter hypermethylation and 1p\/19q deletion was observed (p = 0.003). Other molecular markers failed to show significant associations between MGMT gene promoter statuses. There was extensive epigenetic silencing of MGMT gene in high grade gliomas with oligodendroglial component. Together with frequent 1p\/19q co-deletion in oligodendroglial tumors, this may add plausible explanations supporting the relative favorable prognosis in oligodendroglial tumors compared with pure astrocytic tumors. ","1880":"In order to establish the role of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) in large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), we analyzed clinical characteristics, radiological features, and radiosurgical outcomes. Between March 1992 and March 2005, 28 of 33 patients with large AVMs (&gt; 10 cm(3) in nidus-volume) who were treated with GKS underwent single session radiosurgery (RS), and the other 5 patients underwent staged volumetric RS. Retrospectively collected data were available in 23 cases. We analyzed treatment outcomes in each subdivided groups and according to the AVM sizes. We compared the estimated volume, defined as primarily estimated nidus volume using MR images, with real target volume after excluding draining veins and feeding arteries embedded into the nidus. Regarding those patients who underwent single session RS, 44.4% (8\/18) had complete obliteration; regarding staged volumetric RS, the obliteration rate was 40% (2\/5). The complete obliteration rate was 60% (6\/10) in the smaller nidus group (10-15 cm(3) size), and 25% (2\/8) in the larger nidus group (over 15 cm(3) size). One case of cerebral edema and two cases (8.7%) of hemorrhage were seen during the latent period. The mean real target volume for 18 single sessions of RS was 17.1 cm(3) (10.1-38.4 cm(3)), in contrast with the mean estimated volume of 20.9 cm(3) (12.0-45.0 cm(3)). The radiosurgical treatment outcomes of large AVMs are generally poor. However, we presume that the recent development in planning software and imaging devices aid more accurate measurement of the nidus volume, therefore improving the treatment outcome. ","1881":"There is no definite adjustment protocol for patients shunted with programmable valves. Therefore, we attempted to find an appropriate method to adjust the valve, initial valve-opening pressure, adjustment scale, adjustment time interval, and final valve-opening pressure of a programmable valve. Seventy patients with hydrocephalus of various etiologies were shunted with programmable shunting devices (Micro Valve with RICKHAM(R) Reservoir). The most common initial diseases were subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and head trauma. Sixty-six patients had a communicating type of hydrocephalus, and 4 had an obstructive type of hydrocephalus. Fifty-one patients had normal pressure-type hydrocephalus and 19 patients had high pressure-type hydrocephalus. We set the initial valve pressure to 10-30 mmH(2)O, which is lower than the preoperative lumbar tapping pressure or the intraoperative ventricular tapping pressure, conducted brain computerized tomographic (CT) scans every 2 to 3 weeks, correlated results with clinical symptoms, and reset valve-opening pressures. Initial valve-opening pressures varied from 30 to 180 mmH(2)O (mean, 102 +\/- 27.5 mmH(2)O). In high pressure-type hydrocephalus patients, we have set the initial valve-opening pressure from 100 to 180 mmH(2)O. We decreased the valve-opening pressure 20-30 mmH(2)O at every 2- or 3-week interval, until hydrocephalus-related symptoms improved and the size of the ventricle was normalized. There were 154 adjustments in 81 operations (mean, 1.9 times). In 19 high pressure-type patients, final valve-opening pressures were 30-160 mmH(2)O, and 16 (84%) patients' symptoms had nearly improved completely. However, in 51 normal pressure-type patients, only 31 (61%) had improved. Surprisingly, in 22 of the 31 normal pressure-type improved patients, final valve-opening pressures were 30 mmH(2)O (16 patients) and 40 mmH(2)O (6 patients). Furthermore, when final valve-opening pressures were adjusted to 30 mmH(2)O, 14 patients symptom was improved just at the point. There were 18 (22%) major complications : 7 subdural hygroma, 6 shunt obstructions, and 5 shunt infections. In normal pressure-type hydrocephalus, most patients improved when the final valve-opening pressure was 30 mmH(2)O. We suggest that all normal pressure-type hydrocephalus patients be shunted with programmable valves, and their initial valve-opening pressures set to 10-30 mmH(2)O below their preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressures. If final valve-opening pressures are lowered in 20 or 30 mmH(2)O scale at 2- or 3-week intervals, reaching a final pressure of 30 mmH(2)O, we believe that there is a low risk of overdrainage syndromes. ","1882":"Susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) is a sensitive magnetic resonance image (MRI) technique to detect cerebral microbleeds (MBLs), which would not be detected by conventional MRI. We performed SWI to detect MBLs and investigated its usefulness in the evaluation of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) patients. From December 2006 to June 2007, twenty-one MTBI patients without any parenchymal hemorrhage on conventional MRI were selected. Forty-two patients without trauma were selected for control group. According to the presence of MBLs, we divided the MTBI group into MBLs positive [SWI (+)] and negative [SWI (-)] group. Regional distribution of MBLs and clinical factors were compared between groups. Fifty-one MBLs appeared in 16 patients of SWI (+) group and 16 MBLs in 10 patients of control group [control (+)], respectively. In SWI (+) group, MBLs were located more frequently in white matters than in deep nucleus different from the control (+) group (p &lt; 0.05). Nine patients (56.3%) of SWI (+) group had various neurological deficits (disorientation in 4, visual field defect in 2, hearing difficulty in 2 and Parkinson syndrome in 1). Initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\/mean Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were 13.9 +\/- 1.5 \/ 4.7 +\/- 0.8 and 15.0 +\/- 0.0 \/ 5.0 +\/- 0.0 in SWI (+) and SWI (-) groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Traumatic cerebral MBLs showed characteristic regional distribution, and seemed to have an importance on the initial neurological status and the prognosis. SWI is useful for detection of traumatic cerebral MBLs, and can provide etiologic evidences for some post-traumatic neurologic deficits which were unexplainable with conventional MRI. ","1883":"Several treatment options have proven effective for metastatic brain tumors, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery. Tumors with cystic components, however, are difficult to treat using a single method. We retrospectively assessed the outcome and efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cystic brain metastases after stereotactic aspiration of cystic components to decrease the tumor volume. The study population consisted of 24 patients (13 males, 11 females; mean age, 58.3 years) with cystic metastatic brain tumors treated from January 2002 to August 2008. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common primary origin. After Leksell stereotactic frame was positioned on each patient, magnetic resonance images (MRI)-guided stereotactic cyst aspiration and GKRS were performed (mean prescription dose : 20.2 Gy). After treatment, patients were evaluated by MRI every 3 or 4 months. After treatment, 13 patients (54.2%) demonstrated tumor control, 5 patients (20.8%) showed local tumor progression, and 6 patients (25.0%) showed remote progression. Mean follow-up duration was 13.1 months. During this period, 10 patients (41.7%) died, but only 1 patient (4.2%) died from brain metastases. The overall median survival after these procedures was 17.8 months. These results support the usefulness of GKRS after stereotactic cyst aspiration in patients with large cystic brain metastases. This method is especially effective for the patients whose general condition is very poor for general anesthesia and those with metastatic brain tumors located in eloquent areas. ","1884":"The definition of empty sella syndrome is 'an anatomical entity in which the pituitary fossa is partially or completely filled with cerebrospinal fluid, while the pituitary gland is compressed against the posterior rim of the fossa'. Reports of this entities relating to the brain tumors not situated in the pituitary fossa, have rarely been reported. In order to analyze the incidence and relationship of empty sella in patients having brain tumors, the authors reviewed preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 72 patients with brain tumor regardless of pathology except the pituitary tumors. The patients were operated in single institute by one surgeon. There were 25 males and 47 females and mean patient age was 53 years old (range from 5 years to 84 years). Tumor volume was ranged from 2 cc to 238 cc. The overall incidence of empty sella was positive in 57\/72 cases (79.2%). Sorted by the pathology, empty sella was highest in meningioma (88.9%, p = 0.042). The empty sella was correlated with patient's increasing age (p = 0.003) and increasing tumor volume (p = 0.016). Careful review of brain MRI with periodic follow up is necessary for the detection of secondary empty sella in patients with brain tumors. In patients with confirmed empty sella, follow up is mandatory for the management of hypopituitarism, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, visual disturbance and increased intracranial pressure.

We reviewed patients with combined HDS and demonstrated their demographic characteristics by comparing them with those of patients with a single HDS. Between October 1994 and February 2006, we retrospectively studied a series of 1,720 patients who suffered from HDS and found 51 patients with combined HDSs. We analyzed several independent variables in order to evaluate the prevalence and etiologic factors of combined HDS. The combined HDS group accounted for 51 of 1,720 (2.97%) patients with HDS; 27 cases of bilateral HFS, 10 cases of bilateral TN and 14 cases of HFS with TN. Their mean age was 52.1 years (range, 26-79 years). There were 5 men and 46 women. Seven patients had synchronous and 44 patients metachronous onset of HDSs. By comparison of combined and single HDS groups, we found that age and hypertension were closely associated with the prevalence of combined HDS (p &lt; 0.05). This study revealed that combined HDS was very rare. Hypertension and age might be the most important causative factors to evoke combined HDS.

The mean duration of the CD was 5.8 +\/- 3.4 years. The mean age at time of surgery was 54.2 +\/- 10.2 years. Patients were evaluated with the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) and relief scale using patient self-reporting. The TWSTRS total scores improved by 64.5%, 65.5%, 75.8%, and 76.0% at 3, 6, 12 months, and at the last available follow-up after surgery, respectively. Statistically significant improvements in the TWSTRS scores were observed 3 months after surgery (p = 0.028) with gradual improvement up to 12 months after surgery, thereafter, the improvement was sustained. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the scores at 3 and 12 months. Subjective improvement reported averaged 81.7 +\/- 6.8% at last follow-up. Mild dysarthria, the most frequent adverse event, occurred in 3 patients. Our results show that the bilateral Gpi-DBS can offer a significant therapeutic effect from 3 months postoperatively in patients with primary CD with phasic type, without significant side effects.

To approach compression sites, we described and evaluated the efficacy of the infranuchal infrafloccular (INIF) approach. A retrospective review of 31 consecutive patients who underwent microvascular decompression (MVD) through INIF with a minimum follow-up of 1 year was performed. Along the intracranial facial nerve, we classified the compression sites into the transitional zone (TRZ), the central nervous system (CNS) segment and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) segment. The INIF approach was used to inspect the CNS segment and the TRZ. Subdural patch graft technique was used in order to achieve watertight dural closure. The cranioplasty was performed using polymethylmethacrylate. The outcome and procedure-related morbidities were evaluated. Twenty-nine patients (93%) showed complete disappearance of spasm. In two patients, the spasm was resolved gradually in 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Late recurrence was noted in one patient (3%). The TRZ has been identified as the only compression site in 19 cases (61.3%), both the TRZ and CNS segment in 11 (35.5%) and the CNS segment only in 1 (3.2%). There was no patient having a compressing vessel in the PNS segment. Infection as a result of cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in one patient (3%). Delayed transient facial weakness occurred in one patient. The TRZ and the CNS segment were more vulnerable area to the compression of vessels. We suggest that surgical avenue with the INIF approach provides early identification of this area.c.

Thus, the present study was undertaken to analyze clinical parameters critical for diagnosis of discogenic pain and to correlate imaging findings with intradiscal pressures and pain responses in patients with APCD-positive discs. Twenty-three patients who showed APCD-positive discs were selected for analysis. CT discogram findings and the degrees of nuclear degeneration seen on MRI were analyzed in comparison to changes of intradiscal pressure that provoked pain responses; and clinical pain patterns and dynamic factors were evaluated in relation to pain provocation. Low back pain (LBP), usually centralized, with diffuse leg pain was the most frequently reported pattern of pain in these patients. Overall, LBP was most commonly induced by sitting posture, however, standing was highly correlated with L5\/S1 disc lesions (p &lt; 0.01). MRI abnormalities were statistically correlated with grading of CT discogram results (p &lt; 0.05); with most pain response observed in CT discogram Grades 3 and 4. Pain-provoking pressure was not statistically correlated with MRI grading. However, it was higher in Grade 3 than Grade 4. APCD-positive discs were demonstrated in patients reporting centralized low back pain with diffuse leg pain, aggravated by sitting and standing. MRI was helpful to assess the degree of nuclear degeneration, yet it could not guarantee exact localization of the painful discs. APCD was considered to be more useful than conventional discography for diagnosis of discogenic pain. ","1889":"The purpose of this study was to establish new fusion criteria to complement existing Brantigan-Steffee fusion criteria. The primary purpose of intervertebral cage placement is to create a proper biomechanical environment through successful fusion. The existence of a traction spur is an essential predictable radiologic factor which shows that there is instability of a fusion segment. We studied the relationship between the existence of a traction spur and fusion after a posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) procedure. This study was conducted using retrospective radiological findings from patients who underwent a PLIF procedure with the use of a cage without posterior fixation between 1993 and 1997 at a single institution. We enrolled 183 patients who were followed for a minimum of five years after the procedure, and used the Brantigan-Steffee classification to confirm the fusion. These criteria include a denser and more mature bone fusion area than originally achieved during surgery, no interspace between the cage and the vertebral body, and mature bony trabeculae bridging the fusion area. We also confirmed the existence of traction spurs on fusion segments and non-fusion segments. The PLIF procedure was done on a total of 251 segments in 183 patients (71 men and 112 women). The average follow-up period was 80.4 +\/- 12.7 months. The mean age at the time of surgery was 48.3 +\/- 11.3 years (range, 25 to 84 years). Among the 251 segments, 213 segments (84.9%) were fused after five years. The remaining 38 segments (15.1%) were not fused. An analysis of the 38 segments that were not fused found traction spur formation in 20 of those segments (52.6%). No segments had traction spur formation with fusion. A new parameter should be added to the fusion criteria. These criteria should be referred to as 'no traction spur formation' and should be used to confirm fusion after a PLIF procedure.

This study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of PLIF with cages in chronic degenerative disc disease with Modic degeneration (changes of vertebral end plate). A total of 597 patients underwent a PLIF with threaded fusion cages (TFC) from 1993 to 2000. Three-hundred-fifty-one patients, who could be followed for more than 3 years, were enrolled in this study. Patients were grouped into 4 categories according to Modic classification (no degeneration : 259, type 1 : 26, type 2 : 55, type 3 : 11). Clinical and radiographic data were evaluated retrospectively. The clinical success rate according to the Prolo's functional and economic outcome scale was 86% in patients without degeneration and 83% in patients with Modic degeneration. The clinical outcomes in each group were 88% in type 1, 84% in type 2, and 73% in type 3. The bony fusion rate was 97% in patients without degeneration and 83% in patients with Modic degeneration. The bony fusion rate in each group was 81% in type 1, 84% in type 2, and 55% in type 3. The clinical success and fusion rates were significantly lower in patients with type 3 degeneration. The PLIF with TFC has been found to be an effective procedure for lumbar spine fusion. But, the clinical outcome and bony fusion rates were significantly low in the patients with Modic type 3.

The aim of our study was to analyze radiologic parameters of the pedicle morphometry from T1 to T8 using computed tomographic myelography (CTM) in Korean population. For evaluation of the thoracic pedicle morphometry, the authors prospectively analyzed a consecutive series of 26 patients with stable thoracic spines. With the consent of patients, thoracic CTM were performed, from T1 to T8. We calculated the transverse outer diameters and the transverse angles of the pedicle, distance from the cord to the inner cortical wall of the pedicle, and distance from the cord to the dura. Transverse outer pedicle diameter was widest at T1 (7.66 +\/- 2.14 mm) and narrowest at T4 (4.38 +\/- 1.55 mm). Transverse pedicle angle was widest at T1 (30.2 +\/- 12.0 degrees ) and it became less than 9.0 degrees below T6 level. Theoretical safety zone of the medial perforation of the pedicle screw, namely, distance from the cord to inner cortical wall of the pedicle was more than 4.5 mm. Based on this study, we suggest that the current pedicle screw system is not always suitable for Korean patients.

The types of herniation were as follows : extraforaminal, 17 patients; foraminal, 21 patients; high grade migration, 59 patients; and high canal compromise, 56 patients. To overcome the difficulties in endoscopic treatment, the anatomic structures were analyzed by 3D reconstruction CT and the high grade disc was extracted using a semi-rigid flexible curved probe and a transforaminal suprapedicular approach. The mean follow-up was 18.3 months. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) of the patients prior to surgery was 9.48, and the mean postoperative VAS was 1.63. According to Macnab's criteria, 145 patients had excellent and good results, and thus satisfactory results were obtained in 94.77% cases. In a posterolateral endoscopic lumbar discectomy, the difficult, non-contained disc is considered to be the most important factor impeding the success of surgery.

Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in this study and 40 segments were involved. All patients were performed anterior cervical interbody fusion using HA spacer and plating system. Indications for surgery were radiculopathy caused by soft-disc herniation or spondylosis in 18 patients, spondylotic myelopathy in 1 patient, and spinal trauma in 10 patients. Cervical spine radiographs were obtained on postoperative 1day, 1week, and then at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months in all patients to evaluate intervertebral disc height, and the degrees of lordosis. Cervical computed tomography was done at postoperative 12 month in all patients to confirm the fusion status. The mean period of clinical follow-up was 17 months. Complete interbody fusion was achieved in 100% of patients. Preoperative kyphotic deformities were corrected in all cases after surgery. Intervertebral disc height was well maintained during follow up period. There were no cases of graft extrusion, graft deterioration and graft fracture. HA spacer is very efficient in achieving cervical fusion, maintaining intervertebral disc height, and restoring lordosis. When combined with the placement of a cervical plate, immediate stability can be achieved and graft related complication can be prevented. ","1895":"Clinical and radiological results of posterior dynamic stabilization using interspinous U (ISU, Coflex, Paradigm Spine Inc.(R), NY, USA) were analyzed in comparison with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). A retrospective study was conducted for a consecutive series of 61 patients with degenerative LSS between May 2003 and December 2005. We included only the patients completed minimum 24 months follow up evaluation. Among them, 30 patients were treated with implantation of ISU after decompressive laminectomy (Group ISU) and 31 patients were treated with wide decompressive laminectomy and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF; Group PLIF). We evaluated visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for clinical outcomes (VAS, ODI), disc height ratio disc height (DH), disc height\/vertebral body length x100), static vertebral slip (VS) and depth of maximal radiolucent gap between ISU and spinous process) in preoperative, immediate postoperative and last follow up. The mean age of group ISU (66.2 +\/- 6.7 years) was 6.2 years older than the mean age of group PLIF (60.4 +\/- 8.1 years; p = 0.003 ). In both groups, clinical measures improved significantly than preoperative values (p &lt; 0.001). Operation time and blood loss was significantly shorter and lower in group ISU than group PLIF (p &lt; 0.001). In group ISU, the DH increased transiently in immediate postoperative period (15.7 +\/- 4.5% --&gt; 18.6 +\/- 5.9%), however decreased significantly in last follow up (13.8 +\/- 6.6%, p = 0.027). Vertebral slip (VS) of spondylolisthesis in group ISU increased during postoperative follow-up (2.3 +\/- 3.3 --&gt; 8.7 +\/- 6.2, p = 0.040). Meanwhile, the postoperatively improved DH and VS was maintained in group PLIF in last follow up. According to our result, implantation of ISU after decompressive laminectomy in degenerative LSS is less invasive and provides similar clinical outcome in comparison with the instrumented fusion. However, the device has only transient effect on the postoperative restoration of disc height and reduction of slip in spondylolisthesis. Therefore, in the biomechanical standpoint, it is hard to expect that use of Interspinous U in decompressive laminectomy for degenerative LSS had long term beneficial effect. ","1896":"This study examined the change of range of motion (ROM) at the segments within the dynamic posterior stabilization, segments above and below the system, the clinical course and analyzed the factors influencing them. This study included a consecutive 27 patients who underwent one-level to three-level dynamic stabilization with Bioflex system at our institute. All of these patients with degenerative disc disease underwent decompressive laminectomy with\/without discectomy and dynamic stabilization with Bioflex system at the laminectomy level without fusion. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for back and leg pain, whole lumbar lordosis (from L1 to S1), ROMs from preoperative, immediate postoperative, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 months at whole lumbar (from L1 to S1), each instrumented levels, and one segment above and below this instrumentation were evaluated. VAS scores for leg and back pain decreased significantly throughout the whole study period. Whole lumbar lordosis remained within preoperative range, ROM of whole lumbar and instrumented levels showed a significant decrease. ROM of one level upper and lower to the instrumentation increased, but statistically invalid. There were also 5 cases of complications related with the fixation system. Bioflex posterior dynamic stabilization system supports operation-induced unstable, destroyed segments and assists in physiological motion and stabilization at the instrumented level, decrease back and leg pain, maintain preoperative lumbar lordotic angle and reduce ROM of whole lumbar and instrumented segments. Prevention of adjacent segment degeneration and complication rates are something to be reconsidered through longer follow up period. ","1897":"Posterior cranial fossa subdural hematomas and extension of the subdural hematoma to the cerebellopontine angle is rarely seen and the concurrent development of acute peripheral facial palsy and the management strategy have not previously been reported in this pathology because of its rarity. We present this case to emphasize that minor head trauma may lead to a posterior cranial fossa hematoma extending to the cerebellopontine angle and cause peripheral facial palsy in patients using aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). In addition, partial evacuation and waiting for the resorption of the hematoma may help to prevent damage to the 7th and 8th cranial nerves.","1898":"A 54-year-old man experienced injury to the second finger of his left hand due to damage from a paintball gun shot 8 years prior, and the metacarpo-phalangeal joint was amputated. He gradually developed mechanical allodynia and burning pain, and there were trophic changes of the thenar muscle and he reported coldness on his left hand and forearm. A neuroma was found on the left second common digital nerve and was removed, but his symptoms continued despite various conservative treatments including a morphine infusion pump on his left arm. We therefore attempted median nerve stimulation to treat the chronic pain. The procedure was performed in two stages. The first procedure involved exposure of the median nerve on the mid-humerus level and placing of the electrode. The trial stimulation lasted for 7 days and the patient's symptoms improved. The second procedure involved implantation of a pulse generator on the left subclavian area. The mechanical allodynia and pain relief score, based on the visual analogue scale, decreased from 9 before surgery to 4 after surgery. The patient's activity improved markedly, but trophic changes and vasomotor symptom recovered only moderately. In conclusion, median nerve stimulation can improve chronic pain from complex regional pain syndrome type II.","1899":"A rare case of hemifacial spasm caused by an ipsilateral tentorial meningioma is described. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a huge tumor in the right cerebellar hemisphere, distant to the cerebello-pontine cistern. The facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex was stretched by the shift of the brainstem and the right cerebello-pontine cistern was effaced. After removing the tumor, the hemifacial spasm resolved completely. We review our case with the pertinent literature regarding the etiological mechanism.","1900":"Two cases of dynamic lumbar spinal stenosis were identified by the authors using axial loaded magnetic resonance image (MRI). In both cases, the patients presented with neurogenic claudication but MRI in decumbency showed no definite pathologic condition associated with their symptoms. In contrast, axial loaded MRI demonstrated constrictive spinal stenosis and a significantly decreased dural sac caused by epidural fat buckling and thickening of the ligamentum flavum in both cases. In the second case, a more prominent disc protrusion was also demonstrated compared with decumbent MRI. After decompressive surgery, both patients had satisfactory outcomes. Axial loaded MRI can therefore give decisive information in dynamic spinal disorders by allowing simulation of an upright position.","1901":"Vascular injury during lumbar disc surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. It has been managed by open vascular surgical repair. With recent technologic advance, endovascular treatment became one of effective treatment modalities. We present a case of a 32-year-old woman who suffered with common iliac artery injury during lumbar disc surgery that was treated successfully by endovascular repair with temporary balloon occlusion and subsequent insertion of a covered stent. Temporary balloon occlusion for 1.5 hours could stop bleeding, but growing pseudoaneurysm was identified at the injury site during the following 13 days. It seems that the temporary balloon occlusion can stall bleeding from arterial injury for considerable time duration, but cannot be a single treatment modality and requires subsequent insertion of a covered stent.","1902":"Intraventricular hemorrhage long after successful encephaloduroarterio synangiosis (EDAS) is very rare. The effect of revascularization surgery for preventing hemorrhagic event of moyamoya disease remains controversial. We report a 17-year-old female with intracerebral hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrahge 10 years after successful EDAS. Even though cerebral vessels angiography showed good collateral circulations without specific weak points, a cerebral hemorrhage could occur in patient with ischemic type of moyamoya disease long after successful indirect bypass operations. Good collateralization of cerebral angiography or magnetic resonance perfusion image after indirect bypass surgery would ensure against ischemic symptoms, not a hemorrhage. And, thus a life-time follow-up strategy might be necessary even if a good collateral circulation has been established.","1903":"Meningioangiomatosis (MA) is a rare congenital tumor that occurs mostly in 5-15 year old children. There have been only 5 cases previously reported that described the cystic nature within these tumors. We present a case of a MA accompanied by a separate macrocyst. A normally developed 2 year-old female patient presented with partial and generalized seizures. The brain computerized tomogram and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a calcified mass accompanied by a cyst in the right parietal area, surrounded by low density and high attenuation edema and hemorrhage. Upon right parietal craniotomy, a 1.6 cm x 1.2 cm x 0.5 cm sized plate-like, gray-white, slightly hard mass was seen and it was completely excised. Approximately 1 cm from the mass in the anterior lateral direction, a cyst was found and subsequent biopsy of the cyst wall revealed no tumor tissue, and therefore the cyst was not removed. Pathologic report demonstrated the meningioangiomatosis. Follow up examination 2 years later showed no recurrence of the tumor, and there was no evidence of neurological deficits. Authors suggest that cysts that arise in the surrounding tissues of tumors may not be tumor cysts, and do not require surgical removal.","1904":"The authors analyzed the effectiveness and therapeutic response of Novalis shaped beam radiosurgery for metastatic brain tumors, and the prognostic factors which influenced the outcome. We performed a retrospective analysis of 106 patients who underwent 159 treatments for 640 metastatic brain lesions between January 2000 and April 2008. The pathologies of the primary tumor were mainly lung (45.3%), breast (18.2%) and GI tract (13.2%). We classified the patients using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) and then analyzed the survival and prognostic factors according to the Kaplan Meier method and univariate analysis. The overall median actuarial survival rate was 7.3 months from the time of first radiosurgery treatment while 1 and 2 year actuarial survival estimates were 31% and 14.4%, respectively. Median actuarial survival rates for RPA classes I, II, and III were 31.3 months, 7.5 months and 1.7 months, respectively. Patients' life spans, higher Karnofsky performance scores and age correlated closely with RPA classes. However, sex and the number of lesions were not found to be significantly associated with length of survival. This result suggests that Novalis radiosurgery can be a good treatment option for treatment of the patients with brain metastases. ","1905":"Cerebral vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemic infarction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the patients who suffer with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite adequate treatment, some patients deteriorate and they develop symptomatic vasospasm. The objective of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and clinical outcome of intraarterial nimodipine infusion on symptomatic vasospasm that is refractory to hemodynamic therapy. We retrospectively reviewed the procedure reports, the clinical charts and the transcranial doppler, computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography results for the patients who underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic cerebral vasospasm due to aneurysmal SAH. During the 36 months between Jan. 2005 and Dec. 2007, 19 patients were identified who had undergone a total of 53 procedures. We assessed the difference in the arterial vessel diameter, the blood flow velocity and the clinical outcome before and after these procedures. Vascular dilatation was observed in 42 of 53 procedures. The velocities of the affected vessels before and after procedures were available in 33 of 53 procedures. Twenty-nine procedures exhibited a mean decrease of 84.1 cm\/s. We observed clinical improvement and an improved level of consciousness with an improved GCS score after 23 procedures. Based on our results, the use of intraarterial nimodipine is effective and safe in selected cases of vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH. Prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm these results. ","1906":"Intracranial aneurysms are sometimes presented with visual symptoms by their rupture or direct compression of the optic nerve. It is because their prevalent sites are anatomically located close to the optic pathway. Anterior communicating artery is especially located in close proximity to optic nerve. Aneurysm arising in this area can produce visual symptoms according to their direction while the size is small. Clinical importance of visual symptoms presented by aneurysmal optic nerve compression is stressed in this study. Retrospective analysis of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms compressing optic apparatus were carried out. Total 33 cases were enrolled in this study. Optic nerve compression of the aneurysms was confirmed by the surgical fields. In 33 cases among 351 cases of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms treated surgically, from 1991 to 2000, the dome of aneurysm was compressed in optic pathway. In some cases, aneurysm impacted into the optic nerve that deep hollowness was found when the aneurysm sac was removed during operation. Among 33 cases, 10 cases presented with preoperative visual symptoms, such as visual dimness (5), unilateral visual field defect (2) or unilateral visual loss (3), 20 cases had no visual symptoms. Visual symptoms could not be checked in 3 cases due to the poor mental state. In 6 cases among 20 cases having no visual symptoms, optic nerve was deeply compressed by the dome of aneurysm which was seen in the surgical field. Of 10 patients who had visual symptoms, 8 showed improvement in visual symptoms within 6 months after clipping of aneurysms. In 2 cases, the visual symptoms did not recover. Anterior communicating artery aneurysm can cause visual symptoms by compressing the optic nerve or direct rupture to the optic nerve with focal hematoma formation. We emphasize that cerebral vascular study is highly recommended to detect intracranial aneurysm before its rupture in the case of normal CT findings with visual symptoms and frequent headache. ","1907":"We describe our clinical experiences and outcomes in patients who had thromboembolic complications occurring during endovascular treatment of intracerebral aneurysms with a review of the literature. The types of thromboembolic complications were divided and the treatment modalities for each type were described. Between August 2004 and March 2009 we performed endovascular embolization with Guglielmi detachable coils for 173 patients with 189 cerebral aneurysms, including ruptured and unruptured aneurysms at our hospital. Sixty-eight patients were males and 105 patients were females. The age of patients ranged from 22-82 years (average, 58.8 years). We retrospectively evaluated this group with regard to complication rates and outcomes. The types of thromboembolic complications were classified into the following three categories: mechanical obstruction, distal embolic stroke, and stent-induced complications, which corresponded to types I, II, and III, respectively. A comparison of the clinical results was made for each type of complication. Only eight patients had a thromboembolic complication during or after a procedure (4.6%). Of the eight patients, two had a mechanical obstruction as the causative factor; the other three patients had distal embolic stroke as the causative factor. The remaining three patients had stent-induced complications. In cases of mechanical obstruction, recanalization occurred due to the use of intra-arterial thrombolytic agents in one of two patients. Nevertheless, a poor prognosis was seen. In the cases of stent-induced complications, in one of three patients in whom a thrombus developed following stent insertion, a middle cerebral artery territory infarct developed with a poor prognosis despite the use of wiring and an intra-arterial thrombolytic agent. In the cases of distal embolic stroke, all three patients achieved good results following the use of antiplatelet agents. Treatment for thromboemboic complications due to mechanical obstruction and stent-induced complications include antiplatelet and intra-arterial thrombolytic agents; however, this cannot guarantee a sufficient extent of effectiveness. Therefore, active treatments, such as balloon angioplasty, stent insertion, and clot extraction, are helpful. ","1908":"Surgical treatment of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms is challenging due to limited surgical accessibility. Endovascular approach has a benefit of avoiding direct injury to the brainstem or lower cranial nerves. Therefore, it has recently been considered an alternative or primary modality for PICA aneurysms. We retrospectively assessed outcomes following detachable coil embolization of saccular PICA aneurysms. From February 1997 to December 2007, we performed endovascular procedures to treat 15 patients with 15 PICA aneurysms. Fourteen patients with 14 PICA aneurysms morphology of which was saccular were reviewed retrospectively. Twelve patients had ruptured aneurysms. The aneurysms arose from the PICA origin site (n = 12), the PICA lateral medullary segment (n = 1), or the PICA tonsilomedullary segment (n = 1). Complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 10 patients, residual neck in 3, and residual sac in one. Radiological follow-up was performed in 7 patients with mean duration of 34.7 months (range, 1-97 months) and showed stable or complete occlusion in 6 patients. There were no rebleeding or retreatment after endovascular treatment. Thromboembolism was the only procedure-related complication (n = 4 ; 28.6%). Asymptomatic PICA infarction occurred in two patients and symptomatic PICA infarction in two elderly patients with poor clinical grade. Of these procedural PICA infarction cases, 1 symptomatic PICA infarction patient developed ventriculitis and septic shock leading to death. The clinical outcome was good in 10 patients (71.4%). In the present study, detachable coil embolization has shown as an efficient modality for PICA saccular aneurysms challenging indications of microsurgery. However, thromboembolic complications should be considered, especially in poor clinical elderly patients with ruptured aneurysms. ","1909":"Intraoperative ventriculostomy is widely adopted to make the slack brain. However, there are few reports about hemorrhagic or parenchymal injuries after ventriculostomy. We tried to analyze and investigate the incidence of these complications in a consecutive series of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). From September 2006 to June 2007, 43 patients underwent surgical clipping for aneurysmal SAH at our hospital. Among 43 patients, we investigated hemorrhagic or parenchymal injuries after intraoperative ventriculostomy using postoperative computed tomographic scan in 26 patients. After standard pterional craniotomy, ventriculostomy catheter was inserted perpendicular to the cortical surface along the bisectional imaginary line from Paine's point. Hemorrhagic injuries were detected in 12 of 26 patients (46.2%). Mean systolic blood pressure during anesthesia was with in statistically significant parameter related to hemorrhage (p = 0.006). On the other hand, parenchymal injuries were detected in 11 of 26 patients (42.3%). Female and the amount of infused mannitol during anesthesia showed statistically significant parameters related to parenchymal injury (p = 0.005, 0.04, respectively). However, there were no ventriculostomy-related severe complications. In our series, hemorrhagic or parenchymal injuries after intraoperative ventriculostomy occurred more commonly than previously reported series in aneurysmal SAH patients. Although the clinical outcomes of complications are generally favorable, neurosurgeon must keep in mind the frequent occurrence of brain injury after intraoperative ventriculostomy in the acute stage of aneurysmal SAH. ","1910":"Several surgical procedures have been reported for the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). We compared the results of treatments for CSDH obtained from one burr-hole craniostomy with closed system drainage with or without irrigation, two burr-hole craniostomy with closed system drainage with irrigation, and small craniotomy with irrigation and closed-system drainage. Eighty-seven patients with CSDH underwent surgery at our institution from January 2004 to December 2008. Our patients were classified into three groups according to the operative procedure; group I, one burr-hole craniostomy with closed system drainage with or without irrigation (n = 25), group II, two burr-hole craniostomy with closed system drainage with irrigation (n = 32), and group III, small craniotomy with irrigation and closed-system drainage (n = 30). Age distribution, male and female ratio, Markwalder's grade on admission and at the time of discharge, size of hematoma before and after surgery, duration of operation, Hounsfield unit of hematoma before and after surgery, duration of hospital treatment, complication rate, and revision rate were categories that we compared between groups. Duration of operation and hospitalization were only two categories which were different. But, when comparing burr hole craniostomy group (group I and group II) with small craniotomy group (group III), duration of post-operative hospital treatment, complication and recurrence rate were statistically lower in small craniotomy group, even though operation time was longer. Such results indicate that small craniotomy with irrigation and closed-system drainage can be considered as one of the treatment options in patients with CSDH. ","1911":"This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the degrees of injury on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the time interval to recovery of consciousness in patients with diffuse axonal injury. From January 2004 to December 2008, 25 patients with diffuse axonal injury were treated at our hospital. We retrospectively investigated the patients' medical records and radiological findings. We divided the patients into three groups according to the grade of MRI finding : grade I, small scattered lesions on the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere; grade II, focal lesions on the corpus callosum; and grade III, additional focal lesions on the brain stem. Seven patients belonged to the grade I group; 10 to the grade II group; and 8 to the grade III group. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of all patients at the time of admission was 7.28. Recovery of consciousness was observed in 23 of the 25 patients; the remaining two patients never regained consciousness. The time interval to recovery of consciousness (awake status) ranged from 1 day to 125 days (mean 22.1 days) : grade I group patients, within approximately 1 week (mean 3.7 days); grade II group patients, within approximately 2 weeks (mean 12.5 days); and grade III group patients, within approximately 2 months (mean 59.5 days). Our study results suggest a correlation between the mean time interval to recovery of consciousness in patients with diffuse axonal injuries and the degrees of brain injuries seen on MRI. Patients with grade I and II diffuse axonal injuries recovered consciousness within 2 weeks, while patients with grade III injuries required approximately 2 months. ","1912":"This study was done to evaluate the correlation between carpal tunnel pressure (CTP), electrodiagnostic and ultrasonographic findings in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTP was measured during endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) for CTS using Spiegelberg ICP monitoring device with parenchymal type catheter. Neurophysiologic severity and nerve cross sectional area were evaluated using nerve conductive study and ultrasonography (USG) before ECTR in all patients. Tests were performed in a total of 48 wrists in 39 patients (9 cases bilateral). Maximum CTP was 56.7 +\/- 19.3 mmHg (Mean +\/- SD) and 7.4 +\/- 3.3 mmHg before and after ECTR, respectively. No correlation was found between maximum CTP and either neurophysiologic severity or nerve cross sectional area, whereas we found a significant correlation between the latter two parameters. CTP was not correlated with neurophysiologic severity and nerve cross sectional area. Dynamic, rather than static, pressure in carpal tunnel might account for the basic pathophysiology of CTS better. ","1913":"Medpor porous polyethylene was used to reconstruct small bone defects (gaps and burr holes) along a craniotomy bone flap. The feasibility and cosmetic results were evaluated. Medpor Craniotomy Gap Wedges, V and T, were designed. The V implant is a 10 cm-long wedge strip, the cross section of which is an isosceles triangle with a 4 mm-long base, making it suitable for gaps less than 4 mm after trimming. Meanwhile, the Medpor T wedge includes a 10 mm-wide thin plate on the top surface of the Medpor V Wedge, making it suitable for gaps wider than 4 mm and burr holes. Sixty-eight pterional craniotomies and 39 superciliary approaches were performed using the implants, and the operative results were evaluated with respect to the cosmetic results and pain or tenderness related to the cranial flap. The small bone defects were eliminated with less than 10 minutes additional operative time. In a physical examination, there were no considerable cosmetic problems regarding to the cranial bone defects, such as a linear depression or dimple in the forehead, anterior temporal hollow, preauricular depression, and parietal burr hole defect. Plus, no patient suffered from any infectious complications. The Medpor Craniotomy Gap Wedge is technically easy to work with for reconstructing small bone defects, such as the bone gaps and burr holes created by a craniotomy, and produces excellent cosmetic results. ","1914":"Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a rare cause of thoracic myelopathy. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the surgical outcome on the basis of preoperative clinical and radiological findings. Data obtained in 26 patients whot underwent posterior decompression for thoracic myelopathy, caused by thoracic OLF, were analyzed retrospectively. Patient age, duration of symptoms, OLF type, preoperative and postoperative neurological status using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system, surgical outcome, and other factors were reviewed. We compared the various factors and postoperative prognosis. All patients had undergone decompressive laminectomy and excision of the OLF. Using the JOA score, the functional improvement was excellent in 8 patients, good in 14, fair in 2, and unchanged in 2. A mean preoperative JOA score of 6.65 improved to 8.17 after an average of 27.3 months. According to our analysis, age, gender, duration of symptoms, the involved spinal level, coexisting spinal disorders, associated trauma, intramedullary signal change, and dural adhesions were not related to the surgical outcome. However, the preoperative JOA score and type of OLF were the most important predictors of the surgical outcome. Early diagnosis and sufficient surgical decompression could improve the functional prognosis for thoracic OLF. The postoperative results were found to be significantly associated with the preoperative severity of myelopathy and type of OLF. ","1915":"To evaluate the anatomical parameters that must be considered when performing thoracic transpedicular or extrapedicular screw fixation. We selected 958 vertebrae (1,916 pedicles) from 98 patients for analysis. Eight parameters were measured from CT scans : the transverse outer pedicular diameter, transverse inner pedicular diameter, length, angle, chord length of the pedicles and the transverse width, angle, and chord length of the pedicle-rib units. The age of the patients ranged from 21 to 82 years (mean : 48.2 years) and there were 57 men and 41 women. The narrowest transverse outer pedicular diameter was at T5 (4.4 mm). The narrowest pedicle length was at T1 (15.9 mm). For pedicle angle, T1 was 31.6 degrees, which was the most convergent angle, and it showed the tendency of the lower the level, the lesser the convergent angle. The chord length showed a horizontal pattern with similar values at all levels. For the PRU width, T5 showed a similar pattern to the pedicle width at 13.4 mm. For the PRU angle, T1 was the largest angle at 46.2 degrees and the tendency was the lower the level, the narrower the angle. For chord length, T1 was the shortest at 46.9 mm and T8 was the longest at 60.1 mm. When transpedicular screw fixations carried out at the mid-thoracic level, special care must be taken because there is a high chance of danger of medial wall violation. In these circumstances, extrapedicular screw fixation may be considered as an alternative treatment. ","1916":"We describe a case of 36-year-old man who presented with a subacute headache preceded by a 1-month history of posterior neck pain without trauma history. Head and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies disclosed bilateral supratentorial subdural and retroclival extradural hematomas associated with marked cervical epidural venous engorgement. Cerebral and spinal angiography disclosed no abnormalities except dilated cervical epidural veins. We performed serial follow-up MRI studied to monitor his condition. Patient's symptoms improved gradually. Serial radiologic studies revealed gradual resolution of pathologic findings. A 3-month follow-up MRI study of the brain and cervical spine revealed complete resolution of the retroclival extradural hematoma, disappearance of the cervical epidural venous engorgement, and partial resolution of the bilateral supratentorial subdural hematoma. Complete resolution of the bilateral supratentorial subdural hematoma was confirmed on a 5-month follow-up brain MRI. The diagnosis and possible mechanisms of this rare association are discussed.","1917":"Intradural lumbar disc herniation (ILDH) is rare. In this report, authors present 2 cases of ILDHs associated with severe adhesion between the dural sac and posterior longitudinal ligament. In a 40-year-old man, ILDH occurred in association with epidural adhesion due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). In other 31-year-old man, ILDH occurred in presence of epidural adhesion due to previous spine surgery.","1918":"Pain caused by chronic pancreatitis is medically intractable and resistant to conventional interventional or surgical treatment. We report a case of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis. The patient had a history of nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis and multiple emergency room visits as well as repeated hospitalization including multiple nerve block and morphine injection for 3 years. We implanted surgical lead at T6-8 level on this patient after successful trial of percutaneous electrode. The patient experienced a decreased visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain intensity and amount of opioid intake. The patient was followed for more than 14 months with good outcome and no further hospitalization. From our clinical case, spinal cord stimulation on intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis revealed moderate pain control outcome. We suggest that SCS is an effective, noninvasive treatment option for abdominal visceral pain. Further studies and long term follow-up are needed to fully understand the effect of SCS on abdominal visceral pain.","1919":"Plasma cell granuloma is a tumor-like disease characterized by non-neoplastic polyclonal proliferation of plasma cells and other mononuclear cells. This disease occurs most frequently in the lung and upper respiratory tract, while the involvement of the central nervous system is very rare. A 44-year-old female patient presented with nausea and progressive visual disturbance. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the mass along the right tentorium with low signal intensity in the T2 weighted image (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence, and an isosignal intensity in T1 weighted image (T1WI), the latter of which was enhanced after administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The thickest portion of the tentorium was partially excised via the combined suboccipital and infratentorial approach. The histopathological examination indicated a diagnosis of plasma cell granuloma. Postoperative steroid therapy was administered for remnant tumor control. Although a follow up MRI scan taken 20 months after the operation showed a slight decrease in tumor size, the lesion had extended to the falx and left frontal convexity along with parenchymal edema at 32 months after the operation and the clinical status was aggravated. The mass was removed from the left frontal convexity. Radiation therapy was given, together with steroid administration.","1920":"Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas are isolated plasma cell tumors of soft tissue that typically do not metastasize. They are rare and account for 4% of all plasma cell tumors. To our knowledge, only 14 cases of solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas in the sphenoid sinus have been reported. A 32-year-old man presented to our department with complaint of ocular pain in the right eyeball and diplopia. Physical and neurological examinations revealed intact and prompt direct and indirect light reflexes in both pupils and limitation of extraocular muscle movement seen with the lateral gaze of the right eyeball. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested the presence of mucocele or mycetoma, therefore surgical resection was performed with endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Histopathology was consistent with plasmacytoma. Systemic work-up did not show any evidence of metastasis and the sphenoid sinus was the sole tumor site, and therefore the diagnosis of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma was confirmed. We report a rare case of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma in the sphenoid sinus with successful treatment using the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.","1921":"A 43-year-old woman presented with dizziness, ataxia and right hearing difficulty. Her magnetic resonance images demonstrated an inhomogeneously contrast-enhanced large tumor growing into right cavernous sinus and Meckel's cave located totally within intradural retroclival region. She underwent retromastoid suboccipital craniotomy to resect the tumor mass and adjuvant gamma knife radiosurgery for remnant tumor at 1 month after operation. Adjuvant radiosurgery after surgical excision seems to be effective for the treatment of intradural extraosseous chordomas.","1922":null,"1923":"Remote cerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) is one of the rare complications occurring after supratentorial surgery, and its pathomechanism is poorly understood. We report 10 cases of RCH from our institution and review 154 cases from a database in order to delineate incidence, common presentation, risk factors, and outcomes of this complication. In addition, the means of prevention are discussed. We reviewed the medical records of 10 patients who experienced RCH after undergoing supratentorial surgery at our institution between 2001 and 2008. A database search in Medline revealed 154 cases of RCH in the English literature. Characteristic features were analyzed and compared. There were 10 cases of RCH among 3307 supratentorial surgery cases, indicating a 0.3% incidence. All patients had characteristic imaging features of RCH, namely a streaky bleeding pattern in the superior folia of the cerebellum. Seven patients had a history of preoperative hypertension. Four cases were related to cerebral aneurysms, and other four developed after the removal of brain tumors. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage apparatuses were installed postoperatively in all cases. Outcomes according to modified Rankin scale (mRS) were good in 7 patients, with 1 fatal case. RCH is a rare complication after supratentorial surgery, and the exact etiology still remains uncertain. Hypertension and perioperative loss of CSF seem positively correlated with RCH, but no single risk factor is totally responsible. Patients with RCH should be closely observed to improve their prognosis. ","1924":"The purpose of this study was to determine the normal morphometric landmarks of the uniting and dividing points of the brachial plexus (BP) in the periclavicular region to provide useful guidance in surgery of BP injuries. A total of 20 brachial plexuses were obtained from 10 adult, formalin-fixed cadavers. Distances were measured on the basis of the Chassaignac tubercle (CT), and the most lateral margin of the BP (LMBP) crossing the superior and inferior edge of the clavicle. LMBP was located within 25 mm medially from the midpoint in all subjects. In the supraclavicular region, the upper trunk uniting at 21 +\/- 7 mm from the CT, separating into divisions at 42 +\/- 5 mm from the CT, and dividing at 19 +\/- 4 mm from the LMBP crossing the superior edge of the clavicle. In the infraclavicular region, the distance from the inferior edge of the clavicle to the musculocutaneous nerve (MCN) origin was 49 +\/- 1 mm, to the median nerve origin 57 +\/- 7 mm, and the ulnar nerve origin 48 +\/- 6 mm. From the lateral margin of the pectoralis minor to the MCN origin the distance averaged 3.3 +\/- 10 mm. Mean diameter of the MCN was 4.3 +\/- 1.1 mm (range, 2.5-6.0) in males (n = 6), and 3.1 +\/- 1.5 mm (range, 1.6-4.0) in females (n = 4). We hope these data will aid in understanding the anatomy of the BP and in planning surgical treatment in BP injuries. ","1925":"This study was aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) colonization in neurosurgical practice of field, with particular attention to intensive care unit (ICU). This retrospective study was carried out on the Neurosurgical ICU (NICU), during the period from January. 2005 to December. 2007, in 414 consecutive patients who had been admitted to the NICU. Demographics and known risk factors were retrieved and assessed by statistical methods. A total of 52 patients had VRE colonization among 414 patients enrolled, with an overall prevalence rate of 6.1%. E. faecium was the most frequently isolated pathogen, and 92.3% of all VRE were isolated from urine specimen. Active infection was noticed only in 2 patients with bacteremia and meningitis. Relative antibiotic agents were third-generation cephalosporin in 40%, and vancomycin in 23%, and multiple antibiotic usages were also identified in 13% of all cases. Multivariate analyses showed Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score less than 8, placement of Foley catheter longer than 2 weeks, ICU stay over 2 weeks and presence of nearby VRE-positive patients had a significantly independent association with VRE infection. When managing the high-risk patients being prone to be infected VRE in the NICU, extreme caution should be paid upon. Because prevention and outbreak control is of ultimate importance, clinicians should be alert the possibility of impending colonization and infection by all means available. The most crucial interventions are careful hand washing, strict glove handling, meticulous and active screening, and complete segregation. ","1926":"Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) associated with aneurysm has been infrequently encountered and the treatment for this malady is challenging. We report here on our clinical experience with AVMs associated with arterial aneurysms that were managed by multimodality treatments, including clipping of the aneurysm, microsurgery, Gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKS) and Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization. We reviewed the treatment plans, radiological findings and clinical courses of 21 patients who were treated with GKS for AVM associated with aneurysm. Twenty-seven aneurysms in 21 patients with AVMs were enrolled in this study. Hemorrhage was the most frequent presenting symptom (17 patients : 80.9%). Bleeding was caused by an AVM nidus in 11 cases, aneurysm rupture in 5 and an undetermined origin in 1. Five patients were treated for associated aneurysm with clipping followed by GKS for the AVM and 11 patients were treated with GDC embolization combined with GKS for an AVM. Although 11 associated aneurysms remained untreated after GKS, none of them ruptured and 4 aneurysms regressed during the follow up period. Two aneurysms increased in size despite the disappearance of the AVM nidus after GKS and then these aneurysms were treated with GDC embolization. If combined treatment using microsurgery, GKS and endovascular treatment can be adequately used for these patients, a better prognosis can be obtained. In particular, GKS and GDC embolization are considered to have significant roles to minimize neurologic injury. ","1927":"The decision to adopt a conservative or surgical modality for a relatively small volume of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) is difficult and often controversial, especially when consciousness is tolerable. The authors examined the results of stereotactic-guided evacuation of SICH for relatively small volumes with respect to functional outcome. This prospective study was performed on 387 patients with SICH who underwent stereotactic-guided evacuation (n = 204, group A) or conservative treatment (n = 183, group B) during the past 8 years. The primary end-point was recovery of functional status, which was estimated using the Modified Barthel Index (MBI) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). All patients had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of &gt;\/= 13 and unilateral hemiparesis of less than motor power grade 3. Group demographic characteristics and initial neurological statuses were similar. In all cases, the volume of SICH involved was &lt; 30 cm(3) and location was limited to basal ganglia and thalamus. At 6-month follow-ups, MBI was 90.9 in group A and 62.4 in group B (p &lt; 0.05), and MRS was 1.2 in group A and 3.0 in group B (p &lt; 0.05). Better motor function and stereotactic-guided evacuation had a significant effect on a functional recovery in regression analyses. Even in patients with a small volume of SICH, stereotactic-guided evacuation improved functional recovery in activities in daily life than conservative treatment did. ","1928":"Conventional pterional approach is a commonly used neurosurgical technique for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. However, this technique requires more extensive brain exposure than other key hole approaches and is sometimes associated with surgical traumatization or cosmetic problems. The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative outcome between pterional and supraorbital keyhole approaches in the patients with anterior circulation aneurysms. The authors reviewed patients with anterior circulation aneurysms who underwent aneurysm clipping via pterional or supraorbital keyhole approach at a single institute over a period of 2 years. Ninety-eight patients harboring 108 aneurysms were included in this study. Various outcomes were recorded, which included clinical grade, cosmetic problems, patients' satisfaction and complications such as chewing discomfort, frontal muscle weakness, hyposmia, infection. The supraorbital approach exhibited a shorter operation time compared with the pterional approach. Complications such as chewing discomfort occurred less frequently in the supraorbital approach group. Moreover, the cosmetic outcome was significantly better in the supraorbital group than in the pterional group. The supraorbital keyhole approach reduced intra- and postoperative complications, including chewing discomfort and cosmetic disturbances, compared with the conventional pterional approach. ","1929":"Cardiac dysfunction after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with elevation of serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels. Elevation of cTnI predicts cardiopulmonary and neurological complications, and poor outcome. We retrospectively reviewed the medical and radiologic records of 114 (male : 30, female : 84) patients who developed aneurysmal SAH between January 2006 and June 2007 and had no history of previous cardiac problems. We evaluated their electrocardiography and cTnI level, which had been measured at admission. A cTnI level above 0.5 microg\/L was defined as an indicator of cardiac injury following SAH. We examined various clinical factors for their association with cTnI elevation and analyzed data using chi-square test, t-test and logistic regression test with SPSS version 12.0. The results were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS SHOWS A CORRELATION WITH CTNI ELEVATION : higher Hunt-Hess (H-H) grade (p = 0.000), poor Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score (p = 0.000), profound pulmonary complication (p = 0.043), higher heart rate during initial three days following SAH (p = 0.029), ruptured aneurysm on communicating segment of internal carotid artery (p = 0.025), incidence of vasospasm (p = 0.421), and duration of hyperdynamic therapy for vasospasm (p = 0.292). A significant determinants for outcome were cTnI elevation (p = 0.046) and H-H grade (p = 0.000) in a multivariate study. A cTnI is a good indicator for cardiopulmonary and neurologic complications and outcome following SAH. Consideration of variable clinical factors that related with cTnI elevation may be useful tactics for treatment of SAH and concomitant complications. ","1930":"Although prophylactic antiepileptic drug (AED) use in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common practice, lack of uniform definitions and guidelines for seizures and AEDs rendered this prescription more habitual instead of evidence-based manner. We herein evaluated the incidence and predictive factors of seizure and complications about AED use. From July 1999 to June 2007, data of a total of 547 patients with aneurysmal SAH who underwent operative treatments were reviewed. For these, the incidence and risk factors of seizures and epilepsy were assessed, in addition to complications of AEDs. Eighty-three patients (15.2%) had at least one seizure following SAH. Forty-three patients (7.9%) had onset seizures, 34 (6.2%) had perioperative seizures, and 17 (3.1%) had late epilepsy. Younger age (&lt; 40 years), poor clinical grade, thick hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, and rebleeding were related to the occurrence of onset seizures. Cortical infarction and thick hemorrhage were independent risk factors for the occurrence of late epilepsy. Onset seizures were not predictive of late epilepsy. Moreover, adverse drug effects were identified in 128 patients (23.4%) with AEDs. Perioperative seizures are not significant predictors for late epilepsy. Instead, initial amount of SAH and surgery-induced cortical damage should be seriously considered as risk factors for late epilepsy. Because AEDs can not prevent early postoperative seizures (&lt; 1 week) and potentially cause unexpected side effects, long-term use should be readjusted in high-risk patients. ","1931":"Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common types of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, usually occurring in the older patients, with a good surgical prognosis. Burr hole craniostomy is the most frequently used neurosurgical treatment of CSDH. However, there have been only few studies to assess the role of the number of burr holes in respect to recurrence rates. The aim of this study is to compare the postoperative recurrence rates between one and two burr craniostomy with closed-system drainage for CSDH. From January 2002 to December 2006, 180 consecutive patients who were treated with burr hole craniostomy with closed-system drainage for the symptomatic CSDH were enrolled. Pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) scans and\/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for radiological evaluation. The number of burr hole was decided by neurosurgeon's preference and was usually made on the maximum width of hematoma. The patients were followed with clinical symptoms or signs and CT scans. All the drainage catheters were maintained below the head level and removed after CT scans showing satisfactory evacuation. All patients were followed-up for at least 1 month after discharge. Out of 180 patients, 51 patients were treated with one burr hole, whereas 129 were treated with two burr holes. The overall postoperative recurrence rate was 5.6% (n = 10\/180) in our study. One of 51 patients (2.0%) operated on with one burr hole recurred, whereas 9 of 129 patients (7.0%) evacuated by two burr holes recurred. Although the number of burr hole in this study is not statistically associated with postoperative recurrence rate (p &gt; 0.05), CSDH treated with two burr holes showed somewhat higher recurrence rates. In agreement with previous studies, burr hole craniostomy with closed drainage achieved a good surgical prognosis as a treatment of CSDH in this study. Results of our study indicate that burr hole craniostomy with one burr hole would be sufficient to evacuate CSDH with lower recurrence rate. ","1932":"Orbital solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare tumor originating from the mesenchyme. We describe the clinical presentations, radiological and operative findings, and pathological features of a patient with orbital SFT. The patient was a 46-year-old female who presented with progressive proptosis advanced for 20 months. On ophthalmological examination, no visual impairment was detected, but left eye was found to be obviously protruded on exophthalmometry. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed a 2.5 x 2 x 2 cm, intensely enhanced mass in the left orbit, which compressed the eyeball forward and the optic nerve downward. The patient underwent frontal craniotomy with superior orbitotomy and gross total resection was performed for the tumor. The histopathological diagnosis including immunohistochemistry was a SFT. After the surgery, proptosis was markedly relieved without visual impairment. Although orbital SFT is extremely rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital tumors. Clinical presentations such as painless proptosis and CD34 immunoreactivity play a significant role in differentiating orbital SFT from other spindle-cell neoplasms of the orbit.","1933":"We present an extremely rare case of the atypical choroid plexus papilloma in an adult which developed at the trigone of right lateral ventricle. A 62-year-old woman presented with the history of intermittent and gradually progressive headache and left side hemiparesis for 6 months. The brain magnetic resonance image showed highly enhanced and well demarcated mass at the trigone of lateral ventricle attached to the choroid plexus. Gross total resection was performed by transcortical approach via the middle temporal gyrus. The tumor was diagnosed as an atypical choroid plexus papilloma. She had no neurologic deficit after the surgery. We report a case of atypical choroid plexus papilloma in adult and introduce newly classified pathologic characteristics of this tumor.","1934":"In surgical planning of the parasagittal meningioma, invasion and occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus are important factors. When tumor is located within anterior 1\/3, or when angiographic finding shows total occlusion of superior sagittal sinus, it is regarded that the ligation of superior sagittal sinus is safe. We report a case of parasagittal meningioma in 59-year-old male patient with complete occlusion of superior sagittal sinus which was confirmed by preoperative angiography, who developed temporary neurologic deterioration after superior sagittal sinus ligation and resection.","1935":"A case of large aneurysm arising from the distal end of an azygous A2 segment is presented. Multiple clip application inadvertently tore the aneurysmal neck, resulting in near avulsion of a right pericallosal artery origin. After an unsuccessful attempt to repair the avulsion, it was treated by occlusion of the origin of the pericallosal artery and an A4-A4 anterior cerebral artery in situ bypass without neurological deficits. The surgical technique and previous reports on side-to-side in situ bypass are discussed.","1936":"The authors report two cases of spontaneous regression of disc herniation at the level adjacent to the anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) level. This phenomenon may be due to the increased tension on the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) by appropriate restoration of the disc height and lumbar lordosis, which is a mechanism similar to ligamentotaxis applied to the thoracolumbar burst fracture.","1937":"Nontraumatic intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) attributable to the thoracolumbar dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) has been extremely rare. A 41-year-old male patient was admitted with severe acute headache, neck stiffness, and pronounced low-back pain radiating to both legs. The T2-weighted MR imaging showed irregular signal void and enlarged, varix like pouch formation with spinal cord compression at the T11-12 level. The angiogram revealed a DAVF.We report a DAVF case with SAH that revealed an extensive infarction from C5 to the conus medullaris after undergoing operative treatment.","1938":"The lumbar intraspinal epidural ganglion cyst has been a rare cause of the low back pain or leg pain. Ganglion cysts and synovial cysts compose the juxtafacet cysts. Extensive studies have been performed about the synovial cysts, however, very little has been known about the ganglion cyst. Current report is about two ganglion cysts associated with implicative findings in young male patients. We discuss about the underlying pathology of the ganglion cyst based on intraoperative evidences, associated disc herniation at the same location or severe degeneration of the ligament flavum that the cyst originated from in young patients.","1939":"Writer's cramp is a type of idiopathic focal hand dystonia characterized by muscle cramps that accompany execution of the writing task specifically. There has been renewed interest in neurosurgical procedures for the treatment of dystonia over the past several years. In particular, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has received increasing attention as a therapeutic option for patients with dystonia. However, to date, limited reporters made investigations into DBS in relation to the Writer's cramp. In this case, unilateral Ventro-oralis complex (Vo) DBS resulted in a major improvement in patient's focal dystonic movement disorders. Her post-operative Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating (BFMDR) scale demonstrated 1 compared with pre-operative BFMDR scale 4. We conclude that thalamic Vo complex DBS may be an important neurosurgical therapeutic option for Writer's cramp.","1940":"To evaluate the potential effects of risedronate (RIS) which shows a higher anti-resorptive effect among bisphosphonates, after a posterolateral lumbar intertransverse process spinal fusion using both autograft and allograft in a rat model. A totoal of 28 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 2 study groups. A posterolateral lumbar intertransverse process spinal fusion was peformed using both autograft and allograft in a rat model. Group I (control) received 0.1 mL of steril saline (placebo) and Group II (treatment) received risedronate, equivalent to human dose (10 microg\/kg\/week) for 10-weeks period. The fusion rates as determined by manual palpation were 69% in the group I and 46% in the group II (p = 0.251). According to radiographic score, the spinal segment was considered to be fused radiographically in 7 (53%) of the 13 controls and 9 (69%) of the 13 rats treated with RIS (p = 0.851). The mean histological scores were 5.69 +\/- 0.13 and 3.84 +\/- 0.43 for the control and treatment groups, respectively. There was a significant difference between the both groups (p = 0.001). The mean bone density of the fusion masses was 86.9 +\/- 2.34 in the control group and 106.0 +\/- 3.54 in the RIS treatment group. There was a statistical difference in mean bone densities of the fusion masses comparing the two groups (p = 0.001). In this study, risedronate appears to delay bone fusion in a rat model. This occurs as a result of uncoupling the balanced osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity inherent to bone healing. These findings suggest that a discontinuation of risedronate postoperatively during acute fusion period may be warranted. ","1941":"The authors studied the risk factors of silent cerebral microbleeds (MBs) and old hematomas (OHs) and their association with concurrent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in the patients of intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs). From April 2002 to June 2007, we retrospectively studied 234 patients of primary hemorrhagic stroke. All patients were evaluated with computed tomography (CT) and 3.0-tesla MR imaging studies within the first week of admission. MBs and OHs were assessed by using T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) MR imaging. The patients were divided into 2 groups, depending on whether or not they had two GRE lesions of chronic hemorrhages. A correlation between MBs and OHs lesions were also statistically tested. Lacunes and white matter and periventricular hyperintensities (WMHs, PVHs) were checked by T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Variables on the clinical and laboratory data and MR imaging abnormalities were compared between both groups with or without MBs and OHs. MBs were observed in 186 (79.5%) patients and a total of 46 OHs were detected in 45 (19.2%) patients. MBs (39.6%), OHs (80.4%), and ICHs (69.7%) were most commonly located in the ganglionic\/thalamic region. Both MBs and OHs groups were more frequently related to chronic hypertension and advanced WMHs and PVHs. The prevalence and number of MBs were more closely associated with OHs groups than non-OH patients. This study clearly demonstrated the presence of MBs and OHs and their correlation with hypertension and cerebral white matter microangiopathy in the ICHs patients. Topographic correlation between the three lesions (MBs, OHs, and ICHs) was also noted in the deep thalamo-basal location. ","1942":"This study was performed to elucidate the technical and patient-specific risk factors for postoperative ischemia in patients undergoing temporary arterial occlusion (TAO) during the surgical repair of their aneurysms. Eighty-nine consecutive patients in whom TAO was performed during surgical repair of an aneurysm were retrospectively analyzed. The demographics of the patients were analyzed with respect to age, Hunt and Hess grade on admission, Fisher grade of hemorrhage, aneurysm characteristics, timing of surgery, duration of temporary occlusion, and number of temporary occlusive episodes. Outcome was analyzed at the 3-month follow-up, along with the occurrence of symptomatic and radiological stroke. In overall, twenty-seven patients (29.3%) had radiologic ischemia attributable to TAO and fifteen patients (16.3%) had symptomatic ischemia attributable to TAO. Older age and poor clinical grade were associated with poor clinical outcome. There was a significantly higher rate of symptomatic ischemia in patients who underwent early surgery (p = 0.007). The incidence of ischemia was significantly higher in patients with TAO longer than 10 minutes (p = 0.01). In addition, patients who underwent repeated TAO, which allowed reperfusion, had a lower incidence of ischemia than those who underwent single TAO lasting for more than 10 minutes (p = 0.011). Duration of occlusion is the only variable that needs to be considered when assessing the risk of postoperative ischemic complication in patients who undergo temporary vascular occlusion. Attention must be paid to the patient's age, grade of hemorrhage, and the timing of surgery. In addition, patients undergoing dissection when brief periods of temporary occlusion are performed may benefit more from intermittent reperfusion than continuous clip application. With careful planning, the use of TAO is a safe technique when used for periods of less than 10 minutes. ","1943":"Clinical features of pituitary hemorrhage vary from asymptomatic to catastrophic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors related to severity of hemorrhage of pituitary adenoma. Pituitary hemorrhage was noted in 32 of 88 patients who underwent operations between January 2000 and December 2007. Clinical status was classified into group I (no hemorrhage symptoms), II (mild to moderate symptoms without neurological deficit), and III (with neurological deficit), and was compared to radiological, pathological, and operative findings. All patients were operated by transsphenoidal approach, and hemorrhage-related symptoms were relieved. Groups I, II, and III comprised 15, 10 and 7 patients, respectively. In group I, hemorrhage volume was under 1 mL in 11 (73.3%), but, it was above 1 mL in 7 (70%) of group II and in all cases of group III. Hemorrhage stage based on MRI findings was chronic or subacute in 11 (73.3%) of group I, acute in 6 (60%) of group II, and acute or hyperacute in 6 (85.7%) of group III. Pathological examination revealed chronic-stage hematomas in 5 (50%) group II patients. Functioning adenomas were found in 5 (33.3%) group I patients but none in group II or III patients. Silent adenomas were found in 4 (26.7%), 8 (80%), and 3 (42.9%) in groups I, II, and III, respectively. Clinical features of pituitary hemorrhage may differ with the radiological and immunohistopathlogical findings. Persistent symptoms are related to the chronic stage of hematoma requiring surgery for symptom relief. Neurological deficits are caused by large amount of acute hemorrhage requiring emergency operation. Silent adenoma is related to the severity of pituitary hemorrhage. ","1944":"This study was designed to investigate automated pressure-controlled discography (APCD) findings, to calculate the elastance of intervertebral discs, and to assess the relationship between the calculated elastance and disc degeneration. APCD was performed in 19 patients. There were a total of 49 intervertebral discs treated. Following intradiscal puncture, a dye was constantly injected and the intradiscal pressure was continuously measured. The elastance of the intervertebral disc was defined as unit change in intradiscal pressure per fractional change in injected dye volume. Disc degeneration was graded using a modified Dallas discogram scale. The mean elastance was 43.0 +\/- 9.6 psi\/mL in Grade 0, 39.5 +\/- 8.3 psi\/mL in Grade 1, 30.5 +\/- 22.3 psi\/mL in Grade 2, 30.5 +\/- 22.3 psi\/mL in Grade 3, 13.2 +\/- 8.3 psi\/mL in Grade 4 and 6.9 +\/- 3.8 psi\/mL in Grade 5. The elastance showed significant negative correlation with the degree of degeneration (R(2) = 0.529, p = 0.000). APCD liberates the examiner from the data acquisition process during discography. This will likely improve the quality of data and the reliability of discography. Elastance could be used as an indicator of disc degeneration. ","1945":"TWO FINDINGS EASILY FOUND AT CORONAL SOURCE IMAGES OF MR MYELOGRAPHY (MRM) WERE EVALUATED : dorsal root ganglion (DRG) swelling and running course abnormality (RCA) of L5 exiting root at foramen or extraforamen. We tried to find the sensitivity of each finding when root was compressed. From 2004 July to 2006, one hundred and ten patients underwent one side paraspinal decompression for their L5 root foraminal or extraforaminal compression at L5-S1 level. All kinds of conservative treatments failed to improve leg symptom for several months. Before surgery, MRI, CT and MRM were done. Retrospective radiologic analysis for their preoperative MRM coronal source images was done to specify root compression sites and L5 root morphologic changes. DRG swelling was found in 66 (60%) of 110 patients. DRG swelling has statistically valuable meaning in foraminal root compression (chi-square test, p &lt; 0.0001). Seventy-two (66%) in 110 patients showed abnormal alteration of running course. Abnormal running course has statistically valuable meaning in foraminal or extraforaminal root compression (chi-square test, p &lt; 0.0001). Three-dimensional MRM provides precise thin sliced coronal images which are most close to real operative views. DRG swelling and running course abnormality of L5 exiting root are two useful findings in diagnosing L5 root compression at L5-S1 foramen or extraforamen. MRM is thought to provide additional diagnostic accuracy expecially in L5-S1 foraminal and extraforaminal area. ","1946":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of unilateral decompression and pedicle screw fixation for the unilateral symptomatic foraminal stenosis. The study group comprises consecutive 16 patients who underwent unilateral decompression and bone cement augmented pedicle screw fixation from May 2003 to January 2006. The patients were evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the scoring system of the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) for low back pain. The result of surgery was also evaluated with McNab's classification. Excellent or good outcome was considered as successful. The patients were followed at postoperative 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year with standing AP and lateral films. The average VAS and JOA score of the 16 patients were 7.8 (range, 6-9) and 5.8 (range, 3 - 10) before surgery and 2.2 (range, 0 - 5) and 12.3 (range, 9 - 15) at the time of last follow up. Both VAS and JOA score improved significantly after the surgery (p &lt; 0.05, t-test). All patients improved after the operation and no revision surgery was required. No metal failure or pseudoarthrosis was observed during the follow-up. The success rate was 87.5%. Our data suggest that unilateral decompression and pedicle screw fixation for the unilateral symptomatic foraminal stenosis is an effect method for obtaining satisfactory clinical outcome. Its possible advantage is shorter operation time and reduced surgical extent. We believe that the reduced stiffness of unilateral fixation was compensated by pedicle screw augmentation and interbody fusion. ","1947":"To report an unsuspected adaptive plasticity of single upper motor neurons and of primary motor cortex found after microsurgical connection of the spinal cord with peripheral nerve via grafts in paraplegics and focussed discussion of the reviewed literature. The research aimed at making paraplegics walk again, after 20 years of experimental surgery in animals. Amongst other things, animal experiments demonstrated the alteration of the motor endplates receptors from cholinergic to glutamatergic induced by connection with upper motor neurons. The same paradigm was successfully performed in paraplegic humans. The nerve grafts were put into the ventral-lateral spinal tract randomly, without possibility of choosing the axons coming from different areas of the motor cortex. The patient became able to selectively activate the re-innervated muscles she wanted without concurrent activities of other muscles connected with the same cortical areas. Authors believe that unlike in nerve or tendon transfers, where the whole cortical area corresponding to the transfer changes its function a phenomenon that we call \"brain plasticity by areas\", in our paradigm due to the direct connection of upper motor neurons with different peripheral nerves and muscles via nerve grafts motor learning occurs based on adaptive neuronal plasticity so that simultaneous contractions of other muscles are prevented. We propose to call it adaptive functional \"plasticity by single neurons\". We speculate that this phenomenon is due to the simultaneous activation of neurons spread in different cortical areas for a given specific movement, whilst the other neurons of the same areas connected with peripheral nerves of different muscles are not activated at the same time. Why different neurons of the same area fire at different times according to different voluntary demands remains to be discovered. We are committed to solve this enigma hereafter.

However, rare instances of AVM recurrence have been reported in both children and adults with negative findings on postoperative angiography. The authors present the case of a 12-year-old boy with recurrent AVM. The AVM was originally fed by the pericallosal arteries on both sides, and it showed changing patterns of supply at recurrence. The authors concluded that a negative postoperative angiogram is not necessarily indicative of a cure. Repeat angiography and regular follow-up examinations should be performed to exclude the possibility of recurrence, especially in children.","1950":"This article presents the case of a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma which was contaminated with Klebsiella pneumoniae and resulted in a life-threatening central nervous system infection. After repeated of bilateral burr-hole drainage, the patient became hyperpyrexic and drowsy. Suppuration within the subdural space was suspected and then the patient underwent bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomies, and pus was evacuated. Its cultures revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae. Intravenous meropenem was given for 6 weeks. He recovered completely. Microorganisms like Klebsiella pneumoniae may directly infect the subdural space with iatrogenic contamination.","1951":"Cerebral embolic infarction is the most common neurologic complication of cardiac myxoma (CM). Development of cerebral aneurysms in CM is very rare. We present a 64-year-old woman with acute cerebral infarction and multiple cerebral aneurysms complicated by CM. The aneurysms were multiple, fusiform-shaped, and located in distal branch of major cerebral arteries. The serum interleukin (IL)-6 was highly elevated, which was normalized after surgical resection of CM. There was no regression of aneurysms on follow-up neuroimaging. Multiple cerebral aneurysms in CM are rare condition. Highly elevated serum IL-6 may be associated with increased risk of cerebral aneurysmal formation.","1952":"Although prompt diagnosis and emergent surgical intervention are important in acute spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH), some cases with spontaneous remission of symptom and hematoma without surgery have been reported. We present a case of acute nontraumatic SSDH presenting with transient left hemiplegia for 4 hours. A magnetic resonance imaging study of cervical spine confirmed SSDH with C3-6 cervical cord compression at the left side. The patient had conservative management without recurrence. Although hemiplegia is an unusual clinical manifestation of SSDH, it should be differentiated from that of cerebrovascular origin promptly. Conservative management may be an alternative therapeutic option for selective cases with transient neurological deficits.","1953":"On rare occasions, percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) may be associated with adverse spinal and extraspinal events. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not been reported complication following a PV. This is a report of two elderly women with spine compressions who developed idiopathic SAH after injecting polymethylmethacrylate into the thoracolumbar region transcutaneously. PV was performed as an usual manner on prone position under local anesthesia for these patients. During the interventions, two patients complained of a bursting nature of headache and their arterial blood pressure was jumped up. Computed tomography scans revealed symmetric SAH on the both hemispheres and moderate degree of hydrocephalus. Any intracranial vascular abnormalities for their SAH were not evident on modern neuroangiography modalities. One patient received a ventricular shunt surgery, but both fully recovered from the procedure-related SAH. The pathophysiologic mechanism that induce SAH will be discussed, with suggesting the manner that prevent and minimize this rare intracranial complication after PV.","1954":"The first case of intracranial metastases of a cervical intramedullary low-grade astrocytoma without malignant transformation in adult is presented in this report. Seven years ago, a 45 year-old male patient underwent biopsy to confirm pathologic characteristics and received craniocervical radiation and chemotherapy for a grade II astrocytoma in the cervical spinal cord. Two years later, posterior fusion was necessary for progressive kyphosis in the cervical spine. He was well for approximately 7 years after the primary surgery. Two months ago, he presented with partial weakness and incoordination with gait difficulty. MRI Scan demonstrated multiple small lesions in the cerebellar vermis and left hemisphere. After suboccipital craniectomy and posterior cervical exposure, the small masses in the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres were excised to a large extent by guidance of an intraoperative navigation system. The tumor at the cervical and brain lesions was classified as an astrocytoma (WHO grade II). When a patient with low-grade astrocytoma in the spinal cord has new cranial symptoms after surgery, radiaton, and chemotherapy, the possibility of its metastasis should be suspected because it can spread to the intracranial cavity even without malignant transformation as shown in this case.","1955":"Osteoporotic patients who undergo percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) have the risk of a repeated collapse of their adjacent vertebral body due to alteration of load transfer into the adjacent vertebral body. The authors have experienced a rare case of repeated osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) resulting in extreme multi-level PVP. A 74-year-old female developed severe back pain after slipping down one month ago. Her X-ray and MR images indicated a T11 VCF. She underwent successful PVP with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Two weeks later, she returned to our hospital due to a similar back pain. Repeated X-ray and MR images showed an adjacent VCF on T12. A retrial of PVP was performed on T12, which provided immediate pain relief. Since then, repeated collapses of the vertebral body occurred 12 times in 13 levels within a 24-month period. Each time the woman was admitted to our hospital, she was diagnosed of newly developed VCFs and underwent repeated PVPs with PMMA, which finally eased back pain. Based on our experience with this patient, repeated multiple PVP is not dangerous because its few and minor complications. Therefore, repeated PVP can serve as an effective treatment modality for extreme-multi level VCFs.","1956":"A 49-year-old woman presented with headache, vomiting and visual disturbance. Neurological examination revealed bitemporal hemianopsia with poor visual acuity. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a bulky intra-suprasellar mass, which was isointense with brain parenchyma on T1-weighted images, and slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. After gadolinium administration, the mass was homogeneously enhanced. The mass was partially removed by the endonasal transsphenoidal approach and then the remnant mass was totally removed by the transcranial approach five months later. We found a yellowish mass which was attached to the diaphragm sellae in operation field. Histopathological examination of the tumor revealed the characteristic features of a schwannoma. We report an unusual case of an intra-suprasellar schwannoma resembling a non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma both clinically and radiologically.","1957":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) can provide immediate stabilization in pathologic fractures of spinal tumors. However, long term follow-up data in cases of pathologic fractures are lacking. The authors report follow-up results of VP in 185 pathologic fractures of 102 spinal tumor patients. Percutaneous VP was performed at 185 vertebral bodies of 102 patients from 2001 to 2007. Retrospective analysis was done with medical records and radiological data. The change of visual analogue score (VAS), vertebral body (VB) height and kyphotic angle were measured preoperatively and on postoperative one day and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The patients were composed of metastatic spine tumors (81%) and multiple myeloma (19%). Involved spinal segments were between T6 and L5. Mean follow-up period was 12.2 months. VAS for back pain was 8.24 preoperatively, 3.59 (postoperative one day), 4.08 (three months) and 5.22 (one year). VB compression ratio changed from 21.33% preoperatively to 13.82% (postoperative one day), 14.36% (three month), and 16.04% (one year). Kyphotic angle changed from 15.35 degrees preoperatively to 12.03 degrees (postoperative one day), 13.64 degrees (three month), and 15.61 degrees (one year). Immediate pain relief was definite after VP in pathologic compression fracture of osteolytic spinal disease. Although VAS was slightly increased on one year follow-up, VP effect was maintained without significant change. These results indicate that VP could be a safe and effective procedure as a palliative treatment of the spinal tumor patients. ","1958":"The objectives of this study were to analyze the recanalization rates and outcomes of multimodal therapy that consisted of sequential intravenous (IV)\/intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis, mechanical thrombolysis including mechanical clot disruption using microcatheters and microwires, balloon angioplasty, and stenting for acute ischemic stroke, and to evaluate the prognostic factors related to the outcome. Fifty patients who were admitted to the hospital within 8 hours from ischemic symptom onset were retrospectively analyzed. Initial IV thrombolysis and subsequent cerebral angiography were performed in all patients. If successful recanalization was not achieved by IV thrombolysis, additional IA thrombolysis with mechanical thrombolysis, including balloon angioplasty and stenting, were performed. The outcomes were assessed by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) change and modified Rankin scale (mRS) and prognostic factors were analyzed. Successful recanalization was achieved in 42 (84%) of 50 patients, which consisted of 8 patients after IV thrombolysis, 19 patients after IA thrombolysis with mechanical clot disruption, and 15 patients after balloon angioplasty or stenting. Symptomatic hemorrhage occurred in 4 (8%) patients. Good outcomes were achieved in 76% and 70% of patients upon discharge, and 93% and 84% of patients after 3 months according to the NIHSS change and mRS. The initial clinical status, recanalization achievement, and presence of symptomatic hemorrhage were statistically related to the outcomes. Multimodal therapy may be an effective and safe treatment modality for acute ischemic stroke. Balloon angioplasty and stenting is effective for acute thrombolysis, and produce higher recanalization rates with better outcomes. ","1959":"It has been suggested that elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level is a marker of increased risk of mortality in acute ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, the association of serum cTnT level and prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has been sparsely investigated. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between cTnT level and the outcome in patients with spontaneous ICH. We retrospectively investigated 253 patients identified by a database search from records of patients admitted in our department for ICH between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2007. The patients were divided into 2 groups; the patients in group 1 (n=225) with serum cTnT values of 0.01 ng\/mL or less, and those in group 2 (n=28) with serum cTnT values greater than 0.01 ng\/mL. The serum cTnT level was elevated in 28 patients. There were significant differences in sex, hypertension, creatine kinase-myocardial band, midline shift, side of hematoma, and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage between the 2 groups. Logistic regression analysis identified the level of consciousness on admission, cTnT and midline shift as independent predictors of hospital mortality. Theses results suggest that increased serum cTnT level at admission is associated with in-hospital mortality and the addition of a serum cTnT assay to routine admission testing should be considered in patients with ICH. ","1960":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcome of 75 consecutive patients with cervical carotid artery stenosis and who were treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS) only. From February 2003 to June 2008, there were 78 stents placed in 75 symptomatic patients (mean age : 67.3 years); 69 patients had carotid stenosis &gt;\/=70%, and 6 patients had asymptomatic stenosis &gt;\/=80%. No carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was performed during the same period. The patients were clinically followed-up for a mean of 20.1 months. The procedures were technically successful in all cases. Three (3.8%) patients had procedure-related complications. During the 30-day postprocedural period, there were no restenosis or major stroke. Minor stroke was noticed in 3 (3.8%) patients and 1 (1.3%) of the 75 patients suddenly expired 2 days after discharge. There were no new neurological symptoms that developed during the clinical follow-up period. The results of our series were not inferior to those the previously published in CAS studies, and in fact they were better. Our results suggest that CAS may be safe and useful for the treatment of cervical carotid artery stenosis when it is used as the first line treatment in those institutions that lack enough experience with CEA. ","1961":"The purpose of this study was to identify independent predictors of mortality and functional recovery in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (PICH) and to improve functional outcome in these patients. Data were collected retrospectively on 585 patients with supratentorial PICH admitted to the Stroke Unit at our hospital between 1st January 2004 and the 31st July 2008. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the associations between all selected variables and 30-day mortality and 90-day functional recoveries after PICH was evaluated. Ninety-day functional recovery was achieved in 29.1% of the 585 patients and 30-day mortality in 15.9%. Age (OR=7.384, p=0.000), limb weakness (OR=6.927, p=0.000), and hematoma volume (OR=5.293, p=0.000) were found to be powerful predictors of 90-day functional recovery. Furthermore, initial consciousness (OR=3.013, p=0.014) hematoma location (lobar, OR=2.653, p=0.003), ventricular extension of blood (OR=2.077, p=0.013), leukocytosis (OR=2.048, p=0.008), alcohol intake (drinker, OR=1.927, p=0.023), and increased serum aminotransferase (OR=1.892, p=0.035) were found to be independent predictors of 90-day functional recovery after PICH. On the other hand, a pupillary abnormality (OR=4.532, p=0.000) and initial unconsciousness (OR=3.362, p=0.000) were found to be independent predictors of 30-day mortality after PICH. The predictors of mortality and functional recovery after PICH identified during this analysis may assist during clinical decision-making, when advising patients or family members about the prognosis of PICH and when planning intervention trials. ","1962":"The factors that influence the prognosis of patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS) treated by microvascular decompression (MVD) have not been definitely established. We report a prospective study evaluating the prognostic factors in patients undergoing MVD for HFS. From January 2004 to September 2006, the authors prospectively studied a series of 293 patients who underwent MVD for HFS. We prospectively analyzed a number of variables in order to evaluate the predictive value of independent variables for the prognosis of patients undergoing MVD. The patients were followed-up at regular intervals and divided into as cured and unsatisfactory groups based on symptom relief. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models. A total 273 of 293 (94.2%) patients achieved symptom relief within one year after the operation. Intraoperatively, the indentation of the root exit zone was observed in 259 (88.5%) patients. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed that the symptoms at postoperative 3 months (p&lt;0.001) and indentation of the root exit zone (p=0.036) were associated with good outcomes. The intraoperative finding of root exit zone indentation will help physicians determine the prognosis in patients with HFS. To predict the prognosis of HFS, a regular follow-up period of at least 3 months following MVD should be required. ","1963":"Determining language lateralization is important for the presurgical evaluation of patients with medically intractable epilepsy. The Wada test has been the gold standard for lateralization of language dominance before epilepsy surgery. However, it is an invasive test with risk, and have some limitations. We compared the volumetric analysis with Wada test, and studied the clinical potential of volumetric analysis to assess language laterality in large surgical candidates with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To examine the efficacy of volumetric analysis to determine language lateralization during presurgical evaluation, we compared the volumetric analysis of the bilateral planum temporale with the results of Wada test in 59 patients with chronic intractable TLE (rTLE, n=32; lTLE, n=27) who underwent epilepsy surgery. We measured the gray matter volumes of planum temporale (PT) of each patients using the VoxelPlus2 program (Mevisys, Daejeon, Korea). Overall congruence of the volumetric analysis with the Wada test was 97.75% in rTLE patients and 81.5% in lTLE patients. There were more significant leftward asymmetry of the PT in rTLE patients than lTLE patients. In lTLE patients, relatively high proportion (37%) of the patients showed bilateral or right hemispheric language dominance. These results provide evidence that the volumetric analysis of the PT could be used as an alternatives in language lateralization. Also, the results of the Wada test suggested that there was considerable plasticity of language representation in the brains of patients with intractable TLE and it was associated with an earlier age of brain injury.

However, it rarely occurs after diagnostic lumbar puncture, and its treatment and pathophysiology are uncertain. Tension pneumocephalus can develop even after diagnostic lumbar puncture in a special condition. This extremely rare condition and underlying pathophysiology will be presented and discussed. The authors report the case of a 44-year-old man with a basal skull fracture accompanied by pneumothorax necessitating chest tube suction drainage, who underwent an uneventful lumbar tapping that was complicated by postprocedural tension pneumocephalus resulting in an altered mental status. The patient was managed by burr hole trephination and saline infusion following chest tube disengagement. He recovered well with no neurologic deficits after the operation, and a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated that the pneumocephalus had completely resolved. Tension pneumocephalus is a rare but serious complication of lumbar puncture in patients with basal skull fractures accompanied by pneumothorax, which requires continuous chest tube drainage. Thus, when there is a need for lumbar tapping in these patients, it should be performed after the negative pressure is disengaged.","1966":"While syringomyelia is not a rare spinal disorder, syringomyelia associated with a spinal arachnoid cyst is very unusual. Here, we report a 62-year-old man who suffered from gait disturbance and numbness of bilateral lower extremities. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the presence of a spinal arachnoid cyst between the 7th cervical and 3rd thoracic vertebral segment and syringomyelia extending between the 6th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebral segment. The cyst had compressed the spinal cord anteriorly. Syringomyelia usually results from lesions that partially obstruct cerebrospinal fluid flow. Therefore, we concluded that the spinal arachnoid cyst was causing the syringomyelia. After simple excision of the arachnoid cyst, the symptoms were relieved. A follow-up MRI demonstrated that the syringomyelia had significantly decreased in size after removal of the arachnoid cyst. This report presents an unusual case of gait disturbance caused by syringomyelia associated with a spinal arachnoid cyst.","1967":"Brown-Sequard syndrome may be the result of penetrating injury to the spine, but many other etiologies have been described. This syndrome is most commonly seen with spinal trauma and extramedullary spinal neoplasm. A herniated cervical disc has been rarely reported as a cause of this syndrome. We present a case of a 28-year-old male patient diagnosed as large C3-C4 disc herniation with spinal cord compression. He presented with left hemiparesis and diminished sensation to pain and temperature in the right side below the C4 dermatome. Microdiscectomy and anterior cervical fusion with carbon fiber cage containing a core of granulated coralline hydroxyapatite was performed. After the surgery, rapid improvement of the neurologic deficits was noticed. We present a case of cervical disc herniation producing acute Brown-Sequard syndrome with review of pertinent literature.","1968":"Cervical cord compression due to osteochondroma in hereditary multiple exostosis (HME) is a rare condition, especially in young children. In this report, we discuss a rare case of cervical osteochondroma presenting as Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) in a 7-year-old boy with HME. The child was admitted because of hemiparesis involving the right limbs and hypoesthesia on the left side following mild trauma. MR image revealed cord compression by osteochondroma of the C7 lamina. We removed the osteocondroma and the neurological deficit was improved.","1969":"The Mayfield head clamp is the most frequently used head clamp system in the field of neurosurgery. In many cases, surgery is performed with complete reliance on the safety of the MHC. However, we experienced an extremely rare case in which the MHC accidentally broke while installing this system for immobilization of the head and neck. This is a case report with a brief review of the literature. The patient was a 58-year-old female who was scheduled to undergo cervical laminoplasty under the diagnosis of degenerative spondylotic cervical stenosis. In an attempt to install an MHC, we fixed three pins in the scalp; however, the arm of the MHC system broke when force was applied from both directions. Fortunately, the patient remained in a stable position and did not sustain an injury to the head or neck. Fixation was performed using another MHC, and the surgery was performed successfully. The patient was discharged after surgery with no specific complications related to the MHC system. The authors experienced an extremely rare case of MHC breakage during application and report the importance of properly managing and maintaining the instruments in order to prevent fatal injury.","1970":"The stereotactic surgical target for dystonic tremor is the subject of ongoing debate. Targeting the subthalamic area using deep brain stimulation has been regaining interest as a therapy for various types of involuntary movements. We describe the efficacy of stimulation of the subthalamic area in a patient with intractable dystonic tremor. Excellent control without neurological complications was achieved. This case report demonstrates that the subthalamic area is a valuable target for the control of dystonic tremor.","1971":"The authors present a rare case of severe vasospasm following the rupture of arteriovenous fistula. On initial CT scan, hematoma in the corpus callosum and left inferior frontal region with surrounding cerebromalacia and all ventricles without apparent subarachnoid hemorrhage were seen. Angiograms showed arterivenous fistula but did not show cerebral vasospasm. Thirteen days after admission the neurological state of patient suddenly deteriorated and bilateral motor weaknesses developed. Following angiograms revealed severe narrowing on the supraclinoid portion of bilateral internal carotid arteries, bilateral anterior cerebral arteries and bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Transluminal angioplasty and intra-arterial papaverine infusion were performed. The patient remained stable with moderate neurologic deficits.","1972":"We present two rare cases of anomalous vertebral artery (VA) with retroesophageal right subclavian artery. One patient had a right VA arising from the right common carotid artery (CCA), and a left VA originating from the third branch off the aorta. Both VAs ascended anteriorly to the transverse foramen of C5 to C6 vertebra and entered the transverse foramen of C4. The other patient had a right VA arising from the right CCA and entering the transverse foramen of C5. The presence of anomalous variations of the origin and course of vertebral artery might have serious implications in angiographic and surgical procedures, and it is of great importance to be aware of such a possibility.","1973":"Pain has long been regarded as a subjective symptom. Recently, however, some regard a type of intractable chronic pain as a disease. Furthermore, chronic persistent pain becomes a cause of permanent impairment (PI). In 6th edition, the American Medical Association (AMA) Guides has rated the pain as a PI. In Korea, pain has been already been rated as a PI. Here, we examined the present status and the prospect of disability evaluation for the pain in Korea. Pain can be rated as a PI by the Workmen's Compensation Insurance Act (WCIA) and Patriots and Veterans Welfare Corporation Act (PVWCA) in Korea. We examined the definition, diagnostic criteria and grades of the pain related disability (PRD) in these two acts. We also examined legal judgments, which were made in 2005 for patients with severe pain. We also compared the acts and the judgments to the criteria of the 6th AMA Guides. The PRD can be rated as one of the 4 grades according to the WCIA. The provisions of the law do not limit the pain only for the complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The PRD can be rated as one of the 3 grades by the PVWCA. If there were objective signs such as osteoporosis, joint contracture and muscle atrophy corresponding to the CRPS, the grade is rated as 6. When the pain always interferes with one's job except easy work, the grade is rated as high as 5. In Korea, judicial precedents dealt the pain as a permanent disability in 2005. Although there were no objective criteria for evaluation of the PRD, pain has been already rated as a PI by the laws or judicial precedents, in Korea. Thus, we should regulate the Korean criteria of PRD like the AMA 6th edition. We also should develop the objective tools for evaluation of the PRD near in future. ","1974":"Although there are several descriptions of this vessel, there is no detailed angiographic study of the accessory middle cerebral artery (AMCA) in Korea. We describe the angiographic characteristics of the cortical territory and origin of AMCA and discuss the clinical significance of this anomaly. We searched for patients with AMCAs from a retrospective review of 1,250 conventional cerebral angiograms. We determined the origins, diameters and cortical territories of these AMCAs. Fifteen patients (15 of 1250 = 1.2%) had 16 AMCAs (one patient had bilateral AMCAs). AMCAs originated from the distal A1 in eleven cases, middle A1 in two, proximal A1 in two, and proximal A2 in one case. All AMCAs followed a course parallel to the main middle cerebral artery (MCA). All but three of these arteries were smaller than the main MCA. Thirteen of the smaller diameter AMCAs had cortical distribution to the orbito-frontal and prefrontal, and precentral areas. Three AMCAs had diameter as large as the main MCA. These three supplied the orbitofrontal, prefrontal, precentral, central and anterior-parietal arteries. The AMCAs originated from A1 or A2. Most had smaller diameter than the main MCA. The AMCAs coursed along the horizontal portion of the MCA, but supplied the orbital surface, the anterior frontal lobe and sometimes wider cortical territory, including the precentral, central, anterior-parietal areas. ","1975":"Our retrospective study aimed to determine whether 16-slice computerized tomography (CT) angiography optimized sharp kernel is suitable for the evaluation of visibility, luminal patency and re-stenosis of intracranial stents in comparison with conventional angiography. Fifteen patients with symptomatic intracranial stenotic lesions underwent balloon expandable stent deployment of these lesions (10 middle cerebral arteries, 2 intracranial vertebral arteries, and 3 intracranial internal carotid arteries). CT angiography follow-up ranged from 6 to 15 months (mean follow-up, 8 months) after implantation of intracranial stents and conventional angiography was confirmed within 2 days. Curved multiplanar reformations with maximal intensity projection (MIP) with optimal window settings for assessment of lumen of intracranial stents were evaluated for visible lumen diameter, stent patency (contrast distal to the stent as an indirect sign), and re-stenosis by two experienced radiologists who blinded to the reports from the conventional angiography. All of stents deployed into symptomatic stenotic lesions. All stents were classified as patent and no re-stenosis, which was correlated with results of conventional angiography. Parts of the stent lumen could be visualized in all cases. On average, 57% of the stent lumen diameter was visible using optimized sharp kernel. Significant improvement of lumen visualization (22%, p&lt;0.01) was observed using the optimized sharp kernel compared with the standard sharp kernel. Inter-observer agreements on the measurement of lumen diameter and density were judged as good, respectively (p&lt;0.05). Sixteen-slice CT using the optimized sharp kernel may provide a useful information for evaluation of lumen diameter patency, and re-stenosis of intracranial stents. ","1976":"We retrospectively analyzed survival, local control rate, and incidence of radiation toxicities after radiosurgery for recurrent metastatic brain lesions whose initial metastases were treated with whole-brain radiotherapy. Various radiotherapeutical indices were examined to suggest predictors of radiation-related neurological dysfunction. In 46 patients, total 100 of recurrent metastases (mean 2.2, ranged 1-10) were treated by CyberKnife radiosurgery at average dose of 23.1 Gy in 1 to 3 fractions. The median prior radiation dose was 32.7 Gy, the median time since radiation was 5.0 months, and the mean tumor volume was 12.4 cm(3). Side effects were expressed in terms of radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) neurotoxicity criteria. Mass reduction was observed in 30 patients (65%) on MRI. After the salvage treatment, one-year progression-free survival rate was 57% and median survival was 10 months. Age (&lt;60 years) and tumor volume affected survival rate (p=0.03, each). Acute (&lt;\/=1 month) toxicity was observed in 22% of patients, subacute and chronic (&gt;6 months) toxicity occurred in 21%, respectively. Less acute toxicity was observed with small tumors (&lt;10 cm(3), p=0.03), and less chronic toxicity occurred at lower cumulative doses (&lt;100 Gy, p=0.004). \"Radiation toxicity factor\" (cumulative dose times tumor volume of &lt;1,000 Gyxcm(3)) was a significant predictor of both acute and chronic CNS toxicities. Salvage CyberKnife radiosurgery is effective for recurrent brain metastases in previously irradiated patients, but careful evaluation is advised in patients with large tumors and high cumulative radiation doses to avoid toxicity. ","1977":"We retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcomes of 42 patients with growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenoma to evaluate the clinical manifestations and to determine which preoperative factors that significantly influence the remission. Forty-two patients with GH-secreting pituitary adenoma underwent transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) between 1995 and 2007. The patient group included 23 women and 19 men, with a mean age of 40.2 (range 13-61) years, and a mean follow-up duration of 49.4 (range 3-178) months after the operation. For comparable radiological criteria, we classified parasellar growth into five grades according to the Knosp classification. We analyzed the surgical results of the patients according to the most recent stringent criteria for cure. The overall rate of endocrinological remission in the group of 42 patients after primary TSS was 64% (26 of 42). The remission rate was 67% (8 of 12) for microadenoma and 60% (18 of 30) for macroadenoma. The remission rate was 30% (3 of 10) for the group with cavernous sinus invasion and 72% (23 of 32) for the group with intact cavernous sinus. Cavernous sinus invasion in Knosp grade III and IV was significantly correlated with the remission rate. There was a significant relationship between preoperative mean GH concentration and early postoperative outcome, with most patients in remission having a lower preoperative GH concentration. TSS is thought to be an effective primary treatment for GH-secreting pituitary adenomas according to the most recent criteria of cure. Because the remission rate in cases with cavernous sinus invasion is very low, early detection of the tumor before it extends into the cavernous sinus and a long-term endocrinological and radiological follow-up are necessary in order to improve the remission rate of acromegaly.

We present a novel ICA trapping technique which can be used with insufficient collaterals flow via anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and posterior communicating artery (PcoA). A patient was admitted with severe headache and the cerebral angiography demonstrated a typical blood blister-like aneurysm at the contralateral side of PcoA. For trapping the aneurysm, the first clip was placed at the ICA just proximal to the aneurysm whereas the distal clip was placed obliquely proximal to the origin of the PcoA to preserve blood flow from the PcoA to the distal ICA. The patient was completely recovered with good collaterals filling to the right ICA territories via AcoA and PcoA. This technique may be an effective treatment option for trapping the aneurysm, especially when the PcoA preservation is mandatory.","1980":"The authors report a case of 42-year-old woman with an intraventricular tumor in the trigone of the left lateral ventricle. The first operation achieved a microscopically complete resection. The tumor was histologically atypical meningioma. After 26 months, there were recurrences of intraventricular meningioma. Complete resection of the tumor and adjuvant radiation therapy were performed, and the histological diagnosis was malignant meningioma. Sixteen months after the second operation, spinal metastasis in cervicolumbar lesion was diagnosed and a subtotal removal of cervical intradural extramedullary mass was performed. We describe an unusual case of intraventricular malignant meningioma with cerebrospinal fluid-disseminated spinal metastases with review of the clinical courses of previous reports.","1981":"Spontaneous spinal subarachnoid hematoma (SSH) is a rare entity to cause spinal cord or nerve root compression and is usually managed as surgical emergencies. We report a case of spontaneous SSH manifesting as severe lumbago, which demonstrated nearly complete clinical resolution with conservative treatment. A 58-year-old female patient developed a large SSH, which was not related to blood dyscrasia, anticoagulation, lumbar puncture, or trauma. Patient had severe lumbago but no neurologic deficits. Because of absence of neurologicl deficits, she was treated conservatively. Follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) image showed complete resolution. Conservative treatment of SSH may be considered if the patient with spontaneous SSH has no neurologic deficits.","1982":"We report on a case of thrombosis of the left common iliac artery following anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) of L4-5 in a 79-year-old man with no previous medical problems, including peripheral vascular disease. After completing the ALIF procedure, the surgeon could not feel the pulsation of the left dorsalis pedis artery, and the oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) had fallen below 90% from pulse oxymetry on the left great toe. Thrombectomy was successfully performed after confirming the thrombus in the left common iliac artery using Computed Tomography (CT) angiography. Thrombosis of the common iliac artery is very rare following ALIF. However, delayed diagnosis can lead to disastrous outcome. Although elderly patients have no cardio-vascular disease or vessel calcification in pre-op evaluation, the possibility of a complication involving L4-5 should be considered.","1983":"Atlantoaxial rotatory fixation (AARF) in adult is a rare disorder that occurs followed by a trauma. The patients were presented with painful torticollis and a typical 'cock robin' position of the head. The clinical diagnosis is generally difficult and often made in the late stage. In some cases, an irreducible or chronic fixation develops. We reported a case of AARF in adult patient which was treated by immobilization with conservative treatment. A 25-year-old female was presented with a posterior neck pain and limitation of motion of cervical spine after a traffic accident. She had no neurological deficit but suffered from severe defect on the scalp and multiple thoracic compression fractures. Plain radiographs demonstrated torticollis, lateral shift of odontoid process to one side and widening of one side of C1-C2 joint space. Immobilization with a Holter traction were performed and analgesics and muscle relaxants were given. Posterior neck pain and limitation of the cervical spine's motion were resolved. Plain cervical radiographs taken at one month after the injury showed that torticollis disappeared and the dens were in the midline position. The authors reported a case of type I post-traumatic AARF that was successfully treated by immobilization alone.","1984":"Chordoma is a rare bone tumor derived from remnants of the notochord. The majority of chordomas involve the sacrum or skull base. We report a rare case of a L4 vertebral body chordoma treated with anterior en bloc vertebrectomy and posterior stabilization. No tumor recurrence was observed at the 5 year follow-up examination.","1985":"Oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs usually when oculomotor nerve is compressed by growing or budding of posterior communicating artery (PcoA) aneurysm. Midbrain injury, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), or uncal herniation may also cause it. We report herein a rare case of ONP associated with SAH which was caused by middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysm rupture. A 58-year-old woman with clear consciousness suffered from headache and sudden onset of unilateral ONP. Computed tomography showed SAH caused by the rupture of MCA aneurysm. The unilateral ONP was not associated with midbrain injury, increased ICP, or uncal herniation. The patient was treated with coil embolization, and the signs of oculomotor nerve palsy completely resolved after a few days. We suggest that bloody jet flow from the rupture of distant aneurysm other than PcoA aneurysm may also be considered as a cause of sudden unilateral ONP in patients with SAH.","1986":"Carotid occlusion is an inevitable therapeutic modality for the treatment of complex aneurysms such as giant, traumatic, and intracavernous aneurysms. Late complications of carotid occlusion include 'de novo' aneurysm formation at a distant site because of hemodynamic changes in the circle of Willis. We report a case of de novo aneurysm in a vessel that appeared to be normal on initial angiography. The patient developed an anterior communicating artery aneurysm and marked growth of a basilar bifurcation aneurysm 9 years after trapping of the left internal carotid artery for the treatment of a ruptured large saccular aneurysm involving ophthalmic and cavernous segments. We propose that patients who undergo therapeutic carotid occlusion should be periodically followed by magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomographic angiography to evaluate the possibility of de novo aneurysm formation; this advice is in line with previous reports.","1987":"While many factors contribute to aging, changes in calcium homeostasis and calcium related neuronal processes are likely to be important. High intracellular calcium is toxic to cells and alterations in calcium homeostasis are associated with changes in calcium-binding proteins, which confine free Ca(2+). We therefore assayed the expression of the calcium binding proteins calretinin and calbindin in the central auditory nervous system of rats. Using antibodies to calretinin and calbindin, we assayed their expression in the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary nucleus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body and auditory cortex of young (4 months old) and aged (24 months old) rats. Calretinin and calbindin staining intensity in neurons of the cochlear nucleus was significantly higher in aged than in young rats (p&lt;0.05) The number and staining intensity of calretinin-positive neurons in the inferior colliculus, and of calbindin-positive neurons in the superior olivary nucleus were greater in aged than in young rats (p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that auditory processing is altered during aging, which may be due to increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, consequently leading to increased immunoreactivity toward calcium-binding proteins. ","1988":"We aimed to analyze clinical and radiological outcomes retrospectively in patients with basilar apex aneurysms treated by coiling or clipping. Outcomes of basilar bifurcation aneurysms were assessed retrospectively in 77 consecutive patients (61 women, 16 men), ranging in age from 25 to 79 years (mean, 53.7 years) from 1999 to 2007. Forty-nine patients out of 77 patients (63.6%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhages of the 49 patients treated with coiling, 27 (55.1%) showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm sac. Of these, 13 patients (26.5%) developed coil compaction on angiographic or MRI follow-up, with recoiling required in 9 patients (18.4%). Procedural complications of coiling were acute infarction in nine patients and the bleeding of the aneurysms in six patients. The remaining 28 patients underwent microsurgery: twenty-six of these (92.9%) with microsurgery followed up with conventional angiography. Complete occlusion of the aneurysm sac was achieved in 19 patients (73.1%). Operation-related complications of microsurgery were thalamoperforating artery injuries in three patients, retraction venous injury in two, postoperative epidural hemorrhage (EDH) in one, and transient partial or complete occulomotor palsy in 14 patients. Glasgow Outcome Scores (GOS) were 4 or 5 in 21 of 28 (75%) patients treated with microsurgery at discharge, and at 6 month follow-up, 20 of 28 (70.9%) maintained the same GOS. In comparison, GOS of four or 5 was observed in 36 of 49 (73.5%) patients treated with coiling at discharge and at 6 month follow-up, 33 of 49 patients (67.3%) maintained the GOS from discharge. Basilar top aneurysms were still challenging lesions based on our series. Endovascular or microsurgery endowed with its inborn risks and procedural complications for the treatment of basilar apex aneurysms individually. Microsurgery provided better outcome in some specific basilar apex aneurysms. For reaching the most favorable outcome, endovascular modality as well as microsurgery was inevitably considered for each specific basilar apex aneurysm. ","1989":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is frequently used to localize language areas in a non-invasive manner. Various paradigms for presurgical localization of language areas have been developed, but a systematic quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of those paradigms has not been performed. In the present study, the authors analyzed different language paradigms to see which paradigm is most efficient in localizing frontal language areas. Five men and five women with no neurological deficits participated (mean age, 24 years) in this study. All volunteers were right-handed. Each subject performed 4 tasks, including fixation (Fix), sentence reading (SR), pseudoword reading (PR), and word generation (WG). Fixation and pseudoword reading were used as contrasts. The functional area was defined as the area(s) with a t-value of more than 3.92 in fMRI with different tasks. To apply an anatomical constraint, we used a brain atlas mapping system, which is available in AFNI, to define the anatomical frontal language area. The numbers of voxels in overlapped area between anatomical and functional area were individually counted in the frontal expressive language area. Of the various combinations, the word generation task was most effective in delineating the frontal expressive language area when fixation was used as a contrast (p&lt;0.05). The sensitivity of this test for localizing Broca's area was 81% and specificity was 70%. Word generation versus fixation could effectively and reliably delineate the frontal language area. A customized effective paradigm should be analyzed in order to evaluate various language functions. ","1990":"This study is a retrospective clinical study over more than 4 years of follow up to understand the mechanism of load sharing across the graft-bone interface in the static locking plate (SLP) fixation compared with non-locking plate (NLP). Orion locking plates and Top non-locking plates were used for SLP fixation in 29 patients and NLP fixation in 24 patients, respectively. Successful interbody fusion was estimated by dynamic X-ray films. The checking parameters were as follows : screw angle (SA) between upper and lower screw, anterior and posterior height of fusion segment between upper and lower endplate (AH &amp; PH), and upper and lower distance from vertebral endplate to the end of plate (UD &amp; LD). Each follow-up value of AH and PH were compared to initial values. Contributions of upper and lower collapse to whole segment collapse were estimated. Successful intervertebral bone fusion rate was 100% in the SLP group and 92% in the NLP group. The follow-up mean value of SA in SLP group was not significantly changed compared with initial value, but follow-up mean value of SA in NLP group decreased more than those in SLP group (p=0.0067). Statistical analysis did not show a significant difference in the change in AH and PH between SLP and NLP groups (p&gt;0.05). Follow-up AH of NLP group showed more collapse than PH of same group (p=0.04). The upper portion of the vertebral body collapsed more than the lower portion in the SLP fixation (p=0.00058). The fused segments with SLP had successful bone fusion without change in initial screw angle, which was not observed in NLP fixation. It suggests that there was enough load sharing across bone-graft interface in SLP fixation. ","1991":"Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the vertebral body is known as a relatively uncommon phenomenon in a vertebral compression fracture (VCF). The outstanding radiologic findings of AVN are intravertebral vacuum phenomenon with or without fluid collection. Several reports revealed that PVP or balloon kyphoplasty might be the effective treatment modalities for AVN. We also experienced excellent results when using PVP for the treatment of AVN of the vertebral body, and intend to describe the treatment's efficacy in this report. Thirty-two patients diagnosed with AVN of the vertebral body were treated with PVP. We measured the pre- and post-operative anterior body height and kyphotic angulation. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to determine the relief of back pain. The anterior body height (pre-operative : 1.49 cm, post-operative : 2.22 cm) and kyphotic angulation (pre-operative : 14.47 degrees, post-operative : 6.57 degrees) were significantly restored (p&lt;0.001). VAS was improved from 8.9 to 3.7. Pseudoarthrosis was corrected in all cases, which was confirmed by dynamic radiographs. Fluid collection was found in sixteen cases and was aspirated with serous nature. No organism and tumor cell were noted. PVP proved to be an effective procedure for the treatment of AVN of the vertebral body, which corrected dynamic instability and significantly restored the anterior body height and kyphotic angulation. ","1992":"We report the case of a 64-year-old man with dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) at right jugular foramen, presented as subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. The malformation was fed by only the neuromeningeal trunk of the right ascending pharyngeal artery and drained into the right lateral medullary veins craniopetally. Complete embolization was attained by selective transarterial glue injection, but patient showed lower cranial neuropathies. A 3-month follow-up angiogram still showed persistent fistula occlusion. Transarterial glue embolization is a feasible method, only if a transvenous access is not possible in case of single channel fistula.","1993":"Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is almost always induced by vascular compression but in some cases the cause of HFS are tumors at cerebellopontine angle (CPA) or vascular malformations. We present a rare case of hemifacial spasm caused by epidermoid tumors and the possible pathogenesis of HFS is discussed. A 36-year-old female patient presented with a 27-month history of progressive involuntary facial twitching and had been treated with acupuncture and herb medication. On imaging study, a mass lesion was seen at right CPA. Microvascular decompression combined with mass removal was undertaken through retrosigmoid approach. The lesion was avascular mass and diagnosed with an epidermoid tumor pathologically. Eventually, we found a offending vessel (AICA : anterior inferior cerebellar artery) compressing facial nerve root exit zone (REZ). In case of HFS caused by tumor compression on the facial nerve REZ, surgeons should try to find an offending vessel under the mass. This case supports the vascular compression theory as a pathogenesis of HFS.","1994":"We present a case of an acute psoas muscle hematoma following percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy. A 60-year-old female who presented with far lateral lumbar disc herniation underwent endoscopic discectomy on the right side at the L4-5 level. On the second postoperative day, the patient complained of severe right flank and leg pain and her blood pressure decreased. A computed tomography scan showed a large acute psoas muscle hematoma at right L4-5 level. The patient was transfused with packed red blood cells and placed at absolute bed rest. After observing the patient in intensive care, the severe flank and leg pain subsided, but the mild back pain persisted. Although percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy is an effective minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation, this case highlights the inherent risks of acute lumbar segmental vessel injury.","1995":"The presence of distant metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinoma decreases the 10-year survival rates of patients by 50%. This is a report of a 61-year-old female with follicular thyroid carcinoma who presented initially with low back pain. 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose whole-body positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\/CT) demonstrated a hypointensity lesion in the left thyroid gland with malignant uptake in L1 vertebra and magnetic resonance images revealed paravertebral and epidural extension of mass in L1 vertebra. After thyroidectomy, histopathological study showed a follicular carcinoma. We performed L1 total en bloc spondylectomy with expandable cage for long-term local control. The technical details of total en bloc spondylectomy in follicular carcinoma are described herein.","1996":"Although most of sacral perineural cysts are asymptomatic, some may produce symptoms. Specific radicular pain may be due to distortion, compression, or stretching of nerve root by a space occupying cyst. We report a rare case of S1 radiculopathy caused by sacral perineural cyst accompanying disc herniation. The patient underwent a microscopic discectomy at L5-S1 level. However, the patient's symptoms did not improved. The hypesthesia persisted, as did the right leg pain. Cyst-subarachnoid shunt was set to decompress nerve root and to equalize the cerebrospinal fluid pressure between the cephalad thecal sac and cyst. Immediately after surgery, the patient had no leg pain. After 6 months, the patient still remained free of leg pain.","1997":"Acute traumatic spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 level is a rare condition, almost exclusively the result of major trauma, frequently associated with transverse process fractures and severe neurologic deficits. Recently, open reduction and internal fixation with posterior stabilization has been the method of treatment most frequently reported. We report a rare case of traumatic L5-S1 pondylolisthesis with a unilateral facet locking with a review of literatures.","1998":"Ewing's sarcoma usually arises from skeletal bone, but rarely may have an extraskeletal origin. However, Ewing's sarcoma that originates around the spinal column, especially, the intradural extramedullary type is extremely rare. We report a rare case of primary intraspinal extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma.","1999":"Traumatic brainstem hemorrhage after blunt head injury is an uncommon event. The most frequent site of hemorrhage is the midline rostral brainstem. The prognosis of these patients is poor because of its critical location. We experienced a case of traumatic brainstem hemorrhage. A 41-year-old male was presented with drowsy mentality and right hemiparesis after blunt head injury. Plain skull radiographs and brain computerized tomography scans revealed a depressed skull fracture, epidural hematoma, and hemorrhagic contusion in the right parieto-occipital region. But, these findings did not explain the right hemiparesis. T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image of the cervical spine demonstrated a focal hyperintense lesion in the left pontomedullary junction. Brain diffusion-weighted and FLAIR MR images showed a focal hyperintensity in the ventral pontomedullary lesion and it was more prominent in the left side. His mentality and weakness were progressively improved with conservative treatment. We should keep in mind the possibility of brainstem hemorrhage if supratentorial lesions or spinal cord lesions that caused neurological deficits in the head injured patients are unexplainable.","2000":"The goal of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical features of human cadaveric spines implanted with the Activ L prosthesis. Five cadaveric human lumbosacral spines (L2-S2) were tested for different motion modes, i.e. extension and flexion, right and left lateral bending and rotation. Baseline measurements of the range of motion (ROM), disc pressure (DP), and facet strain (FS) were performed in six modes of motion by applying loads up to 8 Nm, with a loading rate of 0.3 Nm\/second. A constant 400 N axial follower preload was applied throughout the loading. After the Activ L was implanted at the L4-L5 disc space, measurements were repeated in the same manner. The Activ L arthroplasty showed statistically significant decrease of ROM during rotation, increase of ROM during flexion and lateral bending at the operative segment and increase of ROM at the inferior segment during flexion. The DP of the superior disc of the operative site was comparable to those of intact spine and the DP of the inferior disc decreased in all motion modes, but these were not statistically significant. For FS, statistically significant decrease was detected at the operative facet during flexion and at the inferior facet during rotation. In vitro physiologic preload setting, the Activ L arthroplasty showed less restoration of ROM at the operative and adjacent levels as compared with intact spine. However, results of this study revealed that there are several possible theoretical useful results to reduce the incidence of adjacent segment disease. ","2001":"Bilateral C1-2 transarticular screw fixation (TAF) with interspinous wiring has been the best treatment for atlantoaxial instability (AAI). However, several factors may disturb satisfactory placement of bilateral screws. This study evaluates the usefulness of unilateral TAF when bilateral TAF is not available. Between January 2003 and December 2007, TAF was performed in 54 patients with AAI. Preoperative studies including cervical x-ray, three dimensional computed tomogram, CT angiogram, and magnetic resonance image were checked. The atlanto-dental interval (ADI) was measured in preoperative period, immediate postoperatively, and postoperative 1, 3 and 6 months. Unilateral TAF was performed in 27 patients (50%). The causes of unilateral TAF were anomalous course of vertebral artery in 20 patients (74%), severe degenerative arthritis in 3 (11%), fracture of C1 in 2, hemangioblastoma in one, and screw malposition in one. The mean ADI in unilateral group was measured as 2.63 mm in immediate postoperatively, 2.61 mm in 1 month, 2.64 mm in 3 months and 2.61 mm in 6 months postoperatively. The mean ADI of bilateral group was also measured as following; 2.76 mm in immediate postoperative, 2.71 mm in 1 month, 2.73 mm in 3 months, 2.73 mm in 6 months postoperatively. Comparison of ADI measurement showed no significant difference in both groups, and moreover fusion rate was 100% in bilateral and 96.3% in unilateral group (p=0.317). Even though bilateral TAF is best option for AAI in biomechanical perspectives, unilateral screw fixation also can be a useful alternative in otherwise dangerous or infeasible cases through bilateral screw placement. ","2002":"In recent years, CyberKnife has emerged as an important treatment modality in the management of pituitary adenomas. Treatment results after performing CyberKnife and the complications of this procedure are reviewed. Twenty-six patients with pituitary adenomas received stereotactic radiosurgery with the CyberKnife (CKRS). The follow-up periods ranged from 7 months to 47 months (mean+\/-SD : 30+\/-12.7 months). The patients consisted of 17 with non-functioning adenomas, 3 with prolactinomas and 6 with acromegaly. The change in the tumor volume, visual acuity, hormonal function, and complications by this therapy were analyzed in each case. The tumor control rate was 92.3%. Hormonal function was improved in all of the 9 (100%) functioning adenomas. Hormonal normalization was observed in 4 of the 9 (44%) patients with a mean duration of 16 months. In two patients (7.6%), visual acuity worsened due to cystic enlargement of the tumor after CKRS. No other complications were observed. CyberKnife is considered safe and effective in selected patients with pituitary adenomas. However, longer follow-up is required for a more complete assessment of late toxicity and treatment efficacy. ","2003":"It is well known that changes in cerebral hemodynamics occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Osmo-regulation in the brain is important for maintaining a constant milieu in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, early osmolarity changes after minor head injury have not been studied until now. In this study, serum osmolarity was measured in 99 patients with minor head trauma. As a control group, blood samples were drawn from 99 patients who had a minor trauma in an extremity. Serum osmolarity was estimated using a fully automatic biochemical autoanalyzer within the first 3 hours after the trauma. The mean serum osmolarity levels were 286.08+\/-10.17 mOsm\/L in the study group and 290.94+\/-5.65 mOsm\/L in the control group (p&lt;0.001). However, after age adjustment between the study and control groups, this statistical significance was found to be valid only for patients over 30 years of age. It was noted that serum osmolarity levels decrease in the first 3 hours following minor head trauma in patients over 30 years of age. Further studies into this area could provide guidance for the management\/treatment of elderly patients. ","2004":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliable factors influencing the surgical outcome of the patients with traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) and to improve the functional outcome of these patients. A total of 256 consecutive patients who underwent surgical intervention for traumatic ASDH between March 1998 and March 2008 were reviewed. We evaluated the influence of perioperative variables on functional recovery and mortality using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Functional recovery was achieved in 42.2% of patients and the overall mortality was 39.8%. Age (OR=4.91, p=0.002), mechanism of injury (OR=3.66, p=0.003), pupillary abnormality (OR=3.73, p=0.003), GCS score on admission (OR=5.64, p=0.000), and intraoperative acute brain swelling (ABS) (OR=3.71, p=0.009) were independent predictors for functional recovery. And preoperative pupillary abnormality (OR=2.60, p=0.023), GCS score (OR=4.66, p=0.000), and intraoperative ABS (OR=4.16, p=0.001) were independent predictors for mortality. Midline shift, thickness and volume of hematoma, type of surgery, and time to surgery showed no independent association with functional recovery, although these variables were correlated with functional recovery in univariate analyses. Functional recovery was more likely to be achieved in patients who were under 40 years of age, victims of motor vehicle collision and having preoperative reactive pupils, higher GCS score and the absence of ABS during surgery. These results would be helpful for neurosurgeon to improve outcomes from traumatic acute subdural hematomas. ","2005":"The advent of endovascular therapy for intracranial aneurysms and the rapid advances in that field have supplanted microsurgical treatment for many intracranial aneurysms. Applying current outcome data and other parameters, nuances of selecting the modality of treatment for intracranial aneurysms are reviewed. Patient factors, such a age, co-morbidities, vasospasm and other medical conditions, are addressed. A custom-tailored multimodality treatment paradigm for the management of ruptured and unruptured aneurysms will maximize the favorable results seen in this difficult patient population.","2006":"","2007":"Single-balloon kyphoplasty via an extrapedicular approach has been reported to be effective because it requires less time than conventional two-balloon kyphoplasty and has comparable therapeutic efficacy. However, single-balloon kyphoplasty is not popular because the extrapedicular approach is believed to be complicated and unsuitable for the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. The authors describe a standardized surgical technique that utilizes a far-lateral extrapedicular approach for single-balloon kyphoplasty, which can be performed in any part of the spine by physicians without substantial difficulty.","2008":"Pituitary apoplexy is a clinical syndrome caused by an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic vascular accident involving a pituitary adenoma or an adjacent pituitary gland. Pituitary apoplexy may be associated with a variety of neurological and endocrinological signs and symptoms. However, isolated third cranial nerve palsy with ptosis as the presenting sign of pituitary apoplexy is very rare. We describe two cases of pituitary apoplexy presenting as sudden-onset unilateral ptosis and diplopia. In one case, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the pituitary fossa with signs of hemorrhage, upward displacement of the optic chiasm, erosion of the sellar floor and invasion of the right cavernous sinus. In the other case, MRI showed a large area of insufficient enhancement in the anterior pituitary consistent with pituitary infarction or Sheehan's syndrome. We performed neurosurgical decompression via a transsphenoidal approach. Both patients showed an uneventful recovery. Both cases of isolated third cranial nerve palsy with ptosis completely resolved during the early postoperative period. We suggest that pituitary apoplexy should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with isolated third cranial nerve palsy with ptosis and that prompt neurosurgical decompression should be considered for the preservation of third cranial nerve function.","2009":"The authors report a case of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) that is supplied by a lateral sacral artery. A 73-year-old male presented with gait disturbance that had developed 3 years ago. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging suggested a possible SDAVF. Selective spinal angiography including the vertebral arteries and pelvic vessels showed the SDAVF fed by left lateral sacral artery. The patient was subsequently treated with glue embolization. Three days after the embolization procedure, his gait disturbance was much improved.","2010":"Clear cell sarcoma (CCS), also called malignant melanoma of soft parts, is a rare malignant soft tissue tumor and is often associated with tendons or aponeuroses. Most of CCS involve extremities, especially lower extremities, but a tumor occurring in the trunk is rare. We report an extremely rare case of CCS originated in the upper thoracic back muscle. To our knowledge, this case is the second report of CCS of the back muscle.","2011":"Meningiomas are usually benign neoplasms in which extracranial metastases occur very rarely. We report a case of multiple extracranial metastases of an atypical meningioma following a local recurrence. A 68-year-old man presented with left-side motor weakness and dysarthria for two weeks. A computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intraventricular tumor. We performed a total mass removal, and the histopathologic findings were consistent with benign meningioma. Eight months later, the meningioma recurred. We performed a reoperation and whole brain radiation therapy postoperatively. The histopathologic findings showed atypical meningioma. Six months later, CT and MRI revealed metastases to multiple vertebrae, lung, ribs and perirenal soft tissue so a decompressive laminectomy with mass removal was performed. The histopathologic findings of the spinal tumors showed atypical meningioma. The results from perirenal biopsies were consistent with metastatic meningioma. In conclusion, extracranial metastasis as well as local recurrence must be considered in atypical or anaplastic meningioma. There must be regular follow-ups. Finally, an evaluation of the chest, abdomen and bone is necessary, especially when related symptoms or signs develop.","2012":"Intracranial schwannomas preferentially arise from the vestibular branch of the eighth nerve, and rarely from the trigeminal nerve, facial nerve, and lower cranial nerves. Anterior cranial fossa schwannomas are extremely uncommon and few details about them have been reported. The patient was a 39-year-old woman whose chief complaints were anosmia and frontal headache for 2 years. The gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an extra-axial mass from ethmoid sinus to right frontal base region near the midline, with solid enhancement in lower portion and multicystic formation in upper portion. The tumor was totally resected via basal subfrontal approach. At operation, the tumor had cystic portion with marginal calcification and the anterior skull base was destructed by the tumor. The olfactory bulb was involved, and the tumor capsule did not contain neoplastic cells. The histopathological diagnosis was schwannoma. We report a rare case of anterior cranial fossa schwannoma with literature review.","2013":"Inflammatory pseudotumor is an uncommon lesion with unknown etiology characterized by sclerosing inflammation which clinically and radiographically mimics a neoplastic lesion. A 47-year-old man presented with sudden headache and dysarthria. Brain CT scan revealed a 2.6x2.2 cm sized, round, and hyperdense mass in the anterolateral wall of the left lateral ventricular trigone. On MR imaging studies, the mass showed low signal intensity in the wall of the trigone on T2-weighted image, central mixed (iso- and high-) signal intensity with peripheral low-signal intensity on T1-weighted image. Subtle staining of left choroid plexus with irregular shaped distal branch of anterior choroidal artery was found on the cerebral angiography. These findings suggested a small tumorous lesion originated from the left choroid plexus. During the hospital days, the mass manifested as repeated hemorrhages. The mass was successfully removed via left occipital transcortical approach. The histopathological report of the specimen was hemorrhage and fibrosis, with dense lymphoplasma cell infiltration, suggestive of an inflammatory pseudotumor.","2014":"Acute epidural hematoma (AEDH) occurring as a result of traumatic head injury constitutes one of the most critical emergencies in neurosurgery. However, there are only several reports that show the rapid disappearance of AEDH without surgical intervention. We suggest redistribution of hematoma through the overlying skull fractures as the mechanism of rapid disappearance of AEDH. A 13-year-old female fell from a height of about 2 m and presented with mild headache. A computed tomography (CT) scan performed 4 hours after the injury revealed an AEDH with an overlying fracture in the right temporal region and acute small hemorrhagic contusion in the left frontal region. A repeat CT scan 16 hours after injury revealed that the AEDH had almost completely disappeared and showed an increase in the epicranial hematoma. The patient was discharged 10 days after injury with no neurological deficits. This case is characterized by the rapid disappearance of an AEDH associated with an overlying skull fracture. We believe that the rapid disappearance of the AEDH is due to the redistribution of the hematoma, rather than its resolution or absorption, and fracture plays a key role in this process.","2015":"We aimed to identify clinico-radiological risk factors that may predict unfavorable neurological outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to establish a guideline for patient selection in clinical trials that would improve neurological outcome during the early post TBI period. Initial clinico-radiological data of 115 TBI patients were collected prospectively. Regular neurological assessment after standard treatment divided the above patients into 2 groups after 6 months : the Favorable neurological outcome group (GOS : good &amp; moderate disability, DRS : 0-6, LCFS : 8-10) and the Unfavorable group (GOS : severe disability-death, DRS : 7-29 and death, LCFS : 1-7 and death). There was a higher incidence of age &gt;\/=35 years, low initial GCS score, at least unilateral pupil dilatation, and neurological deficit in the Unfavorable group. The presence of bilateral parenchymal lesions or lesions involving the midline structures in the initial brain CT was observed to be a radiological risk factor for unfavorable outcome. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age and initial GCS score were independent risk factors. The majority of the Favorable group patients with at least one or more risk factors showed improvement of GCS scores within 2 months after TBI. Patients with the above mentioned clinico-radiological risk factors who received standard treatment, but did not demonstrate neurological improvement within 2 months after TBI were deemed at risk for unfavorable outcome. These patients may be eligible candidates for clinical trials that would improve functional outcome after TBI. ","2016":"The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) reported that the 5-year cumulative rupture rate of small unruptured aneurysms less than 7 mm in diameter is very low depending on the aneurysm's location. However, we have seen a large number of ruptured aneurysms less than 7 mm in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to review our experience and to measure the size and location at which aneurysms ruptured in our patient population. We reviewed the characteristics of aneurysms, such as size and location, from the original angiograms of patients who were admitted to our hospital between January 2004 and December 2007. All aneurysms were treated surgically or through endovascular procedures. Interventional or surgical treatment was given to a total of 889 patients, including 568 females and 321 males. At the time of our study, 627 cases were ruptured aneurysms and 262 cases were unruptured aneurysms. Of the ruptured cases, the mean diameter of the aneurysm was 6.28 mm. We found that 71.8% of ruptured aneurysms were smaller than 7 mm in diameter, and 87.9%, were smaller than 10 mm. Based on location, the data show that anterior communicating artery aneurysms most often presented with rupture sizes less than 7 mm (76.8%) and 10 mm (92.1%) in diameter. Most ruptured aneurysms were less than 7 mm in size, although recent studies have noted that small aneurysms are less likely to rupture. Although the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms remains controversial, the aneurysm size and location play a signigicant role in determining the risk of rupture. Larger sample sizes and a long term study are needed to reveal the natural history and the rupture risk of unruptured intracranial aneurysms because the size of most ruptured aneurysms was less than 7 mm in diameter in our series. ","2017":"Many biomechanical and clinical studies on adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) have addressed cranial segment. No study has been conducted on caudal segment degeneration after upper segment multiple lumbar fusions. This is a retrospective investigation of the L5-S1 segment after spinal fusion at and above L4-5, which was undertaken to analyze the rate of caudal ASD at L5-S1 after spinal fusion on and above L4-5 and to determine that factors that might have influenced it. The authors included 67 patients with L4-5, L3-5, or L2-5 posterior fusions. Among these patients, 28 underwent L4-5 fusion, 23 L3-5, and 16 L2-5 fusions. Pre- and postoperative radiographs were analyzed to assess degenerative changes at L5-S1. Also, clinical results after fusion surgery were analyzed. Among the 67 patients, 3 had pseudoarthrosis, and 35 had no evidence of ASD, cranially and caudally. Thirteen patients (19.4%) showed caudal ASD, 23 (34.3%) cranial ASD, and 4 (6.0%) both cranial and caudal ASD. Correlation analysis for caudal ASD at L5-S1 showed that pre-existing L5-S1 degeneration was most strongly correlated. In addition, numbers of fusion segments and age were also found to be correlated. Clinical outcome was not correlated with caudal ASD at L5-S1. If caudal and cranial ASD are considered, the overall occurrence rate of ASD increases to 50%. The incidence rate of caudal ASD at L5-S1 was significantly lower than that of cranial ASD. Furthermore, the occurrence of caudal ASD was found to be significantly correlated with pre-existing disc degeneration. ","2018":"To evaluate clinical and radiological results of two different fusion techniques in adult low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis. Between November 2003 and December 2004, 46 consecutive patients underwent instrumented mini-transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (mini-TLIF) (group I) at Wooridul Spine Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Between February 2003 and October 2006, 32 consecutive patients underwent instrumented circumferential fusion (group II) at Leon Wiltse Memorial Hospital, Suwon, Korea. The mean follow-up periods were 29.7 and 26.1 months, respectively. Mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores for back and leg pain decreased, respectively, from 6.98 and 6.33 to 2.3 and 2.2 in group I and from 7.38 and 6.00 to 1.7 and 1.0 in group II. Mean Oswestry disability index (ODI) improved from 51.85% to 14.4% in group I and from 60% to 9.1% in group II. In both groups, VAS and ODI scores significantly changed from pre- to postoperatively (p&lt;0.001), but postoperative outcome between groups was statistically not significant. Radiologic evidence of fusion was noted in 95.7% and 100% of the patients in group I and II, respectively. In both groups, changes in disc height, segmental lordosis, degree of listhesis, and whole lumbar lordosis between the pre- and postoperative periods were significant except whole lumbar lordosis in both groups. Clinical and functional outcomes demonstrate no significant differences between groups in treating back and leg pain of adult patients with low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis. However, in terms of operative data (i.e. operation time and hospital stay), instrumented mini-TLIF demonstrated better results. ","2019":"Although endoscopic procedures for lumbar disc diseases have improved greatly, the postoperative outcomes for high grade inferior migrated discs are not satisfactory. Because of anatomic limitations, a rigid endoscope cannot reach all lesions effectively. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of endoscopic transforaminal suprapedicular approach to high grade inferior-migrated lumbar disc herniations. Between May 2006 and March 2008, a suprapedicular approach was performed in 53 patients with high grade inferior-migrated lumbar disc herniations using a rigid endoscope and a semi-rigid flexible curved probe. One-to-four hours after surgery, the presence of remnant discs was checked with MRI. The outcomes were evaluated with the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) one week after surgery. The L2-3 level was involved in 2 patients and the L3-4 level was involved in 14 patients, while the L4-5 level was involved in 39 patients. There were single piece-type in 34 cases and a multiple piece-type in 19 cases. Satisfactory results were obtained in all cases. The mean preoperative VAS for leg pain was 9.32+\/-0.43 points (range, 7-10 points), whereas the mean ODI was 79.82+\/-4.53 points (range, 68-92 points). At the last follow-up examination, the mean postoperative VAS for leg pain was 1.78+\/-0.71 points and the mean postoperative ODI improved to 15.27+\/-3.82 points. A high grade inferior migrated lumbar disc is difficult to remove sufficiently by posterolateral endoscopic lumbar dscectomy using a rigid endoscope. However, a satisfactory result can be obtained by applying a transforaminal suprapedicular approach with a flexible semi-rigid curved probe. ","2020":"Guyon's canal at the wrist is not the common site of ulnar nerve compression. Ganglion, lipoma, anomalous tendon and muscles, trauma related to an occupation, arthritis, and carpal bone fracture can cause ulnar nerve compression at the wrist. However, ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal by vascular lesion is rare. Ulnar artery aneurysm, tortous ulnar artery, hemangioma, and thrombosis have been reported in the literature as vascular lesions. The authors experienced a case of ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal by an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and the patient's symptom was improved after surgical resection. We can not easily predict vascular lesion as a cause of ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal. However, if there is not obvious etiology, we should consider vascular lesion as another possible etiology.","2021":"The authors present a case of subdural empyema in a macrocephalic patient. A 23-year-old male was admitted due to headache and fever. One month ago, he had mild head injury by his coworkers. Physical examination showed a macrocephaly and laboratory findings suggested purulent meningitis. Neuroimaging studies revealed a huge size of epidural space-occupying lesion. Under the impression of epidural abscess, operation was performed. Eventually, the lesion was located at subdural space and was proven to be subdural empyema. Later, histological examination of the specimen obtained by surgery demonstrated finings consistent with the capsule of the chronic subdural hematoma. Two weeks after operation, Propionibacterium acnes was isolated. The intravenous antibiotics were used for total of eight weeks under monitoring of the serum level of the C-reactive protein. Follow-up brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of significant amount of remaining subdural lesion. However, he has complained of minimal discomfort. It is suggested that the subdural empyema occurred with preexisting chronic subdural hematoma after head injury about one month prior to admission and it took a long time to treat Propionibacterium acnes subdural empyema with systemic antibiotics, at least over eight weeks.","2022":"A 31-year-old man presented with dull headache and memory disturbance lasting for one week. Computed tomographic scans revealed acute hydrocephalus. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 53 leukocytes\/mm(3), with a mononuclear preponderance and no erythrocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hydrocephalus and leptomeningeal enhancement. Magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography showed supraclinoid occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, which resembled unilateral moyamoya disease. Neuroendoscopic biopsy of a lesion in the septum pellucidum revealed noncaseating granulomas, which was consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient was successfully managed with intravenous methylprednisolone and ventriculoperitoneal shunting. To our knowledge, this is the first case of moyamoya-like vasculopathy associated with neurosarcoidosis.","2023":"Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are hemodynamically low flow, low resistance vascular malformations without clinical significance. Although most DVAs are asymptomatic and are found incidentally, sometimes they can be symptomatic with intracerebral hemorrhage, many of which are usually caused by associated cavernous malformations (CMs) rather than the DVAs themselves. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature where an intracerebral hemorrhage has been caused by a DVA alone. This report describes a case of an intracerebral hemorrhage due to DVA alone with review of the literature.","2024":"A 75-year-old female presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography revealed a partial duplication (fenestration) in the proximal A(1) segment and a ruptured aneurysm at the distal end of A(1) fenestration. This congenital anomaly accompanying an aneurysm was associated with duplicated ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA). Congenital defect of the arterial wall and hemodynamic factors at the fenestrated A(1) are considered to play a significant role in the development of this aneurysm. The present case is peculiar because not only the ruptured A(1) aneurysm was related with the anterior and middle cerebral artery duplication but also the location of A(1) fenestration and the origin of A(1) aneurysm in a fenestration are quite unusual.","2025":"We report a supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNET) in 17-year-old primipara in the second trimester her pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left frontoparietal mass with solid and cystic component. Gross-total resection was achieved via a left frontoparietal craniotomy. It was decided to suspend the radiotherapy and chemotherapy until the 30 weeks of gestation. But, a sudden uncal herniation was developed due to the reccurrence of the tumor and bleeding into the tumor at the 25 weeks of gestation and the patient died after urgent decompressive surgery. sPNETs is an extremely rare brain tumor in pregnancy and only two cases were reported in the literature to date. There is no universally agreed treatment protocol for sPNETs during pregnancy and a multidisciplinary approach is required in treatment. In the present study, the clinical, histopathological features and therapeutical difficulties of sPNETs diagnosed during pregnancy was discussed with the literature review.","2026":"We present a patient with multifocal symptomatic osseous chordomas having unusual growth patterns with review of the pertinent literature. The patient was 62-year-old male and had multiple osseous chordomas located in sacral, thoracic, and paraclival jugular foramen areas. There was no metastasis in other organs. All affected sites were osseous. The multicentric chordomas are extremely rare. This case could be considered as a chordoma involving multiple neuraxial bones. But, the possibility of multicentricity could also be thought. In such cases radical resection should be performed for each lesion at the initial diagnosis. If complete surgical resections are infeasible or impossible, preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy should be planned for the highest possibility of successful treatment.","2027":"The common carotid artery generally bifurcates into the internal and external carotid arteries at the level of C3-4. Injury to the common carotid artery during anterior cervical discectomy is a complication that is very much feared but encountered rarely. Knowing the anatomic variations of the common carotid artery and using an operating microscope during the anterior cervical approach for cases with low-lying bifurcation of the common carotid artery would prevent injuries to this artery. We present a 42-year-old female who has successfully undergone anterior cervical discectomy at the level of C5-6 and C6-7. She had a low-lying bifurcation of the common carotid artery.","2028":"To investigate the effectiveness of radiographic parameters on segmental instability in the lumbar spine using Kinetic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Segmental motion, defined as excessive (more than 3 mm) translational motion from flexion to extension, was investigated in 309 subjects (927 segments) using Kinetic MRI. Radiographic parameters which can help indicate segmental instability include disc degeneration (DD), facet joint osteoarthritis (FJO), and ligament flavum hypertrophy (LFH). These three radiographic parameters were simultaneously evaluated, and the combinations corresponding to significant segmental instability at each level were determined. The overall incidence of segmental instability was 10.5% at L3-L4, 16.5% at L4-L5, and 7.3% at L5-S1. DD and LFH at L3-L4 and FJO and LFH at L4-L5 were individually associated with segmental instability (p&lt;0.05). At L4-L5, the following combinations had a higher incidence of segmental instability (p&lt;0.05) when compared to other segments : (1) Grade IV DD with grade 3 FJO, (2) Grade 2 or 3 FJO with the presence of LFH, and (3) Grade IV DD with the presence of LFH. At L5-S1, the group with Grade III disc and Grade 3 FJO had a higher incidence of segmental instability than the group with Grade I or II DD and Grade 1 FJO. This study showed that the presences of either Grade IV DD or grade 3 FJO with LFH at L4-L5 were good indicators for segmental instability. Therefore, using these parameters simultaneously in patients with segmental instability would be useful for determining candidacy for surgical treatment. ","2029":"This retrospective study of 215 patients with 383 symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), was performed to evaluate the clinical outcomes, and to analyze the various clinical factors affecting these results. The authors assessed the clinical outcome under the criteria such as the pain improvement, activity, requirement of analgesics, and the patient's satisfaction, and determined the relation to various peri- and intra-operative factors, and postoperative imaging findings. The outcome was determined as 84.2% in relief of pain, 72.0% in change in activity, 65.7% in analgesics use, and 84.7% of satisfaction rate. More severe focal back pain, high uptake bone scan, and the lower mean T-score were related to the better pain relief following PVP. The longer the duration between fracture and PVP, the less severe focal back pain, low uptake bone scan, and leakage of PMMA into the paravertebral space were related to the less improvement in activity. Female and low uptake bone scan showed a correlation with more analgesic use. The longer the duration between fracture and PVP, low uptake bone scan, and the higher the mean T-score were correlated with the less the patients satisfaction. Our study suggests that PVP may be more effective in the acute phase of VCFs, more severe focal pain, and far advanced osteoporosis on BMD. Leakage of PMMA into the paravertebral spcae also could be affecting the surgical results. ","2030":"The aim of study was to review our patient population to determine whether there is a critical aneurysm size at which the incidence of rupture increases and whether there is a correlation between aneurysm size and location. We reviewed charts and radiological findings (computed tomography (CT) scans, angiograms, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography) for all patients operated on for intracranial aneurysms in our hospital between September 2002 and May 2004. Of the 336 aneurysms that were reviewed, measurements were obtained from angiograms for 239 ruptured aneurysms by a neuroradiologist at the time of diagnosis in our hospital. There were 115 male and 221 female patients assessed in this study. The locations of aneurysms were the middle cerebral artery (MCA, 61), anterior communicating artery (ACoA, 66), posterior communicating artery (PCoA, 52), the top of the basilar artery (15), internal carotid artery (ICA) including the cavernous portion (13), anterior choroidal artery (AChA, 7), A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (3), A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (11), posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA, 8), superior cerebellar artery (SCA, 2), P2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (1), and the vertebral artery (2). The mean diameter of aneurysms was 5.47+\/-2.536 mm in anterior cerebral artery (ACA), 6.84+\/-3.941 mm in ICA, 7.09+\/-3.652 mm in MCA and 6.21+\/-3.697 mm in vertebrobasilar artery. The ACA aneurysms were smaller than the MCA aneurysms. Aneurysms less than 6 mm in diameter included 37 (60.65%) in patients with aneurysms in the MCA, 43 (65.15%) in patients with aneurysms in the ACoA and 29 (55.76%) in patients with aneurysms in the PCoA. Ruptured aneurysms in the ACA were smaller than those in the MCA. The most prevalent aneurysm size was 3-6 mm in the MCA (55.73%), 3-6 mm in the ACoA (57.57%) and 4-6 mm in the PCoA (42.30%). The more prevalent size of the aneurysm to treat may differ in accordance with the location of the aneurysm. ","2031":"Direct surgical clipping of paraclinoid aneurysms poses technical challenges to even very experienced neurosurgeons, making endovascular treatment an alternative treatment modality in many centers. We have therefore retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular detachable coil embolization of paraclinoid aneurysms. From June 1997 to June 2007, 65 patients underwent endovascular detachable coiling for 67 paraclinoid aneurysms (of which 9 were ruptured and 58 were unruptured) in our institute. Their medical records, radiological images and readings, and operation records were reviewed retrospectively. After the initial embolization procedure, complete occlusion was achieved in 29 (43.3%) of the aneurysms treated by endovascular detachable coiling. Six aneurysms required retreatment, with two each requiring one, two, or three additional endovascular procedures. Fifty-five (82.1%) aneurysms were measured by three-dimensional time of flight (TOF) magnetic resonance images (MRI) or transfemoral cerebral angiography (TFCA) at a mean follow-up of 29.7 months (range from 4 to 94 months), with 39 aneurysms (70.9%) showing complete occlusion. Thromboembolic events (3.8%) were the most frequent complication. Rupture did not occur during or after any of the procedures. According to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), 98.4% of the patients treated by coil embolization had a score of 4 or 5. Our results indicate that endovascular detachable coiling is a safe and effective treatment modality in paraclinoid aneurysms. ","2032":"In the present study, the authors investigated the clinical and imaging features as well as the therapeutic outcomes of SIH (spontaneous intracranial hypotension) patients. A retrospective review of 12 SIH patients was carried out. The diagnostic work-up included lumbar tapping and measurement of CSF opening pressure, radioisotope cisternography, brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) myelography. Autologous epidural blood patching was performed in patients who did not respond to conservative therapies, including analgesics, steroids, hydration and rest. Typical postural headache was found in 11 (91%) patients. Nine (75%) patients showed pachymeningeal enhancement on their initial T1-weighted MR images. The CSF opening pressure was less than 60 mmH(2)O in 9 of 11 patients. Autologous epidural blood patching was performed in 7 patients, and all of them showed good responses. SIH can present with various clinical presentations and neuroimaging findings. Autologous epidural blood patching is thought to be the treatment of choice for patients with SIH. ","2033":"GBM is the most common primary brain tumor, but intraventricular GBM is rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. The authors report a case of 64-year-old man who had a remote history of previous periventricular intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed an intraventricular lesion with inhomogeneous enhancement, infiltrative borders and necrotic cyst, and obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient underwent surgical removal through transcortical route via the bottom of previous hemorrhage site and the final pathologic diagnosis was GBM. We present a rare case of an intraventricular GBM with detailed clinical course, radiological findings, and pathological findings, and the possible origin of this lesion is discussed.","2034":"Primary intracranial squamous cell carcinoma is extremely rare, with most cases arising from a preexisting benign epidermoid cyst. We report a rare case of primary intracranial squamous cell carcinoma in the brain stem with a cerebellopontine angle (CPA) epidermoid cyst. A 72-year-old female suffered from progressive left hemiparesis, difficulty in swallowing, and right hemifacial numbness. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high signal intensity (SI) lesion in the CPA region and an intra-axially ring-enhanced cystic mass in the right brain stem with low SI. Whole-body positron emission tomography showed no evidence of metastatic disease. The histological findings revealed a typical epidermoid cyst in the CPA region and a squamous cell carcinoma in the brain stem. We speculate that the squamous cell carcinoma may have been developed due to a chronic inflammatory response by the adjacent epidermoid cyst. The patient underwent a surgical resection and radiotherapy. After 12 months, she had no evidence of recurrence.","2035":"Hemifacial spasm induced by intracranial aneurysm is a rare clinical condition. A 45-year-old male patient presented with a 3-year history of progressive involuntary twitching movement on right face. On radiological study, a dilated vascular lesion compressing the brain stem was found at the junction of vertebral artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery. On operative field, we found the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and the fusiform aneurysm compressing root exit zone of facial nerve. Microvascular decompression was performed and the facial symptom was relieved without complications.","2036":"Although the incidence of unilateral abducens nerve palsy has been reported to be as high as 1% to 2.7% of head trauma cases, bilateral abducens nerve palsy following trauma is extremely rare. In this report, we present the case of a patient who developed a bilateral abducens nerve palsy and hypoglossal nerve palsy 3 days after suffering head trauma. He had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15 points. Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated clivus epidural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage on the basal cistern. Herein, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these nerve palsies and its management.","2037":"Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy occurring during spinal surgery is frequently related to iliac bone graft harvesting, but meralgia paresthetica (MP) can result from the patient being in the prone position. Prone position-related MP is not an uncommon complication after posterior spine surgery but there are only few reports in the literature on this subject. It is usually overlooked because of its mild symptoms and self-limiting course, or patients and physicians may misunderstand the persistence of lower extremity symptoms in the early postoperative period to be a reflection of poor surgical outcome. The authors report a case of prone position-related MP after posterior lumbar interbody fusion at the L3-4 and reviewed the literature with discussion on the incidence, pathogenesis, and possible risk factors related to this entity.","2038":"Congenital absence of a cervical spine pedicle is a rare clinical entity, and it is usually found incidentally on radiological studies performed after trauma in patients with cervical pain. We report two cases of congenital absence of a cervical spine pedicle and present a review of the literature.","2039":"We herein describe the case of a focal spontaneous spinal epidural abscess who was initially diagnosed to have a free fragment of a lumbar disc. A 71-year-old woman presented with history of low back and right leg pain. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested a peripherally enhancing free fragment extending down from S1 nerve root axilla. Preoperative laboratory investigation showed elevation of c-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. She was taken for surgery and a fluctuating mass at the axilla of S1 nerve was found. When the mass was probed with a dissector, a dark yellow, thick pus drained out. Pus cultures were negative. Patients who present with extreme low back plus leg pain and increased leucocyte count, ESR and CRP levels should raise the suspicion of an infection of a vertebral body or spinal epidural space.","2040":"Gas forming brain abscess is a rare disease caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae occurring in patients with impaired host defense mechanism such as diabetes mellitus or liver cirrhosis. A 59-year-old man with 2-year history of diabetes mellitus and 20-year history of liver cirrhosis presented to the hospital with headache. On the day after admission, severe headache was developed and he deteriorated rapidly. Brain CT showed a non-enhanced mass including multiple air density as well as surrounding edema seen in the right occipital lobe, and isodensity air-fluid level seen in the right lateral ventricle. Despite emergent ventricular drainage and intraventricular and intravenous administration of antibiotics, his condition progressively worsened to sepsis and to death after 5 days. Bacterial culture of blood and ventricular fluids disclosed a Gram (-) rod, Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this report we review the pathogenic mechanism and its management.","2041":"The effects on neural proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSC) of basic fibroblast growth factor-2 (bFGF), insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) were assessed. Also, following combinations of various factors were investigated : bFGF+IGF-I, bFGF+BDNF, bFGF+NGF, IGF-I+BDNF, IGF-I+NGF, and BDNF+NGF. Isolated NSC of Fisher 344 rats were cultured with individual growth factors, combinations of factors, and no growth factor (control) for 14 days. A proportion of neurons was analyzed using beta-tubulin III and NeuN as neural markers. Neural differentiations in the presence of individual growth factors for beta-tubulin III-positive cells were : BDNF, 35.3%; IGF-I, 30.9%; bFGF, 18.1%; and NGF, 15.1%, and for NeuN-positive cells was : BDNF, 34.3%; bFGF, 32.2%; IGF-1, 26.6%; and NGF, 24.9%. However, neural differentiations in the absence of growth factor was only 2.6% for beta-tubulin III and 3.1% for NeuN. For beta-tubulin III-positive cells, neural differentiations were evident for the growth factor combinations as follows : bFGF+IGF-I, 73.1%; bFGF+NGF, 65.4%; bFGF+BDNF, 58.7%; BDNF+IGF-I, 52.2%; NGF+IGF-I, 40.6%; and BDNF+NGF, 40.0%. For NeuN-positive cells : bFGF+IGF-I, 81.9%; bFGF+NGF, 63.5%; bFGF+BDNF, 62.8%; NGF+IGF-I, 62.3%; BDNF+NGF, 56.3%; and BDNF+IGF-I, 46.0%. Significant differences in neural differentiation were evident for single growth factor and combination of growth factors respectively (p&lt;0.05). Combinations of growth factors have an additive effect on neural differentiation. The most prominent neural differentiation results from growth factor combinations involving bFGF and IGF-I. These findings suggest that the combination of a mitogenic action of bFGF and postmitotic differentiation action of IGF-I synergistically affects neural proliferation and NSC differentiation. ","2042":"Aim of study was to find a proper method for assessing subsidence using a radiologic measurement following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with stand-alone polyetheretherketone (PEEK), Solistrade mark cage. Forty-two patients who underwent ACDF with Solistrade mark cage were selected. With a minimum follow-up of 6 months, the retrospective investigation was conducted for 37 levels in 32 patients. Mean follow-up period was 18.9 months. Total intervertebral height (TIH) of two fused vertebral bodies was measured on digital radiographs with built-in software. Degree of subsidence (DeltaTIH) was reflected by the difference between the immediate postoperative and follow-up TIH. Change of postoperative disc space height (CT-MRDeltaTIH) was reflected by the difference between TIH of the preoperative mid-sagittal 2D CT and that of the preoperative mid-sagittal T1-weighted MRI. Compared to preoperative findings, postoperative disc height was increased in all cases and subsidence was observed only in 3 cases. For comparison of subsidence and non-subsidence group, TIH and CT-MRDeltaTIH of each group were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in TIH and CT-MRDeltaTIH between each group at 4 and 8 weeks, but a difference was observed at the last follow-up TIH (p=0.0497). ACDF with Solistrade mark cage was associated with relatively good radiologic long-term results. Fusion was achieved in 94.5% and subsidence occurred in 8.1% by the radiologic assessment. Statistical analysis reveals that the subsidence seen later than 8 weeks after surgery and the development of subsidence does not correlate statistically with the change of the postoperative disc space height. ","2043":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular therapy as a primary treatment for spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). The authors reviewed 18 patients with spinal DAVFs for whom endovascular therapy was considered as an initial treatment at a single institute between 1993 and 2006. NBCA embolization was considered the primary treatment of choice, with surgery reserved for patients in whom endovascular treatment failed. Surgery was performed as the primary treatment in one patient because the anterior spinal artery originated from the same arterial pedicle as the artery feeding the fistula. Embolization was used as the primary treatment modality in 17 patients, with an initial success rate of 82.4%. Two patients with incomplete embolization had to undergo surgery. One patient underwent multiple embolizations, which failed to completely occlude the fistula but relieved the patient's symptoms. Spinal DAVF recurred in two patients (one collateral development and one recanalization) during the follow-up period. The collateral development was obliterated by repeated embolization, but the patient with recanalization refused further treatment. The overall clinical status improved in 15 patients (83.3%) during the follow-up period. Endovascular therapy can be successfully used as a primary treatment for the majority of patients with spinal DAVFs. Although it is difficult to perform in some patients, endovascular embolization should be the primary treatment of choice for spinal DAVF. ","2044":"This study was performed to assess the efficacy of GKS in patients with ten or more brain metastases. From Aug 2002 to Dec 2007, twenty-six patients (13 men and 13 women) with ten or more cerebral metastatic lesions underwent GKS. The mean age was 55 years (32-80). All patients had Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score of 70 or better. According to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification, 3 patients belonged to class I and 23 to class II. The location of primary tumor was lung (21), breast (3) and unknown (2). The mean number of the lesions per patient was 16.6 (10-37). The mean cumulated volume was 10.9 cc (1.0-42.2). The median marginal dose was 15 Gy (9-23). Overall survival and the prognostic factors for the survival were retrospectively analyzed by using Kaplan Meier method and univariate analysis. Overall median survival from GKS was 34 weeks (8-199). Local control was possible for 79.5% of the lesions and control of all the lesions was possible in at least 14 patients (53.8%) until 6 months after GKS. New lesions appeared in 7 (26.9%) patients during the same period. At the last follow-up, 18 patients died; 6 (33.3%) from systemic causes, 10 (55.6%) from neurological causes, and 2 (11.1%) from unknown causes. Synchronous onset in non-small cell lung cancer (p=0.007), high KPS score (&gt;\/=80, p=0.029), and controlled primary disease (p=0.020) were favorable prognostic factors in univariate analysis. In carefully selected patients, GKS may be a treatment option for ten or more brain metastases. ","2045":"Many vascular neurosurgeons tend to remove bone flap in patients with large aneurysmal intracerebral hematomas (ICH). However, relatively little work has been done regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic decompressive craniectomy in a patient with a large aneurysmal ICH. Large ICH was defined as hematoma when its volume exceeded 25 mL, ipsilateral to aneurysms. The patients were divided into two groups; aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) associated with large ICH, January, 1994 - December, 1999 (Group A, 41 patients), aneurysmal SAH associated with large ICH, January, 2000 - May, 2005 (Group B, 27 patients). Demographic and clinical variables including age, sex, hypertension, vasospasm, rebleeding, Hunt-Hess grade, aneurysm location, aneurysm size, and outcome were compared between two groups, and also compared between craniotomy and craniectomy patients in Group A. In Group A, 21 of 41 patients underwent prophylactic decompressive craniectomy. In Group B, only two patients underwent craniectomy. Surgical outcome in Group A (good 23, poor 18) was statistically not different from Group B (good 15, poor 12). Surgical outcomes between craniectomy (good 12, poor 9) and craniotomy cases (good 11, poor 9) in Group A were also comparable. We recommend that a craniotomy can be carried out safely without prophylactic craniectomy in patients with a large aneurysmal ICH if intracranial pressure is controllable with hematoma evacuation. ","2046":"We report a case of trigonal cavernous malformation (CM) radiologically mimicking meningioma. The computed tomographic (CT) head angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a partially calcified lesion with slight contrast enhancement located in the area of the left atrium of lateral ventricle. The lesion was completely removed using microsurgery with a parieto-occipital transcortical approach. The resected mass was histologically confirmed as CM. CM should be considered as differential diagnosis in case of the atrial mass lesion due to lack of hemosiderin ring characteristically seen other seated CM.","2047":"The authors present a case of 68-year-old woman who underwent resection of a metastatic adenocarcinoma in the left parietooccipital area. The intraoperative course was uneventful; however, after closure of the scalp incision, increased bleeding from the suture line was noted. A computerized tomography scan that was performed immediately after operation revealed acute epidural hemorrhage with mass effect under the bone flap. The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and immediate re-exploration was performed. This patient was successfully treated owing to early recognition of the condition and immediate treatment with transfusion. Neurosurgeons should be alert that hypercoagulabe state is common in cancer patients and consumptive coagulopathy can occur after resection of metastatic brain tumor.","2048":"A rare case of ruptured aneurysm associated with multiple A(1) fenestrations resembling plexiform network was demonstrated by 3D angiography. A 56-year-old female presented with a ruptured aneurysm in the A(2) segment of the left distal anterior cerebral artery associated with the right A(1) fenestration. The ruptured aneurysm was occluded with surgical neck clipping via interhemispheric approach without neurological deficit. Plexiform fenestrations of the right distal A(1), opposite side to the left ruptured A(2) aneurysm, were clearly visible on postoperative 3D angiography. Our case may strongly support the theory described by Paget, namely that a remnant of the plexiform anastomosis between the primitive olfactory artery and A(1) segment is the source of such fenestration.","2049":"Spinal intradural extramedullary teratoma is a rare condition that develops more commonly in children than in adults and may be associated with spinal dysraphism. We report a rare case of adult-onset intradural extramedullary teratoma in the thoracolumbar spinal cord with no evidence of spinal dysraphism and without the history of prior spinal surgery. The patient was a 38-year-old male whose chief complaint was urinary incontinence. X-ray images of the thoracolumbar spine showed the widening of the interpedicular distance and posterior marginal erosion of the vertebral bodies and pedicles at the T11, T12, and L1 level. Magnetic resonance imagings of the lumbar spine showed a lobulated inhomogeneous high signal intradural mass (87x29x20 mm) between T11 and L1 and a high signal fluid collection at the T11 level. Laminectomy of the T11-L1 region was performed, and the mass was subtotally excised. The resected tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as a mature cystic teratoma. The patient's symptom of urinary incontinence was improved following the surgery.","2050":"The purpose of this study is to verify the usefulness of the rabbit model for disc degeneration study. The L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, or L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) of 9 mature male New Zealand White rabbits were injured by inserting a 16-gauge needle to a depth of 5 mm in the left anterolateral annulus fibrosus while leaving L5-L6 IVD uninjured. Three other rabbits also received intradiscal injections of rabbit disc cells transfected with adenovirus and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (ad-BMP-2) at L4-L5 in addition to injury by 16-gauge needle at the L1-L2 level. Using digitized radiographs, measurements of IVD height were made and analyzed by using the disc height index (DHI). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the injured discs, injected discs, and uninjured L5-L6 discs were performed at 15 weeks post surgery and compared with preoperative MRI scans. All twelve rabbits showed consistent results of disc degeneration within 15 weeks following annular puncture. DHIs of injured discs were significantly lower than that of the uninjured L5-L6 discs (p&lt;0.05). The mean value of disc degeneration grade of injured discs was significantly higher than that of uninjured discs (p&lt;0.05). The injection of disc cell transfected with ad-BMP-2 did not induce disc regeneration at 15 weeks after injection. This study showed that the injured disc had a significant change in DHI on simple lateral radiograph and disc degeneration grade on MRI scans within 15 weeks in all rabbits. Rabbit annular puncture model can be useful as a disc degeneration model in vivo. ","2051":"To evaluate the risk factors that may be responsible for the development of contralateral reherniations from ipsilateral ones after open lumbar microdiscectomy (OLM), and to compare surgical outcomes of revision OLM for contralateral reherniations with those for ipsilateral ones. Seventeen patients who underwent revision OLM for contralateral reherniation were enrolled into Group I, and 35 patients who underwent revision OLM for ipsilateral reherniation were enrolled into Group II. Using medical charts and imaging study results, the differences in the clinical and radiological factors were evaluated between the two groups. Clinical outcomes of each group were compared between the two groups. Significant differences were found in the interval to reherniation from initial surgery (33 months for Group I and 18.6 months for Group II, p=0.009), as well as in the incidences of both protruded disc (35.3% for Group I and 8.6% for Group II, p=0.045) and mild disc degeneration (29.4% for Group I and 5.7% for Group II, p=0.031) at initial surgery. On binary multi-logistic regression analysis, significant differences were found in the interval to reherniation (p=0.027, Odds ratio=1.051) and incidence of mild disc degeneration (p=0.025, Odds ratio=12.03) between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the improvement of clinical outcomes after revision OLM between the two groups. The interval to reherniation from initial surgery and the grade of disc degeneration at initial surgery were key factors that distinguished the development of contralateral reherniations from ipsilateral ones. Surgical outcomes of revision OLM were similar in both groups. ","2052":"For patients with giant or dissecting aneurysm, multimodal treatment consisting extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery plus clip or coil for parent artery occlusion may be necessary. In this study, the safety and efficacy of multimodal treatment in 15 patients with complex aneurysms were evaluated retrospectively. From January 1995 to June 2007, the authors treated 15 complex aneurysms that were unable to be clipped or coiled. Among them, nine patitents had unruptured aneurysms and 6 had ruptured aneurysms. Aneurysms were located in the internal cerebral artery (ICA) in 11 patients (4 in the dorsal wall, 4 in the terminal ICA, 1 in the paraclinoid, and 2 in the cavernous ICA), in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 2, and in the posterior circulation in two patients Fifteen patients with complex aneurysms were treated with bypass surgery previously. Thirteen patients were treated with external carotid middle cerebral artery (ECA-MCA) anastomosis, and one patient with superficial temporal to posterior cerebral artery (STA-PCA) and another patient with occipital artery to posterior inferior cerebellar artery (OA-PICA) anastomosis. Parent artery occlusion was then performed with a clip in 9 patients, with a coil in 4, with balloon plus coil in one patient. All 15 aneurysms were successfully treated with clip or coil combined with bypass surgery. Follow-up angiograms showed good patency of anastomotic site in 10 out of 11 patients, and perfusion study showed sufficient perfusion in 6 out of 9 patients. These findings indicate that for patients with complex aneurysms, clip or coil for parent vessel occlusion with additive bypass surgery can successfully exclude the aneurysm from the neurovascular circulatory system. ","2053":"The serum S100 protein has been known to reflect the severity of neuronal damage. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic value of the serum S100 protein by Elecsys S100 immunoassay in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and to establish reference value for this new method. Serum S100 protein value was measured at admission, day 3 and 7 after bleeding in 42 consecutive patients (SAH : 20, ICH : 22) and 74 healthy controls, prospectively. Admission Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, Hunt &amp; Hess grade and Fisher grade for SAH, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage, ICH volume, and outcome at discharge were evaluated. Degrees of serum S100 elevation and their effect on outcomes were compared between two groups. Median S100 levels in SAH and ICH groups were elevated at admission (0.092 versus 0.283 microg\/L) and at day 3 (0.110 versus 0.099 microg\/L) compared to healthy controls (0.05 microg\/L; p&lt;0001). At day 7, however, these levels were normalized in both groups. Time course of S100 level in SAH patient was relatively steady at least during the first 3 days, whereas in ICH patient it showed abrupt S100 surge on admission and then decreased rapidly during the next 7 days, suggesting severe brain damage at the time of bleeding. In ICH patient, S100 level on admission correlated well with GCS score (r=-0.859; p=0.0001) and ICH volume (r=0.663; p=0.001). A baseline S100 level more than 0.199 microg\/L predicted poor outcome with 92% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Logistic regression analyses showed Ln (S100) on admission as the only independent predictor of poor outcome (odd ratio 36.1; 95% CI, 1.98 to 656.3). Brain damage in ICH patient seems to develop immediately after bleeding, whereas in SAH patients it seems to be sustained for few days. Degree of brain damage is more severe in ICH compared to SAH group based on the S100 level. S100 level is considered an independent predictor of poor outcome in patient with spontaneous ICH, but not in SAH. Further study with large population is required to confirm this result. ","2054":"The authors reviewed clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with three column injury of the cervical spine who had undergone posterior cervical fixation using Nitinol shape memory alloy loop in the anterior-posterior combined approach. Nine patients were surgically treated with anterior cervical fusion using an iliac bone graft and dynamic plate-screw system, and the posterior cervical fixation using Nitinol shape memory loop (Davydovtrade mark) at the same time. A retrospective review was performed. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Frankel grading method. We reviewed the radiological parameters such as bony fusion rate, height of iliac bone graft strut, graft subsidence, cervical lordotic angle, and instrument related complication. Single-level fusion was performed in five patients, and two-level fusion in four. Solid bone fusion was presented in all cases after surgery. The mean height of graft strut was significantly decreased from 20.46+\/-9.97 mm at immediate postoperative state to 18.87+\/-8.60 mm at the final follow-up period (p&lt;0.05). The mean cervical lordotic angle decreased from 13.83+\/-11.84 degrees to 11.37+\/-6.03 degrees at the immediate postoperative state but then, increased to 24.39+\/-9.83 degrees at the final follow-up period (p&lt;0.05). There were no instrument related complications. We suggest that the posterior cervical fixation using Nitinol shape memory alloy loop may be a simple and useful method, and be one of treatment options in anterior-posterior combined approach for the patients with the three column injury of the cervical spine. ","2055":"Premorbid demographic backgrounds of injured individuals are likely to reflect more accurately the status of patients with traumatic brian injury (TBI) than clinical factors. However, the concrete study about the relationship between the demographic factors and neurocognitive function in TBI patients has not been reported. The object of this study was to evaluate the effect of premorbid demographic factors on the recovery of neurocognitive function following TBI. From July 1998 to February 2007, 293 patients (male: 228, female: 65) with a history of head injury, who had recovered from the acute phase, were selected from our hospital to include in this study. We analyzed the effect of premorbid demographic factors including age, sex, educational level and occupation on the recovery of neurocognitive function in each TBI subgroup as defined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Intelligence and memory are components of neurocognitive function, and the Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS) and the Korean memory assessment scale (K-MAS) were used in this study. The results were considered significant at p&lt;0.05. The higher level of education was a good prognostic factor for intelligence regardless of GCS score and younger age group showed a better result for memory with an exception of severe TBI group. In the severe TBI group, the meaningful effect of demographic factors was not noted by the cause of influence of severe brain injury. The demographic factors used in this study may be helpful for predicting the precise prognosis and developing an appropriate rehabilitation program for TBI patients. ","2056":"Jugular foramen schwannomas are uncommon pathological conditions. This article is constituted for screening these tumors in a wide perspective. One-hundred-and-ninty-nine patients published in 19 articles between 1984 to 2007 years was collected from Medline\/Index Medicus. The series consist of 83 male and 98 female. The mean age of 199 operated patients was 40.4 years. The lesion located on the right side in 32 patients and on the left side in 60 patients. The most common presenting clinical symptoms were hearing loss, tinnitus, disphagia, ataxia, and hoarseness. Complete tumor removal was achieved in 159 patients. In fourteen patients tumor reappeared unexpectedly. The tumor was thought to originate from the glossopharyngeal nerve in forty seven cases; vagal nerve in twenty six cases; and cranial accessory nerve in eleven cases. The most common postoperative complications were lower cranial nerve palsy and facial nerve palsy. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage, meningitis, aspiration pneumonia and mastoiditis were seen as other complications. This review shows that jugular foramen schwannomas still have prominently high morbidity and those complications caused by postoperative lower cranial nerve injury are life threat. ","2057":"Intracranial pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is a rare cerebrovascular lesion that has only recently been recognized as a distinct pathological entity. A 41-year-old woman (Patient 1) presented with the sudden development of an altered mental state. Brain CT showed an acute subdural hematoma. A red sylvian vein was found intraoperatively. A pial AVF was revealed on postoperative angiography, and surgical disconnection of the AVF was performed. A 10-year-old boy (Patient 2) presented with a 10-day history of paraparesis and urinary incontinence. Brain, spinal MRI and angiography revealed an intracranial pial AVF and a spinal perimedullary AVF. Endovascular embolization was performed for both lesions. The AVFs were completely obliterated in both patients. On follow-up, patient 1 reported having no difficulty in performing activities of daily living. Patient 2 is currently able to walk without assistance and voids into a diaper. Intracranial pial AVF is a rare disease entity that can be treated with surgical disconnection or endovascular embolization. It is important for the appropriate treatment strategy to be selected on the basis of patientspecific and lesion-specific factors in order to achieve good outcomes.","2058":"We report a very rare case of a rapidly calcified chronic epidural hematoma (EDH) in a neonate. A 26-day-old female infant was referred to us from a regional hospital because of drowsy mentality and a seizure attack. She was delivered through caesarian section because normal spontaneous vaginal delivery was prolonged and failed. At birth, mild scalp swelling was found on the right frontal area. Scalp swelling was spontaneously resolved and she was discharged without any problems. On the 25th day after her birth, the baby presented with drowsiness and hypotonia following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a chronic EDH that had a thick layer of calcification. A small burr-hole trephination was performed and a single silastic drainage catheter was inserted. After the operation, a total of 12 ml of liquefied hematoma was drained, and the patient's mentality improved from drowsiness to alertness. The patient was asymptomatic when discharged.","2059":"The authors report an extremely rare case with intraventricular and subarachnoid fat developed after trauma to spine and soft tissue in a 54-year-old male. The initial computed tomography (CT) showed multiple low attenuation lesions, which were thought to be pneumocephalus. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions with high signal intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, indicating fat globules within the CSF. In this report, the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and a review of the literature are presented.","2060":"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are very rare tumors. We experienced a case of MPNST in the cervical paraspinal space which was not associated with neurofibromatosis. The tumor located in left C6-7 foramen and compressed C7 root. The tumor was removed through the occipital triangle. We report a case of the primary cerivcal MPNST in a patient who did not have neurofibromatosis-1.","2061":"Cavernous malformations (CMs) arising from the optic nerve and chiasm are extremely rare. The authors present a case of 39-year-old woman with CMs of the optic chiasm. She was referred due to sudden onset of bitemporal hemianopsia and headache, the so-called 'chiasmal apoplexy'. MRI findings suggested a diagnosis of hemorrhage and vascular malformation of the optic chiasm. Pterional craniotomy revealed an intrachiasmatic cavernous malformation with hemorrhage. The malformation was totally excised, but field deficits remained unchanged after surgery.","2062":"Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is rare in children, especially in infants, in whom only 12 cases have been reported. Because of the nonspecificity of presenting symptoms in children, the diagnosis may be delayed. We report herein a case of SSEH in a 20-month-old girl who initially presented with neck pain, and developed lower extremity motor weakness and symptoms of neurogenic bladder 2 weeks prior to admission. The magnetic resonance imaging showed an epidural mass lesion extending from C7 to T4, and the spinal cord was severely compressed by the mass. After emergency decompressive surgery the neurologic function was improved immediately. Two months after surgery, the neurological status was normal with achievement of spontaneous voiding. We suggest that surgical intervention can provide excellent prognosis in case of SSEH in infants, even if surgery delayed.","2063":"To understand the anatomic characteristics of the aortic arch (AA) and its major branches to build a foundation toward performing endovascular surgery safely. A total of 25 formalin fixed Korean adult cadavers were used. The authors investigated : anatomical variations of the AA and its major branches; curvature of the AA; distance from the mid-vertebrae line to the origin of the major branches; distances from the origin of the major branches of AA to the origin of its distal branches; and the angle of the three major branches, the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT), the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and the left subclavian artery (LSCA) arising from AA. The three major branches directly originated from AA in 21 (84%) of the cadavers. In two (8%) of remaining four cadavers, orifice of LCCA was slightly above the stem of BCT. In remaining two (8%) cadavers, the left vertebral artery (LVA) was directly originated from AA. Average angle of AA curvature to the coronal plane was 62.2 degrees. BCT originated 0.92 mm on the right of the mid-vertebrae line. LCCA and LSCA originated from 12.3 mm and 22.8 mm on the left of the mid-vertebrae line. Mean distance from the origin of the BCT to the origin of the RCCA was 32.5 mm. Mean distance from the origin of the LSCA to the origin of the LVA was 33.8 mm. Average angles at which the major branches arise from the AA were 65.3, 46.9 and 63.8 degrees. This study may provides a basic anatomical information to catheterize AA and its branches for safely performing endovascular surgery. ","2064":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and surgical outcome of the conus medullaris tumors. We retrospectively reviewed 26 patients who underwent surgery for conus medullaris tumor from August 1986 to July 2007. We analyzed clinical manifestation, preoperative MRI findings, extent of surgical resection, histopathologic type, adjuvant therapy, and outcomes. There were ependymoma (13), hemangioblastoma (3), lipoma (3), astrocytoma (3), primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) (2), mature teratoma (1), and capillary hemangioma (1) on histopathologic type. Leg pain was the most common symptom and was seen in 80.8% of patients. Pain or sensory change in the saddle area was seen in 50% of patients and 2 patients had severe pain in the perineum and genitalia. Gross total or complete tumor resection was obtained in 80.8% of patients. On surgical outcome, modified JOA score worsened in 26.9% of patients, improved in 34.6%, and remained stable in 38.5%. The mean VAS score was improved from 5.4 to 1.8 among 21 patients who had lower back pain and leg pain. The surgical outcome of conus medullaris tumor mainly depends on preoperative neurological condition and pathological type. The surgical treatment of conus medullaris tumor needs understanding the anatomical and functional characteristics of conus meudllaris tumor for better outcome. ","2065":"Radiosurgery may be contraindicated for lesions adjacent to the optic pathways because of the substantial risk of visual complication. Multisession radiosurgery has been tried as a compromise between single session radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of multisession gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 22 patients with perioptic lesions of benign pathology. In all 22 cases, the lesions were within 1 mm of the optic apparatus and were therefore not considered suitable for single session radiosurgery. Radiation was delivered in 3 to 4 fractions with a median cumulated marginal dose of 20 Gy (range, 15-20 Gy). During a mean follow-up of 29 months (range, 14-44 months), tumor control was achieved in 21 patients. Visual function improved in 7 patients, remained unchanged in 14 patients, and deteriorated in 1 patient with tumor progression. No other complication was observed. This preliminary result supports the idea that multisession GKRS may be an effective and safe alternative for treatment in perioptic lesions that are unsuitable for single session radiosurgery. ","2066":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between various transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography parameters and clinical vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study enrolled 40 patients presented with aneurysmal SAH between September 2006 and August 2007. We measured differences of mean blood flow velocity (BFVm), highest systolic blood flow velocity (BFVh), and Lindegaard ratio (LR) in the middle cerebral artery on TCD examination. These parameters were evaluated for correlation with clinical vasospasm by univariate analysis and the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Twelve patients (30%) developed clinical vasospasm. The best TCD parameters for the detection of clinical vasospasm were revealed to be differences of BFVm, BFVh, and LR values between 1(st) TCD test and 3(rd) TCD (7 cm\/s, 11.5 cm\/s, 0.45 respectively). The positive predictive value of any one of three parameters was 60% and the negative predictive value was 100%. TCD is still considered a useful tool for screening clinical vasospasm. To confirm the predictive value of the above parameters, further prospective study will be needed. ","2067":"The incidence of Brucellosis is increasing in Korea. Spondylitis is the most frequent complication, but it is difficult to diagnose because its clinical symptoms are non-specific. It should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of back pain. We report three rare cases of brucellar spondylitis successfully treated by medical and surgical therapy.","2068":"Although adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the lacrimal gland is a rarely encountered orbital tumor, it invades intracranially more frequently than carcinomas of other glands in the head and neck. A 52-year-old man underwent orbital exenteration and resection of intracranially extended tumor via a fronto-orbito-zygomatic approach in combination with a transfacial approach. Histopathologically, the tumor showed perineural, vascular, and lymphatic invasion. Additionally, he received radiotherapy (60 Gy) and adjuvant systemic cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy due to residual tumor in the orbit and systemic metastases (lung, ribs, and spines). He was free of progression and recurrence at 6 months after treatment. The authors report a case of skull base invasion by an ACC of the lacrimal gland to remind neurosurgeons planning intervention that this disease shows a tendency to invade intracranially.","2069":"Endolymphatic sac tumor is rare, locally aggressive hypervascular tumor of papillary structure, arising from the endolymphatic duct or sac in the posterior petrous bone. We present four cases with this tumor. Two patients were male and the other two were female. Age of each patient was 15, 52, 58, and 67 years. Three patients presented with progressive hearing loss and sustained vertigo for months to years and another one was referred for the tumor detected in routine medical check-up. Preoperative embolization was performed in 3 patients. Complete excision of the tumor was achieved in all patients using translabyrinthine or retrosigmoid approach. Herein, we describe the clinical and radiographic features, surgical treatment and pathologic findings with a review of the literature.","2070":"Angiolipomas in the lumbar spinal region are extremely rare. The present report describes the identification of such a tumor and its removal, and discusses the tumor characteristics and prognosis. A 74-year-old woman was presented with a 5-month history of lower back pain. Severe radiculopathy was experienced in the left leg for 5 days prior to the presentation, and there were no neurological deficits. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed an approximately 3.5 cm heterogeneously enhanced and elongated mass at the left L5-S1 level. A portion of the mass appeared with high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, and with high signal intensity on T1 fat suppression enhancement images. Resection of the tumor was approached via an L5 and S1 laminectomy. A fibrous sticky yellowish hypervascular tumor was identified. Histological study revealed the tumor as an angiolipoma. Symptoms were relieved after tumor excision, and there were no neurological sequelae. Although extremely rare, lumbar epidural angiolipoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lumbar spinal epidural lesions. The prognosis after surgical management of this lesion is favorable.","2071":"Discal cysts are rare lesions that can cause radiating leg pain. Because they are very rare, their natural history and the details of the therapeutic guidelines for the treatment of these cysts are still unknown. A 30-year-old male patient presented to our institute with radiating pain in his left leg and mild back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intraspinal extradural cystic mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images at the L5-S1 level. The partial hemilaminectomy and cyst resection were performed. We report a patient with low back pain and radiating leg pain caused by a lumbar discal cyst and discuss the treatment of this cyst.","2072":"We present a case of delayed oral extrusion of a screw after anterior cervical interbody fusion in a 68-year-old man with osteoporosis. Fifteen months earlier, he had undergone C5 corpectomy and anterior cervical interbody fusion at C4-6 for multiple spinal stenoses. The patient was nearly asymptomatic, except for a foreign body sensation in his throat. We conclude that the use of a mesh graft or other instrument in elderly patients and those with osteoporosis or problematic bone quality should be considered carefully and that if surgery were to be performed, periodic postoperative follow-up evaluations are mandatory.","2073":"We report a rare case of symptomatic Rathke's cleft cyst with thick calcified wall. Brain CT scans revealed a large cystic mass with round thick calcified wall. In this case, we selected the pterional approach instead of transsphenoidal approach due to the possibility of cystic craniopharyngioma. Histopathologically, it was calcified Rathke's cleft cyst with focal epithelial metaplasia. This case illustrates that calcification of the suprasellar cyst does not always suggest craniopharyngioma and the calcification pattern of Rathke's cleft cyst is different from that of the craniopharyngioma.","2074":"In Moyamoya disease, the primary goal of treatment is to improve collateral circulation through angiogenesis. In the present study, we obtained and sub-cultured bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from rats without a cell-mediated immune response. Then, we injected the labeled BMSCs directly into adjacent temporal muscle during encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS). Three weeks after BMSC transplantation, we examined the survival of the cells and the extent of neovascularization. We divided 20 rats into a BMSC transplantation group (n=12) and a control group (n=8). Seven days after the induction of chronic cerebral ischemia, an EMS operation was performed, and labeled BMSCs (1x106(6)\/100 microL) were injected in the temporal muscle for the transplantation group, while an equivalent amount of culture solution was injected for the control group. Three weeks after the transplantation, temporal muscle and brain tissue were collected for histological examination and western blot analysis. The capillary\/muscle ratio in the temporal muscle was increased in the BMSC transplantation group compared to the control group, showing a greater increase of angiogenesis (p&lt;0.05). In the brain tissue, angiogenesis was not significantly different between the two groups. The injected BMSCs in the temporal muscle were vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-positive by immunofluorescence staining. In both temporal muscle and brain tissue, the expression of VEGF by western blot analysis was not much different between the two groups. During EMS in a chronic cerebral ischemia rat model, the injection of BMSCs resulted in accelerated angiogenesis in the temporal muscle compared to the control group. ","2075":"This study is to investigate time course of symptom disappearance in patients whose spasm relieved completely after microvascular decompression (MVD). Of 115 patients with hemifacial spasm (HFS) who underwent MVD from April 2003 to December 2006, 89 patients who had no facial paralysis after operation and showed no spasm at last follow-up more than 1.5 years after operation were selected. Symptom disappearance with time after MVD was classified into type 1 (symptom disappearance right after operation), type 2 (delayed symptom disappearance) and type 3 (unusual symptom disappearance). Type 2 was classified into type 2a (with postoperative silent period) and type 2b (without silent period). Type 1, type 2a, type 2b and type 3 were 38.2%, 48.37%, 12.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Delayed disappearance group (type 2) was 60.7%. Post-operative symptom duration in all cases ranged from 0 to 900 days, average was 74.6 days and median was 14 days. In case of type 2, average post-operative symptom duration was 115.1 days and median was 42 days. Five and 3 patients required more than 1 year and 2 years, respectively, until complete disappearance of spasm. In type 2a, postoperative silent period ranged from 1 to 10 days, with an average of 2.4 days. Surgeons should be aware that delayed symptom disappearance after MVD for HFS is more common than it has been reported, silent period can be as long as 10 days and time course of symptom disappearance is various as well as unpredictable. ","2076":"Sotos Syndrome is characterized by macrocephaly, overgrowth, and developmental delay, and more than 300 patients have been reported worldwide to date. The authors reviewed the clinical characteristics of 8 patients with Sotos Syndrome in Korea for a new understanding and treatment strategies. The medical records of a total of eight Korean children with Sotos Syndrome were reviewed. All patients underwent developmental checkup, lumbar punctures for measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP), brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography. All 8 patients showed macrocephaly and the characteristic craniofacial features of Sotos Syndrome. Other clinical characteristics shown were overgrowth (7\/8), developmental delay (7\/8), congenital heart defect (3\/8), flat foot (8\/8), scoliosis (4\/8), spina bifida (8\/8), hydrocephalus (4\/8), cavum vergae (3\/8), and increased subdural fluid collection (5\/8). Mean ICP measured via lumbar puncture was 27.35+\/-6.25 cm H(2)O (range 20 to 36 cm H(2)O). Two patients received ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, and 1 patient underwent subduro-peritoneal shunt with improvement. Spinal orthosis was applied to 4\/5 patients with scoliosis and 4\/8 children with flat foot were provided with foot orthosis. In this first Korean study of 8 Sotos Syndrome patients we demonstrated the presence of spina bifida and increased ICP, which had not been previously described. The authors therefore suggest that all patients with Sotos Syndrome should undergo examination for the presence of spina bifida, and that shunt procedures would improve development and alleviate clinical symptoms. ","2077":"There are a few reports on the complications of surgery for epilepsy. We surveyed our data to present complications of epilepsy surgeries from the neurosurgeon's point of view and compare our results with other previous reports. A total of 179 surgical procedures for intractable epilepsy (41 diagnostic, 138 therapeutic) were performed in 92 consecutive patients (10 adults, 82 children) during the last 9.2 years (February. 1997-April. 2006). Their medical records and radiological findings were reviewed to identify and analyze the surgical complications. The diagnostic procedures encompassed various combinations of subdural grid, subdural strips, and depth electrodes. Four minor transient complications developed in 41 diagnostic procedures (4\/41=9.8%). A total of 138 therapeutic procedures included 28 anterior temporal lobectomies, 21 other lobectomies, 6 lesionectomies, 21 topectomies, 13 callosotomies, 20 vagus nerve stimulations, 13 multiple subpial transections, and 16 hemispherectomies. Twenty-six complications developed in therapeutic procedures (26\/138=18.8%). Out of the 26 complications, 21 complications were transient and reversible (minor; 21\/138=15.2%), and 5 were serious complications (major; 5\/138=3.6%). Five major complications were one visual field defect, two mortality cases and two vegetative states. There were 2 additional mortality cases which were not related to the surgery itself. Our results indicate that complication rate was higher than previous other reports in minor complications and was comparable in major complications. However, our results show relatively high frequency of mortality cases and severe morbidity case compared to other previous reports. The authors would like to emphasize the importance of acute postoperative care in young pediatric patients as well as meticulous surgical techniques to reduce morbidity and mortality in epilepsy surgery. ","2078":"The standard treatment strategy of intracranial aneurysms includes either endovascular coiling or microsurgical clipping. In certain situations such as in giant or dissecting aneurysms, bypass surgery followed by proximal occlusion or trapping of parent artery is required. The authors assessed the result of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery in the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms in one institute between 2003 and 2007 retrospectively to propose its role as treatment modality. The outcomes of 15 patients with complex aneurysms treated during the last 5 years were reviewed. Six male and 9 female patients, aged 14 to 76 years, presented with symptoms related to hemorrhage in 6 cases, transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 2 unruptured cases, and permanent infarction in one, and compressive symptoms in 3 cases. Aneurysms were mainly in the internal carotid artery (ICA) in 11 cases, middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 2, posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in one and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in one case. The types of aneurysms were 8 cases of large to giant size aneurysms, 5 cases of ICA blood blister-like aneurysms, one dissecting aneurysm, and one pseudoaneurysm related to trauma. High-flow bypass surgery was done in 6 cases with radial artery graft (RAG) in five and saphenous vein graft (SVG) in one. Low-flow bypass was done in nine cases using superficial temporal artery (STA) in eight and occipital artery (OA) in one case. Parent artery occlusion was performed with clipping in 9 patients, with coiling in 4, and with balloon plus coil in 1. Direct aneurysm clip was done in one case. The follow up period ranged from 2 to 48 months (mean 15.0 months). There was no mortality case. The long-term clinical outcome measured by Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) showed good or excellent outcome in 13\/15. The overall surgery related morbidity was 20% (3\/15) including 2 emergency bypass surgeries due to unexpected parent artery occlusion during direct clipping procedure. The short-term postoperative bypass graft patency rates were 100% but the long-term bypass patency rates were 86.7% (13\/15). Nonetheless, there was no bypass surgery related morbidity due to occlusion of the graft. Revascularization technique is a pivotal armament in managing complex aneurysms and scrupulous prior planning is essential to successful outcomes. ","2079":"Malignant gliomas are the most common primary cerebral neoplasms in adults. Despite multimodality treatments, the prognosis for patients with malignant glioma remains poor. However, recently, the effectiveness of concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ) has been reported. We report for the first time preliminary results of the treatment with CCRT of newly diagnosed malignant gliomas in Korean people. Thirty-two patients over the age of 17 years with newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed high-grade gliomas (HGG), from June 2004 to August 2007 were the subjects of this study. There were 17 men and 15 women, with a median age of 53.5 years (range, 17-74). Pathologically, glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and gliomatosis cerebri had been diagnosed in eighteen, eight, four, and two patients, respectively. These 32 patients were treated with CCRT with TMZ. The median follow-up period was 12.5 months (range 3-48). At the time of this analysis, 13 patients died and three patients had been lost to follow-up. There was no mortality caused by drug toxicity. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of these patients was 9.0 months, and the six-month PFS rate was 72.4%. The median overall survival (OS) was 26 months, and the one-year OS rate was 83.6%. The 18 patients with glioblastoma were analyzed separately from the other patients with HGG, and the median OS was 18 months, and the one-year OS rates were 81.8%. The median PFS was seven months, and the six-month PFS rate was 75.0%. Our results are consistent with many other reports, confirming that CCRT with TMZ achieves good clinical outcomes in the treatment of HGG. Therefore, we suggest that CCRT with TMZ as adjuvant chemotherapy be considered as a standard therapy for patients with HGG. ","2080":"Although anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is the standard treatment for degenerative cervical disc disease, concerns regarding adjacent level degeneration and loss of motion have suggested that arthroplasty may be a better alternative. We have compared clinical and radiological results in patients with cervical disc herniations treated with arthroplasty and ACDF. We evaluated 53 patients treated for cervical disc herniations with radiculopathy, 21 of whom underwent arthroplasty and 32 of whom underwent ACDF. Clinical results included the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for upper extremity radiculopathy, neck disability index (NDI), duration of hospital stay and convalescence time. All patients were assessed radiologically by measuring cervical lordosis, segmental lordosis and segmental range-of-movement (ROM) of operated and adjacent disc levels. Mean hospital stay (5.62 vs. 6.26 days, p&lt;0.05) and interval between surgery and return to work (1.10 vs. 2.92 weeks, p&lt;0.05) were significantly shorter in the arthroplasty than in the fusion group. Mean NDI and extremity VAS score improved after 12 months in both groups. Although it was not significant, segmental ROM of adjacent levels was higher in the fusion group than in the arthroplasty group. And, segmental motion of operated levels in arthroplasty group maintained more than preoperative value at last follow up. Although clinical results were similar in the two groups, postoperative recovery was significantly shorter in the arthroplasty group. Although it was not significant, ROM of adjacent segments was less in the arthroplasty group. Motion of operated levels in arthroplasty group was preserved at last follow up. ","2081":"The cranioplasty and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt operation have been used to treat a large cranial defect with posttraumatic hydrocephalus (PTH). The aim of this study was to evlauate the difference of outcomes between in the shunting after the cranioplasty (group 1) and the cranioplasty after the shunting (group 2) in a large flaccid cranial defect with PTH. In this study, a retrospective review was done on 23 patients undergoing the cranioplasty and VP shunt operation after the decompressive craniectomy for a refractory intracranial hypertension from 2002 to 2005. All of 23 cases had a large flaccid concave cranial defect and PTH. Ten cases belong to group 1 and 13 cases to group 2. The outcomes after operations were compared in two groups 6 months later. The improvement of Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) was seen in 8 cases (80.0%) of total 10 cases in group 1, and 6 cases (46.2%) of 13 cases in group 2. Three (75.0%) of 4 cases with hemiparesis in group 1 and 3 of 6 cases (50.0%) in group 2 were improved. All cases (2 cases) with decrease of visual acuity were improved in each group. Dysphasia was improved in 3 of 5 cases (60%) in group 1 and 4 of 6 cases (66.6%) in group 2. These results suggest that outcomes in group 1 may be better than in group 2 for a large flaccid concave cranial defect with PTH. ","2082":"Aneurysms are very rarely encountered in the distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The authors experienced 5 cases with a distal PICA aneurysm among 368 cases of intracranial aneurysms during the period from January 2003 to January 2008. Here, the authors describe their clinical and surgical experiences and include a review of the relevant literature. Using radiologic findings and charts, we retrospectively reviewed the surgical results of 5 cases with a distal PICA aneurysm treated from January 2003 to January 2008. The current five cases were composed of four cases of 'Good' and one case of 'Fair'. No postoperative complications occurred other than a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to hydrocephalus in Case 2. In all five cases, treatment was successful without neurological deficit. Surgical outcome of PICA aneurysms have been reported to be excellent because the amount of intraparenchymal injury is limited. More clinical experience, microsurgical technique developments, and endovascular surgery advancements are certain to improve treatment outcomes. ","2083":"This study was designed to compare the efficacy of micro-vascular decompression (MVD) and Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for elderly idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia patients by analyzing the clinical outcome. In the past 10 years, 27 elderly patients were treated with MVD while 18 patients were treated with GKRS (&gt;65-years-old). We reviewed their clinical characteristics and clinical courses after treatment as well as the treatment outcomes. For patients who were treated with MVD, additional treatment methods such as rhizotomy were combined in some areas. In GKRS, we radiated the root entry zone (REZ) with the mean maximum dose of 77.8 (70-84.3) Gy and one 4 mm collimator. The mean age was 68.1 years for MVD, and 71.1 years for GKS group. The average time interval between first presenting symptom and surgery was 84.1 (1-361) months, and 51.4 (1-120) months, respectively. The mean follow-up period after the surgery was 35.9 months for MVD, and 33.1 months for GKRS. According to Pain Intensity Scale, MVD group showed better prognosis with 17 (63%) cases in grade I-II versus 10 (55.6%) cases in GKRS group after the treatment. The pain recurrence rate during follow up did not show much difference with 3 (11.1%) in MVD, and 2 (11.1%) in GKRS. After the treatment, 2 cases of facial numbness, and 1 case each of herpes zoster, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, hearing disturbance, and subdural hematoma occurred in MVD Group. In GKRS, there was 1 (5.6%) case of dysesthesia but was not permanent. Three cases were retreated by GKRS but the prognosis was not as good as when the surgery was used as primary treatment, with 1 case of grade I-II, and 1 case of recurrence. The maximal relieve of pain was seen just after surgery in MVD group, and 1 year after treatment in GKRS group. For trigeminal neuralgia patients with advanced age, MVD showed advantages in immediately relieving the pain. However, in overall, GKRS was preferable, despite the delayed pain relief, due to the lower rate of surgical complications that arise owing to the old age. ","2084":"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been used in epilepsy patients refractory to standard medical treatments and unsuitable candidates for resective or disconnective surgery. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of VNS to patients who had refractory result to epilepsy surgery and patients with post-traumatic epilepsy. We analyzed the effect of VNS in 11 patients who had undergone previous epilepsy surgery and patients with intractable post-traumatic epilepsy associated with brain injury. All patients underwent VNS implantation between October 2005 and December 2006. We evaluated seizure frequency before and after implantation of VNS and maximum follow up period was 24 months. In the first 6 months, 11 patients showed an average of 74.3% seizure reduction. After 12 months, 10 patients showed 85.2% seizure reduction. Eighteen months after implantation, 9 patients showed 92.4% seizure reduction and 7 patients showed 97.2% seizure reduction after 24 months. Six patients were seizure-free at this time. We conclude that the VNS is a helpful treatment modality in patients with surgically refractory epilepsy and in patients with post-traumatic epilepsy due to severe brain injury. ","2085":"There have been numerous follow-up studies of patients who had ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated by wrapping technique using various materials have been reported. Our objective was to ascertain whether our particular wrapping technique using the temporalis muscle provides protection from rebleeding and any aneurysm configuration changes in follow-up studies. Clinical presentation, the location and shape of the aneurysm, outcomes at discharge and last follow-up, and any aneurysm configuration changes on last angiographic study were analyzed retrospectively in 21 patients. Reinforcement was acquired by clipping the wrapped temporalis muscle. Wrapping and clipping after incomplete clipping was also done. Follow-up loss and non-angiographic follow-up patient groups were excluded in this study. The mean age was 53 years (range 29-67), and 15 patients were female. Among 21 patients, 10 patients had ruptured aneurysms (48%). Aneurysms in 21 patients were located in the anterior circulation. Aneurysm shapes were broad neck form (14 cases), fusiform (1 case), and bleb to adjacent vessel (6 cases). Five patients were treated by clipping the wrapped temporalis, and 16 patients by wrapping after partial clipping. The mean Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at admission was 14.2. The mean Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) at discharge was 4.8, and 18 patients were grade 5. The mean period between initial angiography and last angiography was 18.5 months (range 8-44). Aneurysm size was not increased in any of these patients and configuration also did not change. There was no evidence of rebleeding in any of these treated aneurysms. Our study results show that wrapping technique, using the temporalis muscle and aneurysm clip(s), for intracranial aneurysm treatment provides protection from rebleeding or regrowth. ","2086":"The authors present their experiences with stereotactic multiplanar reformatted (MPR) computed tomography (CT)-guided catheter placement for thrombolysis of spontaneous intracerebral hematoma (sICH) and their clinical results. In 23 patients with sICH, MPR CT-guided catheter placement was used to select the trajectory and target point of hematoma drainage. This group was comprised of 11 men and 12 women, and the mean age was 57.5 years (range, 31-79 years). The patients' initial Glasgow Coma Scale scores ranged from 7 to 15 with a median of 11. The volume of the hematoma ranged from 24 mL to 86 mL (mean 44.5 mL). A trajectory along the main axis of the hematoma was considered to be optimal for thrombolytic therapy. The trajectory was calculated from the point of entry through the target point of the hematoma using reformatted images. The hematoma catheter was left in place for a median duration of 48.9 hours (range 34 to 62 hours). In an average of two days, the average residual hematoma volume was 6.2 mL (range 1.4 mL to 10.2 mL) and was reduced by an average of 84.7% (range 71.6% to 96.3%). The residual hematoma at postoperative seven days was less than 5 mL in all patients. There was no treatment-related death during hospitalization. The present study indicates that stereotactic MPR CT-guided catheter placement for thrombolysis is an accurate and safe procedure. We suggest that this procedure for stereotactic removal of sICH should be considered for the optimization of the trajectory selection in the future. ","2087":"Although endovascular intervention is the first-line treatment of intracranial aneurysm, intraprocedural rupture or extravasation is still an endangering event. We describe two interesting cases of extravasation during embolotherapy for ruptured peripheral cerebral pseudoaneurysms. Two male patients were admitted after development of sudden headache with presentation of intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, respectively. Initial angiographic assessment failed to uncover any aneurysmal dilatation in both patients. Two weeks afterwards, catheter angiography revealed aneurysms each in the peripheral middle cerebral artery and anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Under a general anesthesia, endovascular embolization was attempted without systemic heparinization. In each case, sudden extravasation was noted around the aneurysm during manual injection of contrast after microcatheter navigation. Immediate computed tomographic scan showed a large amount of contrast collection within the brain, but they tolerated and made an unremarkable recovery thereafter. Intraprocedural extravasation is an endangering event and needs prompt management, however proximal plugging with coil deployment can be sufficient alternative, if one confronts with peripheral pseudoaneurysm. Peculiar angiographic features are deemed attributable to extremely fragile, porous vascular wall of the pseudoaneurysm. Accordingly, it should be noted that extreme caution being needed to handle such a friable vascular lesion.","2088":"Symptomatic sacral perineural cysts are uncommon. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the etiologies of perineural cysts, but the accurate etiologies remain unclear. We experienced two cases of symptomatic sacral perineural cysts (Tarlov cysts) in one family, who presented with perianal paresthesia. Both of them were operated and postoperatively their symptoms were disappeared immediately. We experienced the excellent treatment outcome with the surgical management of symptomatic perineural cysts in the sacral region. We assume that the theory of congenital origin including a familial tendency is the most plausible of the hypotheses that have been proposed.","2089":"Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is commonly and effectively used to treat hydrocephalus. Intracardiac migration of the shunt catheter is a rare complication. A 68-year-old woman underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage due to anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Two weeks after the shunt surgery, she had suffered from the abdominal pain. Plain chest x-rays, computed tomography, and echocardiography revealed the distal catheter which was in the right ventricle of the heart. We tried to remove the catheter through the internal jugular vein by fluoroscopic guidance. But, the distal catheter was kinked and knotted; therefore, we failed to withdraw the catheter. After then, we punctured the right femoral vein and pulled down the multi-knotted shunt catheter to the femoral vein using the snare catheter. Finally, we removed the knotted distal catheter via the femoral vein and a new distal catheter was placed into the peritoneal cavity. We report a case in which the distal catheter of the VP shunt migrated into the heart via the internal jugular vein. We emphasize the importance of careful and proper placement of the distal catheter during the tunneling procedure to prevent life-threatening complications.","2090":"Sacral insufficiency fractures are usually known to develop in elderly patients with osteoporosis without definite trauma history. It is difficult to diagnose the sacral insufficiency fracture at an early stage because lower lumbar diseases, concurrently or not, may also be presented with similar symptoms and signs. We report a rare case of sacral insufficiency fracture who was not diagnosed initially but, instead, showed progressively worsening of clinical symptoms and radiological findings after decompression surgery for upper level lumbar stenosis.","2091":"Kissing aneurysms are the rare type of multiple aneurysms. They are adjacent aneurysms of different origin arteries in the same region, which require great care in diagnosis and treatment. We report a case of kissing aneurysms at the anterior communicating artery (AcomA) which were treated by endovascular coil embolization.","2092":"Stenting is a useful alternative treatment modality in carotid artery stenosis patients who are too high-risk to undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We report a case of contralateral cerebral infarction after stenting for extracranial carotid stenosis. A 78-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with left-sided weakness. Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and conventional angiography, she was diagnosed with an acute watershed infarct of the right hemisphere secondary to severe carotid stenosis. Stenting was performed for treatment of the right carotid artery stenosis after a one-week cerebral angiogram was completed. Thirty minutes after stent placement, the patient exhibited a generalized seizure. Four hours later, brain MRI revealed left hemispheric cerebral infarction. Complex aorta-like arch elongation, tortuosity, calcification, and acute angulation at the origin of the supra-aortic arteries may increase the risk of procedural complications. In our case, we suggest that difficult carotid artery catheterization, with aggressive maneuvering during stenting, likely injured the tortuous, atherosclerotic aortic arch, and led to infarction of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere by thromboemboli formed on the wall of the atherosclerotic aorta.","2093":"Intraorbital hemorrhage is a rare clinical condition caused by orbital trauma, surgery around the orbit, intraorbital vascular abnormalities, and neoplasm. It was reported to occur spontaneously without any known causes and in association with orbital pseudotumor in a very few cases. A 59-year-old, female patient admitted with sudden onset of severe exophthalmos and pain on the left eye. Orbital CT and MR imaging suggested hemorrhage in the upper part of retrobulbar area of the left orbit. Cerebral angiography was taken to rule out any possible vascular abnormalities. On the left carotid cerebral angiography, the run-off of the distal ophthalmic artery was not seen and the engorgement of the supraophthalmic artery was noted. Systemic administration of corticosteroid did not improve the clinical status and craniectomy was done and retrobulbar hematoma was removed, and the clinical symptoms and signs were improved. Authors report a case of spontaneous intraorbital hemorrhage with the clinical features similar to those of orbital pseudotumor, requiring surgical decompression.","2094":"Microscopic and endoscopic transsphenoidal approach (TSA) are major surgical techniques in the treatment of pituitary adenoma. Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach (EETSA) has been increasingly used for pituitary adenomas, however, its surgical outcome particularly in functioning pituitary adenoma has been debated. Here, we investigated the endocrine outcome of the patients with growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreting pituitary adenoma treated by EETSA. We treated 80 patients with pituitary adenoma by EETSA since 2004, of which 12 patients were affected by functioning pituitary adenomas (9 GH, 3 ACTH, 0 PRL; 9 macro, 3 micro). Surgical outcome of those patients treated by EETSA was compared with that of the 11 functioning pituitary adenoma patients (8 GH, 3 ACTH; 8 macro, 3 micro) who underwent sublabial microscopic TSA between 1997 and 2003. Imaging remission based on postoperative MRI was achieved in 8 (73%) and hormonal remission in 5 (45%) of 11 patients treated by sublabial microscopic TSA. Imaging remission was observed in 10 (83%, p=0.640) and hormonal remission in 10 (83%, p=0.081) of 12 patients by EETSA. CSF leakage was noticed in 2 (17%) of EETSA group and in 2 (18%) of sublabial microscopic TSA group. Panhypopituitarism was observed in 1 (9%) of EETSA group and in 3 (27%) of sublabial microscopic TSA group. EETSA appears to be an effective and safe method for the treatment of functioning pituitary adenomas. ","2095":"The authors reviewed the experience of 19 patients with orbital tumors and summarize the clinical features, surgical treatment and outcomes. The authors searched the database for all patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of orbital tumors at a single institution between 1999 and 2007. Data from clinical notes, surgical reports, and radiological findings were obtained for the analysis. Orbital tumors constituted a heterogenous array of histopathology. The presenting symptoms were exophthalmos (52.6%), visual disturbance (26.3%) and pain (21.1%). The surgical approaches used were transcranial in 17 patients. Tumors located in the intraconal or perioptic space were surgically excised using a frontoorbital approach (8 cases), while pterional (3 cases), orbital (2 cases) and combined approaches (6 cases) were used for tumors in other sites. Total resection of tumors was achieved in 12 of 19 patients. In 4 patients with glioma and lymphoma only diagnostic biopsy was done. Three patients experienced visual deterioration postoperatively. Two patients had temporary diplopia, and one patient had temporary ptosis. Surgical treatment could be the mainstay of therapy for the majority of symptomatic orbital tumors. Many orbital tumors can be treated safely via a transcranial approach. Frontoorbital approach allows the surgeon to reach both the intraorbital and intracranial structures. Knowledge of the microanatomy of the orbit and meticulous surgical skills are necessary to overcome the pitfalls of intraorbital surgery. ","2096":"Barbiturate coma therapy (BCT) has been known to be an useful method to control increased intracranial pressure (IICP) refractory to medical and surgical treatments. We have used BCT for patients with severe IICP during the past 10 years, and analyzed our results with review of literatures. We analyzed 92 semicomatose or comatose patients with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 7 or less with severe IICP due to cerebral edema secondary to parenchymal damages irrespective of their causes. Forty patients who had received BCT with ICP monitoring from January 1997 to December 2006 were included in BCT group, and fifty-two patients who had been managed without BCT from January 1991 to December 1995 were divided into control group. We compared outcomes with Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) and survival rate between the two groups. Good outcome (GOS=4 and 5) rates at 3-month after insult were 27.5% and 5.8% in BCT and control group, respectively (p&lt;0.01). One-year survival rates were 35.9% and 12.5% in BCT and control group, respectively (p&lt;0.01). In BCT group, the mean age of good outcome patients (37.1 +\/- 14.9) was significantly lower than that of poor outcome patients (48.1 +\/- 13.5) (p&lt;0.05). With our 10-year experience, we suggest that BCT is an effective treatment method for severe IICP patients for better survival and GOS, especially for younger patients. ","2097":"Numerous studies have compared the characteristics of familial intracranial aneurysms with those of non-familial aneurysms. To better understand familial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), we studied a series of patients with SAH who had at least one first-degree relative with SAH, and compared our results with those of previous studies. We identified patients treated for SAH at our hospital between January 1993 and October 2006 and analyzed those patients with one or more first-degree relatives with SAH. We retrospectively collected data from patients with a family history and searched for patients who had relatives with aneurysms or who had been treated at other hospitals for SAH. We identified 12 patients from six families with at least two first-degree relatives with SAH. All patients had affected first-degree relatives; in five families, they were siblings. The mean age at the time of rupture was 49.75 years; in four families, the age difference was within 5 years. In five patients (42%), the aneurysm was located in the middle cerebral artery. Only one patient had an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery. In agreement with previous studies, our results showed that familial aneurysms, in comparison with non-familiar aneurysms, ruptured at a younger age and smaller size, had a high incidence in the middle cerebral artery, and were underrepresented in the anterior communicating artery. Interestingly, the age at the time of rupture was similar between relatives. Screening should be considered in the fifth or sixth decade for those who have a sibling with SAH. ","2098":"Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is considered as a reversible pathophysiological condition mainly induced by continuous vascular compression of the facial nerve root exit zone (REZ) at the cerebellopontine angle. As an offending vessel, vertebrobasilar artery tends to compress much more heavily than others. The authors analyzed HFS caused by vertebrobasilar artery and described the relationships between microsurgical findings and clinical courses. Out of 1,798 cases treated with microvascular decompression (MVD) from Jan. 1980 to Dec. 2004, the causative vessels were either vertebral artery or basilar artery in 87 patients. Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in this study. Preoperatively, computed tomography (CT) or brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with 3-dimentional short range MR technique was performed and CT was checked immediately or 2-3 days after anesthetic recovery. The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, the compression patterns of the vessels at the time of surgery and treatment outcomes. There were 47 were male and 32 female patients. HFS developed on the left side in 52 cases and on the right side in 27. The mean age of onset was 52.3 years (range 19-60) and the mean duration of symptoms was 10.7 years. Many patients (39 cases; 49.1%) had past history of hypertension. HFS caused only by the vertebral artery was 8 cases although most of the other cases were caused by vertebral artery (VA) in combination with its branching arteries. Most frequently, the VA and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) were the simultaneous causative blood vessels comprising 32 cases (40.5%), and in 27 cases (34.2%) the VA and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) were the offenders. Facial symptoms disappeared in 61 cases (77.2%) immediately after the operation and 68 cases (86.1%) showed good outcome after 6 months. Surgical outcome just after the operation was poor in whom the perforators arose from the offending vessels concurrently (p&lt;0.05). In case where the vertebral artery is a cause of HFS, commonly branching arteries associated with main arterial compression on facial REZ requires more definite treatment for proper decompression because of its relatively poor results compared to the condition caused by other vascular compressive origins. ","2099":"Our purpose of this study is to compare insertion angles and screw lengths from Roy-Camille, Magerl, and our designed method for cervical lateral mass screw fixation in the Korean population by quantitative measurement of reformatted two dimensional (2D) computed tomography (CT) images. We selected thirty Korean patients who were evaluated with thin section CT scans and reconstruction program to obtain reformatted 2D-CT images of the transversal plane passing the cranio-caudal angle using three different techniques. We measured the minimum angle to avoid vertebral artery (VA) injury, the ideal angle and depth for bicortical screwing of cervical lateral mass. Morphometric measurements of the lateral masses from C3-C7 were also taken. In all three techniques, the mean safety angles from the VA were less than 8 degrees and the necessary depth of the screw was about 14 mm for safety to the VA and for the bicortical purchase. In our designed technique, the mean beta angles of each level from C3 to C7 were 29.0, 29.8, 29.5, 26.3, and 23.9 degrees, respectively. Results of this study and data from the literature indicate that differences may exist between the Korean and Western people in the length and angle for ideal lateral mass screw fixation. In addition, our technique needs further cadaveric and clinical study for safety and efficacy for being performed as alternative method for cervical lateral mass fixation. ","2100":"The objective of this study is to investigate clinical characteristics, management methods and possible causes of intracranial fusiform aneurysm. Out of a series of 2,458 intracranial aneurysms treated surgically or endovascularly, 22 patients were identified who had discrete fusiform aneurysms. Clinical presentations, locations, treatment methods and possible causes of these aneurysms were analyzed. Ten patients of fusiform aneurysm were presented with hemorrhage, 5 patients with dizziness with\/without headache, 4 with ischemic neurologic deficit, and 1 with 6th nerve palsy from mass effect of aneurysm. Two aneurysms were discovered incidentally. Seventeen aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation, other five in the posterior circulation. The most frequent site of fusiform aneurysm was a middle cerebral artery. The aneurysms were treated with clip, and\/or wrapping in 7, resection with\/without extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass in 6, proximal occlusion with coils with\/without EC-IC bypass in 5, EC-IC bypass only in 1 and conservative treatment in 3 patient. We obtained good outcome in 20 out of 22 patients. The possible causes of fusiform aneurysms were regard as dissection in 16, atherosclerosis in 4 and collagen disease or uncertain in 2 cases. There is a subset of cerebral aneurysms with discrete fusiform morphology. Although the dissection or injury of internal elastic lamina of the cerebral vessel is proposed as the underlying cause for most of fusiform aneurysm, more study about pathogenesis of these lesions is required. ","2101":"When a tear occurs in one of the major cervicocerebral arteries and allows blood to enter the wall of the artery and split its layers, the result is either stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation of the vessel. Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is an infrequent occurrence but is a leading cause of stroke in young and otherwise healthy patients. This article discusses recent developments in understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of VAD and the various clinical manifestations, methods of diagnosis, and approaches to treatment.","2102":"The purpose of this study was to introduce our surgical experiences of scoliosis and to evaluate the effectiveness of anterior correction and fusion in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Between August 2004 and August 2007, four patients with AIS were treated with anterior segmental fusion and fixation at our hospital. Mean follow-up period was 9 (6-12) months. The average age was 14.0 (13-15) years. According to Lenke classification, three patients showed Lenke 1 curve and one patient with Lenke 5 curve. Single rod instrumentation was performed in one patient, dual rod instrumentation in one patient and combined rod instrumentation in two patients. Coronal Cobb measurements were performed on all curves in thoracic, thoracolumbar and, lumbar spine and the angle of hump was measured by a scoliometer pre- and postoperatively. The average operative time was 394 minutes (255-525) with an average intraoperative blood loss of 1,225 ml (1,000-1,700). The mean period of hospital stay was 19.3 days and there was no complication related to the surgery. The mean Cobb angle was reduced from 43.3 degrees to 14.8 degrees (65.8% correction) postoperatively and the rib hump corrected less than 5 degrees . All patients and their parents were satisfied with the deformity correction. Anterior spinal correction and fusion of AIS with Lenke 1 and 5 curve showed excellent deformity correction without any complications. In particular, we recommend anterior dual rod instrumentation because of mechanical stability, better control of kyphosis, and a higher fusion rate. ","2103":"Ligamentum flavum hematoma is a rare condition. Twenty cases including present case have been reported in English-language literature. Among them, only one case reported in pure thoracic spine. A 72-year-old man presented with thoracic myelopathy without precedent cause. Magnetic resonance images revealed a posterior semicircular mass which was located in T7 and T8 level compressing the spinal cord dorsally. T7-8 total laminectomy and extirpation of the mass was performed. One month later following surgery, the patient fully recovered to normal state. Pathologic result was confirmed as ligamentum flavum hematoma. Ligamentum flavum hematoma of rigid thoracic spine is a very rare disease entity. Most reported cases were confined to mobile cervical and lumbar spine. Surgeons should be aware that there seems to be another different pathogenesis other than previously reported cases of mobile cervical and lumbar spine.","2104":"A 35-year-old man's vision had progressively deteriorated over a 3-month period. His left visual acuity was 5\/20. Enhanced orbital computed tomographic (CT) scans revealed a fusiform dilatation of the ophthalmic artery in the left optic canal. Cerebral Angiography revealed a fusiform aneurysm on the left ophthalmic artery in the optic canal, measuring 6.2 x 4.6 mm in size. Four days after admission, visual acuity dropped to hand-motion. Endovascular treatment was chosen and a microcatheter was guided into the proximal segment of the ophthalmic artery. Using 4 detachable coils, parent artery occlusion was done. Three months after the intervention, the visual acuity in his left eye improved to 20\/20. Dramatic recovery of visual acuity is exceptional with an ophthalmic artery trunk aneurysm. When an occlusion of the proximal ophthalmic artery is the only treatment option in such a situation, the endovascular occlusion of the proximal ophthalmic artery is quite feasible in the sense that it does not require any optic nerve manipulation.","2105":"Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a relatively rare but significant spinal condition. Urgent surgical evacuation of a hematoma is generally indicated to prevent serious permanent neurological deficits. We encountered three cases of spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas associated with motor weakness that were treated successfully by surgical intervention.","2106":"Although tuberculosis of the central nervous system is well known, the incidence of intramedullary tuberculomas is low and a combination of intramedullary with intracranial tuberculomas is extremely rare. We report a case of disseminated tuberculoma involving brain and spine with miliary pulmonary tuberculosis in a 66-year-old woman initially presenting with fever, general weakness, back pain and motor weakness of both lower extremities. Despite medical therapy, she developed progressive motor weakness of both lower extremities with muscle strength 1\/5 in both lower extremities. Urgent surgical intervention was followed and her muscle power and motor functions were improved gradually. The anti-tuberculous drugs were continued and the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain and spine showed that the lesions had become smaller or disappeared.","2107":"In the evaluation of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), most neurologists only see their patients during a limited period of their fluctuating 24-hour-a-day lives. This study aimed to assess the short-term outcome of STN stimulation for patients with advanced PD evaluated in a 24-hour monitoring unit for movement disorder (MUMD) using a prospective protocol. Forty-two patients with advanced PD consecutively treated with bilateral STN stimulation using multi-channel microelectrode recording were included in this study. All patients were evaluated using a 24-hour MUMD with a video recording\/editing system and were evaluated with a prospective protocol of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr Staging, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living, levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Short Form-36 Health Survey, and neuropsychological tests. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain were performed prior to and six months after surgery. All patients were evaluated at three and six months after surgery. There was a rapid and significant improvement of the motor symptoms, especially in tremor and rigidity, after STN stimulation with low morbidity. Dyskinesia was markedly decreased with much lowered LEDD values by 50% after STN stimulation. 1.5T MR images were safely taken according to the manufacturer's guidelines at six months after surgery without any adverse effects in 41 patients treated with STN stimulations. Evaluations in a 24-hour monitoring unit could reduce the dose of medication efficiently to an optimal level with patients'comfort and improve the clinical symptoms in harmony with STN stimulation. ","2108":"To analyze the relationship of concomitant foraminal lumbar disc herniation (FLDH) with postoperative leg pain after microdecompression for extraforaminal lumbar disc herniation (EFLDH) at the L5-S1 level. Sixty-five patients who underwent microdecompression for symptomatic EFLDH at the L5-S1 level were enrolled. According to the severity of accompanying FLDH, EFLDH was classified into four categories (Class I : no FLDH; Class II : mild to moderate FLDH confined within a lateral foraminal zone; Class III : severe FLDH extending to a medial foraminal zone; Class IV : Class III with intracanalicular disc herniation). The incidence of postoperative leg pain, dysesthesia, analgesic medication, epidural block, and requirement for revision surgery due to leg pain were evaluated and compared at three months after initial surgery. The incidences of postoperative leg pain and dysesthesia were 36.9% and 26.1%, respectively. Pain medication and epidural block was performed on 40% and 41.5%, respectively. Revision surgery was recommended in six patients (9.2%) due to persistent leg pain. The incidences of leg pain, dysesthesia, and requirement for epidural block were higher in Class III\/IV, compared with Class I\/II. The incidence of requirement for analgesic medication was significantly higher in Class III\/IV, compared with Class I\/II (p=0.02, odds ratio=9.82). All patients who required revision surgery due to persistent leg pain were included in Class III\/IV. Concomitant FLDH seems related to postoperative residual leg pain after microdecompression for EFLDH at the L5-S1 level. ","2109":"C2 laminar screw fixation is considered as an excellent alternative to Magerl's transfacetal approach or Harms construct for the atlantoaxial stabilization. However, to our knowledge, there is no report on the feasibility of the new approach to Korean population. We investigated morphometric parameters of the dorsal arch of the C2 to provide the quantitative data for the feasibility of laminar screw fixation. One-hundred-and-two patients' cervical computed tomography had been reconstructed and investigated on the anatomical parameters related with C2 laminar screw placement. Sixty patients were male and forty-two patients were female. Measurements included the laminar thickness and slope, spino-laminar angle, and maximal screw length. Ages ranged from 20 to 81 and the mean age was 48.4. Mean laminar thickness was 5.7 mm (+\/-1.0) (5.8 mm in male and 5.4 mm in female). Fifty-one patients (50%) had a laminar thickness smaller than 5.5 mm at least unilaterally, therefore the patients were considered as inappropriate candidates for the laminar screw fixation in the smaller side of the laminae. Mean value of maximal length of screw was 33.3 mm (34.3 mm in male and 31.9 mm in female). Mean spino-laminar angle was 43.2 degrees and mean slope angle was 32.9 degrees . Half of patients had inappropriate laminar profiles to accommodate a 3.5 mm screw in at least one side of the axis. The three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction is mandatory for the preoperative assessment for the feasibility of the C2 lamina. ","2110":"The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of short segment fixation following postural reduction for the re-expansion and stabilization of unstable burst fractures in patients with osteoporosis. Twenty patients underwent short segment fixation following postural reduction using a soft roll at the involved vertebra in cases of severely collapsed vertebrae of more than half their original height. All patients had unstable burst fracture with canal compromise, but their motor power was intact. The surgical procedure included postural reduction for 2 days and bone cement-augmented pedicle screw fixations at one level above, one level below and the fractured level itself. Imaging and clinical findings, including the level of the vertebra involved, vertebral height restoration, injected cement volume, local kyphosis, clinical outcome and complications were analyzed. The mean follow-up period was 15 months. The mean pain score (visual analogue scale) prior to surgery was 8.1, which decreased to 2.8 at 7 days after surgery. The kyphotic angle improved significantly from 21.6+\/-5.8 degrees before surgery to 5.2+\/-3.7 degrees after surgery. The fraction of the height of the vertebra increased from 35% and 40% to 70% in the anterior and middle portion. There were no signs of hardware pull-out, cement leakage into the spinal canal or aggravation of kyphotic deformities. In the management of unstable burst fracture in patients with severe osteoporosis, short segment pedicle screw fixation with bone cement augmentation following postural reduction can be used to reduce the total levels of pedicle screw fixation and to correct kyphotic deformities. ","2111":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the surgical outcome and to compare the surgical results between transsylvian and transcortical approaches in patients with putaminal hematomas. Retrospective review of charts and CT scan images was conducted in 45 patients (20 transsylvian and 25 transcortical approaches) who underwent open surgical evacuation of putaminal hematomas. Mean Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score and hematoma volume were 7.5+\/-3.2 and 78.1+\/-29.3 cc, respectively. The factors affecting the functional mortality were investigated using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition, surgical results between transsylvian and transcortical approaches were compared. None of the patients had a good recovery after the surgery. Overall functional survival rate and mortality were 37.7% and 31%, respectively. The only risk factor for functional mortality was GCS motor score after controlling age, history of hypertension, side of hematoma, hematoma amount, midline shift, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and surgical approach (p=0.005). Even though a transcortical approach was shorter in operative time (4.4 versus 5.1 hour) and showed a higher mortality rate (40% versus 20%) and lower functional survival (45% versus 35%) compared to the transsylvian approach, the differences were not statistically significant between the two groups. In patients who have large amounts of hematoma and require open surgical evacuation, the only significant risk factor for functional survival is the preoperative GCS score. Cortical incision methods such as transsylvian and transcortical approaches have no influence on the surgical outcome. To decompress the swollen brain rapidly, transcortical approach seems to be more suitable than transsylvian approach.

Most pseudoaneurysms form as a result of blunt trauma and present as painless, pulsatile mass that may be associated with pathologic finding and enlarged size. We report a rare case of pseudoaneurysm arising from STA caused by blunt injury and diagnosed by 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography.","2114":"Astroblastoma is a rarely diagnosed primary brain neoplasm whose histogenesis has been clarified recently. It occurs in children and young adults and presents as a well circumscribed, contrast-enhancing lesion in the cerebral hemisphere. We present a case of 20-year-old woman with an astroblastoma in the left temporal convexity that was treated with total tumor resection alone. We thought the mass was extra-axial neoplasm based on radiological findings of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging initially, but later, we obtained angiographic findings suggesting an intra-axial neoplasm. The patient is doing well even two years after surgery. The characteristic radiological and histopathological features of this case are described with a literature review. An astroblastoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a superficially located tumor presenting with the findings of an extra-axial mass, especially in a young patient.","2115":"Angiosarcoma of the brain, either primary or metastatic is extremely rare. Moreover, angiosarcoma metastasizing to the brain is also highly unlike to occur comparing with metastases to the other organs. Thus, an ideal treatment strategy has not been established. A 67-year-old man with past surgical history of a scalp angiosarcoma underwent surgical resection of intracranial invasion. Because of wide scalp flap excision and resultant poor vascularity of the scalp flap, additional radiation was not provided. Because adjuvant therapy is impossible due to poor scalp condition, more careful but ample resection of the primary lesion is essential to conduct initial operation.","2116":"Giant cavernous malformations (GCMs) occur very rarely and little has been reported about their clinical characteristics. The authors present a case of a 20-year-old woman with a GCM. She was referred due to two episodes of generalized seizure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance image demonstrated a heterogeneous multi-cystic lesion of 7 x 5 x 5 cm size in the left frontal lobe and basal ganglia, and enhancing vascular structure abutting medial portion of the mass. These fingings suggested a diagnosis of GCM accompanying venous angioma. After left frontal craniotomy, transcortical approach was done. Total removal was accomplished and the postoperative course was uneventful. GCMs do not seem differ clinically, surgically or histopathologically from small cavernous angiomas, but imaging appearance of GCMs may be variable. The clinical, radiological feature and management of GCMs are described based on pertinent literature review.","2117":"Primary cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a rare tumor in adults that accounts for just 1% of all cases of GBM. Due to their rarity, cerebellar GBMs are not yet completely understood about the pathogenesis and the prognosis. Here, we present a case of GBM in a 69-year-old man. Neurologic examination revealed the presence of cerebellar signs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 4.5 x 3.6 cm-sized, ill-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left cerebellum and two patchy hyperintense lesions in the right cerebellum with minimal enhancement. After operation, glioblastoma was histologically confirmed. Postoperative radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy was subsequently followed. Here, a case of unusual GBM in the cerebellum is reported with review of literature regarding the pathogenesis, the differential diagnosis and prognosis. There was no evidence of recurrence during postoperative one year. This patient showed a good prognosis in spite of the multiple lesions.","2118":"Cancer-testis (CT) genes are considered promising candidates for immunotherapeutic approaches. The aim of this study was to investigate which CT genes should be targeted in immunotherapy for brain tumors. We investigated the expression of 6 CT genes (MAGE-E1, SOX-6, SCP-1, SSX-2, SSX-4, and HOM-TES-85) using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in 26 meningiomas and 32 other various brain tumor specimens, obtained from the patients during tumor surgery from 2000 to 2005. The most frequently expressed CT genes of meningiomas were MAGE-E1, which were found in 22\/26 (85%) meningioma samples, followed by SOX-6 (9\/26 or 35%). Glioblastomas were most frequently expressed SOX-6 (6\/7 or 86%), MAGE-E1 (5\/7 or 71%), followed by SSX-2 (2\/7 or 29%) and SCP-1 (1\/7 or 14%). However, 4 astrocytomas, 3 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 3 oligodendroglial tumors only expressed MAGE-E1 and SOX-6. Schwannomas also expressed SOX-6 (5\/6 or 83%), MAGE-E1 (4\/6 or 67%), and SCP-1 (2\/6 or 33%). The data presented here suggest that MAGE-E1 and SOX-6 genes are expressed in a high percentage of human central nervous system tumors, which implies the CT genes could be the potential targets of immunotherapy for human central nervous system tumors. ","2119":"We assessed the surgical results of percutaneous balloon compression in 50 patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Fifty patients with follow-up period of more than 12 months were retrospectively analyzed. The mean follow-up period was 42 months (range, 12-82). The mean age was 65.8 years (range, 27-83). Seventeen patients (34%) had other previous surgical procedures. The balloon was inflated by injecting radio-contrast media under brief general anesthesia according to Mullan's technique. The mean inflating time was 88 seconds (range, 60-120). The whole procedure took about 20 minutes. We reported excellent and good results in 70% of the cases, poor in 6% as annoying dysesthesia, recurrence in 16%, and 8% failure due to technical deficiencies. Forty-six patients (92%) were initially relieved of their pain. There were permanent motor weakness of the masseter muscle in 4% of patients and transitory diplopia in 8%. Neither anesthesia dolorosa nor keratitis occurred. Almost all patients (92%) were discharged postoperatively within two days. These results indicate that balloon compression would be an effective method with acceptable morbidity, technically, it can be performed rapidly and simply in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. ","2120":"The purpose of the present study is to assess the long-term results of microsurgical dorsal root entry zonotomy (MDT) for the treatment of medically intractable upper-extremity spasticity. The records of nine adult patients who underwent MDT by one operating neurosurgeon from March 1999 to June 2004 were retrospectively reviewed by another investigator who had no role in the management of these patients. In all patients, MDT was performed on all roots of the upper limb (from C5 to T1) for spasticity of the upper extremity. The degree of spasticity was measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (grade 0-4). Severity of the pain level was determined using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, score 0-10). Also, patient satisfaction of the post-operative outcome was assessed. Comparing the preoperative and postoperative spasticity using the Modified Ashworth Scale, we observed improvement in all patients, particularly in five of the nine patients (55.6%) who improved by three grades over an average of 66.4 months (range, 40-96). Regarding patient satisfaction, seven patients (77.8%) had affirmative results. None of the patients experienced severe, life-threatening, postoperative complications. We observed a decrease in the intensity of painful spasms to less than three scores as measured by NRS in all four patients with associated pain. This study shows that MDT provides significant, long-term reduction of harmful spasticity and associated pain in the upper limbs. ","2121":"Hydrocephalus is a common sequelae of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and patients who develop hydrocephalus after SAH typically have a worse prognosis than those who do not. This study was designed to identify factors predictive of shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus among patients with aneurysmal SAH, and patients who require permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Seven-hundred-and-thirty-four patients with aneurysmal SAH who were treated surgically between 1990 and 2006 were retrospectively studied. Three stages of hydrocephalus have been categorized in this paper, i.e., acute (0-3 days after SAH), subacute (4-13 days after SAH), chronic (&gt;\/=14 days after SAH). Criteria indicating the occurrence of hydrocephalus were the presence of significantly enlarged temporal horns or ratio of frontal horn to maximal biparietal diameter more than 30% in computerized tomography. Overall, 66 of the 734 patients (8.9%) underwent shunting procedures for the treatment of chronic hydrocephalus. Statistically significant associations among the following factors and shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus were observed. (1) Increased age (p &lt; 0.05), (2) poor Hunt and Hess grade at admission (p &lt; 0.05), (3) intraventricular hemorrhage (p &lt; 0.05), (4) Fisher grade III, IV at admission (p &lt; 0.05), (5) radiological hydrocephalus at admission (p &lt; 0.05), and (6) post surgery meningitis (p &lt; 0.05) did affect development of chronic hydrocephalus. However the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage, multiple aneurysms, vasospasm, and gender did not influence on the development of shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus. In addition, the location of the ruptured aneurysms in posterior cerebral circulation did not correlate with the development of shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus after aneurysmal SAH seems to have a multifactorial etiology. Understanding predisposing factors related to the shunt-dependent chronic hydrocephalus may help to guide neurosurgeons for better treatment outcomes. ","2122":"Limited therapeutic options are available for vancomycin intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis (VISE) infections and no optimum therapy has been established. We report a case of VISE skull osteomyelitis that was successfully treated with linezolid. The patient was a 53-year-old man who presented with headache, nausea and dysphasia. Brain computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated a subdural hematoma in the left hemisphere. Craniotomy and hematoma evacuation was performed and he showed good recovery despite a scalp wound infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The organism isolated from the scalp wound was sensitive to vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin for 44 days. However, he showed a high fever, persistent positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis (MRSE) blood cultures, and a deteriorating clinical status. He underwent infected skull bone flap removal and linezolid treatment for 35 days. During one year of follow up, he has not had any further episodes of osteomyelitis or fever. Linezolid has shown to be effective agent to eradiate osteomyelitis caused by VISE.","2123":"Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare immunologic disorder characterized by histiocyte proliferation in multiple organ systems. Eosinophilic granuloma, a benign bone lesion, represents a focal form of LCH. We experienced a case of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a patient who presented with intracranial epidural hematoma and cyst on the midline of the frontal skull. A 10-year-old boy presented with a rapidly growing large scalp mass on the midline frontal area after mild head trauma. The scalp mass was painless and immobile. Plain skull x-ray showed a punched-out bone lesion. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a non-enhancing osteolytic lesion presenting with an epidural hematoma and cyst on the midline of the frontal skull. The lesion of the skull was completely resected and the patient's recovery was uneventful. The acute presentation of a solitary eosinophilic granuloma of skull with an epidural hematoma has been described in only five cases in the literature and we report the first case of LCH presenting as an intracranial epidural hematoma on frontal area.","2124":"Shunt infections are a common complication of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, but the formation of a brain abscess related to a shunt system is very rare. A 44-year-old woman had a VP shunt inserted for hydrocephalus secondary to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. She suffered an episode of meningitis and sepsis 8 months after the shunt operation. After recovering from the meningitis, she complained of a loss of cognitive function. An enhancing mass was found in the frontal lobe, around the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and the ventricular catheter was embedded inside the mass. The ventricular catheter and cerebral abscess were removed using neuroendoscopy. We present an interesting case of a shunt-related brain abscess which illustrates the usefulness of neuroendoscopy.","2125":"To evaluate the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of the patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy associated with athetoid cerebral palsy. The authors reviewed the clinical and neurodiagnostic findings, surgical managements and outcomes in six consecutive patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy associated with athetoid cerebral palsy who had been treated with surgical decompression and fusion procedures between January 1999 and December 2005. The mean age of the 6 patients (four women and two men) at the time of surgery was 42.8 years (range, 31-55 years). The mean follow-up period was 56.5 months (range, 17-112 months). The neurological outcome was evaluated before and after operations (immediately, 6 months after and final follow-up) using grading systems of the walking ability, brachialgia and deltoid power. At immediate postoperative period, after 6 months, and at final follow-up, all patients showed apparent clinical improvements in walking ability, upper extremity pain and deltoid muscle strength. Late neurological deterioration was not seen during follow-up periods. There were no serious complications related to surgery. Surgical decompression and stabilization in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy associated with athetoid cerebral palsy have been challenging procedure up to now. Our results indicate that early diagnosis and appropriate surgical procedure can effectively improve the clinical symptoms and neurological function in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and athetoid cerebral palsy, even in those with severe involuntary movements. ","2126":"Bone cement leakage is a well-known potential complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in patients with osteoporotic compression fracture. Even though there has been a controversy in the efficacy of antecedent venography to prevent this complication, many authors have performed intraosseous venography before bone cement injection. The goal of this study was to classify the venous drainage patterns of spine before PVP, and compare their patterns at different vertebral levels. The authors retrospectively reviewed 1,042 intraosseous venographic patterns in 321 patients with 574 osteoporotic compression fractures during six-year period in one institution. To classify venogram patterns, we selected simple lateral X-ray of spine taken immediately after injection of the contrast dye. We classified the venography patterns according to contrast leakage pattern and leakage direction as follows; trabecular (TR), trabecular anterior (TA), trabecular posterior (TP), trabecular anterior-posterior (TAP), trabecular lateral (TL), venous anterior(VA), venous posterior (VP), venous anterior-posterior (VAP), soft tissue (ST). Also, we compared venogram patterns according to different spinal levels. In overall, the most common pattern was TP type accounting for 37.4% (390\/1042) of all intraosseous venograms. This is followed by TAP in 21.5%, TR 17.4%, TA 11.6%, TL 5.8%, ST 4.1%, VA 1.2%, VP 0.6%, and VAP 0.4% in descending order of frequency. According to the spinal level, TR and TAP types were most common in thoracic spine (T6-T10), TP type was most common in thoraco-lumbar spine (T11-L2), and TP and TAP types were most common in lumbo-sacral spine (L3-S1). Contrast dye leakage to soft tissue such as psoas muscle or disc were detected in 43 (4.1%) venograms. Direct venous drainage without staining of vertebral body was found in 23 (2.2%) venograms. The 8.3% of thoracic venogram showed direct venous drainage. Thoracic level showed a more tendency of direct venous drainage than other spine levels (p&lt;0.01). The authors propose a new classification system of intraosseous venography during PVP. The trabecular-posterior (TP) type is most common through all spine, and venous-filling (V) type was most frequent in thoracic spine. Further study would be necessary to elucidate the efficacy of this classification system to prevent bone cement leakage during PVP. ","2127":"Cerebral vasospasm still remains a major cause of the morbidity and mortality, despite the developments in treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The authors measured the utility and benefits of external lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage to prevent the clinical vasospasm and its sequelae after endovascular coiling on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in this randomized study. Between January 2004 and March 2006, 280 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated at our institution. Among them, 107 patients met our study criteria. The treatment group consisted of 47 patients who underwent lumbar CSF drainage during vasospasm risk period (about for 14 days after SAH), whereas the control group consisted of 60 patients who received the management according to conventional protocol without lumbar CSF drainage. We created our new modified Fisher grade on the basis of initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan at admission. The authors established five outcome criteria as follows : 1) clinical vasospasm; 2) GOS score at 1-month to 6-month follow-up; 3) shunt procedures for hydrocephalus; 4) the duration of stay in the ICU and total hospital stay; 5) mortality rate. The incidence of clinical vasospasm in the lumbar drain group showed 23.4% compared with 63.3% of individuals in the control group. Moreover, the risk of death in the lumbar drain group showed 2.1% compared with 15% of individuals in the control group. Within individual modified Fisher grade, there were similar favorable results. Also, lumbar drain group had twice more patients than the control group in good GOS score of 5. However, there were no statistical significances in mean hospital stay and shunt procedures between the two groups. IVH was an important factor for delayed hydrocephalus regardless of lumbar drain. Lumbar CSF drainage remains to play a prominent role to prevent clinical vasospasm and its sequelae after endovascular coiling on aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Also, this technique shows favorable effects on numerous neurological outcomes and prognosis. The results of this study warrant clinical trials after endovascular treatment in patients with aneurysmal SAH. ","2128":"In order to assess the incidence of thromboembolic events and their clinical presentations, the present study prospectively examined routine brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) taken within 48 hours after a coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms. From January 2006 to January 2008, 163 cases of coil embolization of cerebral aneurysm were performed along with routine brain MRI, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) imaging, within 48 hours after the embolization of the aneurysm to detect the silent thromboembolic events regardless of any neurological changes. If any neurological changes were observed, an immediate brain MRI follow-up was performed. High-signal-intensity lesions in the DW-MR images were considered as acute thromboembolic events and the number and locations of the lesions were also recorded. Among the 163 coil embolization cases, 98 (60.1%) showed high-signal intensities in the DW-MR imaging follow-up, 66 cases (67.0%) involved the eloquent area and only 6 cases (6.0%) showed focal neurological symptoms correlated to the DW-MR findings. The incidence of DW-MR lesions was higher in older patients (&gt;\/=60 yrs) when compared to younger patients (&lt;60 yrs) (p=0.002, odd's ratio=1.043). The older patients also showed a higher incidence of abnormal DW-MR signals in aneurysm-unrelated lesions (p=0.0003, odd's ratio=5.078). The incidence of symptomatic thromboembolic attacks after coil embolization of the cerebral aneurysm was found to be lower than that reported in previous studies. While DW-MR imaging revealed a higher number of thromboembolic events, most of these were clinically silent and transient and showed favorable clinical outcomes. However, the incidence of DW-MR abnormalities was higher in older patients, along with unpredictable thromboembolic events on DW-MR images. Thus, in order to provide adequate and timely treatment and to minimize neurological sequelae, a routine DW-MR follow-up after coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms might be helpful, especially in older patients. ","2129":"The purpose of this study was to report the morbidity, mortality, angiographic results, and merits of elective coiling of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Ninety-six unruptured aneurysms in 92 patients were electively treated with detachable coils. Eighty-one of these aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation, and 15 were located in the posterior circulation. Thirty-six aneurysms were treated in the presence of previously ruptured aneurysms that had already undergone operation. Nine unruptured aneurysms presented with symptoms of mass effect. The remaining 51 aneurysms were incidentally discovered in patients with other cerebral diseases and in individuals undergoing routine health maintenance. Angiographic and clinical outcomes and procedure-related complications were analyzed. Eight procedure-related untoward events (8.3%) occurred during surgery or within procedure-related hospitalization, including thromboembolism, sac perforation, and coil migration. Permanent procedural morbidity was 2.2% ; there was no mortality. Complete occlusion was achieved in 73 (76%) aneurysms, neck remnant occlusion in 18 (18.7%) aneurysms, and incomplete occlusion in five (5.2%) aneurysms. Recanalization occurred in 8 (15.4%) of 52 coiled aneurysms that were available for follow-up conventional angiography or magnetic resonance angiography over a mean period of 13.3 months. No ruptures occurred during the follow-up period (12-79 months). Endovascular coil surgery for patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms is characterized by low procedural mortality and morbidity and has advantages in patients with poor general health, cerebral infarction, posterior circulation aneurysms, aneurysms of the proximal internal cerebral artery, and unruptured aneurysms associated with ruptured aneurysm. For the management of unruptured aneurysms, endovascular coil surgery is considered an attractive alterative option. ","2130":"Outcome of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) in the consecutive 100 cases with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) was analyzed. Data from initial 100 patients treated with GKS in the authors' institute were reviewed retrospectively. Spetzler-Martin grade at diagnosis were I in 18 patients, II in 27, III in 36, IV in 11, and V in 8. Thirty-five patients had experienced previous bleeding, 27 patients presented with seizure, and 31 patients presented with headache. The mean volume of the lesion was 4.3 cm(3) (0.1-29.3 cm(3)). The median radiation dose delivered to the margin was 20.0 Gy (13-32 Gy). Mean follow-up period was 37.5 months (5-63 months). Angiographic follow-up was performed in 48 patients at least 2 years after GKS. Sixteen patients were lost in follow up following 2 years from GKS. Twenty-eight of 48 patients (58%) showed complete obliteration and 20 patients (42%) showed partial obliteration. Seven patients presented with post-GKS hemorrhage. Adverse radiation effect (ARE) was observed at follow-up MRI in 25 of 76 patients, and it was symptomatic in 5 patients. Complete obliteration was confirmed in 24 of 31 (77%) patients with volume less than 4 cm(3), meanwhile only 4 of 17 (24%) patients with volume of 4 cm(3) or more showed complete obliteration. Complete obliteration rate was 67% with 20 Gy or higher marginal dose, 63% with 15-20 Gy, and 17% with less than 15 Gy. GKS can provide high rates of obliteration with acceptable risk of morbidity in a subgroup of small AVMs. However, overall outcome in whole spectrum of AVMs, in which large proportion of cases have unfavorable characteristics for radiosurgery, is much worse. More effective therapeutic strategy needs to be developed for large AVMs that are difficult to be managed with current available treatment modalities. ","2131":"Total laminectomy (TL) is an effective surgical technique for the treatment of cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) along multiple levels. However, kyphosis and probable neurological deterioration have been frequently reported after laminectomy. We analyzed the changes in the cervical curvature after TL and subsequent changes in neurological status. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 14 patients who underwent TL for the treatment of cervical OPLL between Jan. 1998 and Dec. 2003. TL was selected according to the previously determined criteria. The curvature of the cervical spine was visualized on a lateral cervical spine X-ray and measured using Ishihara's Curvature Index (CI) before the operation and at the last follow-up examination. Perioperative neurological status was estimated using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score and the Improvement Rate (IR) at the same time as the images were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, the male\/female ratio was 10:4, and the mean follow-up period was 41 months. The mean number of OPLL was 4.9, and the mean number of operated levels was also 4.9. The CI decreased after TL (p=0.002), which was indicative of a kyphotic change. However, this kyphotic change showed no correlation with the length of the follow-up period, number of operated levels and preoperative CI. Neurological examination at the last follow-up showed an improved neurological status in all patients (p=0.001). There was no neurological deterioration in any case during the follow-up period. Moreover, there was no correlation between IR and the degree of kyphotic change. Postoperative complications, such as C5 radiculopathy and epidural bleeding, resolved spontaneously without neurological sequelae. Kyphotic change was observed in all but one patient who underwent TL for the treatment of cervical OPLL. However, we did not find any contributing factors to kyphosis or evidence of postoperative neurological deterioration. ","2132":"Giant lymph node hyperplasia (Castleman's disease) is a nonneoplastic lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown etiology that usually occurs in the chest. Its morphological recognition is based on a composition of various histological features. The mass is often asymptomatic, but it can cause nonspecific thoracic symptoms, such as regional pain. This disease can be found wherever lymph nodes are present, but two-thirds of these tumors are found in the chest, along the tracheobronchial tree in the mediastinum or lung hilus. However, we experienced an unusual case of Castleman's disease as a cause of back pain that was localized in the posterior mediastinum bordering the chest wall.","2133":"The location of ganglioglioma (GG) within the infratentorial compartment is unusual. The authors report a rare case of GG in the cerebellar hemisphere. A 12-year-old boy suffered from headache and gait disturbance. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated a large enhancing cerebellar mass with cystic components compressing the forth ventricle. After complete resection of the tumor, the patient became symptom free. Histological examination on the tumor disclosed glial cells and dysplastic ganglion cells. Although it is a rare tumor, in the appropriate clinical setting, a GG should be considered in the presence of a cerebellar mass with both solid and cystic components on magnetic resonance images in children.","2134":"Post-clipping intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the contralateral hemisphere is a very unusual phenomenon in a patient with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, unless there is an underlying condition. We report a complicated case of 47-year-old man, who underwent uneventful clipping of ruptured aneurysm and experienced vasospasm two weeks later. Vasospasm was treated by intra-arterial nimodipine and systemic hyperdynamic therapy. One week thereafter, he became unconscious due to intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the anterior border-zone of contalateral hemisphere, but intraoperative and pathologic findings failed to disclose any vascular anomaly. We suggest that the anti-spastic regimens cause local hemodynamic redistribution through the vasodilatory effect and in turn, resulted in such an unexpected bleeding.","2135":"A cerebrospinal fluid hydrothorax is a very rare complication following ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and usually reported in children. We report a case of 47-year-old woman who developed massive hydrothorax and respiratory distress following intrathoracic migration of distal shunt catheter. After the confirmation of catheter in thoracic cavity using radionuclide shuntogram, the patient was successfully treated with laparoscopic shunt catheter reposition.","2136":"A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a one-month history of progressive headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hemorrhagic mass adjacent to the left inferior cerebellar hemisphere associated with a peripheral rim of signal void. Angiography demonstrated an avascular mass and the provisional diagnosis was a large cavernous angioma in the cerebellum. Intraoperative findings revealed a thrombosed giant aneurysm of the left distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). We report an unusual case of a completely thrombosed giant aneurysm simulating a large cavernous angioma in the cerebellum. The cerebellar cisternal location of the mass may be a clue for the pre-operative diagnosis of an aneurysm.","2137":"The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)1 and L-ascorbic acid on proteoglycan synthesis, and the relationship between Sox9, proteoglycan, and TGF-beta1 in intervertebral disc cells. Human intervertebral disc tissue was sequentially digested to 0.2% pronase and 0.025% collagenase in DMEM\/F-12 media and extracted cells were cultured in 37, 5% CO(2) incubator. When intervertebral disc cells were cultured with TGF-beta1 or L-ascorbic acid, the production level of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) was estimated by dimethyl methyleneblue (DMMB) assay. The changes of Sox9 mRNA and protein levels via TGF-beta1 were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in each. The amount of sGAG was increased with the lapse of time during incubation, and sGAG content of pellet cultured cells was much larger than monolayer culture. When primary cultured intervertebral disc cells in monolayer and pellet cultures were treated by TGF-beta1 20 ng, sGAG content of experimental group was increased significantly compared to control group in both cultures. L-Ascorbic acid of serial concentrations (50-300 ug\/ml) increased sGAG content of mono layer cultured intervertebral disc cells significantly in statistics. The co-treatment of TGF-beta1 and L-ascorbic acid increased more sGAG production than respective treatment. After treating with TGF-beta1, Sox9 mRNA and protein expression rates were significantly increased in disc cells compared with the control group. This study suggests that TGF-beta1 would increase sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and other proteoglycans such as versican by elevating Sox9 mRNA and protein expressions in order. ","2138":"Postoperative delirium (POD) is characterized by an acute change in cognitive function and can result in longer hospital stays, higher morbidity rates, and more frequent discharges to long-term care facilities. In this study, we investigated the incidence and risk factors of POD in 224 patients older than 70 years of age, who had undergone a neurosurgical operation in the last two years. Data related to preoperative factors (male gender, &gt;70 years, previous dementia or delirium, alcohol abuse, serum levels of sodium, potassium and glucose, and co morbidities), perioperative factors (type of surgery and anesthesia, and duration of surgery) and postoperative data (length of stay in recovery room, severity of pain and use of opioid analgesics) were retrospectively collected and statistically analyzed. POD appeared in 48 patients (21.4%) by postoperative day 3. When we excluded 26 patients with previous dementia or delirium, 17 spontaneously recovered by postoperative day 14, while 5 patients recovered by postoperative 2 months with medication, among 22 patients with newly developed POD. The univariate risk factors for POD included previously dementic or delirious patients, abnormal preoperative serum glucose level, pre-existent diabetes, the use of local anesthesia for the operation, longer operation time (&gt;3.2 hr) or recovery room stay (&gt;90 min), and severe pain (VAS&gt;6.8) requiring opioid treatment (p&lt;0.05). Backward regression analysis revealed that previously dementic patients with diabetes, the operation being performed under local anesthesia, and severe postoperative pain treated with opioids were independent risk factors for POD. Our study shows that control of blood glucose levels and management of pain during local anesthesia and in the immediate postoperative period can reduce unexpected POD and help preventing unexpected medicolegal problems and economic burdens. ","2139":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of spinal implant removal and to determine the possible mechanisms of pain relief. Fourteen patients with an average of 42 years (from 22 to 67 years) were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion, who later developed recurrent back pain or persistent back pain despite a solid fusion mass. Patients' clinical charts, operative notes, and preoperative x-rays were evaluated. Relief of pain was evaluated by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain change after implant removal. Clinical outcome using VAS and modified MacNab's criteria was assessed on before implant removal, 1 month after implant removal and at the last clinical follow-up. Radiological analysis of sagittal alignment was also assessed. Average follow-up period was 18 months (from 12 to 25 months). There were 4 patients who had persistent back pain at the surgical site and 10 patients who had recurrent back pain. The median time after the first fusion operation and the recurrence of pain was 6.5 months (from 3 to 13 months). All patients except one had palpation pain at operative site. The mean blood loss was less than 100ml and there were no major complications. The mean pain score before screw removal and at final follow up was 6.4 and 2.9, respectively (p&lt;0.005). Thirteen of the 14 patients were graded as excellent and good according to modified MacNab's criteria. Overall 5.9 degrees of sagittal correction loss was observed at final follow up, but was not statistically significant. For the patients with persistent or recurrent back pain after spinal instrumentation, removal of the spinal implant may be safe and an efficient procedure for carefully selected patients who have palpation pain and are unresponsive to conservative treatment. ","2140":"This study is to report our experience of 40 cases of spinal schwannoma. From 1995 to 2006, medical records were retrospectively reviewed in 40 cases of spinal schwannoma. We treated 40 spinal schwannomas in 38 (22 male and 16 female) patients. The mean age was 50.2. Four cases were sited in the cervical spine, 11 cases in the thoracic spine, and 25 cases in the lumbar spine. Two patients showed recurrences. Thirty-eight cases were intradural-extramedullary type and 2 cases were extradural. Two cases (5%) including 1 recurred case had no postoperative motor improvement. Ninety-five percents of patients improved on postoperative motor grade. Spinal schwannoma is mostly benign and extramedullary tumor. There were 2 recurred cases (5%) that had history of previous subtotal removal at first operation and had shown worse prognosis compared with the cases without recurrence. To reduce the recurrence of spinal schannoma, total excision of tumor mass should be done. ","2141":"The surgical approach is typically similar to those used for other supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) lesions. However, the surgical clipping of this aneurysm is complicated and as a result, can result in postoperative ischemic complications. We studied to clarify the clip-induced ischemic complication risk of AChA aneurysm and to get the benefits for helping decision making. We retrospectively investigated 53 cases (4.0%) of AchA aneurysm treated surgically. We divided the AChA aneurysm to 3 subtype according to the origin of aneurysmal neck; A type originating from the AChA itself, J type from junction of AChA and ICA, and I type from the ICA itself. We evaluated brain CT about 1 week post-operative day to confirm the low density in AChA territory. Ruptured aneurysm was 26 cases and unruptured aneurysm 27 cases. The aneurysmal subtype of A, J, and I was 13, 17, and 23 cases. Of the 53 cases who performed surgical neck clipping, twelve (22.6%) had postoperative AChA distribution infarcts. Increased infarct after neck clipping had statistic significance in non-I subtype (p=0.005). It is easy to classify as \"easy\" surgery. But surgery for AChA aneurysms carries with it a significant risk of postoperative stroke. Don't always stick to clipping only, especially in non-I type of incidental small aneurysm, which has high risk of post-clip ischemic complications. ","2142":"The crossing laminar screw fixation might be the most recently developed approach among various fixation techniques for C2. The new construct has stability comparable to transarticular or transpedicular screw fixation without risk of vertebral artery injury. Quantitative anatomical studies about C2 vertebra suggest significant variation in the thickness of C2 lamina as well as cross sectional area of junction of lamina and spinous process. We present an elderly patient who underwent an occipito-cervical stabilization incorporating crossed C2 laminar screw fixation. We preoperatively recognized that she had low profiles of C2 lamina, and thus made a modification of trajectory for the inferiorly crossing screw. We introduce a simple modification of crossing C2 laminar screw technique to improve stability in patients with low laminar profiles.","2143":"Aortic abdominal aneurysm rarely has been reported as causing osteolytic lesions of the spine. It may produce back and radiating pain patterns similar to those of several commonly encountered neurosurgical processes. We report a uncommon complication of huge pulsating aortic aneurysm causing severe vertebral erosion with incapacitating back and radiating pain.","2144":"Spinal cord infarction is uncommon and usually presents with sudden onset of motor and sensory disturbances. We report a case of a 64-year-old women without previous medical history, who presented with acute onset of paraplegia after lifting. However, radiologic examinations did not show any abnormal lesion in the spinal cord. And, cerebrospinal fluid studies also showed no remarkable findings. This case illustrates the cause of spontaneous paraplegia after lifting injury and we consider the presumptive cause of paraplegia as spinal cord infarction.","2145":"Recently, Harms and Melcher modified Goel's approach, the C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screw fixation, and the new technique is currently in favor among neurosurgeons. Comparing to the advantages of Harms construct, the disadvantages were not extensively investigated. We experienced a patient with severe occipital pain developed after the C1 lateral mass screw placement for the traumatic atlantoaxial instability. We reviewed literatures about Harms construct with focus on the occipital neuralgia as a postoperative complication and suggest here technical tips to avoid the troublesome pain.","2146":"A 62-year-old female patient suffered from numbness and resting pain in the right ring and little fingers for 3 years. We confirmed cubital tunnel syndrome with electrodiagnostic study and performed the operation. We found seven firm consistent nodules, compressing the overlying the ulnar nerve, proximal to the medial epicondyle in the operation field. Histological finding showed synovial chondromatosis. We report a rare case of a patient with cubital tunnel syndrome caused by synovial chondromatosis.","2147":"Cystic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a rare disease. Its exact prevalence has not yet been reported. Also, the mechanism of cyst formation remains to be elucidated. We report a case of GBM with a large peripheral cyst. A 43-year-old woman visited our clinic with a 3-month history of severe headache, memory impairment and general weakness. T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) image revealed a midline enhanced solid mass and bilateral symmetric banana-shaped peripheral cysts. A centrally enhanced mass was measured 2x4 cm in size and both mass and cysts as 7x7 cm. Both the frontal lobe and the frontal horn were severely compressed inferiorly and posteriorly. We resected a midline solid tumor and cysts via the bilateral interhemispheric transcortical approach. Histopathologic examination revealed GBM. The patient was subsequently treated with fractionated conventional brain radiation therapy, followed by temozolomide chemotherapy. Eighteen months later, there was no tumor recurrence and no neurological deficits were noted. Our patient showed no tumor recurrence and a long survival at a long follow-up.","2148":"Transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily type 1 (TRPV1), a most specific marker of the nociceptive primary afferent, is expressed in peptidergic and non-pepetidergic primary afferents innervating skin and viscera. However, its expression in sensory fibers to skeletal muscle is not well known. In this study, we studied the neurochemical characteristics of TRPV1-positive primary afferents to skeletal muscles. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with total 20 microl of 1% fast blue (FB) into the gastrocnemius and erector spinae muscle and animals were perfused 4 days after injection. FB-positive cells were traced in the L4-L5 (for gastrocnemius muscle) and L2-L4 (for erector spinae muscle) dorsal root ganglia. The neurochemical characteristics of the muscle afferents were studied with multiple immunofluorescence with TRPV1, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and P2X(3). To identify spinal neurons responding to noxious stimulus to the skeletal muscle, 10% acetic acids were injected into the gastrocnemius and erector spinae muscles and expression of phospho extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in spinal cords were identified with immunohistochemical method. TRPV1 was expressed in about 49% of muscle afferents traced from gastrocnemius and 40% of erector spinae. Sixty-five to 60% of TRPV1-positive muscles afferents also expressed CGRP. In contrast, expression of P2X(3) immnoreaction in TRPV1-positive muscle afferents were about 20%. TRPV1-positive primary afferents were contacted with spinal neurons expressing pERK after injection of acetic acid into the muscles. It is consequently suggested that nociception from skeletal muscles are mediated by TRPV1-positive primary afferents and majority of them are also peptidergic. ","2149":"Delayed ischemic deficit or cerebral infarction is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study is to reassess the prognostic impact of intraoperative elements, including factors related to surgery and anesthesia, on the development of cerebral infarction in patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms. Variables related to surgery and anesthesia as well as predetermined factors were all evaluated via a retrospective study on 398 consecutive patients who underwent early microsurgery for ruptured cerebral aneurysms in the last 7 years. Patients were dichotomized as following; good clinical grade (Hunt-Hess grade I to III) and poor clinical grade (IV and V). The end-point events were cerebral infarctions and the clinical outcomes were measured at postoperative 6 months. The occurrence of cerebral infarction was eminent when there was an intraoperative rupture, prolonged temporary clipping and retraction time, intraoperative hypotension, or decreased O(2) saturation, but there was no statistical significance between the two different clinical groups. Besides the Fisher Grade, multiple logistic regression analyses showed that temporary clipping time, hypotension, and low O(2) saturation had odds ratios of 1.574, 3.016, and 1.528, respectively. Cerebral infarction and outcome had a meaningful correlation (gamma=0.147, p=0.038). This study results indicate that early surgery for poor grade SAH patients carries a significant risk of ongoing ischemic complication due to the brain's vulnerability or accompanying cardio-pulmonary dysfunction. Thus, these patients should be approached very cautiously to overcome any anticipated intraoperative threat by concerted efforts with neuro-anesthesiologist in point to point manner. ","2150":"The purpose of this study is to identify the factors affecting the failure of trials (&lt;50% pain reduction in pain for trial period) to improve success rate of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial. A retrospective review of the failed trials (44 patients, 36.1%) among the patients (n=122) who underwent SCS trial between January 1990 and December 1998 was conducted. We reviewed the causes of failed trial stimulation, age, sex, etiology of pain, type of electrode, and third party support. Of the 44 patients, 65.9% showed unacceptable pain relief in spite of sufficient paresthesia on the pain area with trial stimulation. Four of six patients felt insufficient paresthesia with stimulation had the lesions of the spinal cord. Seventy five percent of the patients experienced unpleasant or painful sensation during stimulation had allodynia dominant pain. Third-party involvement, sex, age and electrode type had no influence on the outcome. We conclude that SCS trial is less effective for patients with neuropathic pain of cord lesions, postherpetic neuropathy or post-amputation state. Further, patients with allodynia dominant pain can feel unpleasant or painful during trial stimulation. ","2151":"The length of anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC) in racial groups, age, gender of patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) and pallidotomy were investigated. From January 1996 to December 2003, 211 patients were treated with DBS and pallidotomy. There were 160 (76%) Caucasians, 35 (17%) Hispanics, 12 (5%) Asians and 4 Blacks (2%). There were 88 males and 52 females in DBS-surgery group and 44 males, 27 females in pallidotomy group. Mean age was 58 year-old. There were 19 males and 19 females and mean age was 54.7 years in the control group. Measurements were made on MRI and @Target software. The average AC-PC distance was 24.89 mm (range 32 to 19), which increased with aging until 75 years old in Caucasian and also increased with aging in Hispanic, but the AC-PC distance peaked at 45 years old in Hispanic. The order of AC-PC distance were 25.2+\/-2 mm in Caucasian, 24.6+\/-2.24 mm in Asian, 24.53 mm in Black, 23.6+\/-1.98 mm in Hispanic. The average AC-PC distance in all groups was 24.22 mm in female who was mean age of 56.35, 25.28 mm in male who was mean age of 60.19 and 24.5+\/-2 mm in control group that was excluded because of the difference of thickness of slice. According to multiple regression analysis, the AC-PC distance was significantly correlated with age, race, and gender. The AC-PC distance is significantly correlated with age, gender, and race. The atlas of functional stereotaxis would be depended on the variation of indivisual brain that can influenced by aging, gender, and race. ","2152":"Recently, due to the evolution of technology, the field of neurosurgery is receiving spotlight. In particular endovascular neurosurgery has gained a great interest along with the advancement of the modern neurosurgery. The most remarkable advances were made in embolization of the cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations and intracranial stenosis during the past 10 years. These advances will further change the role of neurosurgeons in treating cerebrovascular disease. Because interventional neuroradiologists have performed most of procedures in the past, neurosurgeons have been deprived of chances to learn endovascular procedure. This article discusses the development of technological aspect of endovascular neurosurgery in chronological order. By understanding the history and current status of the endovascular surgery, the future of neurosurgery will be promising.","2153":"Meningiomas frequently invade cerebral venus sinuses, especially parasagittal meningioma to superior sagittal sinus. However, most invasions do not reach internal jugular vein. We present a case of parasagittal meningioma extending into the internal jugular vein through the sinuses. Radiological investigation revealed that the tumor was invading the sagittal, transverse, sigmoid sinus and junction of the internal jugular vein to subclavian vein, which was filled with tumor. The histopathological examinations revealed that both the cerebral tumor and mass in the internal jugular vein contributed to the transitional meningioma. This is a rare case of a meningioma extending into the internal jugular vein through the sinuses. According to this case, the frontal parasagittal meningioma could invade directly the internal jugular vein. The significance of this association to cerebral venus sinuses and internal jugular vein are discussed.","2154":"Cause of pituitary apoplexy has been known as hemorrhage, hemorrhagic infarction or infarction of pituitary adenoma or adjacent tissues of pituitary gland. However, pituitary apoplexy caused by pure infarction of pituitary adenoma has been rarely reported. Here, we present the two cases pituitary apoplexies caused by pituitary adenoma infarction that were confirmed by transsphenoidal approach (TSA) and pathologic reports. Pathologic report of first case revealed total tumor infarction of a nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma and second case partial tumor infarction of ACTH secreting pituitary macroadenoma. Patients with pituitary apoplexy which was caused by pituitary adenoma infarction unrelated to hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction showed good response to TSA treatment. Further study on the predisposing factors of pituitary apoplexy and the mechanism of infarction in pituitary adenoma is necessary.","2155":"A 64-year-old man with TBI was admitted to our institute. In following days, he showed unusual behavior of agitation, restlessness, emotional instability and inattention. Post-traumatic delirium was tentatively diagnosed, and donepezil was given for his cognitive dysfunction. Although there was partial relief of agitation, he sustained back pain despite medication. Lumbar magnetic resonance image revealed SDH along the whole lumbar spine, and surgical drainage was followed. Postoperatively, his agitation disappeared and further medication was discontinued. We report a unique case of post-traumatic delirium in a patient with concomitant TBI and spinal subdural hemorrhage (SDH) that resolved with operative drainage of spinal hemorrhage.","2156":"Migration of a disc fragment to the posterior epidural space is rare, especially in the thoracic spine. Only four such cases of posterior epidural migration of thoracic disc fragments have been reported. The authors report a case of 66-year-old man who presented with back pain and right leg weakness due to posterior epidural migration of thoracic disc fragment. The patient was successfully treated by laminectomy and partial facetectomy with disc removal.","2157":"Myoclonus is a rare side effect of gabapentin (GBP) and has been reported in patients with preexisting myoclonus, mental retardation, chronic static encephalopathy, diffuse brain damage, impaired renal function, or end stage renal disease. We report a case of myoclonus in a patient with normal renal function and no previous disorders. A 69-year-old female underwent diskectomy and foraminotomy at the left L4-L5 level. Postoperatively, she complained of paresthesia in her left leg, which was thought to be due to root manipulation during surgery. To relieve the paresthesia, she was given tramadol, an oral opioid agonist, and GBP. One week after GBP was increased to 900 mg per day, myoclonus developed, which severely impaired her normal activity. Her symptoms resolved 2 days after discontinuation of GBP. The coadministration of tramadol and GBP may mutually enhance the myoclonic potential of each drug. The causal relationship between GBP and myoclonus was suggested by cessation of myoclonus after GBP discontinuation despite continued therapy with tramadol.","2158":"Total laminectomy for the removal of intradural-extramedullary spinal cord tumors has been used widely, but postoperative complications often develop, such as kyphosis, spinal instability, and persistent back pain. In this study, we evaluated seven patients with intradural-extramedullary spinal cord tumors with respect to the value of unilateral limited laminectomy. Our cases included six schwannomas, and one meningioma. The cervical region was involved in four cases, the thoracolumbar region in two cases, and the lumbar region in one case. The rationale for choosing a unilateral approach is to preserve musculoligamentous attachments and posterior bony elements as much as possible. The patients were mobilized on the third postoperative day and preoperative neurological symptoms were recovered within a few weeks. We did not observe any complication relating to unilateral limited laminectomy and at follow-up evaluation (at 3 and 12 months postoperatively), none of the patients showed spinal deformity or spinal instability. We think that the unilateral limited laminectomy is a safe and efficient technique for the treatment of intradural-extramedullary spinal cord tumors. We suggest that this technique is one of the best treatments for these tumors.","2159":"Earlier reports have revealed that the incidence of posttraumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) is higher among patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC). The aim of this study was to determine the influencing factors for the development of PTH after DC. A total of 693 head trauma patients admitted in our hospital between March 2004 and May 2007 were reviewed. Among thee, we analyzed 55 patients with severe traumatic brain injury who underwent DC. We excluded patients who had confounding variables. The 33 patients were finally enrolled in the study and data were collected retrospectively for these patients. The patients were divided into two groups: non-hydrocephalus group (Group I) and hydrocephalus group (Group II). Related factors assessed were individual Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), age, sex, radiological findings, type of operation, re-operation and outcome. Of the 693 patients with head trauma, 28 (4.0%) developed PTH. Fifty-five patients underwent DC and 13 (23.6%) developed PTH. Eleven of the 33 study patients (30.3%) who had no confounding factors were diagnosed with PTH. Significant differences in the type of craniectomy and re-operation were found between Group I and II. It is suggested that the size of DC and repeated operation may promote posttraumatic hydrocephalus in severe head trauma patients who underwent DC. ","2160":"The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the dynamic stabilization system in the treatment of degenerative spinal diseases. The study population included 20 consecutive patients (13 females, 7 males) with a mean age of 61+\/-6.98 years (range 46-70) who underwent decompression and dynamic stabilization with the Dynesys system between January 2005 and August 2006. The diagnoses included spinal stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis (9\/20, 45%), degenerative spinal stenosis (5\/20, 25%), adjacent segmental disease after fusion (3\/20, 15%), spinal stenosis with degenerative scoliosis (2\/20, 10%) and recurrent intervertebral lumbar disc herniation (1\/20, 5%). All of the patients completed the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Korean version of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The following radiologic parameters were measured in all patients : global lordotic angles and segmental lordotic angles (stabilized segments, above and below adjacent segments). The range of motion (ROM) was then calculated. The mean follow-up period was 27.25+\/-5.16 months (range 16-35 months), and 19 patients (95%) were available for follow-up. One patient had to have the implant removed. There were 30 stabilized segments in 19 patients. Monosegmental stabilization was performed in 9 patients (47.3%), 9 patients (47.3%) underwent two segmental stabilizations and one patient (5.3%) underwent three segmental stabilizations. The most frequently treated segment was L4-5 (15\/30, 50%), followed by L3-4 (12\/30, 40%) and L5-S1 (3\/30, 10%). The VAS decreased from 8.55+\/-1.21 to 2.20+\/-1.70 (p&lt;0.001), and the patients' mean score on the Korean version of the ODI improved from 79.58%+\/-15.93% to 22.17%+\/-17.24% (p&lt;0.001). No statistically significant changes were seen on the ROM at the stabilized segments (p=0.502) and adjacent segments (above segments, p=0.453, below segments, p=0.062). There were no patients with implant failure. The results of this study show that the Dynesys system could preserve the motion of stabilized segments and provide clinical improvement in patients with degenerative spinal stenosis with instability. Thus, dynamic stabilization systems with adequate decompression may be an alternative surgical option to conventional fusion in selected patients. ","2161":"Fractures of lumbo-sacral junction involving bilateral sacral wings are rare. Posterior lumbo-sacral fixation does not always provide with sufficient stability in such cases. Various augmentation techniques including divergent sacral ala screws, S2 pedicle screws and Galveston rods have been reported to improve lumbo-sacral stabilization. Galveston technique using iliac bones would be the best surgical approach especially in patients with bilateral comminuted sacral fractures. However, original Galveston surgery is technically demanding and bending rods into the appropriate alignment is time consuming. We present a patient with unstable lumbo-sacral junction fractures and comminuted U-shaped sacral fractures treated by lumbo-sacro-pelvic fixation using iliac screws and discuss about the advantages of the iliac screws over the rod system of Galveston technique.","2162":"We present a case with seizure, confusion, hypesthesia and paraplegia after intrathecal injection of fluorescein. A 41-year-old man was admitted to our institution for the management of the CSF leakage. Intrathecal injection of fluorescein was performed and he complained of severe pain and numbness in the lower extremities at the end of the injection. Four hours later, he exhibited confusion, paraparesis and two episodes of generalized seizures. Two days later, he showed paraplegia and all sensory modalities below the T12 level were absent. Spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed myelopathic change in the lower thoracic spinal cord. There was no improvement of weakness and sensory deficits in lower extremity even 14 days after fluorescein injection. We speculated that thoracic myelopathy was associated with the intrathecal injection of fluorescein. In spite of its rarity, the complication after intrathecal injection of fluorescein could be serious. Thus, obtaining an informed consent with discussion with patient before the procedure is mandatory.","2163":"Air within the spinal canal called pneumorrhachis has been seen rarely. We report a case showing multiple air pockets in the paraspinal and epidural space with vacuum disc and review pathogenesis and treatment of pneumorrhachis.","2164":"Forestier's disease is a systemic rheumatological abnormality in which exuberant ossification occurs along ligaments throughout the body, but most notably the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. This disease is usually asymptomatic; however dysphagia, dyspnea, and peripheral nerve entrapment have all been documented in association with the disorder. We report a rare case of catastrophic neurologic damage caused by Forestier's disease accompanying ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.","2165":"The authors describe a case of pseudoaneurysm arising from internal iliac artery presented with radiculopathy mimicking the symptoms of lumbar disc disease or spinal cord tumor. Among the several preoperative evaluation including CT, MRI, electrophysiologic study and ultrasonography, important diagnostic clue was obtained by ultrasonographic findings of turbulence flow at the core of partially enhanced mass in the pelvic cavity. The patient was managed with endovascular coil embolization successfully. The current case makes us remind that assessment of neurological symptoms on lower extremity should include consideration of extraspinal cause in pelvis.","2166":"A 57-year-old man presented with weakness in both legs upon awakening after drinking. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine did not reveal any intraspinal abnormalities but MRI of the pelvis revealed lesions with abnormal intensities with heterogeneous contrast enhancement in both gluteal muscles. Serum creatine phosphokinase was markedly elevated. A diagnosis of lumbosacral plexopathy, complicating rhabdomyolysis was made. With supportive care he recovered well but mild weakness of the right ankle remained at 6 month-follow-up. Pelvic MRI is a helpful diagnostic tool in localizing rhabdomyolysis. Lumbosacral plexopathy should be included in the differential diagnosis of the such cases, presenting with sudden weakness of legs.","2167":"Unruptured non-traumatic dissecting aneurysm in the M4 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) accompanied by complete occlusion of the ipsilateral internal cerebral artery (ICA) has never been reported. A 41-year-old man presented with an infarction manifesting as left-sided weakness and dysarthria. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed a subacute stage infarction in the right MCA territory and complete occlusion of the right ICA. Angiography demonstrated aneurysmal dilatation of the M4 segment of the right MCA. Surgery was performed to prevent hemorrhage from the aneurysm. The aneurysm was proximally clipped guided by Navigation-CT angiography and flow to the distal MCA was restored by superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis. We report this rare case with literature review.","2168":"Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are typically considered as benign tumors, with a favorable long-term prognosis. Drop metastasis of CPP into the spinal subarachnoid space is rare. We report a 42-year-old woman who presented with headache and back pain 6 years after removal of a posterior fossa CPP. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed mass lesions in the lumbosacral subarachnoid space and recurrent intracranial tumor. The lesions were resected and histologically diagnosed was CPP. We consider that CPP can spread via cerebrospinal fluid pathways and cause spinal drop metastasis. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the whole spinal axis and to perform periodic follow-up examinations in patients with CPP.","2169":"The brain is dependent on glucose as an energy source. Intricate homeostatic mechanisms have been implicated in maintaining the blood glucose concentration in the brain. The aim of this study is to find the way to identify the metabolic proteins regulating the glucose in rat hypothalamus. In this study, we analysed the secretome from rat hypothalamus in vivo. We introduced 500 nM of insulin into the rat hypothalamus. The chromatographic patterns of the secretome were identified, after which Mass Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry (MS-MS) analysis was performed. In Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, 60 proteins were identified in the secretome. Among them, 8 novel proteins were unveiled and were associated with the energy metabolism of insulin signaling in mitochondria of rat hypothalamic neuron. Nineteen other proteins have unknown functions. These ligands were confirmed to be secreting from the rat hypothalmus on insulin signaling by western blotting. The hypothalamus is the master endocrine gland responsible for the regulation of various physiological and metabolic processes. Proteomics using LC-MS analysis offer a efficient means for generating a comprehensive analysis of hypothalamic protein expression by insulin signaling. ","2170":"This study characterized the neurons in the lumbosacral cord that express phospho ERK (pERK) after distension or irritation of the bladder, and their relation to the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) positive primary afferents. Mechanical distension and chemical irritation of the bladder were induced by intravesical injection of the saline and mustard oil, respectively. Spinal neurons expressing pERK and the primary afferent fibers were characterized using multiple immunofluorescence for neurokinin 1 (NK1), neuronal nitric oxide synthetase (nNOS) and VR1. Neurons in lamina I, medial dorsal horn (MDH), dorsal gray commissure (DGC) and sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN) were immunoreactive for pERK after either mechanical or chemical stimulation. The majority of pERK positive cells were positive for NK1 in lamina I and SPN, but not in the DGC. Most of pERK positive cells are not stained for nNOS except in a small population of the cells in the SPN and DGC. Contacts between perikarya and dendrites of pERK-positive cells and terminals of primary afferents expressing VR1 were identified in lamina I, lateral collateral path (LCP) and SPN. In this study, the lumbosacral neurons activated by mechanical and chemical stimulation of the urinary bladder were identified with expression of the pERK, and also provided the evidence that VR1-positive primary afferents may mediate the activation of these neurons. ","2171":"It was hypothesized that dopamine agonist administration and subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesion in the rat might have a synergistic effect on the neuronal activities of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) as observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. The effects of SKF38393 (a D(1) receptor agonist) and Quinpirole (a D(2) receptor agonist) were compared in parkinsonian rat models with 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) after STN lesion. SKF38393 and Quinpirole were consecutively injected intrastriatally. SNpr was microrecorded to ascertain the activity of the basal ganglia output structure. The effect of SKF38393 or Quinpirole injection on the firing rate and firing patterns of SNpr was investigated in medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesioned rats and in MFB+STN lesioned rats. The administration of SKF38393 decreased SNpr neuronal firing rates and the percentage of burst neurons in the MFB lesioned rats, but did not alter them in MFB+STN lesioned rats. The administration ofQuinpirole significantly decreased the spontaneous firing rate in the MFB lesioned rats. However, after an additional STN lesion, it increased the percentage of burst neurons. This study demonstrated that dopamine agonists and STN lesion decreased the hyperactive firing rate and the percentage of burst neurons of SNpr neurons in 6-OHDA lesioned rats, respectively. Quinpirole with STN lesion increased a percentage of burst neurons. To clear the exact interactive mechanism of D(1) and D(2) agonist and the corresponding location, it should be followed a study using a nonselective dopamine agonist and D(1), D(2) selective antagonist. ","2172":"The aim of this study was to identify the anatomical location and course of the facial nerve (FN) and their relationship to the tumor size in surgically treated vestibular schwannomas. A retrospective study was conducted on 163 patients who had been treated by the microsurgical resection for a newly diagnosed vestibular schwannoma between 1995 and 2005 (mean age of 46.1 years; 108 females and 55 males). Surgery was carried out via retrosigmoid approach in all patients with the electromyographic monitoring for the FN function. The anatomical location and course of the FN along the tumor surface were verified in each patient during the microsurgery, and were classified into 4 groups : 1) the FN displaced along the ventral and superior surface of the tumor (VS); 2) the ventral and central (VC); 3) the ventral and inferior (VI); and 4) the dorsal (Do). THE FN DISPLACEMENT WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE FOLLOWINGS : VS in 91 patients (55.8%); VC in 57 (35.0%); VI in 14 (8.6%); and Do in 1 (0.6%). In the subgroup with tumors less than 2 cm in diameter (n=23), the FN was displaced along the ventral and central surface of the tumor in the majority (65.2%), whereas, in the patients with tumors larger than 2cm (n=140), it was displaced along the ventral and superior surface most frequently (59.3%). The FN can be displaced variably in vestibular schwannomas, and most frequently along the ventral and superior surface of the tumor, especially in large ones. ","2173":"Persistent trigeminal artery variant (PTAV) is an anastomosis between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the cerebellar artery without any interposing basilar artery segment. We discuss its probable embryological origin and emphasize clinical implications. Retrospectively 1250 conventional cerebral angiograms and 2947 cranial magnetic resonance angiographies (MRAs) were evaluated for the patients with PTAV. Five patients (four men and one woman, 23 to 76 years of age, median age 65 years) had a PTAV. Three patients who underwent MRA had a PTAV (3\/2947=0.1%). Four of the patients who underwent cerebral angiography had a PTAV (4\/1250=0.32%). Two of 143 patients who underwent both conventional angiography and cranial MRA showed PTAV. The PTAV was an incidental finding in all five patients. The PTAV originated from the cavernous segment of the left ICA in four patients and from the cavernous segment of the right ICA in one patient. The terminal branch of the PTAV was the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) in two patients and the AICA only in the other three patients. Neurosurgeons should be aware of possible presence of PTAV. Manipulation of this vessel during a surgical approach to the parasellar region and percutaneous gasserian ganglion procedure may result in hemorrhage or ischemia. ","2174":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the surgical results and prognostic factors for patients with soft cervical disc herniation with myelopathy. During the last 7 years, 26 patients with cervical discogenic myelopathy were undertaken anterior discectomy and fusion. Clinical and radiographic features were reviewed to evaluate the surgical results and prognostic factors. The clinical outcome was judged using two grading systems (Herkowitz's scale and Nurick's grade). Male were predominant (4:1), and C5-6 was the most frequently involved level. Gait disturbance, variable degree of spasticity, discomfort in chest and abdomen, hand numbness were the most obvious signs. Magnetic resonance(MR) images showed that central disc herniation was revealed in 16 cases, and accompanying cord signal changes in 4. Postoperatively, 23 patients showed favorable results (excellent, good and fair) according to Herkowitz's scale. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion effectively reduced myelopathic symptoms due to soft cervical disc herniation. The authors assured that the shorter duration of clinical attention, the lesser the degree of myelopathy and better outcome in discogenic myelopathy. ","2175":"Spinal cord hemangioblastoma is an uncommon vascular neoplasm with a benign nature and is associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease in 20-30% of patients. Total removal of these tumors without significant neurological deficit remains a great challenge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of VHL mutation analysis and to evaluate surgical outcome of patients with spinal cord hemangioblastomas. This study included nine patients treated for spinal cord hemangioblastomas at our institute between December 1994 and March 2006. There were four male and five female patients. Mean age was 37.8 years. The mean follow-up period was 22.4 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the complete neuraxis was done in all cases and VHL mutation analysis was performed in three cases for a definite diagnosis. Six patients had intramedullary tumor, and the remaining patients had intradural extramedullary lesions. Five patients were associated with VHL disease. The von Hippel-Lindau mutation analysis was done in three patients and two of them showed VHL gene abnormality. Tumors were located in the cervical cord in five cases and in the thoracic cord in four cases. All patients underwent surgical intervention, and total removal was achieved in six cases. All patients showed improvement or, at least, clinically stationary state. Surgical complications did not develop in any cases. Spinal hemangioblastoma in this series has been safely and effectively removed via a posterior approach. Postoperatively, clinical outcome was excellent in the majority of cases. The VHL mutation analysis was useful in patients with family history and in those with multiple hemangioblastomas. ","2176":"Recently, intracranial atherosclerosis has become a major cause of ischemic stroke, appearing more frequently in Koreans than Caucasians. Symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis is a disease that could recur readily even during the treatment with anti-platelet agents. When the symptoms develop, ischemic stroke can not be recovered readily. Therefore, aggressive treatments such as endovascular therapy and bypass surgery are required in addition to medical treatment for the intracranial artery stenosis. Recent intracranial stenting and drug eluting stenting have shown as very advanced effective therapeutic modalities. Nevertheless, until now, a randomized controlled study has not been conducted. Regarding bypass surgery, since the failed EC-IC bypass surgery study performed 20 years ago, extensive studies on its efficacy has not been conducted yet, and thus it has to be performed strictly only in hemodynamically compromised patients. Unless breakthrough drugs that suppress the progression of intracranial atherosclerosis and the formation of thrombi, and facilitate the regression of the arterial stenosis, the treatment concept of the recovery of the blood flow of stenotic arterial territory by mechanical recanalization or bypass surgery would be remained for the prevention as well as treatment of ischemic stroke caused by intracranial atherosclerosis.","2177":"Low back pain is common during pregnancy. However, the prevalence of symtomatic lumbar disc herniation is rare, and cauda equina syndrome due to disc herniation during pregnancy is even rarer. We report a rare case of lumbar disc herniation causing cauda equina syndrome during third trimester of pregnancy which successfully treated by endoscopic discectomy. This case shows that endoscopic discectomy can be the treatment option for the lumbar disc herniation during pregnancy.","2178":"Hematomas caused by ruptured traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) usually present with extradural hematomas, whereas intradural intraparenchymal hematomas are extremely rare. We report a case of traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the MMA giving rise to an intracerebral hematoma after head trauma. A 70-year-old man suffered a massive intracerebral temporoparietal hemorrhage after a head injury. CT angiogram of the brain revealed a large hematoma in the right middle cranial fossa extending to the right sylvian fissure. Cerebral angiogram also revealed a pseudoaneurysm of the MMA, which was successfully treated surgically. Although traumatic MMA pseudoaneurysm producing intracerebral hematoma (ICH) is rare, it should be considered as a possible cause of intracerebral hematoma.","2179":"A 26-year-old man was admitted to our department due to intermittent left hemiparesis for 3 months. Magnetic resonance image showed subacute infarction in the right precentral gyrus. Digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed an aneurysmal protrusion at the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation. It was difficult to differentiate the aneurysm from the occlusion of the middle trunk of the MCA trifurcation. Brain single photon emission computerized tomography showed a decrease in perfusion in the right posterior frontal lobe without vascular reserve. Therefore, we planned a superficial temporal artery-MCA anastomosis with an exploration of the right MCA bifurcation. Intraoperatively, the aneurysmal opacification on preoperative angiography proved to be the proximal stump of the occluded middle trunk of the MCA trifurcation. An aneurysmal protrusion at the MCA bifurcation does not always indicate an aneurysm. In diagnosing protruding vascular lesions at the MCA bifurcation, the possibility of a vascular stump should be considered according to their angioanatomical appearance and the history of the patient.","2180":"Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) has been considered as a low grade tumor of adolescents and young adults. Although this tumor often shows cystic component, the hemorrhage within the cyst is extremely rare. The authors report a rare case of cystic PXA with a hemorrhage within the cyst and the mural nodule in the left frontal lobe. A 64-year-old male presented with a week history of the right side hemiparesis. After gross total resection of the tumor, the patient was fully recovered from neurological deficit. It is suggested that this typically benign tumor could be presented with hemorrhage, causing a rapid neurological deterioration. Prompt surgical intervention, especially total removal of the tumor can provide an excellent functional recovery.","2181":"Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) tuberculosis is a rare disease, potentially causing severe instability and neurological deficits. The authors present a case of CVJ tuberculosis with atlantoaxial dislocation and retropharyngeal abscess in a 28-year-old man with neck pain and quadriparesis. Radiological evaluations showed a widespread extradural lesion around the clivus, C1, and C2. Two stage operations with transoral decompression and posterior occipitocervical fusion were performed. The pathological findings confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Treatment options in CVJ tuberculosis are controversial without well-defined guidelines. But radical operation (anterior decompression and posterior fusion and fixation) is necessary in patient with neurological deficit due to cord compression, extensive bone destruction, and instability or dislocation. The diagnosis and treatment options are discussed.","2182":"Most posttraumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is noticed by the patients with the first symptom, rhinorrhea. A 38-year-old woman presented with frequent clear continuous rhinorrhea and otorrhea for 5 years after basilar skull fracture. After this, meningitis was developed with subsequent CSF fistula. Her clinical symptom was improved by medical treatment. The dural defect and CSF leakage were not detected by computerized tomography (CT) cisternography.

The patient has returned to independent living.","2184":"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been used as an anticancer agent in traditional Chinese medicine for thousand years and berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid present that has indicated significant antimicrobial activity. We have examined the combined anticancer effects of As(2)O(3) and berberine against the human neuroblastoma (HNB) SH-SY5Y cells in vitro, and to elucidate underlying molecular mechanism. HNB SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 2 microM As(2)O(3) and 75 microg\/ml berberine, and their survival, cell death mechanism as well as synergistic cytotoxic effects were estimated by using MTT assay, DAPI staining, agarose gel electrophoresis, flow cytometric analysis, and western blot analysis. The combined treatment of two drugs also markedly decreased cell viability. The cytotoxic effects of two drugs were revealed as apoptosis characterized by chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The apoptotic cytotoxicity was accompanied by activation of caspase-3 protease as well as decreased the expression of Bcl-2, Bid, and Bcl-x\/L. In addition, the cells treated with combination of two drugs also showed significantly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and lipid peroxidation compared to cells As(2)O(3) or berberine only. Combined treatment of As(2)O(3) with berberine induced activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in HNB SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest that the possibility of the combined treatment of two chemotherapeutic agents with low concentration improving cytotoxic effect for cancer cells with minimal side effects. ","2185":"The focus of aneurysm surgery is eliminating unnecessary operative manipulations and preparing the surgeon for any crises that might arise. With this concept in mind, we have tried resection of the gyrus rectus without routine sylvian fissure dissection in selected patients with anterior communicating artery (ACom) aneurysms, and compared these results with those from the conventional transsylvian approach. This retrospective study included 231 surgically treated patients with ACom aneurysms from March, 1997 to May, 2005. The patients were divided into two groups : Group A (96 with sylvian fissure dissection, March, 1997-December, 2000) and Group B (135 without sylvian fissure dissection, January, 2001-May, 2005). Overall surgical outcomes were compared, and operative times have been prospectively recorded since January, 04 to evaluate how this maneuver affected the length of surgical procedures. All aneurysms were satisfactorily clipped, and there was no evidence of increased number of procedure-related retraction injuries in group B. Overall outcome was good in 186 (80.5%); 76 (79.2%) in group A, and 110 (81.5%) in group B (x(2) test, p=0.79). In good clinical grade of group A, good outcome was observed in 60 patients (89.6%) and in group B, 97 patients (94.2%) (Fisher's exact test, p=0.38) (Fig. 2). In this study, eliminating the step of sylvian fissure dissection by gentle lateral basal-frontal retraction to the side of the sylvian fissure did not increase morbidity and mortality. However, we do not intend to modify the standard approach to the ACom aneurysm that is familiar to and has been mastered by many others. Rather, we report our experience on the basis of our anatomic understanding of the technique and its results. ","2186":"Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity. Although many different operative techniques have been introduced, none of them have been proven superior to others. Simple cubital tunnel decompression has numerous advantages, including simplicity and safety. We present our experience of treating cubital tunnel syndrome with simple decompression in 15 patients. According to Dellon's criteria, one patient was classified as grade 1, eight as grade 2, and six as grade 3. Preoperative electrodiagnostic studies were performed in all patients and 7 of them were rechecked postoperatively. Five patients of 15 underwent simple decompression using a small skin incision (2 cm or less). Preoperative mean value of motor conduction velocity (MCV) within the segment (above the elbow-below the elbow) was 41.8+\/-15.2 m\/s and this result showed a decrease compared to the result of MCV in the below the elbow-wrist segment (57.8+\/-6.9 m\/s) with statistical significance (p&lt;0.05). Postoperative mean values of MCV were improved in 6 of 7 patients from 39.8+\/-12.1 m\/s to 47.8+\/-12.1 m\/s (p&lt;0.05). After an average follow-up of 4.8+\/-5.3 months, 14 patients of 15 (93%) reported good or excellent clinical outcomes according to a modified Bishop scoring system. Five patients who had been treated using a small skin incision achieved good or excellent outcomes. There were no complications, recurrences, or subluxation of the ulnar nerve. Simple decompression of the ulnar nerve is an effective and successful minimally invasive technique for patients with cubital tunnel syndrome. ","2187":"High-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch (HES) compromises blood coagulation more than does low-molecular-weight HES. We compared the effects of low- and high-molecular-weight HES for the treatment of vasospasm and investigated the dose relationship with each other. Retrospectively, in a series of consecutive 102 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 35 patients developed clinical symptoms of vasospasm of these fourteen patients were treated with low-molecular-weight HES for volume expansion while the other 21 received high-molecular-weight HES as continuous intravenous infusion. Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level, and platelet count were all measured prior to initiation, during treatment and after termination of therapy for symptomatic vasospasm. The total dose of HES ranged from 5 L to 14 L and median infusion duration was 10 days. A more pronounced PTT prolongation was observed in high-molecular-weight HES group compared with low-molecular-weight HES group. No other coagulation parameters were altered. Dosage (=duration) shows a positive correlation with PTT. Clinically, significant bleeding episodes were noted in four patients who received high-molecular-weight HES. Coagulopathy was developed in direct proportion to molecular weight of starch and dosages. We propose the extreme caution in the administration of HES solution for the vasospasm treatment. ","2188":"Balloon kyphoplasty can effectively relieve the symptomatic pain and correct the segmental deformity of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. While many articles have reported on the effectiveness of the procedure, there has not been any research on the factors affecting the deformity correction. Here, we evaluated both the relationship between postoperative pain relief and restoration of the vertebral height, and segmental kyphosis, as well as the various factors affecting segmental deformity correction after balloon kyphoplasty. Between January 2004 and December 2006, 137 patients (158 vertebral levels) underwent balloon kyphoplasty. We analyzed various factors such as the age and sex of the patient, preoperative compression ratio, kyphotic angle of compressed segment, injected PMMA volume, configuration of compression, preoperative bone mineral density (BMD) score, time interval between onset of symptom and the procedure, visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain rating and surgery-related complications. The mean postoperative VAS score improvement was 4.93+\/-0.17. The mean postoperative height restoration rate was 17.8+\/-1.57% and the kyphotic angle reduction was 1.94+\/-0.38 degrees . However, there were no significant statistical correlations among VAS score improvement, height restoration rate, and kyphotic angle reduction. Among the various factors, the configuration of the compressed vertebral body (p=0.002) was related to the height restoration rate and the direction of the compression (p=0.006) was related with the kyphotic angle reduction. The preoperative compression ratio (p=0.023, p=0.006) and injected PMMA volume (p&lt;0.001, p=0.035) affected both the height restoration and kyphotic angle reduction. Only the preoperative compression ratio was found to be as an independent affecting factor (95% CI : 1.064-5.068). The two major benefits of balloon kyphoplasty are immediate pain relief and local deformity correction, but segmental deformity correction achieved by balloon kyphoplasty does not result in additional pain relief. Among the factors that were shown to affect the segmental deformity correction, configuration of the compressed vertebral body, direction of the most compressed area, and preoperative compression ratio were not modifiable. However, careful preoperative consideration about the modifiable factor, the PMMA volume to inject, may contribute to the dynamic correction of the segmental deformity. ","2189":"There are numerous reports on the primary stabilizing effects of the different cervical cages for cervical radiculopathy. But, little is known about the subsidence which may be clinical problem postoperatively. The goal of this study is to evaluate subsidence of cage and investigate the correlation between radiologic subsidence and clinical outcome. To assess possible subsidence, the authors investigated clinical and radiological results of the one-hundred patients who underwent anterior cervical fusion by using AMSLUtrade mark cage during the period between January 2003 and June 2005. Preoperative and postoperative lateral radiographs were measured for height of intervertebral disc space where cages were placed. Intervertebral disc space was measured by dividing the sum of anterior, posterior, and midpoint interbody distance by 3. Follow-up time was 6 to 12 months. Subsidence was defined as any change in at least one of our parameters of at least 3 mm. Subsidence was found in 22 patients (22%). The mean value of subsidence was 2.21 mm, and mean subsidence rate was 22%. There were no cases of the clinical status deterioration during the follow-up period. No posterior or anterior migration was observed. The phenomenon of subsidence is seen in substantial number of patients. Nevertheless, clinical and radiological results of the surgery were favorable. An excessive subsidence may result in hardware failure. Endplate preservation may enables us to control subsidence and reduce the number of complications. ","2190":"Kyphoplasty performed in the middle thoracic spine presents technical challenges that differ from those in the lower thoracic or lumbar region due to small pedicle size and angular severity for thoracic kyphosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of balloon kyphoplasty through extrapedicular approach for the treatment of intractable osteoporotic compression fractures in the middle thoracic spine. The patients who were performed with one level balloon kyphoplasty through extrapedicular approach due to painful osteoporotic compression fractures at T5-T8 from June 2003 to July 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Imaging and clinical features were analyzed including involved vertebrae level, vertebral height, injected cement volume, clinical outcome and complications. Eighteen female patients (age ranged from 60 to 77 years old) were included in this study. The average amount of the implanted cement was 4.2+\/-1.5 cc. The mean cobb angle and compression rate were improved from 12.1+\/-6.5 degrees to 8.5+\/-7.2 degrees and from 30% to 15%, respectively. The mean pain score (visual analogue scale) prior to kyphoplasty was 7.9 and it decreased to 3.0 after the procedure. Cement leakage to the adjacent disc (2 cases) and paravertebral soft tissues (1 case) were seen but there were no major complications such as pneumothorax, segmental artery injury, pulmonary embolism, or epidural leakage. Balloon kyphoplasty through extrapedicular approach is considered as a safe and effective in treating the middle thoracic regions with low complication rate. ","2191":"Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is characterized by tonic clonic contractions of the muscles innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve. Compression of the facial nerve by an ectatic vessel is widely recognized as the most common underlying etiology. HFS needs to be differentiated from other causes of facial spasms, such as facial tic, ocular myokymia, and blepharospasm. To understand the overall craniofacial abnormalities and to perform the optimal surgical procedures for HFS, we are to review the prevalence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, details of each treatment modality, usefulness of brainstem auditory evoked potentials monitoring, debates on the facial EMG, clinical course, and complications from the literature published from 1995 to the present time.","2192":"The authors herein propose the staged excision as a novel strategy to preserve facial nerve and minimize complication during microsurgery of large vestibular schwannoma (VS). At the first stage, for reducing mass effect on the brain stem and cerebellum, subtotal tumor resection was performed via a retrosigmoid craniotomy without intervention of meatal portion of tumor. With total resection of the remaining tumor, the facial nerve was decompressed and delineated during the second stage translabyrinthine approach at a later date. A 38-year-old female who underwent the staging operation for resection of her huge VS is illustrated.","2193":"We report a case of arachnoid cyst in which subdural hematoma and intracystic hemorrhage developed spontaneously. Usually, arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic, but can become symptomatic because of cyst enlargement or hemorrhage, often after mild head trauma. Although they are sometimes combined with subdural hematoma, intracystic hemorrhage has rarely been observed. Our patient had a simultaneous subdural hematoma and intracystic hemorrhage without evidence of head trauma.","2194":"The syndrome of the sinking skin flap was introduced to explain the phenomenon of neurological deterioration after decompressive craniectomy. A 37-year-old man was admitted with acute subdural hematoma and traumatic intraparenchymal hematoma. After decompressive craniectomy, the patient suffered from hydrocephalus for which a ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunt was inserted. Following this procedure, the depression of the skin flap became remarkable and his mentation was deteriorated. The patient recovered uneventfully after temporary elevating of valve pressure and cranioplasty. We present a patient who was successfully managed with elevation of valve pressure and cranioplasty for the syndrome of the sinking scalp flap with review of a pertinent literature.","2195":"We experienced a case of giant arachnoid granulation misdiagnosed as dural sinus thrombosis. A 66-year-old woman presented with a one month history of progressive occipital headache. Computed tomography angiography and cerebral angiography showed a round filling defect at the transverse sinus which was speculated as a transverse sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy was performed to prevent worsening of thrombosis for 2 weeks and then a Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed. The filling defect lesion at the transverse sinus revealed a non-enhancing granule with central linear enhancement, which was compatible with giant arachnoid granulation. We checked the intrasinus pressure difference across the lesion the through the dural sinus in order to exclude the lesion as the cause of headache. Normal venous pressure with no significant differential pressure across the lesion was noted. Headache was treated with medical therapy.","2196":"Fungal infections of the spine are relatively uncommon. Moreover, cervical spondylodiscitis due to Candida albicans in non-immunocompromised patient is very rare. We report a case of Candida spondylodiscitis in a 64-year-old woman who complained of neck pain. The clinical feature and treatment option are presented with a review of pertinent literatures.","2197":"Even though intracerebral hematoma (ICH) due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm has been treated by aneurysm clipping at the same time of removal of ICH through craniotomy, such management strategy is controversial in an aged patients with poor clinical grade. In this regards, stereotactic aspiration of hematoma following coil embolization can be an alternative treatment modality. Thus, the authors report a case of an aged patient who underwent stereotactic aspiration of ICH following coil embolization for the ruptured aneurysm with a brief review of literature.","2198":"Brucellosis, a zoonosis with worldwide distribution, is a systemic infection caused by facultative intracellular bacteria of the genus Brucella, which can involve multiple organs and tissues. We report an uncommon case of spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess due to Brucella in a male stockbreeder. Diagnosis was based on clinical history, and supported by Brucella serology and magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical and radiological improvement were observed with a combined antimicrobial therapy of doxycycline, rifampicin, and gentamycin.","2199":"Meningioma en plaque (MEP) is a rare tumor characterized more by its clinical and biological behavior than its histological appearance. Hyperostosis of the skull is one of the characteristic signs of MEP. This bony change can produce clinical symptoms and signs in MEP by pressing against adjacent structures. The authors report a rare case of an osteolytic MEP extending from the sphenoid wing into the orbital wall, middle fossa, and temporalis muscle.","2200":"We present a rare case of fracture-dislocation at the level of the first sacral (S1) and second sacral (S2) vertebrae. The S1 was displaced forward into the pelvic cavity and was located just in front of the S2. Because the patient also had extensive neurological injury to the lumbar plexus and instability of the pelvic ring, surgery to stabilize the pelvis and to decompress the lumbar plexus was performed. The surgery was successful and the patient experienced marked improvement in neurological function.","2201":"The authors developed a stereotactic device for irradiation of small animals with Leksell Gamma Knife(R) Model C. Development and verification procedures were described in this article. The device was designed to satisfy three requirements. The mechanical accuracy in positioning was to be managed within 0.5 mm. The strength of the device and structure were to be compromised to provide enough strength to hold a small animal during irradiation and to interfere the gamma ray beam as little as possible. The device was to be used in combination with the Leksell G-frame(R) and KOPF(R) rat adaptor. The irradiation point was determined by separate imaging sequences such as plain X-ray images. The absolute dose rate with the device in a Leksell Gamma Knife was 3.7% less than the value calculated from Leksell Gamma Plan(R). The dose distributions measured with GAFCHROMIC(R) MD-55 film corresponded to those of Leksell Gamma Plan(R) within acceptable range. The device was used in a series of rat experiments with a 4 mm helmet of Leksell Gamma Knife. A stereotactic device for irradiation of small animals with Leksell Gamma Knife Model C has been developed so that it fulfilled above requirements. Absorbed dose and dose distribution at the center of a Gamma Knife helmet are in acceptable ranges. The device provides enough accuracy for stereotactic irradiation with acceptable practicality. ","2202":"Both endovascular coil embolization and microsurgical clipping are now firmly established as treatment options for the management of cerebral aneurysms. Moreover, they are sometimes used as complementary approaches each other. This study retrospectively analyzed our experience with endovascular and microsurgical procedures as complementary approaches in treating a single aneurysm. Nineteen patients with intracranial aneurysm were managed with both endovascular and microsurgical treatments. All of the aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation. Eighteen patients presented with SAH, and 14 aneurysms had diameters of less than 10 mm, and five had diameters of 10-25 mm. Thirteen of the 19 patients were initially treated with endovascular coil embolization, followed by microsurgical management. Of the 13 patients, 9 patients had intraprocedural complications during coil embolization (intraprocedural rupture, coil protrusion, coil migration), rebleeding with regrowth of aneurysm in two patients, residual sac in one patient, and coil compaction in one patient. Six patients who had undergone microsurgical clipping were followed by coil embolization because of a residual aneurysm sac in four patients, and regrowth in two patients. In intracranial aneurysms involving procedural endovascular complications or incomplete coil embolization and failed microsurgical clipping, because of anatomical and\/or technical difficulties, the combined and complementary therapy with endovascular coiling and microsurgical clipping are valuable in providing the best outcome. ","2203":"Rapid increase in aged population and westernization of lifestyle have modified epidemiological status of stroke. The purpose of this study is to analyze changing trends of stroke epidemiology in South Korea. We reviewed retrospectively medical records of 1,124 cases diagnosed as stroke among 54,534 patients who visited the Emergency Medical Center at our hospital from January 1994 to December 1996 (Group A). Also, we evaluated 1,705 cases diagnosed as stroke among 55,381 patients who visited to the same hospital from January 2003 to December 2005 (Group B). The variable features of stroke, such as age, sex, seasonal variation and distribution of stroke subtypes were studied by comparing group A with B. In group A, hemorrhagic stroke (67.9%) was more prevalent than ischemic stroke (32.1%). However, group B showed that the ratio of hemorrhagic stroke (40.3%) to ischemic stroke (59.6%) has been reversed. The highest incidence of stroke was noted in their sixties and seventies of age in group B, which was older than that of group A. In group A, male ischemic stroke (IS) patients outnumbered female patients (1.26:1). Moreover, this gender disproportion became higher in group B (1.53:1). In group A, the number of male intracerebral hermorrhage (ICH) patients were similar to that of female patients (0.97:1). However, male ICH patients outnumbered female patients in group B (1.23:1). As for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), female patients outnumbered male patients more than two-fold in both groups. Both groups showed that the occurrence of ischemic stroke was highest in summer, but that of hemorrhagic stroke was the highest in winter. This study showed the changing trends of stroke in its distribution of subtypes. Multicenter prospective study using stroke registry would be required for the determination of national epidemiologic trends. ","2204":"Burr hole drainage has been widely used to treat chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH). However, the incidence of recurrent CSDH varies from 3.7 to 30% after surgery. The authors attempted to elucidate the risk factors associated with the recurrence of CSDH in one burr hole drainage technique. A total of 255 consecutive cases who underwent one burr hole drainage for CSDH were included in this study. Twenty-four patients (9.4%) underwent a repeated operation because of the recurrence of CSDH. We analyzed retrospectively the demographic, clinical and radiologic factors associated with the recurrence of CSDH. In this study, two risk factors were found to be independently associated with the recurrence of CSDH. The incidence of CSDH recurrence in the high- and mixed-density groups was significantly higher than those in the low- and iso-density groups (p&lt;0.001). Bleeding tendency such as in leukemia, liver disease and chronic renal failure was also significantly associated with recurrence of CSDH (p=0.037). These results suggest that high- and mixed- density shown on computed tomographic scan was closely relates with a high incidence of recurrence. Therefore, the operation could be delayed in those cases unless severe symptoms or signs are present. Reoperation using the previous burr hole site is a preferred modality to treat the recurrent CSDH. ","2205":"To evaluate the surgical outcomes of ventral interbody grafting and anterior or posterior spinal instrumentation for the treatment of advanced spondylodiscitis in patients who had failed medical management. A total of 28 patients were evaluated for associated medical illness, detected pathogen, level of involved spine, and perioperative complications. Radiological evaluation including the rate of bony union, segmental Cobb angle, graft- and instrumentation-related complications, and clinical outcomes by mean Frankel scale and VAS score were performed. There are 14 pyogenic spondylodiscitis, 6 postoperative spondylodiscitis, and 8 tuberculous spondylodiscitis. There were 21 males and 7 females. Mean age was 51 years, with a range from 18 to 77. Mean follow-up period was 10.9 months. Associated medical illnesses were 6 diabetes, 3 pulmonary tuberculosis, and 4 chronic liver diseases. Staphylococcus was the most common pathogen isolated (25%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 18% of the patients. Operative approaches, either anterior or posterior spinal instrumentation, were done simultaneously or delayed after anterior aggressive debridement, neural decompression, and structural interbody bone grafting. All patients with neurological deficits improved after operation, except only one who died from aggravation as military tuberculosis. Mean Frankel scale was changed from 3.78+\/-0.78 preoperatively to 4.78+\/-0.35 at final follow up and mean VAS score was improved from 7.43+\/-0.54 to 2.07+\/-1.12. Solid bone fusion was obtained in all patients except only one patient who died. There was no need for prolongation of duration of antibiotics and no evidence of secondary infection owing to spinal instrumentations. According to these results, debridement and anterior column reconstruction with ventral interbody grafting and instrumentation is effective and safe in patients who had failed medical management and neurological deficits in advanced spondylodiscitis. ","2206":"The author conducted a survey on the current status of neurosurgery around the world in preparation for Presidential Address at the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery (ISPN). The addresses and findings from the survey were presented at ISPN in 2006 and Child's Nervous System in 2007. After reviewing the current status of neurosurgery of various countries, the author would like to share this information with members of the Korean Neurosurgical Society, as well as offer a proposal to promote Korean neurosurgery around the world.","2207":"Surgical elevation of the depressed bone is known to be the conventional treatment usually recommended for a simple depressed skull fracture in the adult or pediatric age. The authors introduce, however, a case of depressed skull fracture in an infant which was elevated by means of a cup of breast pump and a suction generator without surgical elevation. In our case, without surgery, a 'cup-shaped' depressed skull fracture in an infant was safely elevated with no neurological signs. This method is considered a simple, effective, safe, and alternative procedure in an infant with simple depressed skull fracture.","2208":"The azygos anterior cerebral artery, a rare anomaly in the circle of Willis in which only a single vessel supplies the medial aspects of both anterior cerebral hemispheres, is closely associated with saccular aneurysms. We present three cases of azygos anterior cerebral artery aneurysms among the 781 cerebral aneurysms surgically treated at our institution in an 11-year period. These three cases all involved elderly women who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Conventional cerebral angiography and CT angiography revealed small saccular aneurysms at the distal ends of the azygos anterior cerebral arteries. These aneurysms were clipped successfully using a bifrontal interhemispheric approach. Hence, the pathogenesis of these particular aneurysms relating to hemodynamic change, associated anomalies, and surgical pitfalls is discussed with review of literature.","2209":"Repeated administration of mannitol in the setting of large hemispheric infarction is a controversial and poorly defined therapeutic intervention. This study was performed to examine the effects of multiple-dose mannitol on a brain edema after large hemispheric infarction. A middle cerebral artery was occluded with the rat suture model for 6 hours and reperfused in 22 rats. The rats were randomly assigned to either control (n=10) or the mannitol-treated group (n=12) in which intravenous mannitol infusions (0.8 g\/kg) were performed six times every four hours. After staining a brain slice with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, the weight of hemispheres, infarcted (IH) and contralateral (CH), and the IH\/CH weight ratio were examined, and then hemispheric accumulation of mannitol was photometrically evaluated based on formation of NADH catalyzed by mannitol dehydrogenase. Mannitol administration produced changes in body weight of -7.6+\/-1.1%, increased plasma osmolality to 312+\/-8 mOsm\/L. It remarkably increased weight of IH (0.77+\/-0.06 gm versus 0.68+\/-0.03 gm : p&lt;0.01) and the IH\/CH weight ratio (1.23+\/-0.07 versus 1.12+\/-0.05 : p&lt;0.01). The photometric absorption at 340 nm of the cerebral tissue in the mannitol-treated group was increased to 0.375+\/-0.071 and 0.239+\/-0.051 in the IH and CH, respectively from 0.167+\/-0.082 and 0.162+\/-0.091 in the IH and CH of the control group (p&lt;0.01). Multiple-dose mannitol is likely to aggravate cerebral edema due to parenchymal accumulation of mannitol in the infarcted brain tissue. ","2210":"The aim of this study was to analyze the treatment results and prognostic factors in patients with massive cerebral infarction who underwent decompressive craniectomy. From January 2000 to December 2005, we performed decompressive craniectomy in 24 patients with massive cerebral infarction. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records, radiological findings, initial clinical assessment using the Glasgow Coma Scale, serial computerized tomography (CT) with measurement of midline and septum pellucidum shift, and cerebral infarction territories. Patients were evaluated based on the following factors : the pre- and post-operative midline shifting on CT scan, infarction area or its dominancy, consciousness level, pupillary light reflex and Glasgow Outcome Scale. All 24 patients (11 men, 13 women; mean age, 63 years; right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, 17 patients; left MCA territory, 7 patients) were treated with large decompressive craniectomy and duroplasty. The average time interval between the onset of symptoms and surgical decompression was 2.5 days. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale was 12.4 on admission and 8.3 preoperatively. Of the 24 surgically treated patients, the good outcome group (Group 2 : GOS 4-5) comprised 9 cases and the poor outcome group (Group1 : GOS 1-3) comprised 15 cases. We consider decompressive craniectomy for large hemispheric infarction as a life-saving procedure. Good preoperative GCS, late clinical deterioration, small size of the infarction area, absence of anisocoria, and preoperative midline shift less than 11mm were considered to be positive predictors of good outcome. Careful patient selection based on the above-mentioned factors and early operation may improve the functional outcome of surgical management for large hemispheric infarction. ","2211":"Stroke is the most prevalent disease involving the central nervous system. Since medical modalities are sometimes ineffective for the acute edema following massive infarction, surgical decompression may be an effective option when medical treatments fail. The present study was undertaken to assess the outcome and prognostic factors of decompressive surgery in life threatening acute, severe, brain infarction. We retrospectively analyzed twenty-six patients (17 males and 9 females; average age, 49.7yrs) who underwent decompressive surgery for severe cerebral or cerebellar infarction from January 2003 to December 2006. Surgical indication was based on the clinical signs such as neurological deterioration, pupillary reflex, and radiological findings. Clinical outcome was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Of the 26 patients, 5 (19.2%) showed good recovery, 5 (19.2%) showed moderate disability, 2 (7.7%) severe disability, 6 (23.1%) persistent experienced vegetative state, and 8 (30.8%) death. In this study, the surgical decompression improved outcome for cerebellar infarction, but decompressive surgery did not show a good result for MCA infarction (30.8% overall mortality vs 100% mortality). The dominant-hemisphere infarcts showed worse prognosis, compared with nondominant-hemisphere infarcts (54.5% vs 70%). Poor prognostic factors were diabetes mellitus, dominant-hemisphere infarcts and low preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. The patients who exhibit clinical deterioration despite aggressive medical management following severe cerebral infarction should be considered for decompressive surgery. For better outcome, prompt surgical treatment is mandatory. We recommend that patients with severe cerebral infarction should be referred to neurosurgical department primarily in emergency setting or as early as possible for such prompt surgical treatment. ","2212":"The purpose of the study was to determine the clinical effects of anterior radical debridement on a series of patients with spontaneous spinal infection. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 32 patients who underwent surgical treatment from January 2000 to December 2005 in our department. The average follow-up Period was 33.4 months (range, 6 to 87 months). Thirty-two patients presented with the following : 23 cases with pyogenic spondylitis, eight with tuberculous spondylitis and one with fungal spondylitis. The indications for surgery were intractable pain, failure of medical management, neurological impairment with or without an associated abscess, vertebral destruction causing spinal instability and\/or segmental kyphosis. The study included 15 (46.9%) males and 17 (53.1%) females ranging in age from 26 to 75 years (mean, 53.1 years). Diabetes mellitus (DM) and pulmonary Tbc were the most common predisposing factors for pyogenic spondylitis and tuberculous spondylitis. Staphylococcus aureus (13%) was the main organism isolated. The most prevalent location was the lumbar spine (75%). Changes in the pain score, Frankel's classification, and laboratory parameters demonstrated a significant clinical improvement in all patients. However, there were recurrent infections in two patients with tuberculous spondylitis and inappropriate debridement and intolerance of medication and noncompliance. Autologous rib, iliac bone and allograft (fibular) were performed in most patients. However, 10 patients were grafted using a titanium mesh cage after anterior radical debridement. There were no recurrent infections in the 10 cases using the mesh cage with radical debridement. The findings of this study indicate that surgery based on appropriate surgical indications is effective for the control of spinal infection and prevention of recurrence with anterior radical debridement, proper drug use and abscess drainage. ","2213":"The objective of this study is to investigate the safety, surgical efficacy, and advantages of a polyaxial screw-rod system for posterior occipitocervicothoracic arthrodesis. Charts and radiographs of 32 patients who underwent posterior cervical fixation between October 2004 and February 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Posterior cervical polyaxial screw-rod fixation was applied on the cervical spine and\/or upper thoracic spine. The surgical indication was fracture or dislocation in 18, C1-2 ligamentous injury with trauma in 5, atlantoaxial instability by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) in 4, cervical spondylosis with myelopathy in 4, and spinal metastatic tumor in 1. The patients were followed up and evaluated based on their clinical status and radiographs at 1, 3, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. A total of 189 screws were implanted in 32 patients. Fixation was carried out over an average of 3.3 spinal segment (range, 2 to 7). The mean follow-up interval was 20.2 months. This system allowed for screw placement in the occiput, C1 lateral mass, C2 pars, C3-7 lateral masses, as well as the lower cervical and upper thoracic pedicles. Satisfactory bony fusion and reduction were achieved and confirmed in postoperative flexion-extension lateral radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans in all cases. Revision surgery was required in two cases due to deep wound infection. One case needed a skin graft due to necrotic change. There was one case of kyphotic change due to adjacent segmental degeneration. There were no other complications, such as cord or vertebral artery injury, cerebrospinal fluid leak, screw malposition or back-out, or implant failure, and there were no cases of postoperative radiculopathy due to foraminal stenosis. Posterior cervical stabilization with a polyaxial screw-rod system is a safe and reliable technique that appears to offer several advantages over existing methods. Further biomechanical testings and clinical experiences are needed in order to determine the true benefits of this procedure. ","2214":"Combined antero-posterior fixation has been a standard method for bilateral interfacetal dislocation in cervical spine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and complication of anterior cervical stabilization in treatment of bilateral interfacetal dislocation. A total of 65 cases of traumatic bilateral interfacetal dislocation in cervical spine who were managed in our institution, from Mar. 1997 to Feb. 2006, were included in this study. Closed reduction was tried in all cases before operation. If closed reduction was accomplished successfully, only anterior cervical fixation was performed (Group I), and attempted to place screws bicortically as possible with unicortical screws. If failed, posterior open reduction with fixation was first tried, followed by anterior cervical fixation (Group II). All patients were evaluated for neurological outcome and radiological evidence of healing. The Group I included 47 patients and the Group II, 18 patients. The improvement of Frankel grade and increase of mean cervical lordosis angles were not statistically different between two groups. Screw-plate system used did not influence the outcome. On follow up, solid bone fusion was evident and there were no cases of instability in both groups. Our study demonstrated that anterior cervical fixation on BID is safe and effective in comparison with combined antero-posterior cervical fixation. ","2215":"We report experiences and clinical outcomes of 61 cases with spinal canal meningiomas from January 1970 through January 2005. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled with follow-up duration of more than one year after surgery. There were 7 male and 31 female patients. The mean age was 52 years (range, 19 to 80 years). All patients underwent microsurgical resection using a posterior approach. Twenty-nine (79.4%) cases experienced clinical improvement after surgery. The extent of tumor resection at the first operation was Simpson Grade I in 10 patients, Grade II in 17, Grade III in 4, Grade IV in 6, and unknown in one. We did not experience recurrent cases with Simpson grade I, II, or III resection. There were 6 recurrent cases, consisting of 5 cases with an extent of Simpson grade IV and one with an unknown extent. The mean duration of recurrence was 100 months after surgery. Radiation therapy was administered as a surgical adjunct in four patients (10.5%). Two cases were recurrent lesions that could not be completely resected. The other two cases were malignant meningiomas. No immediate postoperative death occurred in the patient group. We experienced no recurrent cases of intraspinal meningiomas once gross total resection has been achieved, regardless of the control of the dural origin. Surgeons do not have to take the risk of causing complication to the control dural origin after achieving gross total resectioning of spinal canal meningioma. ","2216":"Thoracoscopic spinal surgery provides minimally invasive approaches for effective vertebral decompression and reconstruction of the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine, while surgery related morbidity can be significantly lowered. This study analyzes clinical results of thoracoscopic spinal surgery performed at our institute. Twenty consecutive patients underwent video-assisted thoracosopic surgery (VATS) to treat various thoracic and thoracolumbar pathologies from April 2000 to July 2006. The lesions consisted of spinal trauma (13 cases), thoracic disc herniation (4 cases), tuberculous spondylitis (1 case), post-operative thoracolumbar kyphosis (1 case) and thoracic tumor (1 case). The level of operation included upper thoracic lesions (3 cases), midthoracic lesions (6 cases) and thoracolumbar lesions (11 cases). We classified the procedure into three groups: stand-alone thoracoscopic discectomy (3 cases), thoracoscopic fusion (11 cases) and video assisted mini-thoracotomy (6 cases). Analysis on the Frankel performance scale in spinal trauma patients (13 cases), showed a total of 7 patients who had neurological impairment preoperatively : Grade D (2 cases), Grade C (2 cases), Grade B (1 case), and Grade A (2 cases). Four patients were neurologically improved postoperatively, two patients were improved from C to E, one improved from grade D to E and one improved from grade B to grade D. The preoperative Cobb's and kyphotic angle were measured in spinal trauma patients and were 18.9+\/-4.4 degrees and 18.8+\/-4.6 degrees , respectively. Postoperatively, the angles showed statistically significant improvement, 15.1+\/-3.7 degrees and 11.3+\/-2.4 degrees , respectively (P&lt;0.001). Although VATS requires a steep learning curve, it is an effective and minimally invasive procedure which provides biomechanical stability in terms of anterior column decompression and reconstruction for anterior load bearing, and preservation of intercostal muscles and diaphragm. ","2217":"Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GK SRS) has become an important treatment modality for vestibular schwannomas. We evaluated the tumor control rate, patterns of tumor volume change and preservation of hearing following low-dose radiation for vestibular schwannomas in a homogeneous cohort group in which the mean marginal dose was 12 Gy. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in this study. All enrolled patients were followed-up for at least 5 years and the radiation dose was 11-13 Gy. Regular MRI, audiometry and clinical evaluations were done and tumor volumes were obtained from MRI using the OSIRIS program. The tumor control rate was 97%. We were able to classify the patterns of change in tumor volume into three categories. Transient increases in tumor volume were detected in 29% of the patients and the maximum transient increase in tumor volume was identified at 6 to 30 months after GK SRS. The transient increases in tumor volume ranged from 121% to 188%. Hearing was preserved in 4 of the 12 patients who had serviceable hearing prior to treatment. There were no other complications associated with GK SRS. Low-dose GK SRS was an effective and safe mode of treatment for vestibular schwannomas in comparison to the previously used high-dose GK SRS. Transient increases in tumor volume can be identified during the follow-up period after low-dose GK SRS for vestibular schwannomas. Physicians should be aware that these increases are not always indicative of treatment failure and that close observation is required following treatments. Unfortunately, a satisfactory hearing preservation rate was not achieved by reducing the radiation dose. It is thought that hearing preservation is a more sophisticated problem and further research is required. ","2218":"Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms are fragile and known to have high risks for intraoperative premature rupture and a relatively high associated morbidity. To improve surgical outcomes of DACA aneurysms, we reviewed our surgical strategy and its results postoperatively. A total of 845 patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms were operated in our hospital from January 1991 to December 2005. Twenty-three of 845 patients had ruptured DACA aneurysms which were operated on according to our surgical strategy. Our surgical strategy was as follows; early surgery, appropriate releasing of CSF, appropriate surgical approach, using neuronavigating system, securing the bridging veins, using temporary clipping and\/or tentative clipping, meticulous manipulation of aneurysm, and using micro-Doppler flow probe. Twenty of 23 patients who had complete medical records were studied retrospectively. We observed the postoperative radiographic findings and checked Glasgow Outcome Scale score sixth months after the operation. Nineteen DACA aneurysms were clipped through a unilateral interhemispheric approach and one DACA aneurysm was clipped through a pterional approach. Postoperative radiographic findings revealed complete clipping of aneurysmal neck without stenosis or occlusion of parent arteries. In two patients, a residual neck of aneurysm was visualized. Seventeen patients showed good recovery, one patient resulted in moderate disability, while 2 patients died. With our surgical strategy it was possible to achieve acceptable surgical morbidity and mortality rates in patients with DACA aneurysms. Appropriate use of tentative clipping, temporary clipping and neuro-navigating systems can give great help for safe approach and clipping of DACA aneurysm. ","2219":"The purpose of this study was to review the characteristics of falcine meningioma retrospectively and to identify the parameters associated with tumor recurrence. The analysis included; age, sex, extent of resection, and radiologic and pathologic findings. Falcine meningiomas were classified by location as anterior, middle, or posterior as described for parasagittal meningiomas. Of the 795 meningioma patients treated between 1990 and 2004 at the authors' institution, 68 patients with meningiomas arising from the falx underwent craniotomies. There were 22 male and 46 female patients (1 : 2.1). Mean age was 55 years and ranged from 14 to 77 years. Locations of falcine meningioma were; the anterior third in 33 cases, middle in 20, and posterior in 15. Mean tumor volume was 42 cc and ranged from 4 to 140 cc. In 58 of the 68 patients tumors were totally removed. Additional surgery for recurrence was performed in 6 patients over 15 years. Of these 6 patients, only two patients underwent gross total tumor resection at first operation; the other four underwent subtotal tumor resection. Based on pathologic reports, the largest tumor subtype was transitional. There were four patients with a high grade tumor-three atypical and one anaplastic meningioma. Of the 68 patients, 59 achieved a good outcome (no neurological deficit or recurrence), six had temporary complications, two suffered new permanent postoperative deficits, and the remaining one died due to severe brain swelling despite postoperative intensive care. Extent of surgical resection was found to be significantly related to tumor recurrence. Falcine meningioma accounted for 8.5% of intracranial meningiomas and the transitional meningioma was the most common subtype of falcine meningioma. Gross total resection of tumor was the single most important predictor of an improved surgical outcome. ","2220":"Although a significant correction of local kyphosis has been reported previously, only a few studies have investigated whether this correction leads to an improved overall sagittal alignment. The study objective was to determine whether an improvement in the local kyphotic angle improves the overall sagittal alignment. We examined and compared the effects of thoracic and lumbar level kyphoplasty procedures on local versus overall sagittal alignment of the spine. Thirty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who showed poor response to conventional, palliative medical therapy underwent single-level kyphoplasty. The pertinent clinical data of these patients, from June 2006 to November 2006, were reviewed retrospectively. We measured preoperative and postoperative vertebral body heights, which were classified as anterior, middle, or posterior fractured vertebral body heights. Furthermore, the local and overall sagittal angles after polymethylmethacrylate deposition were measured. More height was gained at the thoracic level, and the middle vertebral height regained the most. A significant local kyphosis correction was observed at the fractured level, and the correction at larger spanning segments decreased with the distance from the fractured level. The inflatable balloon kyphoplasty procedure was the most effective in regaining the height of the thoracic fractured vertebra in the middle vertebral body. The kyphosis correction by kyphoplasty was mainly achieved in the fractured vertebral body. Sagittal angular correction decreased with an increase in the distance from the fractured vertebra. No significant improvement was observed in the overall sagittal alignment after kyphoplasty. Further studies in a larger population are required to clarify this issue. ","2221":"The current literature implies that the use of short-segment pedicle screw fixation for spinal fractures is dangerous and inappropriate because of its high failure rate, but favorable results have been reported. The purpose of this study is to report the short term results of thoracolumbar burst and compression fractures treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation. A retrospective review of all surgically managed thoracolumbar fractures during six years were performed. The 19 surgically managed patients were instrumented by the short-segment technique. Patients' charts, operation notes, preoperative and postoperative radiographs (sagittal index, sagittal plane kyphosis, anterior body compression, vertebral kyphosis, regional kyphosis), computed tomography scans, neurological findings (Frankel functional classification), and follow-up records up to 12-month follow-up were reviewed. No patients showed an increase in neurological deficit. A statistically significant difference existed between the patients preoperative, postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, sagittal plane kyphosis, anterior body compression, vertebral kyphosis and regional kyphosis. One screw pullout resulted in kyphotic angulation, one screw was misplaced and one patient suffered angulation of the proximal segment on follow-up, but these findings were not related to the radiographic findings. Significant bending of screws or hardware breakage were not encountered. Although long term follow-up evaluation needs to verified, the short term follow-up results suggest a favorable outcome for short-segment instrumentation. When applied to patients with isolated spinal fractures who were cooperative with 3-4 months of spinal bracing, short-segment pedicle screw fixation using the posterior approach seems to provide satisfactory result. ","2222":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in Youngdong district for 10 years. From Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2006, 732 patients (327 males, 405 females, mean age: 54.8+\/-13.1 years) with spontaneous SAH were admitted to our hospital. We reviewed the medical records and radiological findings regarding to the ictus of SAH, location and size of the ruptured aneurysms, Hunt-Hess grade and Fisher grade on admission, personal details such as address, age, and sex, and previous history of medical diseases. In these 732 patients, 672 cases were confirmed as aneurysmal SAH. Among them, 611 patients (262 males, 349 females, mean age: 54.9+\/-13.2 years) came from Youngdong district. The average crude annual incidence of aneurysmal SAH for men, women, and both sexes combined in Youngdong district was 7.8+\/-1.7, 10.5+\/-2.7, and 9.1+\/-2.1 per 100,000 population, respectively. Because of the problems related to the observation period and geographical confinement, it was suspected that the representative incidence of aneurysmal SAH in Youngdong district should be made during the later eight years in six coastal regions. Therefore, the average age-adjusted annual incidence for men, women, and both sexes combined was 8.8+\/-1.4, 11.2+\/-1.3 and 10.0+\/-1.0, respectively in the coastal regions of Youngdong district from 1999 to 2006. In overall, our results on the incidence of aneurysmal SAH was not very different from previous observations from other studies. ","2223":"This multi-center clinical study was designed to determine the long-term results of patients who received a one-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion with expandable cage (Tyche(R) cage) for degenerative spinal diseases during the same period in each hospital. Fifty-seven patients with low back pain who had a one-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion using a newly designed expandable cage were enrolled in this study at five centers from June 2003 to December 2004 and followed up for 24 months. Pain improvement was checked with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and their disability was evaluated with the Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographs were obtained before and after surgery. At the final follow-up, dynamic stability, quality of bone fusion, interveretebral disc height, and lumbar lordosis were assessed. In some cases, a lumbar computed tomography scan was also obtained. The mean VAS score of back pain was improved from 6.44 points preoperatively to 0.44 at the final visit and the score of sciatica was reduced from 4.84 to 0.26. Also, the Oswestry Disability Index was improved from 32.62 points preoperatively to 18.25 at the final visit. The fusion rate was 92.5%. Intervertebral disc height, recorded as 9.94+\/-2.69 mm before surgery was increased to 12.23+\/-3.31 mm at postoperative 1 month and was stabilized at 11.43+\/-2.23 mm on final visit. The segmental angle of lordosis was changed significantly from 3.54+\/-3.70 degrees before surgery to 6.37+\/-3.97 degrees by 24 months postoperative, and total lumbar lordosis was 20.37+\/-11.30 degrees preoperatively and 24.71+\/-11.70 degrees at 24 months postoperative. There have been no special complications regarding the expandable cage during the follow-up period and the results of this study demonstrates a high fusion rate and clinical success. ","2224":"Tubular retractor system as a minimally invasive surgery (MIS) technique has many advantages over other conventional MIS techniques. It offers direct visualization of the operative field, anatomical familiarity to spine surgeons, and minimizing tissue trauma. With technical advancement, many spinal pathologies are being treated using this system. Namely, herniated discs, lumbar and cervical stenosis, synovial cysts, lumbar instability, trauma, and even some intraspinal tumors have all been treated through tubular retractor system. Flexible arm and easy change of the tube direction are particularly useful in contralateral spinal decompression from an ipsilateral approach. Careful attention to surgical technique through narrow space will ensure that complications are minimized and will provide improved outcomes. However, understanding detailed anatomies and keeping precise surgical orientation are essential for this technique. Authors present the technical feasibility and initial results of use a tubular retractor system as a minimally invasive technique for variaties of spinal disorders with a review of literature."},"articletitle":{"0":"Long-Term Management of Seizures after Surgical Treatment of Supratentorial Cavernous Malformations : A Retrospective Single Centre Study.","1":"Psychological
