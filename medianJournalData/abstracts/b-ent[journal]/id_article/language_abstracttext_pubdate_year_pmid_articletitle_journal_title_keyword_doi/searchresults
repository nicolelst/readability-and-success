cavernous hemangioma of the maxillary sinus: a series of 3 cases. Sott-tissue hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that are common in the head and neck region and rare in the sinonasal tract. Those originating in the sinus mucosa are extremely rare. We report three cases of non-osseous (mucosal) cavernous hemangioma (CH) originating in the maxillary sinus and successfully managed endonasally and endoscopically. All patients were referred to the ENT outpatient department for a persistent unilateral pansinusitis that was resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics for one year. All patients complained of unilateral persistent nasal obstruction, and one presented with nosebleeds. The sinus CT scan revealed complete opacification of the maxillary sinus extending into the ethmoid sinus. MR images depicted a heterogeneous signal on both TI- and T2-weighted sequences. In one case, the tumor was highly vascularized and required a preoperative selective arterial embolization. Complete resection via an endonasal endoscopic medial maxillectomy was performed successfully in all cases without severe intraoperative bleeding. The pathologist confirmed the diagnosis of CH. CH is rare in the sinonasal tract but must be considered in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant sinonasal tumors in adults. An endonasal endoscopic medial maxillectomy enabled complete tumor removal with optimal control of its extensions and vascular supply. This approach is associated with less morbidity than an open approach. When nosebleeds are present, injection of a contrast agent and a preoperative arterial embolization are recommended. ","2":"Endoscopic endonasal removal of median palatine cyst. A 49-year-old man presented with a median palatine cyst, as an incidental finding in a work-up of vision disturbance, due to a cyst in the sphenoid sinus. The median palatine cyst was removed with a diode laser in the contact mode under endoscopic vision; forceps were used to remove the sphenoid sinus cyst. Follow-up over 6 months showed authentic absence of left eye vision impairment, no signs of recurrence of the median palatine cyst, and no acute inflammation in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinus area. A median palatine cyst is mostly asymptomatic and painless at palpation. However, its structure, with chronic inflammation and detritus, can be regarded as a focus of chronic infection. Surgery is the only effective method of treatment, and relapse after surgery is rare. ","3":"Stridor caused by.a blue laryngeal mass in an infant: case report. We describe an infant who had inspiratory stridor that began a few weeks after birth. Flexible upper airway endoscopy while the infant was awake showed a large blue mass at the posterior glottis, above the esophageal inlet. The lesion was only visible upon crying or coughing; it was undetectable when we examined the infant in the supine position during spontaneous breathing and did not respond to systemic treatment with propranolol. Based upon these typical features, we established a diagnosis of pressure- dependent postcricoid mass.","4":"Plunging ranula with prestyloid parapharyngeal space, masticator space, and parotid gland extension. Ranulas develop from mucous extravasation secondary to sublingual gland duct obstruction or trauma. Plunging ranula usually dive into the submandibular space. This is the first reported case of a plunging ranula with direct extension to the prestyloid parapharyngeal space, masticator space, and parotid gland with avoidance of the submandibular space. The patient presented with a tender parotid mass, of which the differential is broad, including parotitis, parotid malignancy, metastatic malignancy, lymphoma, as well as other infectious etiologies. When an intraoral component is not identified, other differential considerations would be thyroglossal duct cyst, branchial cleft cyst, parathyroid cyst, cervical thymic cyst, dermoid cyst, cystic hygroma, or benign teratoma. The case is unique due to ranula extension into multiple spaces. For optimal treatment, the sublingual gland along with its tract and contents needs to completely removed. ","5":"Unexpected overnight stay following ENT day-case surgery: a 5-year audit. Recent decades have seen a steady reduction in the average duration of hospitalization for all surgical patients, including those undergoing ENT procedures. Correspondingly, the proportion of day surgeries relative to in-patient surgeries has progressively increased. In the present observational study, we aimed to evaluate the proportion of unplanned overnight stays following planned day surgeries in our ENT unit, and the major causes of these unexpected overnight admissions. From databases, we collected data from all patients who underwent ENT day-case surgery in Ziekenhuis Oost- Limburg between January 2008 and December 2013. A total of 10,440 patients underwent ENT day-case surgery during this period. The overall rate of unexpected overnight admission was 1.86%, with these overnight admissions most commonly due to anaesthetic (46.91%), surgical (19.59%), and organizational (17.01%) reasons. The types of ENT surgery at the greatest risk for prolonged hospitalisation were hemithyroidectomy (12.50%), tympanoplasty (12.15%), and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) (7.81%). We further identified a clear difference in the rate of unexpected overnight stay between surgery scheduled in the morning (1.17%) versus in the afternoon (12.98%). Our present findings highlight the various reasons for unexpected overnight admission after day-case surgery. To reduce the rate of unexpected overnight stays, we need to better understand these different reasons to support the ongoing search for possible solutions. ","6":"Bipolar diathermy-assisted coblation really affects post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate and white membrane in paediatric tonsillectomy. this study aimed to evaluate the effect of bipolar diathermy-assisted coblation on post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage (PTH) rate, operation time, the volume of blood loss during surgery, the time needed to return to a regular diet and the relationship between the thickness of the white membrane of tonsil fossa and the degree of postoperative pain in paediatric tonsillectomy. a total of 1684 patients subjected to tonsillectomy (TE) were enrolled in this study from June 2013 to December 2015. They were randomly divided into a coblation tonsillectomy (control) group and a bipolar diathermy- assisted coblation tonsillectomy (intervention) group. The surgeon reported data concerning the techniques, primary and second PTH, surgery time, the volume of blood loss during surgery, the time needed to return to a regular diet, the thickness of the white membrane of tonsil fossa and the degree of postoperative pain. complete data concerning the technique employed for tonsillectomy as applied in all patients: early and late PTH, surgery time, volume of blood loss during surgery, time needed to resume a regular diet, white membrane thickness of tonsil fossa and postoperative pain degree were collected in the Otorhinolaryngology Department of the First Hospital in Qinhuangdao of China. In the control group, the primary and secondary PTH values were 2.6% and 5.8%, whereas in the intervention group, these values were 0.35% and 1.8%, respectively. The primary PTH rate in the control group was 7.43 times higher than that in the intervention group; the secondary PTH rate in the control group was 3.22 times higher than that in the intervention group (p &lt;0.05). We found that the thickness of the white membrane of the homeostasis area of tonsillar fossa in the intervention group was thinner than that of the control group. The intraoperative blood loss in the control group and intervention group was 3.3 ? 1.6 mL and 2.1 ? 2.9 mL, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Surgery times in the control and intervention group was 17.4 ? 5.1 min and 16.3 ? 4.8 min, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The period required for resuming a regular diet in the control and intervention group was 5.4 ? 3.4 and 5.1 ? 6.2 days, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). bipolar diathermy-assisted coblation can reduce post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage (PTH) rate, operation time, the volume of blood loss during surgery and the white membrane thickness of tonsillar fossa. The thickness of the white membrane of tonsil fossa is positively correlated with postoperative pain degree. The time needed to resume a regular diet showed no significant differences between the two groups. ","7":"Residual cholesteatoma revealed by endoscopy after microsurgery. To endoscopically examine common sites of residual cholesteatoma occurrence after microscopic ear surgery. Thirty patients (15 men and 15 women; age range: 7-81 years) who underwent treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma (20 patients with pars flaccida :holesteatoma and 10 patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma) were selected. Following the removal of the cholesteatoma matrix via microscopy, residual matrix presence was assessed using an endoscope system. Additional resection was performed if the residual matrix was detected. Sites of residual matrix and their rates of incidence were then investigated. Residual matrix was observed in nine out of the 30 (30%) patients by endoscopy after microscopic surgery. Residual matrix was observed in eight out of the 20 (40%) patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma and in one out of :he 10 (10%) patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma. Residual matrix was observed in six out of the 14 (43%) patients who underwent canal wall up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy and in three out of the 13 (23%) patients who underwent -anal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy. Sites of residual matrix included the tegmen tympani in two patients, he medial scutal surface in three patients, the tympanic sinus in two patients and the anterior epitympanic recess in three patients. The risk of residual matrix was greater in patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma than in those with pars tensa :holesteatoma. The attic, tympanic sinus and anterior epitympanic recess are common sites of residual cholesteatoma. Endoscopy is advantageous for the assessment of residual cholesteatoma in hidden areas. ","8":"The role of cVEMPs and vHIT in the evaluation of otosclerosis and its eventual vestibular impairment: preliminary findings. Otosclerosis is one of the most common causes of hearing loss in adults, with a prevalence of 0.3% to 0.4% in Caucasians. Vestibular symptoms may occur, with an incidence ranging between 5% and 57% of patients. The aim of our study is to evaluate the vestibular function and its eventual changes after stapes surgery in patients affected by otosclerosis. Prospective case-control study. Twenty patients (17 females; age range 33-58; mean age 44) who underwent surgery for otosclerotic disease between April 2012 and February 2014 were prospectively studied. These patients underwent preoperative and postoperative audiological tests. Furthermore, vestibular function was evaluated using the cervical evoked myogenic potentials test (cVEMPs) and video head impulse test (vHIT), preoperatively and postoperatively. A case-control study was also performed. Quantitative and statistical analysis of patients' vestibular function was carried out both before and after stapes surgery. The means of the vHIT gains in the case group were 1.03 on the right side and 1.01 on the left side. A significant difference between case and control groups was seen, with a lower left gain registered in the control group. No cases with a gain of less than 0.8 were found in either group. Moreover, a significant postoperative reduction in P1\/NI amplitude was seen in patients complaining of postoperative dizziness or vertigo. These findings indicate a probable traumatic saccular impairment in patients with vestibular symptoms. However, a longer follow-up may help in understanding the behaviour of cVEMPs in post-stapes surgery vertigo. ","9":"Felix tympanoplasty: functional results of a single surgeon's technique in the scope of a literature review on influencing factors. The outcome of myringoplasties may be affected by local, general or epidemiologic factors. We reduced the variability of the surgical procedure to a minimum, in order to better evaluate the role of these factors on the functional results. To accomplish this, a single surgical procedure performed by a single surgeon was analysed in this retrospective study. The analysis was performed on a cohort study of patients who underwent the Felix tympanoplasty as their only operation. Thirty-nine patients were included in the study from January 2001 to January 2011. Postoperative changes from preoperative levels of air-bone gaps were compared according to patient characteristics using linear regression models. We evaluated the following conditions: sex, age, rural or urban living, smoking, alcohol consumption, frequent infantile otitis, frequent adult recurrent otalgia, frequent adult recurrent otorrhoea, contralateral chronic otitis, tympanic membrane perforation size, tympanosclerosis, otorrhoea and inflammatory tympanic membrane at the time of the operation. Evidence of a larger air-bone gap reduction was detected for patients with a history of frequent otorrhoea and with a perforation size &gt;50% of the area of the tympanic membrane. In contrast, there was evidence of a lower air-bone gap reduction detected for patients with tympanosclerosis. The impact on hearing of all other variables did not reach statistical significance. Conlusion: Patients with a history of frequent ear discharge and those with large tympanic membrane perforations had better chances of obtaining greater improvement to their hearing postoperatively. The presence of preoperative tympanosclerosis decreased the mean change from preoperative to postoperative air-bone gaps. ","10":"Transnasal endoscopic management of anterior cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak: experience from a large case series. Anterior cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a consequence described after head trauma, skull base surgery or inflammatory diseases, but may also occur spontaneously. Prompt recognition and management is crucial in order to avoid complications and to achieve successful surgical repair. The purpose of this study is to present the clinical features of a large group of patients with anterior CSF leak and the results of their surgical management. The study approach was a retrospective review of 110 consecutive patients treated by the same surgeon for CSF leak of the anterior skull base via a transnasal endoscopic approach between 2003 and 2013. Patients with anterior skull base surgery due to cancer or pituitary adenoma were excluded from this study. The diagnostic workup included nasal endoscopy, beta2-transferrin and -trace protein assay in the rhinoliquorrhoea and radiological imaging. The intrathecal fluorescein test was performed in selected cases. The surgical techniques used to repair dural defects were primarily middle turbinate placement and fascia lata grafting. Primary endoscopic repair of the CSF fistula was successful in 106\/110 (96.4%) patients. Four patients (3.6%) required a revision procedure due to early failure of the repair. After a minimum follow-up of 24 months, no recurrent CSF leaks were observed in the study group. None of the patients developed meningitis as a surgical complication. The endoscopic transnasal approach is a reliable technique for treating CSF leaks. The intrathecal fluorescein test is safe and helpful in locating the defect. The fascia lata proved the best graft available in our experience. ","11":"Effects of Smoking on healthy oral mucosa: a red-green-blue (photgraphic) evaluation. The aim of this study was to compare normal looking oral mucosa of smokers and non-smokers by means of a photographic technique. Tertiary referral centre Material and methods: There were 78 patients included in the study (age range: 20-60 years), all of whom had normal looking oral mucosa and had been smoking for at least five years. The control group of non-smoking volunteers was age- and gender-matched. Anyone who had reflux, chronic tonsillitis, and pharyngitis or acute upper airway infection was excluded from the study. The oropharyngeal mucosa was examined and photographed endoscopically. Seventeen different oropharyngeal points were chosen and standardized, and the red-green-blue (RGB) values of those specific points were measured. 156 subjects were enrolled in the study: the control group (19 females, 59 males; mean age 41.5 years) and the smoking group (21 females, 57 males; mean age 38.7 years). A statistically significant difference arose between the RGB values of the smoking and control groups (p &lt; 0.05), but not for gender and age (p &gt; 0.05). The study revealed that the normal oral mucosae of the smokers were clearly darker than the non-smokers'. This finding is significant because dark mucosa is thought to be the precursor to any premalignant lesions. ","12":null,"13":"Middle turbinate primary mucocele in a child masquerading as a nasal tumour. Nasal obstruction in children is a very common complaint in daily ENT consultations. The common cold, rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, hypertrophy and inflammation of the adenoid pad are very common causes of nasal obstruction, but there are numerous other causes for which the clinician must be aware. The authors report a very unusual case of a primary mucocele of the middle turbinate of a 7-year-old girl masquerading as a nasal tumour. The mucocele was successfully marsupialized surgically using an endonasal endoscopic approach. The authors report the case, imaging, and review the pertinent literature. Clinicians must be aware of less common aetiologies of nasal obstruction in order to orientate the diagnostic work-up and to propose adequate management. ","14":"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the nasal septum. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a tumour of vascular origin and unknown aetiology, which occurs in all age groups. The most common locations are the liver, bone, lungs, and brain, with less common occurrence in head and neck regions, and no prior reports of origination from nasal septum. Here we report a case of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the nasal septum. A 62-year-old male patient attended our clinic with epistaxis and congestion in his left nasal cavity. Endoscopic examination revealed a mass within the left nasal passage. Clinical and histopathological examinations showed that the mass was a septum-originated epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. The mass was removed endoscopically using a transnasal approach. No recurrence was observed over 36 months of follow-up. Here we discussed this uncommon case along with a literature review. ","15":"Nasoseptal cyst after septorhinoplasty: late and unusual but preventable complication. Formation if a slowly growing cyst following septorhinoplasty is a rare but serious complication. Mucous cyst is more common than foreign body inclusion cyst. Typically, these cysts present as a solitary lesion that develops in the subcutaneous pace over the nasal bone along the line of nasal osteotomy several months or years after initial surgery. Rarely, the cyst onnects with the nasal septum. Surgery is the treatment of choice and consists of either complete excision of the cyst apsule or marsupialization of the cyst. ase report: A nasoseptal mucous cyst developed in a 46-year-old woman 10 years after septorhinoplasty. We successfully narsupialized the cyst with an endonasal endoscopic approach. onclusion:. Cysts can be removed by either complete resection of the cyst capsule or marsupialization via endonasal endoscopy. To prevent cyst formation, initial surgery must be conducted nontraumatically and tissue remnants cleared to prevent dispersion into subcutaneous spaces. ","16":"Anterior Inferior cerebellar artery infarction misdiagnosed as inner ear disease. The clinical &gt;resentation of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction may mimic that of inner ear disease. lethodology: This report presents two patients with cerebellar artery infarction initially misdiagnosed with inner ear lisease. ase Report: Both the patients presented with sudden hearing loss and vertigo. The patient in case 1 was initially liagnosed with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The patient in case 2 presented with 17 days of vertigo and iearing loss. Both were correctly diagnosed with AICA infarction after performing magnetic resonance imaging. esults and Conclusions: We differentiated AICA from inner ear disease based on the variability in degree and frequency ange of hearing loss, the duration of vertigo, and the manifestation of nystagmus. Because cases of AICA infarction and nner ear disease may present with si'milar symptoms, a detailed examination including clinical course assessments, aboratory findings, and neurological imaging is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. ","17":"The injectable filler in rhinoplasty: not a complication-free alternative. Non-surgical or \"filler\" rhinoplasty seems an attractive tool to fine-tune the aesthetic results of surgery; its use as a primary technique is also increasingly popular. However, physicians performing these procedures should be aware that they are not complication-free. In two case studies we now describe potential foreign body reactions, resulting in granulomas, to first generation silicone oil fillers, and second generation injectable hyaluronic acid fillers. Foreign body reactions are especially prevalent against permanent fillers, particularly silicone, and ideally these should be abandoned. Given that granulomas can also be provoked by temporary and semi-permanent fillers, we would advise restraint in their use, with appropriate vigilance to ensure the early recognition of complications. The increasing popularity of filler rhinoplasty will likely provoke a higher incidence of complications in the future. Intralesional steroid injections can be attempted as a treatment, although surgical resection of these \"granulomas\" may ultimately be required. ","18":"Subannular T-tubes for the treatment of adhesive otitis: how we do it. Adhesive otitis is a chronic otitis media (OM) that consists of the adhesion of the tympanic membrane (TM) to the promontory. The aim of our study is to evaluate a new way of positioning subannular T-tubes (SATs) in patients affected by adhesive otitis. This study enrolled 22 patients (average age: 36.7 yo, 2.5 SD; M\/F ratio: 14\/8) affected by unilateral chronic adhesive otitis. All of the patients underwent the positioning of a SAT and a Silastic@ sheet in the tympanic cavity. The clinical course was evaluated, considering otoscopic and audiological variations. In our series, only one case of extrusion of tubes with residual perforation of TM was recorded. Auditory outcomes were satisfying in 18\/22 patients (81.8%). The proposed addition of a Silastic disk seems to avoid a new adhesion of the tympanic membrane to the promontory and, therefore, prevents treatment failures. A longer follow-up and a larger case series are needed to prove the efficacy of this surgical variation. Finally, the positioning of SATs can be considered as a valid and safe procedure for the treatment of adhesive otitis. ","19":"Laser-assisted tympanomastoidectomy for active mucosal chronic otitis media. Achieving disease control in the context of active granulating mucosal chronic otitis media (COM) is typically challenging. Adjuvant laser use in cholesteatomatous COM surgery enhances disease clearance, yet its role in mucosal COM remains unexplored. The purpose of this study is to present the outcomes and our experience of the latter, and to attempt to define the role of this approach in managing mucosal COM. Patients that underwent primary laser-assisted tympanomastoidectomy (2007-2012) for active granulating mucosal COM with at least six months follow-up were studied. Disease control was defined by successful tympanic membrane repair and resolution of otorrhoea. Time-to-event analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was used to gain a temporal estimate of disease control. Seventy ears (66 patients) were included with mean follow-up of 22 months (6-50 months). Disease control was achieved in 94.3% of cases at latest follow-up, while one- and two-year temporal estimates of control were 97.1% and 91.8% respectively. A mean post-operative four-frequency air-bone gap of 20 dB was achieved in 52 cases (74.3%). Surgical complications included transient vertigo (n = 2), wound infection (n = 2), and temporary facial nerve palsy (n = 1). We present disease control rates favourable to other published series of active mucosal COM, supporting the use of the laser as an efficacious adjunct to tympanomastoid surgery in this context. This initial report should foster further appraisal of this approach in larger prospective studies.

Autofluorescence is a highly sensitive, and specific, complementary diagnostic tool for the photodiagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Together with ease of use, these properties suggest that autofluorescence, used alongside white light endoscopy, could be a promising tool for the screening of high-risk populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting tumours involving the upper aerodigestive tract, in comparison with histopathologic examination. A cross-sectional prospective study was carried out from June 2011 till March 2012. Forty-five patients with clinical evidence of suspicious lesions involving the upper aerodigestive tract were enrolled and examined using conventional white light, and autofluorescence endoscopy. A biopsy of each lesion was subsequently submitted for histopathologic examination. Using histology as our gold standard, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of autofluorescence endoscopy in detecting upper aerodigestive tract tumours. In comparison to histopathologic examination, the sensitivity of autofluorescence endoscopy was 95%, with a specificity of 74% (P value&lt;0.001). The positive and negative predictive values were 78%, and 94% respectively. These data confirm a statistically significant correlation between autofluorescence and histopathologic diagnoses. Autofluorescence endoscopy was effective in detecting upper aerodigestive tract tumours, with excellent discrimination between benign and malignant phenotypes; this methodology is an ideal adjunct to white light endoscopy. ","22":"Topographic relationship; sinusitis and paranasal sinus computed tomography. The association between the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and computed tomography (CT) findings is controversial, especially the topography of the symptoms and CT findings. To determine the relationship between topographic and overall paranasal CT findings with topographic and overall symptoms. This was a two-center study comprising 166 patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. All patients underwent CT scans and completed a questionnaire. The symptom scores and CT findings were compared. A correlation between anterior ethmoid sinusitis and hyposmia was found. Blockage of the osteomeatal complex and posterior ethmoid sinusitis was associated with halitosis. There were also correlations between maxillary and sphenoid sinusitis and tooth pain. The total visual scale score was not associated with any of the symptoms. No association was seen between facial pain or facial pressure and paranasal sinus CT scores. No correlation was found between the topographic correlation of sinus pain and topographic paranasal sinus CT findings. No relationship exists between symptoms and paranasal sinus CT findings in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. ","23":"In the era of endoscopic sinus surgery, is there still a place for the Caldwell-Luc procedure? In this report, we present evidence in favor of the Caldwell-Luc approach to the maxillary antrum in selected cases where endoscopic techniques are inadequate to allow full resolution of the problem. Although this procedure is not as popular as it was in the past, its role in the management of benign paranasal sinus diseases is still important. We focus in particular on use of the Caldwell-Luc procedure for conditions such as fungal mycetoma, foreign body removal, empyema, and benign nasal tumours in areas that are not fully accessible by endoscopy alone. Advantages of this technique are its safety and simplicity; no special instrumentation is necessary. It can be performed with surgical equipment widely available in operating rooms in Greece and elsewhere.","24":"Is blood type really a riskfactorfor epistaxis? To determine the association between ABO blood type and epistaxis. This retrospective study involved 359 patients with idiopathic epistaxis. Patients with risk factors for bleeding, including anticoagulant use, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, liver diseases, elevated bleeding time, low coagulation factor levels, or any benign\/malignant tumor, were excluded from the study. Thus, only patients with idiopathic epistaxis were included in this study. For the control group, blood-type information was retrieved from the database of the Turkish Red Crescent, the largest blood bank in Turkey. The distributions of blood types A, B, AB, and 0 were compared between the epistaxis and control groups. The distribution of blood types A and AB did not significantly differ between the epistaxis and control groups (P&gt;0.05). Blood type B occurred significantly less frequently (P&lt;0.05) and blood type 0 occurred significantly more frequently (P&lt;0.001) in the epistaxis group than in the control group. Our study indicates that in the Turkish population, the 0 blood type is over-represented in patients with idiopathic epistaxis versus the general population. We conclude that blood type 0 is a risk factor for idiopathic epistaxis in the Turkish population. ","25":"Draf III frontal sinusotomy: influence of patient characteristics on outcome. To identify positive and negative predictive outcome factors for the Draf III procedure based on the experience of a single center. Seventy-two patients who underwent a Draf III procedure between 2005 and 2011 at the ENT department of University Hospitals Leuven were included. Patient demographics, history of frontal sinus surgery, clinical features, and computed tomographic evaluations were reviewed and analyzed for associations with symptom control and endoscopic outcome. The mean age was 48 years (16-82 years), and the male-to-female-ratio was 2:1. Major indications were chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without nasal polyps) and mucoceles. Supplementary frontal (recess) cells were found in the majority of patients. Osteoneogenesis was present in one out of four patients. At the end of follow-up (mean 35 months), the neo-ostium patency rate was 89%. Stenosis or closure of the neo-ostium was seen in 11% of patients, and 15% of patients required revision surgery. Subjective improvement was reported by 88%. The results of Draf III frontal sinusotomy were positive in the long term. Previous frontal sinus surgery, the presence of allergy or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), asthma, smoking, and variants in frontal recess anatomy did not affect outcome. Osteoneogenesis and chronic mucosal inflammation could be controlled by creating a large drainage pathway. ","26":"This case study describes three newborns referred to our otolaryngologic service for investigating and treating a cystic dilatation of the lacrimal duct. These dilatations corresponded to unilateral or bilateral dacryocystoceles, with or without complications. The first newborn exhibited respiratory distress at birth and received early surgery and endoscopic marsupialization of intranasal and bilateral cysts. The second newborn did not show any signs of complications, and after conservative treatment for a week, the cyst spontaneously resolved. The third newborn was diagnosed in utero with ultrasonography, and the cyst resolved spontaneously during childbirth. These cases provided an opportunity to review the pathophysiology of this rare congenital lacrimal anomaly and to note responses to different therapeutic approaches. Indeed, these three cases illustrated three different management approaches, and allowed us to address the issue of prenatal diagnosis.","27":"Here we describe the clinical and histopathological characteristics of a nine-year-old girl with an intraorbital mass of the left orbit, and review the relevant literature. Imaging data and surgical biopsy revealed an intraconal cystic lesion in the medial-inferior quadrant of the left orbit. The cyst was lined with ciliated pseudostratified epithelium, consistent with a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Cyst marsupialisation and partial mass removal alleviated symptoms, and no cyst recurrence was observed during follow-up. The literature suggests that this is an uncommon cause of a cystic orbital mass. Respiratory epithelial cysts of the orbit should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intraorbital masses. Surgical excision of such a lesion should be limited to avoid damaging orbital structures. Respiratory epithelial cysts of the orbit generally follow a benign course, and recurrence of ocular symptoms is rare. ","28":"Giant cell reparative granuloma of the facial skeleton is a rare presentation of hyperparathyroidism. A 17-year-old girl presented with progressive expansile bony growths of the mandible and maxilla. The case was investigated using biopsies, blood tests, imaging, and surgery. Biopsies confirmed giant cell reparative granuloma. Blood testing revealed very high parathyroid hormone levels, and brown tumours due to primary hyperparathyroidism weresuspected. Surgical removal of an ectopic adenoma led to correction of the endocrine condition. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of multiple brown tumours of the facial skeleton due to an ectopic parathyroid adenoma. Diagnostic pitfalls and therapeutic challenges are described.

We present a patient whose nasopharyngeal cyst contained a malignant lymphoma, and we review previous reports of this condition. Case report with a relevant literature review. Sixteen case reports of nasopharyngeal branchial cleft cysts in 24 patients were included. The average age was 36 years; most cysts were on one side. Five patients underwent aspiration, 18 underwent surgery. The cyst wall was lined by stratified squamous epithelium in seven patients and by ciliated colomunar epithelium in 14. All previous cysts showed benign pathology. Our case is the first report of a malignant disease hidden in a nasopharyngeal branchial cleft cyst. To our knowledge, malignant lymphoma in a nasopharyngeal branchial cleft cyst has not been reported previously. Nevertheless, the possibility of this finding should be kept in mind when evaluating patients with nasopharyngeal cystic lesions. ","30":"Somatic tinnitus originates from increased activity of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, a cross-point between the somatic and auditory systems. Its activity can be modified by auditory stimulation or somatic system manipulation. Thus, sound enrichment and white noise stimulation might decrease tinnitus and associated somatic symptoms. The present uncontrolled study sought to determine somatic tinnitus prevalence among tinnitus sufferers, and to investigate whether sound therapy with counselling (tinnitus retraining therapy; TRT) may decrease tinnitus-associated somatic symptoms. To determine somatic tinnitus prevalence, 70 patients following the TRT protocol completed the Jastreboff Structured Interview (JSI) with additional questions regarding the presence and type of somatic symptoms. Among 21 somatic tinnitus patients, we further investigated the effects of TRT on tinnitus-associated facial dysesthesia. Before and after three months of TRT, tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), and facial dysesthesia was assessed with an extended JSI-based questionnaire. Among the evaluated tinnitus patients, 56% presented somatic tinnitus-including 51% with facial dysesthesia, 36% who could modulate tinnitus by head and neck movements, and 13% with both conditions. Self-evaluation indicated that TRT significantly improved tinnitus and facial dysesthesia in 76% of patients. Three months of TRT led to a 50% decrease in mean THI and JSI scores regarding facial dysesthesia. Somatic tinnitus is a frequent and underestimated condition. We suggest an extension of the JSI, including specific questions regarding somatic tinnitus. TRT significantly improved tinnitus and accompanying facial dysesthesia, and could be a useful somatic tinnitus treatment.

We discuss the clinical details of lipoblastomatosis in the retropharyngeal space of a 9-year-old boy,with an emphasis on the head-neck area, the histopathological maturity of the tumor, and the practical roles of imaging, cytogenetics, and immunostaining in the diagnosis. Clinical record analysis; literature review. A malnourished child presented with worsening respiratory distress and feeding difficulties. Imaging suggested a large, heterogeneous fibrofatty lesion in the retropharyngeal space. Surgery revealed an otherwise encapsulated mass that densely adhered to the pre-vertebral soft tissue. The findings were consistent with a diagnosis of maturing lipoblastomatosis on histopathology, which was supported by additional immunohistochemistry panel analysis. This is the first report of lipoblastomatosis with the retropharyngeal space as the epicenter of involvement\/ origin. Although rare and seldom diagnosed before surgery, lipoblastoma(tosis) may be more common in the head-neck area than thought previously and should be an important differential diagnosis for pediatric fibrolipomatous neoplasms in this anatomic subsite.

In this study, 16 patients with locally advanced and\/or non-resectable squamous cell carcinoma underwent induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouricil or paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab. Over 80% of patients responded to induction chemotherapy. Histological examination of the 14 surgical specimens showed a total absence of residual cancer cells in 37.5% of cases. Concurrent radiation and chemotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, induction chemotherapy may be beneficial in select patients. ","35":"A congenital dacryocystocele with an intranasal cyst is an uncommon lesion that is usually treated by ophthalmologists, although sometimes an otorhinolaryngologist is consulted first because of nasal obstruction. The nasal cavity is narrow in newborns and can easily be obstructed, even by small lesions. Prolapse or expansion of the cyst into the nose may lead to respiratory distress and difficulty in feeding, since newborns are obligate nose breathers. Here we report a case of bilatera dacryocystocele with intranasal extension in a 3-day-old female infant. The infant presented with respiratory distress and episodic desaturation and was managed successfully by bilateral endoscopic marsupialization of the intranasal cysts. This case report discusses the diagnosis and management and reviews the relevant literature. These finding suggest tha congenital dacryocystocele with an intranasal cyst must be considered in the differential diagnosis of newborns suffering from nasal respiratory difficulty.","36":"is to evaluate the sinonasal symptom scores and mucociliary clearance (MCC) after starting to use electronic cigarette METHODOLGY: This prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial was conducted between March 2013 and November 2013. Patients (n=98) admitted to smoking cessation clinic were divided into two groups; Electronic cigarette smokers (group 1) and non-electronic cigarette smokers (group 2). SNOT-22 and saccharin transit time for MCC were evaluated before starting electronic cigarettes and after the third months. SNOT-22 scores and MCC time were evaluated between groups and within groups after 3 months. SNOT 22 scores and MCC measurements showed no difference between groups before the cessation of cigarette smoking (p &gt;0.05). SNOT 22 results of both groups revealed statistically significantly lower scores after the three months (p &lt; 0.05). However, SNOT-22 scores of group 2 was significantly better than group 1 (p &gt; 0.05). Comparison of MCC results of group 2 revealed statistically significantly lower scores after the three months (p &lt; 0.05). However, group 1 did not show any significant difference after three months (p &gt; 0.05). There was a significant difference between the groups at the third month measurements (p &lt; 0.05). Although EC is widely used as a method of quitting smoking, it has negative effects on the sinonasal symptoms and MCC.

The osteoma was removed by an endoscopic endonasal approach with a curved diamond drill and an electromagnetic navigation system. Computed tomography 3 days after surgery showed complete removal of the osteoma and normal position of the right eyeball. No long-term follow-up results were available. This clinical case highlights the use of the endoscopic endonasal approach for the safe and reliable treatment of sinus osteomas, particularly large osteomas. We also describe various manifestations of osteoma, its diagnosis, and surgical management. ","40":"Congenital laryngeal cysts are a rare, but potentially fatal, cause of airway obstruction in infants and children. Most laryngeal cysts are acquired. Here, we describe a congenital laryngeal cyst, its treatment, and its presentation immediately after birth. A newborn child developed stridor very shortly after birth, due to a large, congenital saccular cyst. The diagnosis was based on a laryngoscopy and imaging studies, which detected an extralaryngeal extension through the cricothyroid membrane. The cyst was removed with an endoscopic procedure and a CO2-laser. Afterwards, the cyst recurred, but was successfully removed with an external approach. Clinical manifestations of laryngeal cysts in neonates shortly after birth are rare. Here, we present an interesting clinical case. We also concisely reviewed the literature on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, classification, and therapy for laryngeal cysts. ","41":"Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for diagnosing a vestibular schwannoma (VS). The prevalence of VS ranges from 0.02-2.4%; the incidence is 20 per million per year. This case report describes two cases of VS identified on brain MRIs that were not related to the purpose of the MRI examination. A literature search was performed to find existing audiometric-based protocols for guiding MRI referrals. Asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss appeared to be the most important indication for excluding VS. However, no consensus was found on the significance of asymmetry or on the severity required to exclude VS. In light of the current absence of a reliable audiometric-based protocol for MRI referral, it seems reasonable to refer every patient with audiovestibular symptoms for a brain MRI, despite the view that the low number of incidental findings may not justify the additional cost.","42":"To evaluate the incidence of children with congenital CMV (cCMV) infection in a hearing rehabilitation center. This was a retrospective review of 309 children followed in a rehabilitation center for mild to total sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Seventy-five children had dried blood spots that we retrieved and retrospectively analyzed for the presence of CMV DNA by real time PCR. The children were born in Belgium after January 1996. The etiology of the SNHL was investigated for each child. The CMV DNA was detected in the dried blood spots for 8 of the 75 children tested (10.6%) by real time PCR. In three children, an alternative etiology of SNHL was suspected before the cCMV infection was diagnosed. The incidence of children infected with cCMV in a hearing rehabilitation center is high (10.6%). The detection of CMV DNA in dried blood spots is useful and improves the etiological diagnosis of SNHL. ","43":"PROBLEM\/OBJECTIVES: Maxillary constriction and high palatal arch are associated with increased risk of chronic eustachian tube dysfunction and conductive hearing loss (CHL) due to chronic effusion. However, this relationship has not been clearly demonstrated. This study assessed CHL in school children with a narrowed maxilla and deep palatal vault. Thirty-two children with maxillary constriction were randomly selected for the study group and 28 children with normal transverse maxillary development were selected for the control group. Pure-tone audiograms were obtained for all children, and hearing levels and air-bone gaps were measured. Air-bone gap measurements in the control group ranged from 5.50 to 14.50 decibels (dB), and in the study group they were between 5.00 and 24.00 dB. In the study group, 14 (43.8%) children had slight CHL, and the remaining 18 (56.2%) children had normal hearing levels. In the control group, all of the children had normal hearing levels. Hearing levels and air-bone gaps were greater in the study group than the control group. This study showed that children with a narrowed maxilla and deep palatal vault may have slight CHL. Therefore, the onset of CHL should be followed with hearing screening programs. ","44":"Chronic otitis media (COM) describes a variety of symptoms and physical findings that result from prolonged damage to the middle ear by infection and inflammation. The Health-Related Quality of Life measure for COM (COMQ-12) is a new questionnaire for the assessment of COM that evaluates the overall burden of disease from the patient's perspective. The aim of this study was to develop and appraise the psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the COMQ-12. The Dutch version of the COMQ-12 was obtained through translation and back-translation. Fifty adult patients with a history of active COM completed the Dutch version of the COMQ-12. The internal consistency of this questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The average COMQ-12 score was 22.4 (SD 11.9). The internal consistency of the Dutch version of the COMQ-12 was high, with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.833. The Dutch version of the COMQ-12 provides appropriate health-related quality of life outcome measures in patients with a history of COM. This questionnaire is a useful tool to evaluate the overall burden of disease from the patient's perspective. ","45":"Head and neck inflammatory pseudotumors (IPs) are rare, idiopathic, non-neoplastic lesions that most commonly affect the orbit, but may involve other areas such as the larynx, oropharynx, paranasal sinuses, and meninges. We report the case of a 55-year-old man who presented with progressive left-sided hearing loss, aural fullness, and otalgia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a soft-tissue mass in the left temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Histopathologic examination showed overlying squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, subepithelial fibrosis, and chronic inflammatory infiltrate, which were consistent with an IP. Radiologic images and MRI indicated an ill-defined soft tissue involving the roof and posterior aspect of the TMJ, extending into the anterior external auditory canal. Our case was treated with a 2-week course of high dose prednisone (1 mg\/kg) and a 2-week taper with resolution of symptoms. Two years after treatment, the patient shows no evidence of recurrence on MRI.","46":"Sialendoscopy is a relatively new minimally invasive technique that permits direct salivary tree visualization and is important in obstructive sialadenitis management and treatment. The present study aimed to examine the sialendoscopy learning curve between March 2009 and March 2013. We compared the first and last 100 sialendoscopies performed in our department with regard to anaesthesia type, operating time, success rate, technical difficulty, major complications, and clinical improvement. General anaesthesia rates were 63% and 38% (P = 0.0004) among the first and last 100 sialendoscopies, respectively. Among the first and last 100 procedures, respectively, average operating times were 39 and 25 minutes (P = 0.00055) for diagnostic sialendoscopies and 68 and 65 minutes (P = 0.35) for interventional sialendoscopies. Successful stone extraction rates were 65% and 90.2% (P = 0.0058) among the first and last 100 procedures, respectively, while the corresponding rates of successful stenosis dilation were 92.5% and 97.1% (P = 0.27). Technical difficulty was encountered in 25% and 17% (P = 0.164) of the first and last 100 sialendoscopies, respectively. Neither group experienced major complications. All patients tolerated the procedures well and had excellent outcomes. Progressive learning regarding sialendoscopy enabled more frequent operation under local anaesthesia, thus better meeting the requirements of a minimally invasive technique. We were able to decrease the operative time in diagnostic sialendoscopy. These two factors support the inclusion of diagnostic sialendoscopy into the diagnostic panel in obstructive glandular diseases.

We also investigated whether biometeorological forecasts should be addressed to persons with a history of nosebleed diathesis. We analyzed consecutive idiopathic epistaxis events over a 3-year period. Patients were included if they had been in the municipality of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina at least 24 hours before the epistaxis occurrence. The monthly variation in epistaxis events was determined. Epistaxis days (Days \"0\", 0 = day with epistaxis occurrence) and selected nonepistaxis days (Days \"-1\", -1 = each first single day without epistaxis prior to Day 0) were compared according to daily values of mean, minimum, and maximum temperature; diurnal temperature range; minimum and maximum atmospheric pressure; diurnal pressure range; and mean relative humidity. The greatest and smallest percentage of epistaxis events occurred in the months of March and August, respectively. There were no significant differences between Days 0 and Days -1 with respect to the examined meteorological factors. In this region with a Mediterranean climate, we found a seasonal variation with an incidence peak during the spring transition months, but we did not identify any meteorological trigger factors for epistaxis. Thus, there is no need for biometeorological forecasts to be addressed to persons with a history of nosebleed diathesis. ","49":null,"50":"The scientific research agenda of the Dutch Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Head &amp; Neck Surgery claims that there is a knowledge gap with regard to the efficacy of septoplasty for a blocked nose. This assertion is based on a restrictive approach to evidence-based medicine that could result in unnecessary trials and the abolition or rationing of sound treatment options. The arguments in favour of the effectiveness of septoplasty are based on the total spectrum of evidence from research, clinical experience and basic science. The best available evidence shows that this form of treatment is satisfactory for more than two thirds of all patients. If all levels of evidence are taken into account, it becomes clear that there is no knowledge gap with regard to the efficacy of septoplasty for blocked nose. ","51":"Swallowing dysfunction is a common symptom of myotonic dystrophy, but it is poorly documented in large patient series. This retrospective study was designed to investigate the presence of swallowing symptoms in a large study population and to describe a specific pattern of clinical and radiographic abnormalities. A retrospective analysis was made of 169 files of patients with confirmed MD. Neuromuscular assessment was made by means of a standardised neurological examination; clinical swallowing symptoms were listed, and video-fluoroscopic images were analysed. More than half the patients reported swallowing complaints. The major symptoms were frequent choking, difficult pharyngeal transport and piecemeal deglutition. The pharyngeal phase of swallowing was most frequently compromised. This was shown radiographicaly in reduced pharyngeal peristalsis, hypopharyngeal stasis and fragmented swallowing. Aspiration was seen in half of the patients, mostly during swallowing. A typical 'hung position' of the hyoid was also seen. Different onset types of MD seem to be accompanied by comparable subjective complaints and radiographic symptoms. Pharyngeal transport was most affected in this patient population. Muscular weakness seems to be the major contributor to swallowing impairment in MD. Swallowing abnormalities may be present even if patients report only a few symptoms and even if the severity of the disease is not pronounced.

With the introduction of the daVinci robot in head and neck surgery, the surgical robotic system is now being used to gain direct access to the parapharyngeal space and to excise the tumors endoscopically. This study evaluates the outcomes of four patients with benign PPS tumors treated with a transoral robotic surgery approach in a single centre. All patients with benign tumors of the PPS who underwent transoral resection (between January 2012 and June 2014) using the robot were included in this retrospective study. The study population comprised of two males and two females with a mean age of 52 (range 34-66 years). The parapharyngeal mass was successfully transorally removed in all cases. Overall, mean length of stay was 3.25 days with mean time to oral diet of one day. No intraoperative, perioperative or postoperative complications were encountered. The histological diagnosis was pleomorphic adenoma in two cases (50%). The other two cases were: schwannoma and angioma. There were no recurrences on radiological investigations during a mean follow-up of 14.5 months. MRI scan showed a stable residual fibrotic lesion in case of the angioma. The preoperative complaints of mucus in the throat, painless swelling of the soft palate or throat burden of all patients resolved after surgery. With the assistance of the surgical robotic system, benign tumors within the PPS can be excised safely without neck incisions. Further long-term evaluation is needed to define patient selection and the role of TORS for PPS neoplasms.

After the introduction of transoral robotic surgery technology (TORS) into the otolaryngology practice, surgery on the BOT was performed more effectively. Base of tongue reduction can be performed alone or as a part of a multilevel surgery. Patient selection is important and will be discussed further in this study. Available studies show promising and encouraging results for TORS future use in BOT.","55":"Surgery to the base of tongue (BOT) in the presence of neoplasm is a challenging topic for head and neck surgeons. This area is difficult to access and includes important neurovascular structures such as the hypoglossal nerve and lingual artery. The pivotal role of the tongue base in swallowing makes planning the surgical approach more challenging. The surgical approaches vary from open neck\/mandibulotomy to transoral laser surgery (TLS) which have significant disadvantages. After introduction of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) to otolaryngology practice with the da Vinci Surgical system, we have in our armamentarium a new approach to the BOT. The improved exposure with new retractors, 3-dimensional (3-D) visualization and magnification and advanced motion capacity allow for increased ease to perform surgery in this difficult area. In recent years, several articles published the data about safety and feasibility of TORS for various conditions. This article presents our approach to the BOT for neoplasms including malignant and benign lesions.","56":"Transoral, minimally invasive, organ preservation surgeries are increasingly used to treat laryngopharyngeal carcinomas to avoid the toxicity associated with combined chemoradiotherapy regimens. This study investigated the efficiency, safety, and functional outcomes of using transoral robotic surgery (TORS) to perform supraglottic laryngectomy (SGL). This was a multicenter study using a case series with planned data collection from 2009 to 2012 for patients with supraglottic squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) who underwent SGL using TORS. Eighty-four (84) of 262 patients underwent TORS for supraglottic SCC. Within 24 hours of surgery, 24% of the patients started on an oral diet. The median use of a feeding tube was 8 days for 76% of other patients. Definitive percutaneous gastrostomy feeding was necessary for 9.5% of the patients. 24% of the patients did require a tracheostomy, and the median use was 8 days. One percent (1%) of the patients had a definitive tracheostomy. Aspiration pneumonia was observed in 23% of the patients during the postoperative course, and was responsible for the death of one patient. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 18% of the patients. Based on the pathology results, 51% of the patients received adjuvant radiation therapy. TORS for SGL in intermediate stage SCC is a safe procedure with good functional outcomes and fast recovery times. However, adverse events can occur. Consequently, this technique requires good patient selection criteria to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. ","57":"To report 2.5-year survival outcomes for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated primarily with transoral robotic-assisted resection. Fifty consecutive, appropriately staged patients were enrolled prospectively, and underwent transoral robotic surgery between September 2011 and August 2013. There were 18 patients with overall Stage I-II and 32 patients with Stage III-IV disease. Adjuvant treatment could be spared for 20 patients. Another 5 patients refused the recommended adjuvant treatment. Seventeen patients received 60 Gy adjuvant radiotherapy and 8 patients underwent 66 Gy adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Overall survival was 94% with two disease-specific deaths and one unrelated death. The 2.5-year disease free survival rate was 88%, and the 2.5-year recurrence-free survival was 80%. Local recurrence rate was 10% after 2.5 years. Using TORS as their primary modality, 40% of the patients did not need adjuvant treatment and showed similar survival rates to that of conventional surgery or primary chemoradiotherapy. In another 34% of the patients, adjuvant chemotherapy could be spared and adjuvant radiotherapy could be reduced by 10 Gy, compared to primary chemoradiotherapy of 70 Gy.

","58":"To review and summarize functional and oncologic outcomes after transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for non-oropharyngeal head and neck malignancies. The MEDLINE database and bibliographies of relevant studies were searched through December 2014. Search strategy was ((transoral) AND surgery) AND robotics) OR TORS. Abstracts and titles were screened for relevance and full articles of the selected records were evaluated and critically appraised after inclusion. Data concerning functional and oncologic outcomes as well as adverse effects were collected. 22 records were eventually included in the review. For TORS in the treatment of glottic, hypopharyngeal ands supraglottic cancer we retained 3 case series (26 patients), 5 case series (36 patients) and 6 case series (67 patients) respectively. 8 case reports\/series (14 patients) assessing safety and feasibility of TORS for tumours in the parapharyngeal space, nasopharynx and skull base were also evaluated. In general, treatment of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer by means of TORS seems to be feasible and safe with satisfying functional and short-term oncologic results. For treatment of malignant tumours in the parapharyngeal space, nasopharynx and skull base, the benefits of TORS, when compared to classic surgical techniques, are still uncertain and are particularly based on theoretical advantages. TORS offers an interesting new approach for treating non-oropharyngeal head and neck malignancies. However, long-term results are still not reported and TORS should be directly compared to existing therapeutic options in randomized controlled trials. Until then, its use should be subject to critical appraisal. ","59":"Over the past decade, the development of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) brought a new opportunity in the treatment of early T-stage oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). The objective of this study is to review the functional outcomes after TORS. Indeed, dysphagia is among the most commonly cited functional impairments in OPSCC survivors treated by surgeries with an open approach or conventional radiotherapy. We performed a review of the literature and analysed functional outcomes after TORS. Althought the technique is very recent, early functional and oncologic outcome data are promising and the major studies analysing these parameters support that TORS is feasible and safe as well as oncologically and functionally efficacious.","60":"Head and Neck cancer can be treated by non-surgical or surgical modalities. Current surgical techniques include open surgery and transoral resections. The latter have the distinct advantage of quicker recovery and reduced hospital stay. The further down the aerodigestive tract tumours are sited, the more difficult is the transoral access, requiring techniques that combine magnification and finer instrumentation. Thus, while oral cavity tumours can be removed transorally without special equipment, the need to address oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancers led to the evolution of transoral laser microsurgery. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) improves the visualisation, the instrumentation and the ergonomics in transoral resections and is also used primarily in the treatment of oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. Current evidence suggests that the oncologic and functional outcome of TORS surgery is good as speech and swallowing mechanisms are better preserved. This review will provide the reader an insight into the role of TORS in head and neck practice.","61":"Intuitive Surgical Inc.

They are mostly low-grade tumours, although they can also be aggressive. In this case report, we describe a 34-year-old patient with sinonasal adenocarcinomas. Within his nasal cavity was found an irregular mass. Given the intratumoral calcification and bone, the mass was thought to be a bone-producing tumour, such as an osteosarcoma. The pathological diagnosis was a sinonasal adenocarcinoma with extensive metaplastic bone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a sinonasal adenocarcinoma with metaplastic ossification.","64":"Epistaxis is extremely common in children. Although rare, the presence of an intranasal mass as a cause of bleeding should be ruled out in patients with recurrent or massive epistaxis. We present a patient whose recurrent nose-bleeding had been due to a nasopharyngeal mass. Case report with relevant literature review. A 15-year-old girl with a history of sudden posterior nasal bleeding was diagnosed with thyroid-like low-grade nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx. A type II nasopharyngeal endoscopic resection was performed with an excellent outcome at 30-months follow-up. The literature review on the topic disclosed only five other paediatric cases, none of which presented with epistaxis. Recurrent epistaxis may infer the presence of nasopharyngeal malignant neoplasms, even in children. To our knowledge, this represents the sixth case in the literature of a paediatric low-grade nasopharyngeal adenocarcinoma and the first presenting with massive epistaxis. The possibility of such a finding should be kept in mind when evaluating children with massive epistaxis.

We retrospectively collected speech recognition scores and 14 demographic, audiological, and technical factors, including gender, age at implantation, aetiology, hearing loss progression, preoperative Pure Tone Average (PTA), hearing loss onset age and duration, duration and use of hearing aids (HAs); implantation in the best or worst ear; implantation on the right or left side; use of HA after implantation; and the duration and type of CI. We prospectively tested a subgroup of 21 patients for SRT in fixed noise. The hearing loss duration significantly affected speech recognition scores in quiet conditions (H (4) = 10.567, p =0.032) and SRTs in fixed noise conditions (rs = 0.466, p = 0.033). The PTA of the better ear significantly affected only the SRT in fixed noise conditions (rs = 0.57 1, p = 0.007). The duration of hearing loss and the PTA of the best ear had significant effects on the outcomes of speech recognition and SRT in quiet and fixed noise conditions, respectively.

All animals were killed under general anaesthesia on day five after the DPOAE measurement. The cochleae of each rat were histopathologically and immunohistochemically evaluated. The outer hair cells were mostly preserved in the control and CAPE groups. Moderate-to-severe and mild-to-moderate hair cell losses were detected in the cisplatin and cisplatin-CAPE groups, respectively. DPOAE assessments revealed significant deterioration in the cisplatin group (P &lt; 0.05). The difference between the cisplatin and cisplatin-CAPE groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).

All patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with a history of preceding RYGBP from 2007 to 2012 were identified retrospectively. Cases were matched 2:1 for age, gender, and BMI to a control group undergoing total thyroidectomy without previous RYGBP during the same study period. Age and body mass index were equivalent between cases (n = 14) and controls (n = 23). A comparison between groups demonstrated that cases had a significantly higher incidence of symptomatic hypocalcemia resulting in paresthesia and tetany (38% vs. 0%; P &lt;0 .01), received intravenous calcium more often (18% vs. 0%; P &lt; 0.01), and had longer hospital stays (2.2 vs. 1.2 days, P = 0.02) than controls. Physicians and surgeons need to be aware of this complication and take measures to identify and prevent it, and patients should be informed. In this patient population, calcium levels should be closely monitored and early calcium and vitamin D spplementation should be initiated preemptively.

This study aims to report experiences in sialendoscopy for the management of obstructive sialoadenitis with and without the presence of stones. Data from 71 procedures in 66 patients who underwent sialendoscopy for obstructive sialoadenitis were recorded and compared in terms of clinical data, computed tomography (CT) findings, procedural techniques and outcomes. The overall specificity rate of CT for detecting sialolithiasis was 91.6%. The complete remission rate was 100% for patients with confirmed sialolithiasis successfully treated with stone removal after endoscopic lithotripsy. For patients with non-sialolithiasis obstructive sialoadenitis of the submandibular gland, the complete remission rate dropped to 22% if no additional treatments were done after a diagnostic sialendoscopy. If sialostents were inserted, the complete remission rate increased to 55%. However, this improvement was very limited in terms of the overall management of the affected parotid gland. For patients with obstructive sialoadenitis and salivary gland stones, removal of the stones under sialendoscopy will most likely provide complete remission. Patients without stones have much worse treatment outcomes compared to those with true sialolithiasis. Sialostent placement may have the potential to improve treatment outcomes in the management of non-lithiasis obstructive sialoadenitis.

Here we describe 169 free flap procedures, and determine the success rate of these reconstructions. This study included data from all patients who underwent microsurgical reconstruction for head and neck defects at St. John's Hospital in Bruges between 1994 and 2012. We analysed sex, age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score, smoking, prior radiotherapy, and deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) harvesting technique to determine their influences on flap complications and overall complications. Our study included 169 free flap procedures, with a flap success rate of 92%. The rate of systemic complications was 21%. The DCIA split harvesting technique was associated with a significantly higher incidence of flap complications. Increased age (357 years) was associated with a higher incidence of overall complications. In our present series, the DCIA split harvesting technique was associated with a significantly higher frequency of total flap failure. This increased failure rate was attributed to important haematomas that compromised venous circulation. We also found that patient age was a significant factor for the development of postoperative complications. ","71":"Cervical oesophageal cancer is a difficult problem to manage. The aim of this study was to report our experiences with the surgical treatment of cervical oesophageal cancer and the oncological results obtained in our patients. Nineteen patients with cervical oesophageal cancer underwent surgical treatment between January 2001 and February 2011. Eighteen patients underwent pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy and one patient underwent pharyngoesophagectomy. Reconstruction of the digestive tract with gastric transpositions was performed in 18 patients and right colon transposition was performed in one patient. No operative mortality was noted. Significant complications occurred in nine patients. The distant metastasis rate was 47%. Overall three- and five-year survival rates were 30% and 28%, respectively and the three- and five-year disease-specific survival rates were 41% and 39%, respectively. Pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy with gastric transposition can be performed for the treatment of cervical oesophageal cancer.

For 14 days after surgery, we monitored pain, nausea or vomiting, problems with eating and fluid intake, sleep disturbances, behavioral changes, emotional impact, other types of discomfort, rehospitalization, and duration to full recovery, based on diary entries and telephone calls. 69 children and their parents participated. After inserting ventilation tubes, the average recovery time was 4.6 days. Symptoms were most intense during the first three days. Participants mainly reported pain, behavioral changes, and emotional impact. After more extensive ENT surgery (adenoidectomy and\/or tonsillectomy, with or without insertion of ventilation tubes), the average recovery time was 6.2 days, and pain was more severe and longer-lasting. Apart from nausea or vomiting during the first three days, participants frequently reported behavioral changes, emotional impact, and sleep disturbances. Problems with eating and fluid intake were most prevalent. Pain scores reported by parents differed from the scores reported by their children; parents both underestimated and overestimated their child's pain. This study provided descriptions of postoperative recovery after outpatient ENT surgery in children. This information is indispensable for preparing the child and parents and for ensuring accurate follow-up. Recovery varied with the type of surgery. Mainly, postoperative discomfort was most severe after adenoidectomy and\/or tonsillectomy. Parents tended to give inaccurate estimates of their child's pain. Self-reports from children should be considered the gold standard. ","75":"Radiation-induced carcinosarcoma of the submandibular gland: case report and review of literature. Radiation-induced carcinosarcoma (RICS) of the head and neck is a very rare and extremely aggressive entity. We present the case of a 60-year-old man diagnosed with a T2N2cM0 squamous cell carcinoma at the right base of the tongue (BOT). The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to the BOT and bilateral neck. He developed left submandibular firmness five years after treatment, initially diagnosed as radiation-induced fibrosis. The increasing size of the left submandibular mass two years later prompted further imaging, which showed a 2.2x1.8 cm mass in the left submandibular region in the previously irradiated field. This was diagnosed as a radiation-induced submandibular gland malignancy. This is the first reported case of a RICS in the submandibular gland and demonstrates the importance of early workup and evaluation of submandibular gland pathology in a patient with a history of radiation for a head and neck malignancy.","76":"Isolated laryngeal leishmaniasis in an immunocompetent patient: a case report. Isolated laryngeal Leishmaniasis presents neither explicit laryngeal lesions nor specific symptoms. In fact, it may mimic many inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Considering the low incidence of this atypical localization, laryngeal Leishmaniasis, is rarely contemplated by physicians in differential diagnoses of laryngeal tumour lesions. We present the case of a 62-year-old immunocompetent subject who developed a single Leishmania mucosal lesion on the left vocal cord, simulating a laryngeal cancer. A case report and discussion of the clinical case by referring to the literature. Specific therapy with miltefosine led to clinical and endoscopic improvement. We had no relapse after three years of follow-up. This clinical case highlights the need to consider isolated laryngeal Leishmaniasis in the differential diagnoses of laryngeal tumour lesions, even in immunocompetent subjects who live in endemic zones, in order to ensure an early and correct therapeutic approach. ","77":"Smell functions in patients with multiple sclerosis: a prospective case-control study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the smell function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Twenty subjects (six males, 14 females) who were diagnosed as having MS, based on the 2010 Revised McDonald criteria, and 20 healthy individuals (six males, 14 females) were included in this study. In order to measure smell identification abilities, each subject completed the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Central and peripheral regions of smell were measured using cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images. The central regions of smell (the temporal lobe insular gyrus and the corpus amygdala) and the peripheral regions of smell (the olfactory bulb, tract and sulcus) were examined in the cranial MR images. Regions of smell were also evaluated for the presence of MS lesions (plaques). The total BSIT scores of the subjects in the MS group were found to be significantly lower than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05). In the MS group, measurement values of the central regions of smell (right corpus amygdala diameter, right and left corpus amygdala) were significantly higher than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05). There were no MS 'lesions in the peripheral regions of smell, but MS lesions were observed in the central regions: the right temporal lobe insular gyrus (four patients, 20.0%); the left temporal lobe insular gyrus (two patients, 10.0%); and the right corpus amygdala (one patient, 5.0%). While these results are not sufficient for statistical analysis, the total smell scores of these patients were found to be low. There is a deterioration in the smell functions of patients with MS. Therefore, we highly recommend that ENT specialists use the easily accessible and reliable BSIT for the diagnosis of smell disorders. ","78":"Corticosteroid hypersensitivity in allergic rhinitis. intranasal corticosteroid (IC) is the most effective treatment method in allergic rhinitis patients who are unresponsive to antihistamines. The literature reports an approximate 20% treatment failure for instances where IC is used for the treatment allergic rhinitis. Hypersensitivity reaction to corticosteroids may be one of the causes of this treatment failure. to discover the incidence and confounding factors of corticosteroid hypersensitivity in patients with allergic rhinitis. after 31 patients were excluded, 150 consecutive patients who were prospectively evaluated in our outpatient clinics with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and 50 age- and sex- matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. To diagnose allergic rhinitis, the symptoms of patients and a skin prick test were used. A skin patch test was used to determine corticosteroid hypersensitivity. Total IgE values and total eosinophil count were obtained for all patients. Total symptom scores were calculated for the severity of symptoms and to determine the response to therapy using intranasal corticosteroids. the incidence of corticosteroid hypersensitivity determined via the skin patch test was 14.0% (21 out of 150 patients). A difference was observed for patch test positivity results between the study and control groups (14% vs. 0%, respectively). Serum IgE levels and total eosinophil count were higher among patients who had corticosteroid hypersensitivity (p:0.005 and p:0.004, respectively). Patients unresponsive to intranasal corticosteroids had a higher incidence of corticosteroid hypersensitivity (71.4% vs. 4.4%, p&lt;0.00 1). our study is the largest to date investigating CH in patients with allergic rhinitis and patients with allergic rhinitis have been found to have a high incidence (14%) of corticosteroid hypersensitivity, which may affect the response of patients to intranasal corticosteroid treatment. ","79":"Periostin: a novel biomarker for chronic rhinosinusitis. Rhinosinusitis is characterized by inflammation of the sinuses, resulting in particular symptoms. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of periostin as a biomarker for chronic rhinosinusitis. The mucosal tissues of the ethmoid sinus were sampled from 12 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRsNP) and 25 with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRwNP). Inferior turbinate biopsy was performed in 15 patients with a deviation of the nasal septum (DNS). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to assess the distribution of periostin. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect the expression of periostin mRNA in nasal tissue specimens. The serum concentration of periostin was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Correlation analysis among periostin mRNA in nasal mucosa, IHC staining score of periostin, serum concentration of periostin and proportion of blood eosinophils was performed. The serum concentration of periostin and the IHC staining score of nasal mucosa from CRSsNP and CRSwNP patients were significantly higher than those in DNS counterparts (both P &lt;0.01). The levels of periostin mRNA in CRSsNP and CRSwNP patients were slightly increased, but did not significantly differ from that in the DNS group (both P &gt;0.05). The IHC staining score and serum concentration of periostin were correlated with the proportion of eosinophils in blood (P&lt;0.05 and P &lt;0.0 1). Periostin can be used as a novel biomarker for chronic rhinosinusitis, which provides a potential target for individualized therapy of chronic rhinosinusitis. ","80":"The microbiology of normal non-inflamed sinuses. The presence of organisms in the healthy sinus was uncertain for many decades. This review summarizes the studies that have explored the microbiology of normal non-inflamed sinuses using conventional microbiological culture methods and non-culture molecular techniques, and discusses the potential implications of these for the treatment and prevention of sinus inflammation. A literature search of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases was conducted from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) to 25th June 2016. Studies that used adequate microbiological methods demonstrated the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in healthy non-inflamed sinuses. These organisms may participate in sinus inflammation if the right circumstances arise. Recent data suggest that the host response or lack of response to normal sinus flora may be central to the development of sinus inflammation. Healthy non-inflamed sinuses are colonized by rich and diverse populations of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora. These organisms may participate in sinus inflammation if the right circumstances arise. The host response or lack of response to the normal sinus flora may be central to the development of sinus inflammation. Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum seems to have a potential pathogenic role, while certain probiotics may have a protective effect. Modulation of the sinus flora by topical antimicrobial and\/or probiotic organisms which may interfere with the growth of potential bacterial and fungal pathogens may be used to prevent and treat sinus inflammation. ","81":"Assessment and management of presumed branchial cleft cysts: our experience. The aim was to assess the accuracy of diagnosis and management of presumed branchial cleft cysts in our centre. Retrospective review of patients with a clinical diagnosis of branchial cleft cyst at B arts Health NHS Trust from 2009 to 2015. 67 patients underwent surgical excision for presumed branchial cysts. Ninety per cent were histologically confirmed, 7% demonstrated cystic metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, and 3% lymph node metastases from papillary thyroid cancer. No patient had pre-operative Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) discussion. Pre-operative FNA had a positive predictive value of 90% (95% Cl 0.82-0.95). Age &gt;40 years (p=0.02) and presence of lymph nodes (p=0.02) carried a higher risk of malignancy. Patients &gt;40 years with or without multiple lymph nod 'es on imaging should be treated as presumed meta- static cancer. Consideration should be given to concurrent panendoscopy and intra-operative frozen section +\/- selective neck dissection after discussion at the Head &amp; Neck MDT. ","82":"Comparison of the cough reflex test and water swallowing test in healthy participants and neurological patients. Silent aspiration is poorly identified by traditional clinical swallowing evaluations. Recently, sevral studies have proposed the use of a cough reflex test (CRT) for screening patients at risk of aspirations. The first aithis study is to investigate the CRT thresholds of citric acid concentration for identifying cough responses in healthy participants and neurological patients. The second aim is to compare the results of the CRT with the water swallowing test (WST), a standard screening test for identifying cough responses in neurological patients. The CRT and then the WST were administered to 100 neurological patients and 100 healthy participants. For the CRT, we administered incremental solutions of citric acid interspersed with placebo doses. We used the results of the CRT in healthy participants to define a citric acid concentration cut-off, which could be used with neurological patients as a screening for aspirations. As all controls coughed at a concentration of 0.1 mol\/L, this was used as a cut-off in patients to identify coughing as a screening for aspiration risk. Patients showed cough reflexes at concentrations significantly higher than controls (p=0 .001). The WST was not administered to 17 patients, due to cognitive deficits and severe clinical conditions. Thirty six patients had a cough response above the screening cut-off (&gt; 0.1 mol\/L), 25 of which (30.1%) also had a positive cough response during the WST. The CRT correlated significantly with the WST. Unlike the WST, the CRT could be easily administered to severely impaired patients. Our results indicate the use of the CRT as a screening test for silent aspirators. ","83":"Airway intervention in cases of acute epiglottitis.Problem\/objectives: In cases of acute epiglottitis, indications for airway intervention have not been established. In the present study, we reviewed patients with acute epiglottitis to identify clinical factors, which suggest airway intervention should be performed. Patients with acute epiglottitis admitted to The Jikei University Daisan Hospital (Tokyo) from 2004 to 2013 were identified. Patients' characteristics, histories, laryngoscopic findings and laboratory findings were reviewed and analysed. Of the 83 patients (82 adults and one adolescent) in the sample, 16 (19%) underwent airway intervention and conservative treatment. The factors that were significantly more likely to have been present in patients who received airway intervention were odynophagia, drooling, hoarseness, muffled voice, dyspnoea, swelling of the posterior side of the epiglottis, less than 50% of the glottis area being visible with laryngoscopy, and a high white blood cell (WBC) count. The only factor that was shown by multiple logistic regression analysis to be distinctively predictive of airway intervention was \"less than 50% of the glottis area being visible\" (P = .000, odds ratio = 23.630, sensitivity = 86.6%, specificity = 78.6%, predictive accuracy = 85.2%). When considering whether airway intervention should be performed in cases of acute epiglottitis, the most important clinical factor is the laryngoscopic finding that \"less than 50% of the glottis area being visible.\" Other important clinical factors to consider are odynophagia, drooling, hoarseness, muffled voice, dyspnoea, swelling of the posterior side of the epiglottis and a high WBC count. ","84":"Induction chemotherapy followed by supracricoid partial laryngectomy (SCPL) with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (CHEF) in T3NO arytenoid fixation-related glottic cancer. Arytenoid fixation in the larynx has been considered a contraindication for performing organ preservation surgery (OPS). We present a retrospective series of cases of arytenoid fixation-related T3N0 glottic cancer treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by OPS. Retrospective review of 19 patients (from 2008 to 2012) with T3NO glottic cancer who received two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil (PPF), with a 21-day interval between each cycle, followed by supracricoid partial laryngectomy (SCPL) with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (CHEP). Sixteen patients with a mean age of 56.4 years received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a clinical response (7 partial response\/9 complete response) and radiologic response by computed tomography (CT) (7 partial response\/7 complete response\/2 cases without CT) were treated with SCPL-CHEP and removal of the arytenoid cartilage in the tumour site (10 left\/6 right), bilateral neck dissection of levels II to V and searching of the Delphian node. There was one patient who died after a recurrence in the larynx and who also had an additional concomitant second primary tumour, and a second patient with a second primary tumour in the lung, who is still alive after treatment. Disease-free survival (DFS) was 82.5% at 5 years and overall survival (OS) was 80% at 5 years. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy proved beneficial in patients waiting for surgery, helped maximize the oncologic benefit of the surgery provided (good local control using SCPL with CHEP), improved regional and distant control, minimized side effects by avoiding treatment with radiotherapy whenever possible, and proved feasible even in the presence of ipsilateral arytenoid fixation. Our results are encouraging, although a multi-centre randomized clinical trial should be performed in order to identify the true impact of this approach. ","85":"Human papilloma virus detection in oropharyngeal cancer with gargle samples. human papilloma virus (HPV) is a major risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and knowledge of a patient's HPV status is clinically important in terms of treatment and prognosis. The practicality of using oral gargle samples to reliably detect HPV in patients with OPSCC remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of HPV detection in gargle samples of OPSCC patients using an HPV-dedicated nucleic acid amplification test (cobas 4800 HPV Test; Roche Diagnostics K.K.). 15 patients with histologically proven OPSCC were evaluated from May 2014 to March 2015. Swab sam- ples served as positive controls and were tested using both the Hybrid Capture II HPV Test (HC-II; Digene Corporation) and the cobas 4800 HPV Test. Oral gargle samples were tested using the cobas 4800 HPV Test. Five of the 15 patients were confirmed to be HPV-positive by a combination of p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV-DNA in situ hybridization and nucleic acid amplification. the sensitivity and specificity of the gargling method were 60% and 100%, respectively. No false-positives were obtained. Detection of HPV in two very small tumours rising from the base of the tongue was difficult and these cases were overlooked as HPV-negative. use of the gargling method to determine HPV positivity in OPSCC patients appears feasible, except in patients with very small tumours. Real-time polymerase chain reaction using gargle samples may have greater clinical efficacy than the swabbing method. ","86":"The incidence of hypothyroidism after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. To identify the incidence of radiation-induced hypothyroidism (HT) after head and neck radiotherapy.Furthermore, we wanted to correlate patient and treatment characteristics with the incidence of HT in order to identify predictive factors for radiation-induced HT. We examined the values of thyrotropin, i.e., the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), in head and neck cancer patients who received a combination treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy between 2005 and 2012. HT was defined as having a TSH value of &gt; 10 mIU\/L or whenever the patient started to take substitution therapy after treatment. We correlated the radiotherapy mean dose to the thyroid gland (Dmean), the pretreatment volume of the thyroid gland, sex, age, type of concomitant treatment, tumour localization, and T and N classification with the incidence of HT. We were able to obtain data from 72 patients. From these 72 patients, 48 (66%) had a normal thyroid function and 25 (34%) had developed HT. The mean follow-up for these patients was 55 months (range: 21 to 103 months). Out of the 25 patients with HT, 8 (32%) were diagnosed within the first year of follow-up. Increasing Dmean is a significant risk factor for developing HT. Increasing thyroid volume, on the other hand, was correlated with less HT in our patient cohort. In our study, the incidence of HT is 34%. We also noticed that HT can even develop shortly after treatment. Patients with a higher Dmean to the thyroid gland and lower pretreatment thyroid gland volumes are more at risk. ","87":"The effect of paper patching on aural fullness of unknown aetiology. To assess the effect of paper patching on aural fullness. We conducted a prospective, single-blind, placebo-controlled study using urn randomization. Twenty-two patients presenting with the complaint of aural fullness, without middle-ear pathology, were recruited from a secondary referral centre. The tested intervention was the application of paper patches on specified areas of the tympanic membrane. The main outcome measure was the change in subjective symptoms of average aural fullness and peak aural fullness, based on differences between pre- and post-intervention measurements on a scale from 0 to 10. Paper patching led to significant improvement in subjective symptom scores. In the treatment group, the change in average aural fullness was -2.00 (SD 2.00, p = 0.006), and the change in peak fullness was -1.77 (SD 2.49, p = 0.01). In the placebo group, these values were -0.13 (SD 1.55, p = 0.72) and +0.33 (SD 1.10, p = 0.37), respectively. No major adverse effects were reported. After one week of treatment, paper patching showed a beneficial effect on aural fullness of vague or unknown aetiology. ","88":"Fundamentals in expertise medicine. The author describes how a medical expert appointed to assess damages to physical integrity must proceed. The individual is appointed an expert either directly by the Court of Justice, or appointed sapiteur by a colleague in order to give his opinion on a subject in which he is specialized.","89":"Hearing prevention experience. Many soldiers suffer from serious NIHL due to the lack of an effective hearing prevention policy. To conduct a study to ameliorate the hearing prevention policy. Literature review Results: Sensitization, innovative hearing protection systems, CEP systems for pilots, using OAEs to identify the actual hearing damage of soldiers and motivating them to better protect themselves, and applying the AHAAH algorithm can determine the number of allowable impulses Conclusions: 1) In line with European and Belgian legislation in this context, tremendous efforts have been made by the Belgian military for information about and sensitization regarding the issue of NIHL. 2) The high variety of positions, functions and environmental factors in a military setting makes the inventory of noise exposures complex and extensive. 3) Efficacious ear protection systems have been rapidly implemented in relation to the most exposed work conditions and, finally, extended to all potential dangerous environments. 4) The use of OAEs was not only a pivotal element in the screening of military staff, but also in their conscientization towards the potentially dramatic consequences of excessive noise exposure. 5) Currently, some \"real-life\" measurements are being conducted in order to provide military authorities with a complete cadastre on the noise dangers in the Belgian military. 6) The role of military ENT specialists (i.e., ENT and occupational medicine doctors, totally familiar with the working conditions of military personnel), audiologists and specialists in occupational medicine was critical to the success of these initiatives. ","90":"Civilian law:from occupational medicine to occupational event. Despite the growing importance of objective measurements, the health effects of many occupational risk factors are currently not fully quantified. Occupational noise, as a widespread risk factor, is illustrative in this regard; there is a strong body of evidence linking it to an important health outcome (hearing loss), but it is less decisively associated with others (such as psychological disorders). It is also distinct from environmental noise, and therefore falls under the responsibility of employers as well as individuals. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is, at present, incurable and irreversible. However, it is preventable, if effective and global hearing conservation programmes can be implemented. These programmes should not be isolated efforts, but should be integrated into the overall hazard prevention and control programme of the workplace. Belgian law encompasses a set of provisions for prevention and the protection of the health and safety of workers within the workplace, including aspects pertaining to the hygiene of the workplace and psychosocial aspects at work (stress, violence, bullying and sexual harassment, among others). In principle, combating environmental noise is fully addressed in this country. However, other levels of policy-making also play an important role in this regard. For example, the federal government is in charge of product standards, and therefore also of noise emission standards for products. The interpretation and enforcement of Belgian legislation on well-being at work converts European directives and international agreements on well-being at work into Belgian law.","91":"Principles of hospital disaster management: an integrated and multidisciplinary approach. Hospitals play an important role during a disaster response, and are also at risk for internal incidents. We propose an integrated and multidisciplinary approach towards hospital disaster management and preparedness. In addition to response strategies, much attention is given to risk assessment and preparedness in the pre-incident phase and to business continuity planning (BCP) in the post-incident phase. It is essential to train key players and all personnel to understand the Hospital Incident Management System (HIMS) and to perform specific emergency procedures. All emergency procedures should be grounded in evidence-based practice resulting from essential disaster response research.","92":"Coordination of actions in disaster situations. The essential concept of disaster medicine is to create appropriate proportions of resources to needs. The different operational steps will be described in this chapter. The aim is to minimize human fatalities while reducing the risk of long- and short-term physical and psychological complications.","93":"Disaster medicine. Once we define the characteristics of both a disaster in general and specific disaster categories, the unique aspects of disaster or emergency management and disaster medicine become much easier to understand. The cornerstone of disaster medicine has an ethical aspect, namely how, as medical professionals, we must move from our daily practice in which we employ almost unlimited resources as required by each patient to a collective ethics situation in which a limited set of resources must be used to maximize the number of victims treated, so as to reach an optimal general outcome.","94":"Long-term complications after facial, pharyngeal, laryngeal and tracheal traumas. To review and summarize the existing evidence for long-term anatomical and functional complications after pharyngeal, laryngeal and tracheal traumas. The MEDLINE database and the bibliographies of relevant studies were selected, analysed and appraised prior to December 2015. With regard to the search strategy, the selected items were: ((long-term complications) AND pharyngeal) AND laryngeal) AND tracheal) AND traumas. Abstracts and titles were screened for relevance, while full articles of the se- lected records were evaluated and critically appraised after inclusion. Data concerning life-threatening situations, as well as long-term severe adverse effects were collected. ","95":"Complex intubation, cricothyrotomy and tracheotomy. Successful management of a difficult airway begins with recognizing the potential problem. When the patient cannot breathe spontaneously, oxygenation and ventilation should start first with bag-valve ventilation, with or without an airway adjunct such as a Mayo cannula, followed by an orotrache4l intubation attempt, performed by an experienced emergency doctor. If orotracheal intubation fails, a quick decision must be made regarding surgical options. In a \"cannot intubate, cannot ventilate\" situation, a surgical cricothyrotomy should be considered. When orotracheal intubation is impossible, but bag-valve or laryngeal mask ventilation is possible, an urgent surgical tracheostomy should be performed. In the long run, patients in need of longterm artificial ventilation will need a percutaneous or open tracheostomy. This review provides an update of all aspects of immediate and long-term airway management.","96":"Tracheal damage. Blunt\/penetrating trauma and inhalation injuries to the trachea can result in acute airway compromise, with life-threatening implications. Early assessment, identification, and prompt and appropriate management are of paramount importance in order to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. Signs and symptoms of these injuries are specific and sometimes subtle, and their seriousness may be obscured by other injuries. Diagnosis can therefore be challenging, requiring a high index of suspicion. Indeed, diagnosis and treatment are often delayed, resulting in attempted surgical repair months or even years after injury. Laryngoscopy, flexible and\/or rigid bronchoscopy and computed tomography of the chest are the procedures of choice for a definitive diagnosis. Airway control and appropriate ventilation represent the key aspects of emergency management. Definitive treatment depends on the site and the extent of injury. Surgery, involving primary repair with direct suture or resection and end-to-end anastomosis, is the treatment of choice for patients suffering from tracheal injuries. A conservative approach must be considered for the paediatric population and selected patients with mainly iatrogenic damage. We present a review of the incidence, mechanisms of injury, clinical presentations, diagnosis, initial airway management, anaesthetic considerations and definitive treatment in the case of tracheal damage from blunt\/penetrating trauma and inhalation injuries.","97":"Penetrating and blunt trauma to the neck: clinical presentation, assessment ana emergency management. In Belgium, and even in Western Europe, penetrating and blunt injury to the neck is relatively uncommon in both the civilian and military populations. Pre-hospital and emergency assessment and management will therefore always prove challenging, as individual exposure to this specific type of injury remains low. Historically, the neck has been divided into three anatomical zones with specific landmarks to guide the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to penetrating neck injuries. Most penetrating injuries need to be explored surgically, although with the advent of multi-detector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA), which yields high diagnostic sensitivity, this inflexible approach has recently changed to a more targeted management, based on clinical, radiographic and, if deemed necessary, endoscopic findings. However, some authors have addressed their concern about this novel, 'no-zone' approach, since the risk of missing less apparent aerodigestive tract injuries may increase. It is recommended, therefore, that all patients with penetrating neck injuries be closely observed, irrespective of the initial findings. The incidence of blunt neck injury is much lower, and this makes risk assessment and management even more difficult in comparison with penetrating injuries. Again, MDCTA is most often the first diagnostic tool if a blunt neck injury is suspected, due to its good sensitivity for blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVI) as well as for aerodigestive tract injuries. Specific patterns of injury and unexpected neurological and neuro-radiological findings in trauma patients should always warrant further investigation. Despite ongoing debate, systemic anticoagulation is recommended for most BCVI, sometimes combined with endovascular treatment. Aerodigestive tract injuries may present dramatically, but are often more subtle, making the diagnosis more difficult than other types of neck injuries. Treatment may be conservative if damage is minimal, but surgery is warranted in all other cases.","98":"Direct and indirect injuries of the pharynx and larynx. The neck is characterized by a relatively complex anatomy and a very compact content. It therefore forms an extremely vulnerable part of the human body. Although uncommon, aero-digestive tract injuries caused by trauma present a challenging situation for both the emergency doctor and the head and neck surgeon. Clinical presentations may vary from severe acute distress with immediate life-threatening airway obstruction to apparently more reassuring situations. However, the latter turn out to be frequently misleading, since patients may deteriorate suddenly as the result of unrecognized injuries. In such cases, delayed diagnosis is often associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Due to its role in phonation, breathing and alimentation, injuries to the aero-digestive tract also expose the patient to severe later impairment and a poorer quality of life. Comprehensive airway control remains the highest and often most challenging priority for the emergency physician. Careful clinical examination combined with endoscopy and computed tomography imaging form the key elements in diagnosis and early recognition of patients who may require surgical management.","99":"Long-term complications after facial trauma: literature review. In facial trauma medicine, many articles deal with necessary treatment in an acute setting to achieve the best possible functional and aesthetic outcome for the patient. It is difficult, if not impossible, to ensure long-term follow-up with these patients. Often the long-term outcome is not reported and, if so, most data are retrospective. The goal of this article is to present an overview of known data concerning complications after the initial healing processes are completed. Literature review Results: An overview of complications is presented and discussed. Comparison of results is not possible due to the large number of factors influencing outcome (age, multiple injuries, severity of trauma, etc.). Post-trauma complications are inevitable, but it is agreed that, in any case, the initial treatment of trauma is important in determining optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes. Close collaboration between different specialisms is essential to achieve good patient management, control and follow-up. Long-term post-trauma complications are inevitable, but it is important to be aware of these complications so as to provide the best possible treatment. ","100":"Post-injury smell disorders. Head trauma is the third most common aetioiogy of post-traumatic olfactory loss (PTOL). This literature review aims to report the existing knowledge surrounding this issue, exploring the current understanding of the inducing pathogenesis and the assessment and management standards from the early phases to longer-term considerations. Literature search and appraisal in PubMed on the following themes directly associated with PTOL: olfactory disorders, trauma, pathogenesis, examination, recovery and treatment. Scientific evidence was mainly available for epidemiology and exploration tools in cases suffering from PTOL. The current research into obj6ctive batteries of olfactory tests is promising. This paper highlights the importance of an adequate assessment of PTOL for an early start in olfactory training. ","101":"","102":"Traumatic CSF leaks of the anterior skull base. Skull base fractures are a frequent complication of high-impact trauma; due to the inherent anatomic relationships of the skull base, they may be associated with significant intracranial complications, including CSF leakage, and their detection is therefore important. The ethmoid roof and the cribriform plate region are the sites most vulnerable to fractures and dural tears. Rhinorrhoea is a non-specific finding; the presence of CSF in a sample must be confirmed with beta 2 transferin or beta trace protein. Accurate identification of the leakage site is necessary for a successful surgical treatment. Various modalities are available for this purpose, such as CT scan and MRI. Persistent CSF rhinorrhoea necessitates surgical intervention, due to the risk of meningitis. Continued improvements in endoscopic reconstruction techniques have led to fewer open surgeries for repair. Smaller defects can be closed with fat gasket technique or free grafts, while larger defects necessitate a multilayer closure with local vascularized flaps. These techniques have shown consistently high success rates.","103":"Facial trauma. Patients with facial trauma must be assessed in a systematic way so as to avoid missing any injury. Severe and disfiguring facial injuries can be distracting. However, clinicians must first focus on the basics of trauma care, following the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) system of care. Maxillofacial trauma occurs in a significant number of severely injured patients. Life- and sight-threatening injuries must be excluded during the primary and secondary surveys. Special attention must be paid to sight-threatening injuries in stabilized patients through early referral to an appropriate specialist or the early initiation of emergency care treatment. The gold standard for the radiographic evaluation of facial injuries is computed tomography (CT) imaging. Nasal fractures are the most frequent isolated facial fractures. Isolated nasal fractures are principally diagnosed through history and clinical examination. Closed reduction is the most frequently performed treatment for isolated nasal fractures, with a fractured nasal septum as a predictor of failure. Ear, nose and throat surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons and ophthalmologists must all develop an adequate treatment plan for patients with complex maxillofacial trauma.","104":"The organs of the ear, nose and throat (ENT) contain air- or gas-filled cavities, which make them sensitive to pressure changes. There is a specific pathophysiology involved when these structures are exposed to non-acoustic press ure changes, which are usually not traumatic in normals. The concepts of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of these traumas in an emergency setting are reviewed.","105":"Basilar skullfractures: the petrous bone. to provide suggestions for the management of three of the most dangerous or important lesions (internal carotid artery lesions, cerebrospinal fluid leaks and facial nerve paralysis) associated with the petrous part of basilar skull fractures, thereby trying to assess categories of evidence and determine strengths of recommendation. A PubMed-based literature review was carried out, as well as a consultation of online sources as encountered in the literature review. Also, a non-systematic search of chapters of well-known books dealing with the subject of temporal bone traumata was conducted. Specific levels of evidence and\/or strength of recommendation can be retrieved from the literature, but only with respect to the prophylactic use of antibiotics, the prescription of antithrombotic medications and the indications for angiography. The ample amount of available literature allows for sound management decisions, with reference made to algorithms when available in the literature. Nevertheless, for most of the management\/search questions, categories of evidence and strength of recommendation are low or lacking. ","106":"Speech-in-noise testing as a marker for noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus. Noise-induced hearing loss and tinnitus are auditory complaints that often co-occur. Often, there is no immediate indication of changes in the pure tone audiogram. Patients can still have clinically normal hearing thresholds while clearly experiencing reduced speech comprehension. This might be explained by the process of neurodegeneration of the innervated dendrites of the auditory nerve fibres and secondary degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons. Subsequent maladaptive neuronal plasticity of the central auditory system can induce tinnitus. Standard hearing testing is no longer sufficient in these patients. Therefore more complex tasks, such as speech-in-noise tests, might be valuable extensions to the standard hearing tests. We carried out a prospective investigation of the influence of tinnitus upon speech comprehension in noise and the effectiveness of speech-in-noise testing, using the Flemish version of the digit triplet test (DTT). Thirty-seven patients with mild noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus complaints and clinically normal pure tone thresholds completed the DTT and filled in two tinnitus enquiries. A statistically significant (p=0.026) correlation between the averaged high PTA, 2,z and the averaged SRT across ears on the DTT was found. There also seems to be a slight influence of tinnitus onset on the SRT score.","107":"Middle ear damages. The eardrum and middle ear are often exposed to blunt and penetrating trauma, blasts, thermal or caustic injuries. These injuries may result in tympanic membrane perforation, middle ear haemorrhage, dislocation and fracture of the ossicular chain, perilymphatic fistula and damage to the chorda tympani and\/or facial nerve. In case of life-threatening injuries and\/or mass casualty incidents, middle ear trauma obviously does not take highest priority. However, middle ear lesions should be suspected and recognized as early as possible. After meticulous history taking, physical examination consists of cranial nerve evaluation, thorough inspection of the outer ear, otoscopy and assessment of hearing and vestibular function. In the majority of cases, traumatic tympanic membrane perforations by penetrating and blunt injuries have a good prognosis with spontaneous resolution. Tympanic membrane perforations from blast trauma, thermal or caustic injuries are less likely to heal spontaneously. Perforations lasting six months after injury warrant surgery. A high resolution CT scan of the temporal bone is required in case of immediate complete facial nerve paralysis and when oval window pathology or perilymphatic fistula is suspected. Early surgical intervention is needed in case of early onset facial nerve paralysis, when there is suspicion of a perilymphatic fistula with persisting or increasing vestibular symptoms or neurosensory hearing loss and in case of vestibular dislocation of the stapes footplate. When ossicular chain damage is suspected, elective tympanoplasty is indicated. As any traumatic tympanic membrane perforation runs the risk of cholesteatoma formation, biannual follow-up during a minimum of two years is recommended.","108":"Acute external ear lesions: clinical aspects, assessment and management. We reviewed the literature concerning the assessment and the management of the external ear traumas, which is not very rich. Nevertheless, we outlined the practical attitudes in the four major conditions met: the auricular haematoma, the auricular perichondritis, the auricular laceration and auricular bums. All these pathologies must be promptly treated because there is a risk of perichondritis, which can destroy the cartilage and will result in a severely deformed ear. Auricular haematomas must be drained as soon as possible, lacerations with exposed cartilage must be stitched urgently, and burnt ears should be washed, coated with alginates (Flaminal@) and covered with a loose dressing. Antibioprophyl- axy should always be prescribed after a complete microbiological sampling.","109":"At risk populations:from children to the elderly. When considering emergencies in children and elderly people, the risks and consequences are considerably different. For example, the anatomical differences of children have direct consequences on intubation and airway physiology influences breathing, circulation and neurological outcomes.Pharmacotherapy should be adapted for children according to their differences (maturational changes) where drug metabolism and disposition is concerned and for the elderly, to geriatric pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, the existence of poly-medications and the risk of adverse drug reactions. Literature review Results: Children respond better to rapid medical care than adults. Hypoxia is dangerous for the child and is responsible for bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Hypoxia can be deleterious for elderly patients because of their fragility, e.g., less metabolic reserves, poor muscular compensation and higher risk of heart failure. It is widely accepted that children require paediatric-specific assessment\/treatment equipment and pharmacotherapy. When compared to adults, there is no difference in the Royal College of Physician guidelines for elderly people's reanimation, however, other criteria such as polypathology, co-morbidity, polypharmacy, fragility, risk of delirium, adverse drug reaction, poor outcome and quality of life should be considered. ","110":"Toxic exposure to caustics and respiratory irritants. Toxic emergencies for which the ENT physician is con- sulted mainly involve toxic exposure of the upper airway and digestive tract to caustics and respiratory irritants. The ENT physician may, however, also be involved as a first responder in the case of poisoned patients. This article therefore aims to provide a comprehensive general approach to patients with suspected poisoning and to present a more elaborate discussion on the diagnosis and management of patients following exposure to caustics and respiratory irritants. This survey, however, does not intend to be a substitute for the need for consultation with an emergency physician and a clinical toxicologist qualified in the diagnosis and treatment of poisoned patients.","111":"Management of burn wounds of the head and neck region. Management of the severely burned patient is ery often a challenge, not only due to major disturbances in anatomy and physiological processes, but also because the relatively low incidence of this pathology in both civilian and military practice results in care providers'lack of experience. The purpose of this educational document is to provide doctors confronted with these formidable trauma patients with basic management guidelines as well as some practical tips. In summary, and most importantly, these patients should be reated as any other multitrauma patient. First aid is essential and can be provided by non-medical staff. Initial medical nanagement should focus on the usual, familiar trauma algorithms of ABCDEF from the emergency management of evere burns (EMSB) manual' or the ABCDEs of the manual of advanced trauma life support (ATLS)2 or advanced burn life support (ABLS). Medical care should proceed through the following steps - Step one: establish a reliable intravenous nfusion; step two: protect the airway; step three: establish and maintain a haemodynamic state compatible with sufficient organ perfusion in order to reduce aggravation of the burn wounds and increase overall survival likelihood; step four: provide analgesia with adequate sedation and provide anaesthesia for escharotomy, fasciotomy or other surgical injuries; step five: maintain normothermia; step six: feed the patient by starting enteral nutrition as early as possible; step seven: prevent infection using antiseptic wound management, systemic antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis. All of these intricate steps require continuous reassessment and adjustment, but the existence of other wounds (blast injuries, penetrating and blunt trauma) even further complicates the management of burn casualties.","112":"ENT indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a treatment where patients breathe 100% oxygen while exposed to high environmental pressure in a hyperbaric chamber. This hyperoxygenation has several beneficial effects as an adjunctive treatment in a number of ENT-related conditions and diseases. These can be summarized as anti-ischaemic effects (delivery of oxygen to otherwise ischaemic tissues, reduction of ischaemia-reperfusion damage), anti-infectious effects (bacteriostasis, improved leucocyte phagocytosis bactericidal activity and optimization of antibiotic therapy) and wound-healing effects (stimulation of granulation tissue formation and stabilization). Since HBO therapy has a clear physiologic rationale, a demonstrated effect (although difficult to \"prove\" with placebo controlled randomized trials) in certain indications and certain side-effects, it is proposed that it should be considered an integral part of the (combined surgical and pharmacological) treatment of patients, and not simply as a supplementation of oxygen. Furthermore, the importance of a well-trained medical and technical staff to ensure proper selection and the correct follow-up of patients should not be underestimated.","113":"Facing coagulation disorders after acute trauma. Trauma is the leading cause of mortality for persons between one and 44 years of age, essentially due to bleeding complications. We screened the PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases, using specific keywords. Only publications in English were considered. The pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is complex and includes the classic \"lethal triad\" (i.e., haemodilution, acidosis, hypothermia) but may also include activation of protein C, endothelial and platelet dysfunction, and fibrinogen depletion. The time between trauma and treatment of the resultant massive bleeding should be as short as possible using techniques for rapid control of bleeding and avoiding aggravating factors (hypothermia, metabolic acidosis and hypocalcaemia). If given within three hours of injury, tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces all causes of mortality in trauma patients and reduces transfusion requirements. In a bleeding patient, crystalloids are preferred to colloids and the ratio of fresh frozen plasma to packed red blood cells should be at least 1:2. Damage control surgery (DCS) should be considered for patients who present with, or are at risk for developing, the \"lethal triad\", multiple life-threatening injuries or shock, and in mass casualty situations. DCS can also aid in the evaluation of the extent of tissue injuries and the control of haemorrhage and infection. Finally, there is currently no evidence of the added value of laboratory assays in the management of TIC. TIC appears quickly after trauma and should be anticipated and detected as soon as possible. TXA plays a central role in the management of such patients. Each institution should establish a local algorithm for the management of bleeding patients. ","114":"Protection of respiratory integrity and haemodynamic stabilization. To perform an analysis of the protection of respiratory integrity and haemodynamic stabilization based on the literature review and the experiences and perspectives of emergency and ENT specialists. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken through PubMed and MEDLINE, using the following keywords: [protection of the respiratory integrity], [intubation], [hypotension] and [haemodynamic stabilization]. Articles were selected if the topic was relevant to current ENT and emergency practice. Additional articles were identified through a careful review of reference lists in Uptodate. A critical review of ENT and emergency specialists was carried out. Evidence staging and recommendation levels were established using the Paul Shekelle scale. Firstly, protection of the airway is necessary before starting haemodynamic stabilization. Fibre-optic examination and laryngeal intubation form the gold standard of diagnosis and treatment in the protection of the airway. For circulation, a short catheter with a large size allows the management of intravenous fluids, with vasopressors if necessary. Aetiologic and specific treatments are also very important. Appropriate and collaborative management is necessary with the \"ABCDE\" approach: Airway and im- mobilization of the neck; Breathing; Circulation; Disability and Exposure. A fibre-optic examination is the gold standard of airway diagnosis. Laryngeal intubation is the most effective treatment for protection of the respiratory integrity. The management of circulation includes the implementation of a venous route to initiate administration of IVFs, preferably with isotonic saline. Vasopressors and inotropes are used as second line agents. A multidisciplinary and team approach is preferred, in order to achieve diagnosis and therapeutics simultaneously. ","115":"Pre-hospital interventions: introduction to life support systems. Crucial decisions in pre-hospital emergency care are often made; therefore, a tactical emergency medical support team (TEMS) should maintain the capacity to capture the situation instantaneously and in all circumstances. However, low exposure to severe trauma cases can be a weakness for emergency specialists, which makes pre-hospital assessment more difficult. Pre-hospital interventions (PHI) are usually classified in Western countries into BLS (basic life support) and ALS (ad- vanced life support) levels, according to the methods used. This review introduces tactical combat casualty care for medical personnel (TCCC) guidelines, designed for basic care management under fire or in a hostile environment. The phases of TCCC are: (1) care under fire (or in an unstable environment); (2) tactical field care; and (3) tactical evacuation care, and are mainly dependent on the different hazard zones (hot, warm or cold). In a mass casualty situation due to disaster or cataclysm, standardized protocol and triage are unquestionably required for identifying the environmental risks, for categorizing the casualties in accordance with medical care priorities, and for the initial management of casualty care. When considering conflict situations, or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) events, processes always start at the local level. Even before the detection and analysis of agents can be undertaken, zoning, triage, decontamination, and treatment should be initiated promptly. Otorhinolaryngologists should be aware of PHI procedures for completing preliminary assessment and management together with emergency specialists or TEMS.","116":"First-line attitudes in acute medicine. The often complex problems of the trauma and\/or severely ill patient present many challenges to front-line emergency staff. Multiple injuries and\/or systems of the body involved require careful and timely prioritization and intervention. Optimum evaluation and resuscitation involves repetitive, systematic ipproaches that are known as the \"primary\", \"secondary\" and \"tertiary\" surveys. The primary survey focuses in general on the ABCDE approach of \"Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Expoure\", and is designed to recognize and to treat immediate life-threatening conditions within the initial minutes. This primary resuscitation of non-trauma patients does not differ from the ABCDE approach used to evaluate severely traumatized patients. This approach is applicable in all clinical emergencies, whether the patient is located in the street, at home, in the emergency room, and even in the intensive care or the general wards of the hospital. This approach is widely accepted by experts, and is likely to improve outcomes by helping healthcare professionals to focus on the most life-threatening clinical problems. In an acute setting, high-quality ABCDE skills among all treating team members can save valuable time and improve team performance. The secondary and the tertiary surveys are intended to diagnose all injuries before formulating definitive management strategies. This chapter briefly describes how to perform the ABCDE approach in general, and how to conduct the secondary and the tertiary surveys. A more detailed use of this approach within a specific medical condition will be described in later chapters of this report.","117":"Emergency care in Belgium. Problems and objectives: Europe encompasses not only fifty or more different languages and cultures, but also a similar number of different systems of healthcare and medical practice. Each country has different medical traditions, different systems of professional registration and differing lists of medical specialties. Literature, Report of The European Observatory on Health Systems, as well as World Health Organization health statistics analysis Results and conclusions: In this chapter, the Belgian healthcare system will be discussed, as well as the area of emergency medicine, which is currently recognized as an independent specialty. The different stakeholders in emergency medicine will also be discussed in this chapter, and their qualifications and responsibilities will be presented. ","118":"Face and neck: airway and sensorial capacities. For the assessment and the management of face and neck trauma knowledge of the neuro-anatomy and physiology of the ear, nose, throat (ENT) and head and neck (HN) region and structures is essential, as this area is particularly vulnerable to injury. Indeed, the complex anatomy and physiology in this specific area supports important basic functions. In addition, this review elaborates on upper airway and sensorial capacities. Upper airway dimensions are influenced by bony and soft tissues. Age is of fundamental importance in the upper airway assessment, as significant differences in size and proportions apply in children and adults. The cranial nerves (CN) supply motor, sensory ad special sensory fibres to the upper airway. Injury of the CN is a frequent complication of trauma.","119":"","120":"Mucocoeles are chronic mucosa-lined retention cysts that occur due to sinus ostium obstruction and expand along the path of least resistance, most commonly involving the frontal sinus. A frontal mucocoele typically appears as a smooth and rounded expansile enlargement of a completely opacified frontal sinus, with or without thinning of the bony wall of the sinus. Here we report a rare case of isolated intracranial mucocoele that presented with posterior herniation to the anterior cranial fossa through a small bony defect on the posterior table of the frontal sinus. The findings upon imaging could easily be confused with intracranial abscess, potentially leading to craniotomy drainage. In the present case of mucocoele, the frontal intracranial lesion was completely resolved following endoscopic frontal sinusotomy.","121":"Chondroosseous respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamaroma (COREAH) is an extremely rare, developmental malformation. COREAH is characterized by a spectrum of chondro-osseous metaplasia that arise from the mesenchymal stroma, and it includes dilated submucosal glands lined with respiratory epithelium. This case report aimed to describe a COREAH that originated in the nasal cavity. A 68-year-old woman presented with unilateral nasal obstruction. Endonasal and radiological findings suggested a diagnosis of an unilateral inflammatory polyp. However, after excision of the mass with endoscopic guidance, a histological examination supported a final diagnosis of a nasal COREAH. To our knowledge, this was the first description of a COREAH that originated from the middle turbinate and presented as a choanal polyp. The role of the pathologist is essential for a correct diagnosis. ","122":"Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve (XII) paresis has never been reported as the first and only complication of malignant otitis external (MOE). A 73-year-old diabetic male with persistent left temporomandibular joint ache and ear fullness was admitted with the diagnosis of MOE. He received intravenous ciprofloxacin for 14 days and then continued with oral administration (per os). After two months, he returned with otalgia, swallowing difficulty, and ipsilateral XII paresis. He was re-admitted, received intravenous ciprofloxacin for 6 weeks, and continued with per os ciprofloxacin for 6 months. A Ga67-scan 6 months after the first admission revealed no active infection. Two years after his last admission, the patient still has XII paresis. There is no other cranial nerve involvement and inflammatory markers continue to be normal. Doctors should consider MOE in the differential diagnosis when there is XII paresis, especially in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. ","123":"We evaluated a novel treatment for glottic insufficiency involving the injection of autologous material with direct glottic visualisation in an outpatient setting. Three patients with vocal cord palsy underwent laryngoplasty under local anaesthesia using only a flexible endoscope with a working canal for Microfractured Fat Fibre-endoscopic Injection (MFFI). Adipose tissue was processed using the Lipogems device, which allows optimal purity, fluidity, and mesenchymal stem cell content in the resultant emulsion. According to the preliminary data, MFFI was well tolerated and no complications were observed. During the 12-month follow-up period, voice improvement was constant in all three patients, hinting at the stem cell-related regenerative potential of the procedure. MFFI was proven to be a useful and straightforward tool, combining all of the relevant advantages of other known treatments for glottic insufficiency, and is an efficacious and innovative treatment that can be performed on an outpatient basis using only autologous material. ","124":null,"125":"The present study aimed to compare the effects of sevoflurane (a commonly used inhalation anesthetic) and intravenous propofol on middle ear pressure (MEP) and determine the more appropriate option for middle ear operations. Fifty-seven American Society of Anesthesiologists risk class I-II patients aged 18-65 years who were not scheduled for ear or tympanic membrane operations were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups using the sealed envelope method. Propofol (0.2-0.5 mg\/kg; Group P) and sevoflurane (1-2%; Group S) were used to maintain anesthesia. Baseline tympanometry was conducted on both ears and recorded before anesthesia was induced. Four additional measurements were performed and recorded at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after induction. All post-induction MEP values were significantly higher than baseline measurements in Group S (P &lt; 0.05 for all); there were no differences between post-induction and baseline measurements in Group P. At 10, 15, and 30 min post-induction, MEP values were significantly higher in Group S than in Group P (P &lt; 0.05). Sevoflurane increased MEP values significantly compared with propofol anesthesia. We conclude that propofol can be used more reliably than sevoflurane in middle ear operations.","126":"To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In this retrospective study, 483 patients with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was performed. With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the viruses studied, compared to the control group. BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis. ","127":"Very few studies have investigated the risk of ischemic stroke after an episode of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), and findings have been controversial. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke among SSNHL patients within the province of Ferrara and compare the findings with data available in the literature. This was a cohort study using hospital discharge records. The observation period was from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2012. The study cohort consists of all adult patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of SSNHL (n = 484) and all adult patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke (n = 9985) among the resident population of the province of Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. We calculated the incidence of SSNHL and ischemic stroke, as well as the incidence of ischemic stroke within the group of patients who experienced SSNHL. During the period 2001-2012 in Ferrara, the average annual crude incidence of SSNHL was 11.4\/100,000 (95% CI 10.4-12.4), while the average annual crude incidence of the first ischemic stroke was 235.3\/100,000. During the mean observation time period of 6 years, the expected and observed cases of ischemic stroke among the 484 patients with SSNHL did not differ significantly (6.8 expected vs. 9 observed [95% Poisson Confidence Interval 4.11-17.08]). Our findings suggest that SSNHL does not significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. ","128":"To evaluate the prognostic significance of the duration of disease in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We studied all patients with idiopathic BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal who were treated during 3 consecutive years, divided into 2 groups: those with recent disease onset (within 4 weeks) and those with more remote disease onset. Outcome of treatment by repositioning maneuver and rate of recurrence were compared. 110 patients had BPPV of recent onset and 121 of more remote onset (mean ages 51.3 and 58.2, respectively). Treatment outcomes were similar in both groups, but the rate of recurrence was higher in patients with BPPV of longer duration (21.5% versus 10%). Long duration of the disease does not affect the treatment outcome in patients with idiopathic BPPV, but is correlated with increased rate of recurrence. Older age of these patients is probably a contributing factor for recurrence. ","129":"The olivocochlear reflex strength can be measured using contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS) of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEAOEs). The efferent suppression (ES) thus reflects the functional intactness of the efferent auditory system. In patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS), the results of ES are unclear. This cross-sectional study evaluated click and noise intensity conditions for measuring ES using CAS of TEOAEs in nine patients with unilateral VS and in gender-, age- and ear side-matched control subjects. Two optimal click and noise intensity level combinations were identified. This pilot study compared the amount of ES between tumour and non-tumour ears versus control ears in patients with unilateral VS, but there were no statistically significant differences. Future studies should include a larger population of unilateral VS patients with different grades of hearing loss. ","130":"To analyze changes in bone conduction (BC) thresholds before and after stapedotomy in patients with clinical otosclerosis with a focus on the Carhart notch, which is defined as a significant loss of BC at a certain audiometric frequency. Retrospective case review of pure tone audiometry (PTA) in 213 patients who underwent a stapedotomy at a tertiary referral center between 2004 and 2011. The patients were grouped by age and the frequency of the Carhart notch. The non-operated ear was also evaluated. The Carhart notch was present on pre-operative audiometry in 158 (74%) patients at 0.5 (n = 18, 8.45%), 1 (n = 25, 11.70%), or 2 kHz (n = 115, 54.0%). We measured a mean postoperative improvement in BC of 7.5, 8.4, and 8.8 dB HL. Pre-operatively, 55 (25.8%) patients did not exhibit a typical notch configuration. The mean gain in BC, defined on PTA according to the AAO-HNS criteria (0.5, 1, 2 and 3, or 4 kHz), was 1.8 dB HL after stapedotomy. The Carhart notch was not solely related to the 2 kHz frequency. The greatest gain in BC after stapedotomy for otosclerosis occurred at the notch frequency. ","131":"Cleft lip and\/or palate (CL\/P) is one of the most frequent congenital malformations, with a frequency of 1 in 700 live births. Non-syndromic orofacial clefting is a multifactorial condition, with both a genetic and an environmental component. Although numerous studies have been published addressing the genetic etiology of CL\/P, this factor remains incompletely understood. A promising approach to find candidate gene regions for CL\/P is the investigation of endophenotypes, which are characteristics associated with a certain condition and that can be an expression of underlying susceptibility genes. This review focuses on the known facial endophenotypes in CL\/P (such as distortion of the orbicularis oris muscle and facial features in non-affected relatives of patients with CL\/P) and genes that could be associated with these characteristics. Possibilities for further endophenotype-related studies in the field of non-syndromic CL\/P are discussed.","132":"Patients with head and neck cancer are willing to undergo aggressive treatments and accept alterations in quality of life to attain recovery or to prolong their life. It is unclear how physicians perceive alterations in quality of life. This study examined whether physicians considered changes in quality of life when selecting a treatment for head and neck cancer. A large, Belgian, general practitioner population received a questionnaire in the mail requesting their opinions on quality of life for patients with cancer. They assessed the impacts of symptoms, treatments, and side effects. 506 responses were received and evaluated. A majority of physicians (85.7%) thought that quality of life must be considered when selecting a treatment, even when it represented lower chance of survival. Moreover, 82.4% felt that proposing no treatment was justified when treatment caused impaired quality of life. Most physicians thought that the quality of life was worse for patients with cancer in the head and neck than for patients with cancer in any other location. Moreover, most physicians thought that the patient (98.2%) and the family doctor (89%) should participate in selecting the treatment. The symptoms that ranked highest for impacting quality of life were pain and breathing quality, followed by feeding requirements, voice quality, and physical appearance. Radiotherapy was thought to offer the best quality of life. Physicians considered quality of life a very important factor in treating patients with head and neck cancer. This medical perception strongly influences the choice of treatment. ","133":"The superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator (SCIP) flap, which is the most recent advance in free flap surgery, is described as an evolution of the conventional free groin flap. It has been applied to limb and penile reconstruction. The SCIP flap is versatile and has many advantages, but there are few reports on the application of the SCIP flap to head and neck defects. We used a SCIP flap for reconstruction after resection of an oral malignant tumor in two women, aged 43 and 55 years, who presented between 2010 and 2012 with squamous cell carcinoma of the right floor of the mouth and tongue. After resection, the SCIP flap was elevated and used to reconstruct the defect Both flaps survived well. We confirmed that the SCIP flap is an ideal thin, pliable, and reliable skin flap for reconstructing intra-oral soft-tissue defects with minimal donor-site morbidity. ","134":"Lipoid proteinosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyalin deposits in the skin and mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract; currently, no treatment exists. Nearly all patients experience hoarseness and speech difficulties, due to hyalin deposition in the vocal folds and diminished mobility in infiltrated lips, tongue, and palate. We describe a patient with extensive hyalin plaques on the vocal folds, which resulted in near-aphonic hoarseness. Hyalin deposits in the vocal folds and skin were treated with laser resection. Both the vocal folds and skin improved in appearance, with smoother surface epithelium. However, the patient's speech remained impaired, due to extensive hyalin plaques in the mouth, tongue, and lips. The voice improved only temporarily. Laser resection of hyalin plaques in the vocal folds and skin is a feasible treatment for lipoid proteinosis. However, speech may remain severely limited, due to impaired tongue and lip movement. ","135":"Inflammatory pseudotumours of the paranasal sinuses are rare entities and can be easily confused with aggressive malignant tumours. In this report we describe the characteristic behavior of inflammatory pseudotumours in the maxillary sinus. We present a case of a 47-year-old Caucasian woman, who presented in our ENT department because of progressive nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and epiphora. The clinical as well as the radiological findings suggested a maxillary sinus neoplasm, most probably of malignant nature. The histopathological examination showed an inflammatory pseudotumour of the maxillary sinus with polypoid structure and no signs of malignancy.","136":"Schwannomas (neurilemmomas) are benign primary tumours that arise from Schwann cells. Schwannomas arising from the nasal septum are exceptionally rare. Here, we report a unique case of schwannoma of the nasal septum presenting as a multicentric neuronal tumour. A 40-year old male sustained intermittent left tinnitus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed masses near the nasal septum and upper cervical cord in addition to a tumour in the left cerebellopontine (CP) angle. The tumour in the nasal septum was completely resected by endoscopic endonasal surgery and diagnosed as a typical schwannoma. The CP angle tumour was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, while the asymptomatic cord lesion showed no significant growth and remains under observation. Endoscopic endonasal surgery is useful for the resection of schwannomas of the nasal septum. Schwannomas of the nasal septum may present as multiple neuronal tumours. ","137":"To determine whether osteitis is associated with primary and revision surgery in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and to determine its relationship with mucosal inflammation. Patients were divided into two groups based on a history of prior endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). The primary surgery group included 74 patients who had ESS for the first time, and the revision surgery included 37 patients who had repeat ESS. Histopathological examinations were performed on specimens taken from the bony septa of the ethmoid with the overlying mucosa. The incidence of osteitis was 70.3% in patients in the revision surgery group and 56.8% in patients in the primary surgery group (p = 0.229). Osteitis was associated with tissue eosinophilia and a predominance of inflammatory cells (p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). Surgery may not be the primary cause of bone remodeling in the sinus area. Mucosal inflammation had no effect on the incidence of osteitis when it was associated with tissue eosinophilia in CRS. Patients with osteitis may benefit most from postoperative corticosteroid therapy to prevent further recurrence. ","138":"This study investigated changes in patient nasal and conjunctival flora one year after endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (EDSR). The prospective study included 20 patients that underwent EDSR due to chronic dacryocystitis. Conjunctival and nasal cultures were obtained one year after EDSR from both study and control groups. Patient characteristics, chronic illnesses, the severity and duration of complaints, culture results, and the stent removal time were recorded and analyzed. In the study group, the most commonly isolated microorganism in the nasal cultures was coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n = 11), and the second most commonly isolated microorganism was Staphylococcus aureus (n = 7). A total of 11 (55%) of the nasal cultures in the study group showed the presence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, as did 2 (10%) of the nasal cultures in the control group (p = 0.007). One year after EDSR surgery with silicon stent placement, we detected changes in the nasal flora in the operated side compared with the non-operated side. Even though more than half of the nasal cultures in the study group were positive for MDR bacteria, these microorganisms did not cause attacks of dacryocystitis or affect surgical success. ","139":"Our main objective was to investigate the effect of preoperative oral steroids on intraoperative bleeding and quality of the surgical field during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Our second objective was to determine whether the osteitis score could be used to predict the volume of intraoperative bleeding. This double-blinded, randomized trial included 65 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The corticosteroid group received oral prednisolone (1 mg\/kg), administered to patients once daily for 2 days and then tapered down, with treatment completed on the day 10. The control group received placebo before the operation. Endoscopic exams were recorded, and preoperative sinus computed tomography scans were scored. Intraoperative blood loss was recorded. Quality of the surgical field was assessed by the surgeon, using a linear scale from 1 to 10. The mean bleeding volume was 239 ml in the corticosteroid group and 203 ml in control group. There was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.495). Surgical field quality scores were higher in the corticosteroid group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.36). There was no statistically significant relationship between the bleeding volume and Kennedy Osteitis Scores in corticosteroid group (r = 0.225, p = 0.186) and control group (r = 0.084, p = 0.663). Our findings suggest that using oral corticosteroids, which have rare but serious side effects, is not necessary in the preoperative period. Furthermore, we found that the radiological osteitis score was not a suitable marker for predicting intraoperative bleeding volumes. ","140":null,"141":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term surgical outcomes and recurrence rates of three surgical techniques that are commonly used for cholesteatoma. The hospital records of 132 patients with primary cholesteatoma who underwent surgery between January 1996 and December 2006 were evaluated retrospectively. Twelve cases had bilateral disease, and a total of 144 ears were treated. The patients were divided into three groups according to surgical technique: modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) (n = 48 ears), radical mastoidectomy (RM) (n = 42 ears), and intact canal wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) (n = 54 ears). MRM and RM procedures are canal wall down (CWD) techniques, whereas the ICWM procedure is a canal wall up (CWU) technique. Postoperatively, all patients were followed up yearly for at least 6 years. The otomicroscopic features, cholesteatoma extension, surgical findings, and recurrence rates were compared in the groups. Preoperative otomicroscopic examination showed attic retraction or perforation in 32% of the cases and central perforation in 11%. There was a higher cholesteatoma recurrence rate in the ICWM group than in the MRM and RM groups (p &lt; 0.05), but there was also better hearing gain in the ICWM group (p &lt; 0.05). There are several surgical techniques for eradicating cholesteatoma. Our study found that CWD procedures (RM, MRM) were more effective for the eradication of cholesteatoma, but hearing gain was better when a CWU technique was used. The choice of surgical technique should be individually tailored based on the pre-operative imaging and hearing examination findings.

A total of 166 patients with complete medical records who underwent total laryngectomy (TL) due to laryngeal cancer were analysed retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 57.4 (+ 19.6) years. This study looked at a total of 32 different parameters considered to be effective in the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula after total laryngectomy. Thirty-two patients (19.2%) had a pharyngocutaneous fistula. Aged over 61 years (p = 0.003), Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (p = 0.002), alcohol use (p = 0.006), history of preoperative radiotherapy (p = 0.001), preoperative tracheotomy (p = 0.017), postoperative low levels of haemoglobin (Hb) (p = 0.029), low levels of preoperative albumin (p = 0.001), total protein and a low alb\/glb (albumin\/globulin) ratio (p = 0.001), serum prealbumin levels on the third and seventh postoperative days (p = 0.001), high postoperative CRP levels (p = 0.002), T4 stage (extralaryngeal) and presence of transglottic lesion (p = 0.003), presence of stage IV (p = 0.012) lesion, primary surgery accompanied by bilateral neck dissection (p = 0.047), T-shaped oesophagus suture, postoperative bleeding (p = 0.07), presence of postoperative fever (p = 0.001), presence of skin defect in the anterior neck (p = 0.001) and presence of postoperative depression (p = 0.001) were found to be statistically significant factors in the development of PCF. Our study found many parameters associated with an increased risk of the development of PCF. According to the multivariate regression analysis, aged over 61 years, DM, preoperative RT, preoperative tracheostomy, postoperative Hb under 10 g\/dl, prealbumin under 17 mg\/dl on the third postoperative day, and a postoperative fever of 38.3 degrees C and above were found be associated with a higher risk of the development of fistulae more than the other risk factors. ","144":null,"145":"A worldwide rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer has been recorded over the past decade. This rise has been attributed to an increase in oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) infections. The biology of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is distinct; it includes p53 degradation, retinoblastoma pathway inactivation, and p16 upregulation. The best method for detecting HPV in tumour material is controversial; both in-situ hybridisation and PCR are commonly used. However, p16 can serve as a potential surrogate marker, and therefore, p16 immunohistochemistry is widely used in clinical practice. Compared to HPV-negative cancers, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer appears to be more responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus, p16 can serve as a prognostic marker for enhanced overall survival and disease-free survival. In this review, we aimed to highlight the current understanding of the epidemiology, biology, detection, and management of HPV-related oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","146":"Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis of the nose: a case report. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that is rarely seen in Belgium. The majority of new diagnoses are seen in patients living in or visiting endemic regions, which are mostly developing countries. Here we describe the case of a 60-year-old male patient who was referred to an ENT specialist because of an erythematous swelling of the left side of the nose tip, which had persisted for 3 months. Biopsies showed the presence of leishmaniasis. This case report alerts ENT physicians that leishmaniasis is part of the differential diagnosis in patients who present with an uncommon persistent lesion in the head and neck region and who have travelled to endemic regions or are immunodeficient.","147":"The paranasal sinuses are rarely the site of malignancy, especially non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In such cases, the ethmoid sinus is the second most frequently involved paranasal sinus. Diagnosis of these malignancies is difficult because the early symptoms often mimic benign sinus pathology. Thus, most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and their prognosis is poor. Here we describe the case of a 58-year-old man with a secondary high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the ethmoid sinus. This malignancy was diagnosed two years after the patient had received treatment with temozolomide for a glioblastoma multiforme. This case highlights that malignant tumours of the paranasal sinuses should always be included in the differential diagnosis of sinus disease. Additionally, patients treated with temozolomide should receive regular follow-up care including vigilant evaluation for secondary tumours, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","148":"Wegener granulomatosis (WG) or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a multi-system necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis that classically affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. We report the unusual clinical course of a patient with WG, and we present a literature review on the association between WG and vertigo. In our case, a 56-year-old female presented with a several-month history of chronic sinusitis and otalgia that was refractory to all initiated outpatient therapies. During hospitalization, a diagnostic evaluation revealed serious nasal crusting, chronic otitis media, and hematuria. Serologic testing showed elevated anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCAs). The tentative diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis was confirmed by renal biopsy. Upon admission, the patient developed an acute vertigo with nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting, accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss in one ear. Vestibular symptoms may be associated with Wegener granulomatosis. ","149":"We present the case of a 79 year-old patient with megaesophagus and aphagia, who required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. Megaesophagus was considered the sole cause of aphagia by the referring secondary hospital. Solid state sensor videofluoromanometry (VFM) showed a substantial decrease in manometric values within the hypopharynx along with good relaxation of the upper-esophageal sphincter (UES). This led to electromyography (EMG), which showed features compatible with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG). The diagnosis of MG was confirmed by an intravenous injection of edrophonium chloride, performed under VFM monitoring. The co-existence of MG and megaesophagus rarely occurs in humans; although, most small animals, such as dogs, cats, and rodents, present with megaesophagus as an initial symptom of MG.","150":"Laser-assisted lithotripsy under sialendoscopy has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional sialendoscopic lithotripsy when facing salivary stones. In this preliminary study, we report our experience with Holmium:YAG laser-assisted lithotripsy. Data from 11 Asian patients receiving sialendoscopies for laser-assisted lithotripsy performed in our department from August 2013 to June 2014 were recorded and reviewed. A total of 18 procedures were performed in 11 Taiwanese patients with symptoms of obstructive sialoadenitis who were diagnosed with sialolithiasis. The sizes of the stones ranged between 3 mm and 13 mm. The endoscopic lithotomy procedures were performed in all 11 patients, and stone fragmentation with the Holmium:YAG laser was done successfully in all patients. All patients were followed for a minimum of 3 months, and there was no evidence of complications or recurrences over the follow up period. The Holmium:YAG laser allowed successful fragmentation of stones in all 11 patients. Our experience with this procedure supports the use of Holmium:YAG laser-assisted lithotripsy through sialendoscopy in Asian patients. ","151":"Free flap reconstruction of head and neck defects is a rapidly changing field. We present a case series in this field in which we critically assess our survival rates and complications, and we highlight specific technical variables that may be associated with improved outcomes. This case series from a tertiary medical centre comprises 100 consecutive head and neck microvascular free flap reconstructions. Medical notes were reviewed specifically for indications, adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, complications, and outcome of the free flap. The overall flap survival rate was 99%, with a 6% return-to-theatre rate. Three cases had a general complication in the form of a non-flap compromising haematoma that necessitated a return to theatre for an evacuation. Specific microvascular anastomosis-related complication rate was 2% requiring salvage revision. One flap was lost due to infection. Of the 100 cases, 87% were fasciocutaneous free flaps, 7% were musculocutaneous, 5% were osseocutaneous, and one was a skin\/cartilage free flap. With regard to indications for reconstruction, oncological resection accounted for 86% of cases; a total of 12% had mandibular bone involvement that required osseocutaneous reconstruction. We have highlighted specific technical steps we used that may have contributed to our positive results. Moreover, we encourage the use of standardised postoperative monitoring guidelines for all multidisciplinary surgical teams involved in head and neck patients; they facilitate communication and increase early detection of complications, permitting timely intervention, which may be critical for flap survival. ","152":"We present the case of an individual with congenital prosopagnosia or \"face blindness\", a disorder where the ability to recognize faces is impaired. We studied the lip-reading ability and audiovisual perception of this subject using a DVD with four conditions (audiovisual congruent, auditory, visual, and audiovisual incongruent) and compared results with a normal patient cohort. The patient had no correct responses in the visual lip-reading task; whereas, he improved in the audiovisual congruent task. In the audiovisual incongruent task, the patient provided one response; thus, he was able to lip-read. (He was able to use lip-reading\/to use labial informations) This patient perceived only global dynamic facial movements, not the fine ones. He had a sufficient complementary use of lip-reading in audiovisual tasks, but not visual ones. These data are consistent with abnormal development of the pathways used for visual speech perception and associated with second-order face processing disorders and normal development of the audiovisual network for speech perception.","153":"To investigate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a salvage treatment for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL). Fifteen patients affected by sudden hearing loss and treated with hyperbaric oxygen after steroid and vasodilator therapy failed constituted the study group. A control group of 30 patients who were treated with steroids and vasodilator alone was also included. Hyperbaric oxygen was administered once daily for 15 sessions at a constant pressure of 2.2 atmospheres. Pure-tone hearing thresholds were obtained for both groups before and after each treatment and frequency-specific thresholds 3 months after the end of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Salvage hyperbaric oxygen therapy was performed with a mean delay of 24 days from the onset of SSHL. The overall rate of hearing improvement was higher in the study group (7\/15 cases, 46.6%) compared with the control group (4\/30 cases, 13.3%). The mean pure-tone hearing average thresholds after salvage treatment in the study group was 53.4 dB HL (mean gain, 12.1 dB HL), which was significantly lower than that in the control group of 67.9 dB HL (mean gain, 2.7 dB HL). Hearing recovery was found to be better at low frequencies (250-500 Hz). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be suggested to all patients for whom initial conventional medical treatment for SSHL has failed.

Records were reviewed from all patients attending a single teaching hospital A&amp;E department between 1st January 2010 and 11st February 2011 with a diagnosis of epistaxis. Patients were analysed according to their admission serum urea and creatinine levels and then grouped according to clinical outcome. We identified 278 patients (145 males, 133 females), 82 of which required hospital admission. Eleven required blood transfusion, and five required surgical arrest of the haemorrhage. No patients died. Serum urea and creatinine levels were measured in 119\/278 patients. The mean serum urea level was significantly higher in patients admitted for further management of epistaxis than in patients who were discharged from the A&amp;E department (9.35 mmol\/l vs. 6.74 mmol\/l, respectively; p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in mean serum urea levels between patients who were transfused and patients who were not, or between patients who went to the operating theatre and patients who did not. Elevated serum urea levels on hospital admission are related to more severe clinical outcome in epistaxis.

Observational, non-interventional studies can provide valuable data, supplementing findings from double-blind trials, on the true value of a drug therapy in daily practice. Rupatadine is a new, second-generation, selective oral H1-antihistamine. The primary objective of.this study was to evaluate the evolution of quality of life in patients treated with rupatadine in clinical practice. The impact of rupatadine on the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms, the subject's evaluation of the treatment, and the safety of rupatadine were also evaluated. This prospective, non-interventional, observational, multicenter study included 2,838 adults aged over 18 years. The diagnosis of moderate to severe allergic rhinitis was confirmed. Patients were assessed with validated scales at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment with rupatadine (10 mg, once daily). All outcome parameters improved significantly: mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (mini- RQLQ, p &lt; 0.001), total 5-symptom score (T5SS) severity (p &lt; 0.001), visual analog scale (VAS) of symptom severity (p &lt; 0.001), and the allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) severity classification (p &lt; 0.001). Compliance was very good in 72.2% of patients, and only a few minor adverse effects were reported. The therapeutic responses, evaluated by the patients, were complete relief in 21% and strong relief in 62%. This study, which included a wide cohort of allergic-rhinitis patients, confirmed the clinical benefit of rupatadine when prescribed in clinical practice, even for the most severe symptoms, including nasal congestion. ","158":"After failure of pharmacological treatment, sinus surgery is the recommended alternative treatment for chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. During post-operative healing, adequate local neutrophil activation plays an important role in the repair process. This pilot study aimed to systematically explore the participation of circulating neutrophils in early-phase wound repair of the nasal and paranasal mucosa after sinus surgery, with a special focus on neutrophil recruitment and activation patterns. We conducted a single-center outcome study of patients undergoing sinus surgery. Whole blood samples were collected from eleven patients before surgery and at post-surgical time points of 1 hour and 1, 7, 14, and 30 days. Hematological analysis was conducted to count circulating neutrophils and evaluate their overall activation status. Using flow cytometry, neutrophil expression of membrane CD11b, CD11c, and CD15 was also measured, and oxidative burst analysis was performed. After sinus surgery, neutrophilia increased by 1 hour after surgery, reached a maximum at Day 1, and showed a gradual return toward baseline by Day 30. The oxidative burst initially decreased during the first hours after surgery, increased at Day 14, and returned toward normal by Day 30. Lewis X factor and the expression of CD11b and CD11c exhibited a bimodal change over time, in an inverted phase compared to the oxidative reaction. Circulating neutrophils are involved in the first phase of wound healing after sinus surgery as indicated by increased abundance, early membrane changes, and the modulation of their oxidative capacities. ","159":"A 58-year-old man presented with transient vertigo and pulsatile tinnitus. High-resolution computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, excision, and subsequent immunohistochemical assays were performed. Imaging showed a soft tissue mass in the epitympanum and mastoid with bone erosion of the tegmen tympani and a dural tail sign, suggesting meningioma. Subsequently, because of signs of clinical progression, a canal-wall-up attico-antromastoidectomy was performed, with near-complete removal of a granulomatous, ossifying, haemorrhagic mass. Radiological imaging was critical in determining the extent of the mass and excluding other pathologies. Due to the atypical clinical and radiological signs, the final diagnosis of capillary haemangioma of the middle ear and temporal bone was made only after surgical resection and histopathological examination with immunohistochemistry, which excluded meningioma. The contiguous occurrence of cutaneous capillary haemangioma of the lateral face and neck was an important clue to the diagnosis. ","160":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is characterized by vasculitis of small and medium sized vessels and non-caseating granulomas with head and neck symptoms in 95% of those affected. Cranial nerve palsies are rare; while, chronic rhinosinusitis and ear problems are common. We describe the serious course and the diagnostic challenge of a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis of bilateral mastoids and the right temporal lobe. Initially, the patient showed metachronous bilateral facial palsy with chronic mastoiditis. Repeated surgeries and rheumatologic examinations did not determine a diagnosis. The patient developed additional cranial nerve palsies. Due to progression into the temporal lobe, we removed the affected parts. After 6 months, the diagnosis was revealed by histology. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a diagnostic challenge. Persistent reevaluations were necessary for a final diagnosis and to limit the life-threatening disease. Once diagnosed, therapy began with the standard FAUCI-Scheme.

We report a case of nasopharynx REAH mimicking a malignant tumour with incidental high 18-FDG uptake in a patient with colon cancer. Less than five similar cases have been reported to date, and this is the first case of REAH to show high uptake on PET\/CT scans. Although hamartoma arising from the nasopharynx region is very rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis because it is a benign lesion and complete surgical resection is curative.","162":"Here we report a case of a mucocele of the nasal septum diagnosed by MRI and cone beam CT (CBCT) 23 years after Ogston Luc surgery. A 49-year-old man with nasal obstruction was examined by endoscopy, MRI, and CBCT. Endoscopy showed a smooth and soft septum swelling. MRI revealed an ovalar lesion with high-intensity content on both T1 and T2 images, and a peripheral enhancing rim after i.v. administration of contrast medium. CBCT revealed that the lesion was located in the posterior portion of the septum involving the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and destroying the anterior ethmoid cells on the left side but sparing the left lamina papyracea. The patient underwent endoscopic marsupialization of the lesion. A mucocele of the nasal septum is a rare occurrence. MRI and CBCT are effective and affordable diagnostic tools for this condition, enabling differentiation of mucocele from other sinonasal diseases.

The appearance of the face must be considered as a whole to achieve the best results, but assessment of the chin is often overlooked. The aim of this paper was to determine the need for mentoplasty after rhinoplasty. Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) was used to analyze 200 consecutive rhinoplasty patients, 170 of whom were included in this study. We used Silver and Agarwal's method for assessment of the chin. A total of 170 profile photographs were analyzed. Of these patients, 58.2% (n = 99) had normal chins, 40% (n = 68) had small chins (microgenia), and 1.8% (n = 3) had over-projection. There were no statistically significant differences between men and women. Chin projection is an important component of facial euphony. Approximately half of the rhinoplasty patients we assessed would also benefit from mentoplasty. Surgeons that perform rhinoplasty should discuss mentoplasty with their patients to achieve the best results. ","164":"Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) significantly reduces the quality of life (QoL). While intensive research has focused on the QoL in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, data regarding the impact of ARS on the QoL are relatively sparse. The aim of this study was to construct and validate a simple, reliable QoL questionnaire for ARS patients, which is also one of the priorities set for EPOS 2012. The questionnaire was constructed as follows: a review of literature, collection of symptoms as well as social and emotional consequences by a panel of ENT specialists and general practitioners, interviews with patients experiencing ARS, and a pre-test with another patient group. The questionnaire was validated by determining its internal reliability, discriminant validity, and responsiveness. The survey was given to 50 ARS patients at the time of diagnosis and again 14 days after treatment. The ARS diagnosis was established using the EPOS 12 criteria. The control group consisted of 50 medical students without any sinonasal symptoms. We developed a 13-item questionnaire, called the MARS (Measurement of Acute Rhinosinusitis). Cronbach's alpha was determined to be 0.679. The two-tailed t-test showed a statistically significant difference between the patient group and the control group (p = 0.0000). The SRM coefficient was 1.781. The MARS questionnaire is a QoL instrument developed and validated especially for patients with ARS. This survey demonstrated good internal consistency and excellent discriminant validity, responsiveness, and feasibility for use in daily clinical practice and research. ","165":"To determine the effectiveness of short-term glucocorticoid therapy on nasal polyposis. A total of 60 patients with sinonasal polyposis were given oral glucocorticoid therapy (1 mg\/kg) for 20 days. Patient symptoms were evaluated with the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20). Computerized tomography (CT) images of the paranasal sinus were acquired before and after treatment and were evaluated with the Kennedy scoring system. Evaluation of paranasal CTs showed complete disease resolution in 15 patients and partial disease resolution in 25 patients. Patients with complete and partial resolutions,based on CT images, exhibited significant decreases in disease stages. Statistical analysis revealed a significant change in the SNOT-20 results (P &lt; 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences among the evaluations based on the paranasal sinus CTs, the SNOT-20, and the SNOT-20 combined with a subjective selection of the five most disturbing symptoms (SNOT-20(+5)) (P &gt; 0.05).

Although it is often the result of extensive trauma, rhabdomyolysis may also appear as a rare and serious complication during the postoperative period. Postoperative rhabdomyolysis is a rare but serious complication. Early diagnosis of postoperative rhabdomyolysis is based on laboratory tests and clinical examination. Renal hyperperfusion with hydration and diuretics may prevent a nephrotoxic reaction. We describe two recent cases in patients undergoing head and neck surgery. Between 2007 and 2010, 22 patients with advanced pharyngo laryngeal cancer were treated. Patients records were retrospectively analyzed for preoperative, operative, postoperative, and convalescence data. Demographics, co-morbidities, duration of operation, and postoperative creatine kinase (CK) levels were evaluated. All patients (n = 20 men; n = 2 women) underwent (pharyngo)laryngectomy to treat advanced (stage T4) head and neck tumors. The mean surgical procedure time among these patients was 6.4 h. (range 5.0 to 7.5 h.). The mean peak serum CK was 1725 U\/L (range 456 to 3745 U\/L). The mean rise of CK level was 268 U\/L, in affected patients ranged from 2636 to 3745 U\/L. Rhabdomyolysis occurred in two patients, presenting as excessive, immediate postoperative muscular pain in the \"downside\" hip\/flank. These two patients experienced acute renal failure with an average peak CK of 2700 U\/L. Bicarbonate alkalinization and diuretic administration were initiated at a mean of 24 h. (range, 4 to 48 h.). One patient required hemodialysis for 1 month postoperatively, but had stable serum within 2 months. Patients did not experience extended recovery. Early recognition and aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids and diuresis may prevent the development of acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis causing acute renal failure is a rare but serious postoperative complication. Adequate prevention in high-risk patients, early diagnosis and, aggressive treatment are the keys to a successful recovery.

However, acute suppurative parotitis with abscess formation is less common and possibly complicated by deep neck space infection and sepsis. Our aim was to analyze the clinical features, radiological findings, treatment modalities, and microbiology of parotid abscesses treated at a regional hospital in Taiwan over a 15-year period. Records from patients diagnosed with acute suppurative parotitis or parotid abscesses between January 1998 and December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Parotid abscesses were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) examinations. Fourteen patients (9 males; mean age+standard deviation, 49.6 +\/- 14.4 [range, 22-75] years) with parotid abscesses were included. Painful swelling at the angle of the jaw was the most common symptom. All patients sustained unilateral parotid abscesses, with left-sided lesions in 10 patients, and right-sided ones in 4 patients. Radiographically, 13 of 14 abscess lesions were located in the superficial lobe, and 1 was in the deep lobe of the parotid gland. Besides sufficient fluid hydration, maintenance of good oral hygiene, and administration of parenteral antibiotics, all patients were treated with surgical incision and drainage. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the organism most commonly isolated from abscess cultures. Parotid abscesses were found in about one fifth of patients with acute infectious parotid disease. Parenteral antibiotics plus surgical incision and drainage was the treatment of choice. ","174":"A 55-year-old woman was operated in the lateral park bench position with significant neck flexion and oral packing. Macroglossia was noticed immediately postoperatively after endotracheal extubation. The patient was reintubated for 13 days and subsequently required a tracheostoma. After the placement of the tracheostoma and the removal of the endotracheal tube, the congestion of the tongue decreased markedly within 24 hours. Macroglossia is a rare complication following posterior fossa procedures with few cases reported so far. It can cause airway obstruction, which could be a life-threatening complication, and it therefore requires prompt treatment. The aetiology of postoperative macroglossia remains uncertain and has been attributed to arterial, venous and lymphatic compression, mechanical compression, or neurogenic causes. This article describes new insights into aetiology and also describes preventive measures and possible treatment.","175":"Carcinoid tumours are rare, particularly in the head and neck region. When occurring in this area, they mainly affect the larynx. The first case of primary well-differentiated carcinoid tumour arising from the nasopharynx was documented in 2009 and treated by combined external beam radiation and cold somatostatin analogue with a fatal outcome. To our knowledge, no case of this type of lesion has been successfully treated with surgery and radiotherapy until now. To make physicians aware that typical carcinoid nasopharyngeal tumour can be treated by surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. We report the management of a typical carcinoid nasopharyngeal tumour in a 68-year-old female successfully treated with endoscopic surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. We also review the relevant literature. Patients with close margins at the time of the surgery may need adjuvant radiotherapy to prevent recurrence. After a negative octreotide scintigraphy, periodical follow-up only is sufficient. ","176":"To describe an extremely rare pediatric sinonasal schwannoma, and to reviewmanagement strategies and relevant literature. Case report of pediatric sinonasal schwannoma, that was imaged with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and managed endoscopically. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine pathology. A 12-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of progressive left exophthalmos. Imaging studies showed a large heterogeneous tumour arising from the ethmoid sinus and extending to the base of the skull and to the orbital cavity. The lesion was removed with an endonasal radical excision. The final pathological diagnosis was schwannoma. There was no tumour recurrence or any major complication during the 2-year follow up. Schwannoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis for pediatric patients with intranasal masses. Depending on the location and extent of the tumour, endonasal endoscopic excision could be a suitable management strategy. ","177":"Although concha bullosa, nasal septal deviation (NSD) and paranasal sinusitis are apparently three independent entities, some studies suggest that they are interconnected. Computed tomography (CT) is a useful and accurate imaging modality for examining this interconnection. The objective of this study is to use CT imaging to investigate the possible association between concha bullosa, NSD and paranasal sinusitis. We reviewed 206 nasal and paranasal CT images of individuals with sinonasal symptoms\/cosmetic issues and investigated the association between the presence of concha bullosa and NSD with paranasal sinusitis. There was no significant relation between the presence of concha bullosa and paranasal sinusitis. The mean NSD was significantly higher in the cases with frontal, maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinusitis than in unaffected subjects. Similar findings were found in the patients with any involved paranasal sinus and the controls (6.49 +\/- 3.060 vs. 3.31 +\/- 1.99 degrees; p&lt;0.001). An NSD &gt; or =3.5% differentiated between the presence and absence of paranasal sinusitis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 76.5%, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between NSD and the number of involved sinuses (Pearson's r=0.58, p&lt;0.001). The laterality of sinusitis was not associated with NSD or concha bullosa. Nasal septal deviation, but possibly not concha bullosa, is associated with paranasal sinusitis and its extent. An NSD &gt; or = 3.5 degrees is a useful predictor of paranasal sinusitis. ","178":"To compare the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency (RF) and cold dissection (CD) tonsillectomy. Prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical study. One hundred and fourteen patients underwent tonsillectomy. The RF and CD techniques were used for the right and left tonsils, respectively; the patients and examining physicians were blinded to this information to avoid bias. We compared operation times, intraoperative bleeding, and postoperative pain associated with the respective techniques. The RF and CD techniques required similar operation times. Intraoperative bleeding was lower after RF dissection than after CD. The severity of pain did not differ between the two techniques on postoperative day 1, but was significantly lower for the CD technique than the RF technique on postoperative days 5 and 10. The RF technique is superior to CD regarding intraoperative bleeding, but not regarding operation time or time to return to a painless dietary regimen. ","179":"We performed an 8-year retrospective study to evaluate the presentation, clinical findings and nasopharyngeal biopsy results of adult nasopharyngeal pathologies. This study included 1647 patients (801 males and 846 females) admitted to outpatient clinics. All patients underwent a nasopharyngeal biopsy for a nasopharyngeal mass. In addition, a blind biopsy was taken if there was suspicion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, even in the absence of a mass lesion. The pathological diagnoses were analysed on the basis of the age, sex and clinical presentation of the patients. Patient age ranged between 18 and 85 years; the mean was 36 years. Patient age differed significantly between those with benign and malignant disease (p=0.000); the risk of malignancy increased with age. Benign disease was found in 97.4% of the patients. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia was the most common condition; it was found in 92.71% of benign cases. Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal cancer was the most common malignant disease, being found in 82.95% of all nasopharyngeal malignancies and in 4.43% of all nasopharyngeal disease. The most common symptom was nasal obstruction. The other main symptoms were hearing loss and neck mass. Neck mass was associated with malignancy. Benign disease of the nasopharynx is more common than malignant pathology in patients with a nasopharyngeal mass. Although adenoidal tissue undergoes regression in the adolescent period, this tissue may present as the chief cause of nasal obstruction in adults. Age and symptoms may predict malignant disease. ","180":"The aim of this study was to investigate, in parallel, changes in electrogustometric (EGM) thresholds, the morphology and density of the fungiform papillae (fPap), and the shape and density of the vessels at the tip of the human tongue in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). In 36 patients (19 females, 17 males; 12 subjects with type 1 DM and 24 subjects with type 2 DM), we recorded bilateral EGM-thresholds at the areas innervated by the chorda tympani, the glossopharyngeal nerves, and the greater petrosal nerves. We examined the morphology and density of the fPap and blood vessel density and morphology at the tip of the tongue with contact endoscopy (CE). A group of 36 healthy, age-matched, non-smoking individuals served as controls. The fPap density measured by CE was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced in DM compared to control groups. EGM-thresholds were significantly higher in the DM group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Gender did not have a significant impact on CE and EGM findings within the DM group. Body mass index did not significantly affect EGM-thresholds or the morphology and vascularization of fPap. These results suggested that DM significantly reduced gustatory function, based on EGM, and impaired the gustatory anatomical structures, based on CE. Both EGM and CE may be useful in clinical settings to monitor taste disorders in patients with DM. ","181":"This study aimed to compare the outcomes of cochlear implantation (CI) in children with malformed versus normal inner ear anatomy. We assessed 63 children with prelingual deafness, including 12 with inner ear malformations. All had undergone CI before the age of 5 y. We evaluated Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scores before surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. In both groups, the CAP and SIR scores increased with time after implantation in follow-up assessments. No significant differences were found in the CAP or SIR scores between the two groups at any of the four follow-up assessments. Children with inner ear malformation can benefit from CI. Although additional factors may influence the outcome of CI in children with inner ear malformations compared to children with deafness from other causes, early implantation may provide similar results. ","182":"Evaluation of the clinical and pathological factors associated with the treatment and outcomes of external auditory canal (EAC) carcinomas. A retrospective review of clinical and pathological analysis was performed on 23 patients who were histologically diagnosed with EAC carcinomas and treated at Hamamatsu University hospital. We evaluated the clinical staging, treatment methods, pathological diagnosis (particularly squamous cell carcinoma, SCC), and patient outcomes. Main outcome measures include staging, treatment procedures, pathological features, and estimated survival rates. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of study participants was 75.2% and the 10-year OS was 60.2% using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognosis for SCC was poor compared with other carcinomas (p= 0.0462). The prognoses for SCC patients after treatment with surgery alone and after postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were significantly better than for patients with unresectable tumours (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0001, respectively). There was no significant difference among the four tumour stage groups. Information about patients' survival status was obtained after a median follow-up period of 57.5 months (range, 7-151 months). Our survival analysis data for carcinoma of the EAC demonstrates that SCC and unresectable cases are associated with poor outcomes. Outcomes for patients with operable disease more closely parallel the survival curves of patients with advanced stage T4 disease. Patients with SCC should be strictly categorized as cases with severe disease. ","183":"Several questionnaires are used to survey how tinnitus affects quality of life, making comparisons across studies difficult. The questionnaires also are used to measure treatment outcome but were not designed for this purpose. To address these issues, a new questionnaire has been suggested, the tinnitus functional index (TFI), which is highly responsive to treatment-related change. The current study aim was to translate and validate the TFI for a Dutch-speaking population. Factor analysis was performed to characterize the TFI profile in a large tinnitus population. The questionnaire was translated using a translation-back translation procedure, and 263 patients in the ENT department of Antwerp University Hospital with tinnitus-related complaints completed it. Factor structure was assessed using exploratory analysis with oblique rotation and compared with the original questionnaire. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Spearman correlations with the percentage of time aware of the tinnitus and the visual analogue scales (VAS) for maximum tinnitus loudness and mean tinnitus loudness were calculated to investigate convergent validity. The original eight-factor structure could be confirmed in the Dutch version of the TFI. Internal consistency (a=0.96) and convergent validity showed good results. Statistically significant correlations were found with the VAS for maximum loudness (r=0.59; p&lt;0.001), VAS for mean loudness (r=0.66; p&lt;0.001), and percentage of time aware of tinnitus (r=0.58; p&lt;0.001). The Dutch version of the TFI is suitable for measuring in clinical and research settings how tinnitus affects daily life, with psychometric properties in line with the original version. ","184":"The authors are concerned that an overrestrictive approach to evidence-based medicine could lead to the neglect of valuable treatment options. We describe the need for a personalised approach to evidence-based medicine, and support this with examples from ENT practice. We concur with the point of view that evidence at all levels should be used in clinical decision-making and we suggest that fitness for purpose is more important than hierarchy of evidence. We conclude that the application of evidence-based medicine should involve trying to select the best therapy for individuals on the basis of the total spectrum of treatment options. Evidence and expertise should work synergistically. ","185":"Epidermoid cysts (EC) represent less than 0.01% of all oral cavity cysts. Lateral epidermoid cysts in the neck are very rare. A male patient aged forty-five had a complaint of painless swelling in the neck. A well-circumscribed hypo-echoic mass with internal echoes was detected in the right submandibular regionby ultrasonography. There were round areas inside the cyst with acoustic shadowing. The tissue hardness and the internal nature of the mass were evaluated with sono-elastography. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the mass's location and tissue properties in more detail. Magnetic resonance images revealed a well-circumscribed mass--hyperintense on T2-weighted images, hypo-intense on T1-weighted images--in the right submandibular region that had displaced the submandibular gland and mylohyoid muscle. There was no contrast enhancement in the mass on the contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR images. In this case report, we present the imaging features of a rare lateral EC in the submandibular region.","186":"Septoplasty is a frequently performed ENT surgical procedure and anatomical reference points are well established. Nevertheless, it can be associated with serious complications. We report on a 27-year-old female patient, who was admitted to our hospital 16 days after septoplasty in another institution. She complained of vision loss in her left eye and yellowish discharge from the nose. The MSCT scan revealed fracture of the upper and lateral walls of the left sphenoid sinus with the bone fragment penetrating the left optic canal and signs of left maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinusitis. During functional endoscopic sinus surgery, a lesion of the left optic canal was clearly seen. Despite many treatments, the patient was released from our hospital without any residual sight in her left eye. Unilateral blindness is a rare, but devastating complication following septoplasty. ","187":"Carcinomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses are rare solid head and neck tumours. With an incidence of 1-1.5\/100,000 per year, they account for only 3% of all malignancies in the head and neck region. Sinonasal carcinomas are often adenocarcinomas. Hardwood dust is one possible triggering agent, although the latency period may extend to decades. Central nervous system complications arising from solid tumours of the head can be explained in terms of the close anatomical relationship between the two areas. However, leptomeningeal spread is rare. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating cranial nerve deficits due to a leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as the primary manifestation of an adenocarcinoma of the paranasal sinus and the nasal cavity.","188":"Oncogenic osteomalacia (OOM) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by hypophosphatemia and overexpression of a phosphaturic agent, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). OOM is associated with a variety of mesenchymal tumours referred to as phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours. Head and neck regions are concerned in 5-10% of cases. We report the case of a 42-year-old female with OOM caused by a hemangiopericytoma of the left ethmoid sinus. The period between first symptoms and surgical excision of the lesion was approximately 5 years. We also conducted a PubMed-based search to identify all cases of OOM related to sinonasal tumour. Twenty eight cases in the sinonasal area were reported in the literature. OOM is an important diagnosis because resection of the causative tumour results in cure of the disease. ","189":"Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the use of the endonasal endoscopic approach for removing frontal sinus and frontal recess osteomas. This study aimed to describe an endoscopic endonasal treatment of osteomas without the need for an external approach. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients that had received operations over a 5-year period in a single center. Twenty-nine patients underwent endoscopic osteoma resections. The osteomas were graded according to the Chiu and Kennedy grading system: 12 had type I, 2 had type II, 13 had type III, and 2 had type IV osteomas. The most common indication for surgery was frontal pain. Removal of the osteoma was incomplete in three patients. Of these, one underwent successful transnasal reoperation, and the other two had tumors that extended near the mid-orbital line and were attached to the orbital roof. Based on an 11-point scale (0--no pain, 10--maximum pain), the mean pain intensity decreased from 7.5 before surgery to 3.3 (p &lt; 0.005) after surgery for patients that underwent surgery due to frontal pain. We found that exclusively transnasal endoscopic resections of frontal sinus osteomas were safe. However, this approach can be inadequate under some conditions. An auxiliary external approach may be required when the frontal ostium is narrow and\/or when tumors are extensively attached to the orbital roof, and grow close to the midorbital point. ","190":"This retrospective study assessed several clinical, case history and functional parameters to investigate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in patients with migraine. Two groups of patients were compared: those affected by BPPV and migraine (group A), as defined by International Headache Society criteria, and those with BPPV without migraine or with another form of headache (group B). The following parameters were investigated: onset of BPPV, recovery time, residual dizziness, recurrence of BPPV, atypical eye movement patterns and Meniere-like vertigo in the inter-critical BPPV period. Mean age at BPPV onset was 39 years +\/- 9.2 in Group A and 53 years +\/- 7.3 in Group B (p = 0.00). No significant difference emerged in the number of manoeuvres needed to achieve recovery (Group A: 1.7 +\/- 0.94; Group B: 1.9 +\/- 0.89; p &gt; 0.05). Highly recurrent BPPV (at least 4 documented episodes) was observed in 15 patients from group A (19.4%) and in 8 patients from group B (7.3%). Atypical eyes movements and Meniere-like vertigo were more frequent in migraineurs with highly recurrent BPPV (Chi square = 5.76; p &lt; 0.016). A high prevalence of BPPV and earlier onset in migraine are the main findings of this study. There is a higher incidence of a range of neurotological patterns in the intervals between BPPV episodes in migraineurs with recurrent vertigo. No direct pathophysiological link between migraine and BPPV has yet been established; comorbidity seems to affect clinical features in a sub-population of patients and make BPPV more debilitating. ","191":"To present the symptoms, clinical courses, and management of patients with deep neck infections (DNIs) encountered in our department in 2003-2011. We reviewed the records of 142 patients diagnosed with DNIs that required hospitalization during an 8 y period. In addition, we conducted a follow-up of the patients by telephone interview. The incidence of DNIs has increased significantly in our hospital since 2008. Tonsillitis (15%) and foreign bodies (11%) were the two leading causes. In 57% of the patients, the cause of DNI was not known. The most common underlying systemic disease was diabetes mellitus, noted in 21% of our patients. Branchial cleft cyst was the underlying etiology in five of the 11 patients with recurrent neck infections. Closer attention should be paid to DNI patients, especially to those with diabetes and hypertension. Recurrence of DNI was uncommon and suggested the existence of a branchial cleft cyst. ","192":"Chondrosarcomas of the larynx are usually slow-growing tumours. Their prognosis is reportedly unaffected by local tumour recurrence. Nevertheless, total laryngectomy is often performed in fear that resection of the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage may cause laryngeal collapse and stenosis. Transoral laser surgery (TLS) is not considered among the treatment options. This case report supports the feasibility of a radical yet organ- and function-preserving tumour excision using TLS. A female patient presented with dyspnoea due to an extensive low-grade laryngeal chondrosarcoma. TLS treatment involved total resection of the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage. The patient was decannulated 8 months later with normal swallowing and satisfactory voice quality, which allowed her to have a normal personal and social life. TLS excision of the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage seems to be a feasible and radical yet function- and organ-preserving technique with minimal morbidity. ","193":"Surgery is the main therapeutic option to control recurrent laryngeal cancer after radiotherapy (RT) relapse. Most RT-recurred cancer is treated aggressively; although, conservative laryngeal surgery was attempted in selected cases. Here, we report our experiences with salvage laryngeal surgery for early glottic cancers that did not respond to RT. We analyzed files from 1980 to 2006 and selected 173 patients surgically treated for a RT-failed early glottic carcinoma (stage I-II according to 2010 TNM: 114 T1N0, 59 T2N0). Among them, 47 patients (27%) underwent a salvage partial laryngectomy (SPL) and 126 (73%) had a salvage total laryngectomy (STL). When compared with initial T staging, we found 61% of lesions were up-staged, 31% had the same staged lesion, and only 8% were down-staged (according to rTNM). No statistically significant differences were found in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival when SPL and STL patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that T, rT, and rTNM were prognostic factors for overall survival (p = 0.045, p = 0.028, and p = 0.037, respectively); yet, these significances were lost in multivariate analysis. Our results suggest that salvage surgery is feasible in most cases of RT-recurred early glottic cancer; although, a conservative approach achieves good oncological and functional results only in select RT-recurred patients.","194":"Auditory neuropathy\/dyssynchrony (AN\/AD) is a relatively, recently described diagnostic term. It describes a disorder characterised by detectable otoacoustic emissions and\/or cochlear microphonics, combined with abnormal or absent auditory brainstem responses and deficient speech understanding. Consequently, the patient's cognitive responses are inconsistent with a behavioural tone audiogram. This review describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of AN\/AD. We have focused on the diagnostic pathway, because diagnosis is sometimes difficult, and recent research has provided important insights into the aetiopathology of the disease. The diagnostic tools for AN\/AD currently used in our department will be demonstrated in a clinical case. It is very important to recognise AN\/AD and provide patient counselling and support as early as possible, due to the potentially major influence of this disorder on a patient's social life and language acquisition.","195":"Necrotising otitis externa is an uncommon and aggressive infection of the external auditory canal with a tendency to present in the elderly and immunocompromised patient. We report a series of twenty-five patients admitted to our institution over a four-year period with this diagnosis. We review the diagnosis and antimicrobial management of these cases, and propose a treatment algorithm based on our experience.","196":null,"197":"To give an overview of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) pathologies encountered in the emergency room (ER). Retrospective analysis of 1296 files of patients visiting the ER between January 2008 and December 2012. Diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, referral, and demographic parameters were evaluated. Epistaxis is the most frequent ENT condition seen in the ER. One third of epistaxis patients are on anticoagulant therapy. The second most frequent conditions observed were infections of the pharynx and tonsils. Nasal fractures and vertigo were also frequently observed. Epistaxis and its treatment were the most frequent ENT diagnosis and therapy seen in the ER. Infections are the main cause of hospitalisation. Referral to other disciplines and revisits seldom occurred. ","198":"","199":"To explore a new approach for treating pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) schwannomas via endoscopic transnasal prelacrimal recess-maxillary sinus (MS). Five patients with PPF schwannomas underwent surgical resection of the tumors using this approach. All patients had adequate exposure and complete tumor resection. No major postoperative complications were observed. No evidence of tumor recurrence was noted after follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging and serial evaluations for 12 to 40 months postoperatively. No patients had epiphora, and the shape of the inferior turbinate (IT) was favorable. Treatment of PPF schwannoma via endoscopic transnasal prelacrimal recess-MS is safe and effective. Additionally, this approach is minimally invasive not only for the PPF, from which the benign lesions can be completely removed, but also for the MS. This is especially true with lesions of the prelacrimal and alveolar recesses that can be resected. This approach is necessary to prevent structural and functional damage of the nasal cavity, especially the IT and nasolacrimal duct, allowing better healing with decreased morbidity and shorter recovery periods. ","200":"Here we report a case of pseudotumoral recurrence of allergic fungal sinusitis with involvement of the skull base that was successfully treated with systemic corticosteroids and itraconazole without surgery. This report discusses the sometimes misleading radiological and clinical features as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of a condition that should be recognized by ENT specialists, neurosurgeons, ophtalmologists and radiologists.","201":"Teratoma is the most common germ cell tumour in childhood. Teratoma typically arises in the sacrococcygeal region, gonads and mediastinum. The head and neck region is seldom involved. Teratomas of the neck region represent one of the most unusual causes of respiratory distress during the neonatal period. We present a case of an immature teratoma in the parapharyngeal space presenting with airway obstruction in an infant. Surgeons should consider the possibility of immature teratoma in the head and neck region in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress in an infant, even if the patient does not have an external deformity.","202":"Primary undifferentiated or lymphoepithelial carcinoma mainly occurs in the nasopharynx. Tracheal localization is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, only four cases have been reported previously, all in Asian patients. A 61-year-old male European patient presented with hemoptysis and cough for several months. The workup revealed a primary tracheal tumor without regional or distant metastasis. The patient was treated with tracheal resection followed by end-to-end reconstruction. Pathologic analysis of the tumor, including immunohistochemistry, confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Testing for Epstein-Barr virus by hybridization in situ was massively positive. With a follow-up at 15 months, the patient is alive and free of disease. We report the first case of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in the trachea in the European population. Treatment possibilities are discussed. They should be based on each patient's clinical presentation and the results of their preoperative workup. ","203":"Chronic sinusitis with polyposis (CSWP) is associated with high direct and indirect annual costs. This condition affects several aspects of daily life, and CSWP patients usually suffer from decreased quality of life (QOL). Treatment with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is reported to improve the QOL of patients with CS. Here we evaluated the factors that affected QOL improvement in CSWP patients who were candidates for FESS. All patients with CSWP who were treated at the Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex in Tehan, Iran that were candidates for FESS were recruited. Patients with systemic or neurologic diseases that could affect their QOL were excluded. Clinical signs were recorded before and after FESS using the sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22) and QOL questionnaires. The patient's history of allergic rhinitis, aspirin sensitivity, asthma and smoking was recorded. QOL and associations with clinical features were evaluated within twelve months after FESS. The study included 47 patients with a mean age of 39.5 +\/- 15.4 years (61.7% women). FESS resulted in significant improvements in QOL based on the SNOT-22 and QOL questionnaires (p = 0.0001 for both). Septal deviation was the only single characteristic that was significantly associated with QOL improvements. FESS significantly improved the QOL of patients with CSWP. However, patients with septal deviation benefited the most from FESS. ","204":"Pure tone audiometry (PTA) is currently widely used to monitor ototoxicity, but this method is time-consuming. Here we validate distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) as an instrument for early detection of ototoxicity. A cohort study was performed on newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients who were treated with streptomycin. The patients underwent hearing assessment using conventional PTA and high-frequency DPOAE (8, 9 and 10 kHz) on days 0, 7, 14, 28 and 56 of streptomycin treatment. Detection of ototoxicity according to the duration of streptomycin treatment was compared between DPOAE and PTA. Of 96 newly diagnosed patients treated with streptomycin, 50 completed the study. During the treatment period, 62.5% of the patients had vertigo, while 37.5% complained of tinnitus. DPOAE detected ototoxicity in 47.7% of the cases at day 7, 66.0% at day 14, 70.0% at day 28 and 77.1% at day 56 of streptomycin treatment. The higher frequencies were affected more by ototoxicity, with significant differences at 8 vs. 9 kHz on all testing days and at 9 vs. 10 kHz except on days 7 and 56 (p &lt; 0.001). Hearing loss was detected by PTA in 2.3% of patients on day 7, in 10.6% on day 14, in 22.0% on day 48 and in 29.2% on day 56. DPOAE is a sensitive tool that can detect early changes in the cochlea due to ototoxicity. Use of DPOAE rather than PTA to screen for ototoxicity could reduce screening time and would allow clinical monitoring of more patients. ","205":"The severity of tinnitus often correlates to psychological and general health factors and the risk of depression and insomnia may be higher in patients with tinnitus. Three questionnaires about physical and psychological health were mailed to 714 Swedish patients with tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss. A total of 555 (78%) patients replied and 426 patients (77%) submitted their answers to the questionnaires. Female patients had significantly higher Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores than male patients. An open question about the experienced quality of the care that the patients obtained at our ENT clinics resulted in 159 comments (37%). The majority of the comments were about the hearing aids and many patients did not identify their hearing aids as a treatment. Patients who did not feel that the treatment they obtained at our ENT clinics was good had a significantly higher pure tone average (PTA). The results showed that many patients who did not feel that the treatment they obtained at our ENT clinics was good had no hearing aids (61%) and this level of dissatisfaction was significantly higher than in patients who stated that they had received treatment (45%). The use of hearing aids as the main treatment model in patients suffering from tinnitus and hearing impairment can be recommended in these patients. Further research is required to find an approach that could motivate patients with both tinnitus and hearing impairment to use hearing aids. ","206":"To evaluate the usefulness of antibiotic+steroid irrigation of the middle ear in patients with otitis media with small perforation and pulsatile discharge. A prospective, randomised, evaluator-blinded study was carried at a single tertiary care centre over eight years, looking at 100 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media involving small tympanic membrane perforations and pulsatile mucopurulent discharge. The patients were randomised and divided into two groups. In group A, the examination under microscope, with suction cleaning of the external canal, was followed by irrigation of the middle ear with antibiotic+steroid solution for up to one week, while group B was prescribed self-administration of the same drops with systemic antibiotics. The patients were followed up daily for 10 days to monitor otorrhoea relief and on a weekly basis subsequently to monitor the healing of the tympanic membrane. Forty-nine patients in group A had a dry ear after 3-7 days of daily suction and the irrigation of middle ear with the antibiotic+steroid solution and 44 had a healed tympanic membrane after an average three months of follow-up. Five patients with dry ear but persistent perforation underwent tympanoplasty, while only one patient with a persistent ear discharge underwent mastoid exploration. In group B, eight patients on oral antibiotics and self-administration of the same drops had dry ear while 34 had dry ear after receiving intravenous antibiotics. Thirty perforations healed spontaneously and 12 required tympanoplasty. In 8 patients, the tympano-mastoid was explored and these patients had dry, hearing ears only after surgery. Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media involving small perforations and pulsatile discharge can be managed conservatively with simple suction cleaning + middle ear irrigation with antibiotics + steroid drops. ","207":"To assess the use of PRF prepared using an optimised protocol in middle ear surgery as a substitute for conventional packing products of animal origin such as collagen derived from porcine skin. A retrospective study of 108 patients in whom optimised PRF was used exclusively to pack the external auditory canal or middle ear. The effectiveness or harmlessness of the PRF was evaluated by assessing a range of parameters. A morphological comparison was also made of PRF produced using the Choukroun procedure and our procedure. The success rate of the repair of the tympanic membrane one year after the surgery was 45\/48 patients. In 5 of 63 patients in whom a retro-auricular approach and wall-up technique were used, granuloma was observed along the incision in the ear canal. Granuloma was not seen in any of the 23 patients undergoing a procedure with an endaural approach. The use of a material prepared from patients themselves and not of animal origin has numerous advantages in terms of biocompatibility and safety, without any adverse effect on the success rate for general middle ear procedures. The protocol is simple and does not prolong the time spent by the patient in the operating theatre. The Choukroun technique should be modified to prevent excessive failure rates in PRF processing. ","208":"To investigate the value of the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) for screening at-risk patients for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This study included 217 subjects who were referred to a Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery for evaluation of suspected OSA. The subjects were classified as being at high or low risk of OSA according to their BQ score. The apnea hypopnea index (AHI), body mass index (BMI), Epworth sleepiness score, and BQ results were compared in the two risk groups, and the correlation of BQ with AHI was analyzed. The predictive accuracy of risk grouping was assessed for AHI &gt; 5 and AHI &gt; 15. The BQ identified 82.03% of the subjects as being at high risk of sleep apnea and 17.9% as being at low risk. Using a cut-off point of AHI &gt; 5, the sensitivity was 83.4% and the specificity was 22.2%; the positive predictive value was 76.4% and the negative predictive value was 30.8%. Using a cut-off point of AHI &gt; 15, the sensitivity was 89.3% and the specificity was 22.6%; the positive predictive value was 42.1% and the negative predictive value was 76.9%. These findings indicate that BQ is a poor predictor of OSA in patients who are at high risk of OSA. The BQ does not appear to be an appropriate screening tool for determining the risk of sleep apnea in this population. ","209":"Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a common complication of tonsillitis, yet there is limited consensus regarding its management and epidemiology. Current issues include pre-hospital care provided by general practitioners (GP) in the community (ii) the lack of standardized protocols for in-patient management and (iii) the role of routine microbiology studies in patients with PTA. We performed a retrospective review of confirmed cases of PTA presenting to a west of Ireland tertiary referral center to evaluate the peri-hospital management and role of microbiology studies in such cases. Retrospective chart review of 200 confirmed cases of peritonsillar abscess. The annual incidence of PTA in the west of Ireland population was 14\/100,000. Pre-hospital treatment given by Primary Care Physicians (PCP) was often deficient with 84 (42%) patients receiving no treatment prior to hospital referral. Needle aspiration was the most common technique used to drain the PTA 142 (71%). Anaerobes were isolated in 54 (27%) of cases demonstrating an increasing importance of these bacteria in PTA disease. Metronidazole with either benzylpenicillin 72 (36%), or co-amoxiclav 82 (41%), was the most common empiric antibiotics used. Successful treatment of all cases of PTA with the use of empiric antibiotics was achieved before results arising from microbiology became available. The epidemiology of PTA is not well described. We have described the epidemiology for PTA disease in the west of Ireland population for the first time. Needle aspiration was the most common drainage technique used. Empiric antibiotic treatment based on clinical response is advised with antibiotics effective against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recommended. ","210":"Human papilloma virus (HPV) was recently reported to play a major role in oropharyngeal carcinoma. Large geographical differences in the disease prevalence have been described. Until now, no data have been reported for Flanders (Belgium). A multicenter cooperative study was undertaken at the radiation-oncology departments of Flemish universities. Tumor blocks from patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal carcinoma between 2000 and 2010 were tested for HPV at a single center. Patients' characteristics, treatments, and follow-up data were recorded from medical files. Age standardized incidence rates of oropharyngeal carcinoma were collected from the Belgian Cancer Registry. The incidence of oropharyngeal carcinoma has increased in males and females. Tissues were collected from 264 patients and the HPV status could be defined in 249 of them. The prevalence of HPV(+) oropharyngeal carcinoma was 24.78% (19.93-30.36%). In our cohort, HPV(+) tumors occurred in patients with more advanced tumor stages (p &lt; 0.05), who smoked less (p &lt; 0.05), consumed less alcohol (p &lt; 0.05), had a tonsillar\/base of tongue sublocalization (p &lt; 0.05), and were older (p &lt; 0.05). After radiotherapy, locoregional control and disease free survival were significantly better for patients with HPV(+) status (p &lt; 0.05) in univariate analysis. HPV status remained a strong predictor of better locoregional control after multivariate analysis. We found that concurrent chemotherapy had an equal benefit for locoregional control in both HPV(+) and HPV(-) patients. ","211":"Multiple, minimally invasive surgical techniques have been developed over the last few decades for the management of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHTP). However, in cases with multiglandular disease, bilateral cervical exploration remains the gold standard. Therefore, it is important to have an accurate estimation of the incidence of multiglandular disease in sporadic PHTP. 698 patients were treated for PHTP between 1993 and 2010 at the University Hospitals Leuven, using the bilateral cervical exploration method. After excluding cases of multiple endocrine carcinoma syndrome, the incidences of double adenoma and multiple gland hyperplasia were investigated in these patients. Age, gender, imaging results, serum calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations were analyzed and compared to the data of 50 randomly-selected, PHTP patients with solitary adenomas. 6.6% and 2.4% of the patients with sporadic PHTP had double adenomas and multiple gland hyperplasia, respectively. The female\/male ratio was 4.8 (38\/8) and 1.8 (11\/6), and the average age was 63 and 52 yrs for patients with double adenomas and multiple gland hyperplasia, respectively. The patients with solitary adenomas had a female\/male ratio of 3.5, and an average age of 60 yrs. There were no significant differences in serum calcium or parathyroid hormone concentrations between patients with multiglandular disease and those with solitary adenomas. Multiglandular disease occurs in 9% of patients with sporadic PHTP, and cannot be excluded before surgery. This incidence must be considered when using minimally invasive techniques for treatment of sporadic PHTP. In cases of multiglandular disease, bilateral cervical exploration is indicated. ","212":"PROBLEM\/OBJECTIVES: Unilateral hearing loss (UHL) in children is a relatively common problem often identified by newborn screening or school screening. This review summarizes the outcomes of a large study of children with UHL which identified risk factors for educational problems, describes the results of pilot studies of intervention, and proposes guidelines for interventions and future studies. Cohort of children age 6-12 years with UHL was compared to their siblings with normal hearing on the primary outcomes of cognition, achievement, and language. Secondary outcomes examined included behavioral, speech, and educational problems. A subgroup of children with UHL was followed longitudinally to examine change over time. Children with UHL had lower language and verbal IQ scores than their siblings with normal hearing. They required individualized education plans (a measure of educational difficulty) at three times the rate and speech therapy at twice the rate of their siblings. The additional educational concerns did not ameliorate over time. Low maternal education levels and lower baseline cognitive skills were independent risk factors for school problems. Pilot studies suggest that children with UHL might benefit from amplification, but may need attention to cognitive or executive function skills as well. Children with UHL are at risk for delays in speech-language development, cognition, and behavioral problems that can affect functioning at school. Controlled studies are urgently needed to determine whether amplification, auditory rehabilitation, school-provided educational assistance, or other interventions are able to reduce or eliminate this risk. ","213":"PROBLEM\/OBJECTIVES: Permanent childhood hearing loss has major negative impacts on children's health and development. To improve outcomes, universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has been implemented widely. However, high-quality evidence on its efficacy was lacking. To address this evidence gap, we conducted the Longitudinal Outcomes of Children with Hearing Impairment (LOCHI) study to directly compare outcomes of early- and late-identified children. This paper investigates whether early performance measured shortly after initial amplification predicts language development at 3 years of age. This is a prospective, population-based study. We assessed outcomes at 6- and 12-months after amplification, and then at 3 and 5 years of age. Main outcome measures included directly-assessed language, receptive vocabulary, speech production; and parent-reported functional performance in everyday life. A range of demographic and audiological information was also collected at evaluation intervals. About 450 children participated, and 3-year outcomes scores were available for 356 participants. Multiple regression analysis revealed that early language scores or functional performance ratings were significant predictors of 3-year outcomes. Other significant predictors included the presence or absence of additional disabilities, severity of hearing loss, and age at cochlear implant activation. Early performance, either directly-assessed language ability (PLS-4) or parent-reported functional ratings (PEACH), were significant predictors of 3-year outcomes; along with presence or absence of additional disabilities, severity of hearing loss, and age at CI activation. Earlier implantation is possible with early detection of hearing loss via UNHS. Monitoring performance after initial amplification allows preventive strategies to be implemented early to improve outcomes. ","214":"This study retrospectively evaluates the effect of newborn hearing screening on age at diagnosis, age at cochlear implantation and spoken language development in severely hearing-impaired children. Age at diagnosis, age at cochlear implantation and language development were evaluated in a group of early screened (n = 149) and a group of late screened (n = 139) severely hearing-impaired children. Language outcomes were quantified as language quotients (LQs) on the Reynell Developmental Language Scales and Schlichting Expressive Language Test at 1,2, and 3 years after cochlear implantation. Early screened children were significantly younger than late screened children at the time of hearing loss diagnosis and cochlear implantation. Furthermore, early screening was associated with better receptive and expressive spoken language skills after cochlear implantation. The results of this retrospective study indicate that the newborn hearing screening program in Flanders and The Netherlands resulted in earlier intervention in deaf children, which beneficially influenced spoken language development. ","215":"To assess the impact of fifteen years of universal neonatal hearing screening in Flanders on language development and the educational setting. An analysis of the database of Kind en Gezin from 1997 to 2012 and a long-term evaluation of the children referred to our centre after failed neonatal hearing screening. The CELF and PPVT language tests were performed. Between 1997 and August 2012, bilateral hearing loss was confirmed in 2393 children in Flanders, of whom 11.4% were referred to our tertiary centre. The educational setting and language development of 84 children older than 5 years was evaluated and 54% of them had additional disabilities. Of the children without additional disabilities, 84% attended mainstream schools; 42% of children with additional disabilities entered mainstream education with additional support. There was a significant correlation between the number of additional disabilities and the education level (p &lt; 0.001) and between the degree of hearing loss and educational placement (p &lt; 0.001). Data on language development were available for 76% of the children and a significant correlation could be demonstrated only between the results of the PPVT language and the number of additional handicaps (p &lt; 0.008). The majority of children receiving early treatment after neonatal hearing screening enter mainstream education. The number of additional disabilities has a significant effect on education level and language development. ","216":"In current terminology, auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) is a disease involving the disruption of the temporal coding of acoustic signals in auditory nerve fibres, resulting in the impairment of auditory perceptions that rely on temporal cues. There is debate about almost every aspect of the disorder, including aetiology, lesion sites, and the terminology used to describe it. ANSD is a heterogeneous disease despite similar audiological findings. The absence of an auditory brainstem response (ABR) and the presence of otoacoustic emissions (OAE) suggest an ANSD profile. However, to determine the exact anatomical site of the disorder, more in-depth audiological and electrophysiological tests must be combined with imaging, genetics and neurological examinations. Greater diagnostic specificity is therefore needed to provide these patients with more adequate treatment.","217":"To evaluate the audiological outcome of children with congenital cytomegalovirus infection. In a prospective study, the hearing of 98 congenitally cytomegalovirus-infected children born between January 2003 and July 2009 was systematically evaluated until the age of six using the Flemish CMV protocol. Symptomatic children with hearing loss at birth were treated with ganciclovir, if parents consented. Seventy children passed initial screening, 28 had unilateral or bilateral hearing loss. In the normal hearing group, one asymptomatic and two symptomatic children developed late-onset hearing loss. Eight children in the group with hearing loss at birth received ganciclovir. Nine symptomatic and 11 asymptomatic children did not receive ganciclovir. In the treated group, 37.5% of the children had stable hearing loss, and 37.5% had progressive and\/or fluctuating hearing loss. First progression or fluctuation always occurred after the age of one year. The hearing threshold improved in 25.0%. The improvement took place during or shortly after treatment. Hearing loss remained stable in 33.3% of the untreated symptomatic children, while progression or fluctuation occurred in 55.5%. In the asymptomatic group, hearing loss was most commonly stable (63.6%). The first change in the hearing threshold was almost always detected before the age of one year in both untreated groups. Hearing loss caused by congenital cytomegalovirus infection cannot be defined unequivocally either with respect to the level of hearing loss or its evolution over time. Treating symptomatic children with ganciclovir leads to a better prognosis during the first year of life, after which progression or fluctuation again becomes more likely. However, overall, progression is more common in the untreated symptomatic group. Asymptomatic children with SNHL are more likely to have a stable hearing status. ","218":"Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder in children, with an incidence of 1 in 500 newborns. Most cases are caused by mutations in a single gene. However, DNA diagnostics for hearing loss are challenging, since it is an extremely heterogeneous trait. Although more than 47 causative genes have been identified for the nonsyndromic forms of hearing loss alone, diagnostic application of the scientific progress has lagged behind. The reason for this is the cost: screening all the known causative genes for hearing loss in one patient with the current golden standard for DNA diagnostics, Sanger sequencing, would be extremely expensive. Consequently, current routine DNA diagnostic testing for hearing loss is restricted to one or two of the most common causative genes, and the responsible gene is identified in only 10-20% of cases. Several recent reports have shown that \"next-generation DNA sequencing techniques\" have the potential to provide a novel testing platform that could test all known genes in a sensitive, specific and cost-efficient manner. It is to be expected that these new tests will greatly improve DNA diagnostics in the coming years.","219":"To investigate the aetiology of congenital hearing loss detected by the universal neonatal hearing screening programme (Algo) that was introduced in Flanders 15 years ago, and, more specifically, to investigate genetic causes. Diagnostic work-up of all children with confirmed hearing loss after referral by the Algo screening programme and screening at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of our university hospital. A hearing loss was confirmed in 505 of the 569 neonates (18% from NICU) referred between 1997 and 2011. After further examination, a genetic origin was identified in 84 (17%) of 100 children with a syndromic hearing loss. The most frequent syndromes are discussed. A higher percentage of syndromic hearing loss was found than in the literature. This could be explained by the good cooperation with the human genetics department and the proportion of children retrieved from the neonatal intensive care unit. ","220":"The success of universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) programmes is usually evaluated by determining the effect of the early detection of hearing loss on developmental outcome. However, in practice, these programmes do not detect all children with permanent childhood hearing impairment. In this study we determine the sensitivity of the current UNHS programme and analyse the characteristics of the children not detected by UNHS. We performed a nationwide, population-based, retrospective follow-up study in The Netherlands. All children born in 2003-05 and screened in a hearing screening programme (well babies and neonatal intensive care (NICU) graduates) were included for study. The main outcome measure was the sensitivity of the UNHS programme (based on the proportion of children known to have a permanent childhood hearing impairment in 2008 who were identified by UNHS). We also evaluated age at diagnosis, severity, and aetiology of hearing impairment in the children not detected by UNHS. We found that the sensitivity of the current UNHS programme was 0.83 (0.79 for well babies and 0.96 for NICU graduates). Permanent childhood hearing impairment was confirmed before 36 months of age in 96% of the study cohort. Of the children unidentified by the UNHS, &gt; 50% had moderate hearing loss. No predominant cause of hearing impairment was found in these children. Our current UNHS programme identified the majority of children with a permanent hearing impairment of congenital cause. ","221":"This state-of-the-art report describes the rationale and evidence for family-centred early intervention after newborn hearing screening (NHS). More specifically, we document the organisation and practice of early home-based guidance (EHBG) in Flanders, as well as the new challenges and paradigm shifts induced by NHS. Since the introduction of NHS, the number of participants with bilateral hearing loss entering one of the five EHBG centres in Flanders (one in each of the region's provinces) before the age of twelve months has doubled. About half of the screened population receive EHBG and about 80% of them do so before the age of six months. However, there is enormous variation between the different provinces and this has still to be clarified.","222":"A universal programme of newborn\/early hearing screening was introduced fifteen years ago in the northern part of Belgium (Flanders) by the Government Health Service 'Kind en Gezin' (Child and Family). Since then, large numbers of hearing-impaired babies have been fitted with conventional hearing aids at a very young age, mostly before the age of 2-3 months. As a result of the early hearing screening programme, the decision to proceed with a cochlear implant is now taken much earlier. Fitting hearing aids in very young children is always part of a continuous diagnostics approach based on cross-checks and a combination of objective and subjective audiometry. It is also a component of a multidisciplinary approach, with parents as the essential party. Fitting hearing aids in very young children cannot be separated from this approach. This article therefore stresses the positive evolution of the last fifteen years in the context of three basic elements for helping young children with hearing loss and their families: diagnostics, fitting hearing aids and treatment. Early screening and the consequent early diagnosis of hearing loss in neonates triggered the transformation of support arrangements for young children with hearing loss and their families.","223":"A universal newborn hearing screening programme based on the voluntary participation of maternity hospitals has been implemented in the Wallonia-Brussels Federation since November 2006. This paper presents the results of this programme and its evolution since its implementation (2007-2011). Two-step screening by automated otoacoustic emissions is performed on newborns without risk factors for hearing loss and, if abnormal responses or risk factor(s) are found, auditory brainstem response audiometry is performed. Descriptive analyses of the eligible population, coverage rates and prevalence of hearing loss were presented by year of birth (2007-2011) and globally. Over five years, the first screening test coverage rate increased to almost 95%, 2.4% of the newborns without risk factors were referred for auditory brainstem response audiometry and 42.6% of the newborns referred were lost to followup. Of the newborns with risk factor(s) for hearing loss, 6.3% were not tested, 87.4% had normal bilateral hearing and 3.7% were lost to follow-up. Between 2007 and 2011, hearing impairment was reported in 3.18 per thousand newborns eligible for the programme, whatever the kind of hearing loss. Like many other countries and areas, the Wallonia-Brussels Federation has implemented a universal newborn hearing screening programme. The results of this programme evolved favourably during the period 2007-2011, even if some efforts had to be made to improve the follow-up of the referred newborns and data quality. ","224":"Permanent congenital hearing impairment (CHI) occurs in approximately 1.4 per 1,000 newborns. Early treatment and rehabilitation is essential to prevent the delayed development of speech and language. This paper describes the special collaborative approach of the Flemish screening programme. It also discusses the results and the new insights into socio-demographic risk factors for CHI. In the period 1999-2008, the entire population of 628,337 newborns in Flanders was tested using an AABR hearing screener. Positive results were referred for confirmation of the CHI diagnosis to specialised referral centres. Socio-demographic factors were investigated to study any relationship with CHI. The referral rate after two screenings was 2.7-7.2 per thousand of screened babies depending on the screener used. All children were referred to specialised centres and there was almost no loss to follow-up. The diagnosis of hearing loss was confirmed in 77-82% of the babies referred. The socio-demographic factors of gender, birth order and birth length, initial feeding type, level of education and origin of the mother were found to be independent predictors of CHI. Most of these risk factors can be linked to poverty. The observation that 50% of babies with CHI have no risk factors from the classic AAP list may be partly explained by the non-inclusion of socio-demographic risk factors. This integrated programme opens up new perspectives for hearing-impaired babies. The social impact of the screening programme is considerable. A cluster of socio-demographic risk factors for CHI can be added to the classic AAP list. ","225":"","226":"Metastases to the oral cavity are rare and are most frequently seen in the jawbones. Soft tissue metastases as the first clinical sign of a metastatic cancer are quite exceptional. In this case report, we describe the history of a 67-year old patient presenting with painless oral lesions for 4 weeks. Biopsies showed metastases of an adenocarcinoma that was not yet identified. This case report highlights that an ENT physician should consider metastases to the oral cavity as part of the differential diagnosis in every patient with an uncommon, persistent oral lesion with unclear origin.","227":"Cervical masses are a common clinical finding, but differential diagnosis is often challenging. Acute neck swellings are often due to deep cervical space infections that have originated at oral or oropharyngeal sites. Deep neck infections originating elsewhere are not rare; however, they are difficult to diagnose, and their origins remain obscure in 20% of cases. Neck swellings that originate in the middle ear are very rare, with only a few reported in the scientific literature. Here we report an atypical case of Bezold's abscess caused by the recurrence of a middle ear cholesteatoma. In patients with neck swelling and a history of primary cholesteatoma of the middle ear, otolaryngologists should consider regional recurrence of disease a possibility even several years after the primary surgery.","228":"Hydatid cysts of the head and neck are rare, even in regions where echinococcal infestation is endemic. Although complications, like cyst rupture and infection, may occur, an external fistula is extremely rare. This study examined a case of hydatid cyst that had fistulized in the right submandibular region of the oral cavity, which eroded the mandible. A 45 year-old female patient visited our clinic with complaints of a discharge that left a bad taste in her mouth that persisted for 1 month and a painless swelling in the right submandibular region that had slowly expanded over the past 5 months. A physical examination revealed a cystic mass located in the right submandibular region that had fistulized in the oral cavity. The results were consistent with a hydatid cyst. We performed submandibular gland exeresis and a marginal mandibulectomy to excise the hydatid cyst together with the fistulous tract. ","229":"To describe the clinical characteristics of a 70-year-old female with occipital neuropathy following bone conduction device surgery. A 65-year-old woman underwent bone conduction device placement surgery on the left temporal bone. Postoperatively she progressively developed chronic pain at the implantation site. The pain led to minimal neck movement, which resulted in complaints of the shoulder and arm on the left side. She was treated by an orthopaedic surgeon for a frozen shoulder. Pain medication and occipital nerve blocking had no sustained effect on the pain. Occipital neuropathy is a syndrome with continuous aching involving the occipital and parietal scalp caused by trauma or peripheral compression of the occipital nerves. The most common causes of occipital neuropathy are probably direct trauma to the nerve and hypertrophic fibrosis of subcutaneous tissue surrounding the nerve. Scar formation after surgery may therefore cause entrapment of the nerve. We describe a case of occipital neuropathy as a complication of BAHA surgery. ","230":"The epithelial cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is important for maintenance normal tissue architecture and for cell-cell communication and immune cell migration. E-cadherin is also present in cholesteatomas. This study determined E-cadherin expression in acquired cholesteatomas and analyzed its expression according to cholesteatoma clinical and histological characteristics. We investigated E-cadherin expression in 30 samples from operated patients with acquired middle ear cholesteatomas that were classified according to their clinical and histological characteristics. E-cadherin expression in cholesteatoma was determined immunohistochemically. A semi quantitative method was used to determine the index of expression of E-cadherin and t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. We found significant expression of E-cadherin on CD1, CD3 total, CD4 (p &lt; 0.05), high expression of E-cadherin on CD8 total and CD19\/CD38 lymphocytes (p &lt; 0.01) and very high expression of E-cadherin on mast cells and antigen-presenting cells, including Langerhans cells (p &lt; 0.005). We graduated results as no statistically significant (p&gt;0.05), statistically significant (0.05 &gt; p &gt; 0.01), highly statistically significant (0.01 &gt; p &gt; 0.005) and very highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.005). E-cadherin expression was the same in the cholesteatoma matrix in all samples. There were no differences in expression according to the clinical and histological characteristics of the cholesteatomas.

Between September 2000 and October 2011, a total of 489 patients underwent cartilage tympanoplasty, while 318 patients had tympanoplasty using fascia. In this study we included patients with a follow-up period of at least 3 years. Exclusion criteria were ossicular chain defects, cholesteatoma, otorrhoea, middle ear granulation or effusion, and a history of middle ear surgery. The cartilage group consisted of 49 patients, with 28 patients being included in the fascia group. Both air conduction hearing thresholds and air bone gaps improved significantly in both groups. However, no statistical significance was found between the results for the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Our study concurs with many others in the literature, clearly indicating that cartilage produces hearing results that are comparable to temporalis muscle fascia grafts. ","232":"The aim was to evaluate the complications and practicability of percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) with and without video endoscopic guidance in critically ill patients. In a retrospective review of patients admitted to a multidisciplinary ICU, PDT was performed under bronchoscopic control in 74 patients and without bronchoscopic control in 113 patients. Both groups were evaluated in similar technical conditions. Complications in both groups were mostly minor. Bleeding or difficult tracheal cannulation occurred in 8 patients in each group. In patients without bronchoscopy, one major bleeding necessitated a switch to open revision, the Murphy eye was punctured (n = 2) and there was one pneumothorax. Furthermore, similar levels of cuff leaks, loss of airway and minor stoma infections were noted in both groups. All tracheostomies were performed bedside with similar manpower. Operation times were shorter in patients without bronchoscopy. Our data about PDT in critically ill patients do not indicate any clear-cut difference in complication rates or practicability in the absence of bronchoscopic guidance when adequate skills and experience have been acquired and simple but effective precautions at each step are adopted. However, randomisation and long-term laryngotracheal followup should be considered in future studies.

In this prospective, open-label observational pilot study, 12 patients suffering from CRS with (CRS+NP) or without (CRS-NP) nasal polyps who had undergone prior sinus surgery were treated with bromelain tablets (500 FIP) for three months. Efficacy was evaluated using symptom scores (Total Symptom Scores: TSS); a Total Rhinoscopy Score (TRS) was also determined. QoL was assessed by using the German, adapted version of the Sinonasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20 GAV). Treatment with bromelain tablets (500 FIP) improved TSS, TRS and SNOT-20 GAV on average. This treatment was found to be more effective, however, for CRS-NP than for CRS+NP. The average intake was six tablets, equivalent to a daily dosage of 3000 FIP. No adverse events were observed. Preliminary results indicate good tolerability, symptom control, and improvement in QoL for the treatment of CRS using bromelain tablets (500 FIP). ","234":"We investigated the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the pathogenesis of sinonasal polyps. Adult patients (21 men, 3 women) with nasal polyposis underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Nine adults without polyps (6 men) who underwent septoplasty and\/or rhinoplasty served as controls. Polyp specimens came from three regions: the maxillary sinus (10), ethmoid sinus (14), and nasal cavity (10). Control group samples (9) came from the inferior turbinate. Specimens were evaluated in eight mucosal layers for count and distribution of inflammatory cells and iNOS expression. An iNOS positivity index (PI) was determined for the epithelium (E), subepithelial layer of the lamina propria (SE), and deep paraglandular layer of the mucosa (D). Polymorphonuclear cell (PMNC) % values of the ethmoid and maxillary sinus and overall ethmoid sinus PI were significantly higher in the polyp group. Patients with longer polyp duration, D-perivascular (D-pv), and a higher Brinkmann index had decreased ethmoid sinus D PIs. However, in older patients and patients with longer polyp duration, perivascular PIs increased in maxillary sinus SE and D, respectively. Furthermore, as PMNC % and iNOS-PMNC PI increased, SE_glandular and epithelial_apical iNOS values decreased. In the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, iNOS_D_. endothelial values increased but decreased in the nasal cavity. iNOS may play a role in sinonasal polyp pathogenesis, especially in mucosal SE and D layers. Increased vascular permeability, stromal edema, inflammatory cell migration into the stroma of the mucosa, and increased mucosal gland secretion may result in polyp formation.

This study describes the endoscopic closure of CSF leaks in a large series (36 patients) at the Jagiellonian University over 10 years (1999 to 2009). We describe the aetiology, defect location, graft material, presence of encephalocele, history of meningitis, intracranial pressure, recurrence, and follow-up. In our studies the aetiology of CSF leak was spontaneous in 4 cases, traumatic in 9, and iatrogenic in 23. The defect was most commonly located near the ethmoid and sphenoid bones. Our initial success rate after transnasal endoscopic treatment was 88.9% (32\/36). However, the overall success rate of 97.2% (35\/36) and the low morbidity in this series support the endoscopic approach as the standard of care for CSF leak closure. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 5 years. Importantly, this high success rate can be achieved without the use of intrathecal fluorescein or a lumbar drain.","236":"Research shows that 51.4% of adverse events in hospitals occur in surgery and that 3-22% of surgical patients experience adverse events. The risk may be even higher when turnover is high and when patients are children, as is often the case in ear, nose and throat surgery. This quality project therefore started in response to requests from physicians in two hospitals in the Flemish part of Belgium. The aim of this study is to use the Healthcare Failure Mode &amp; Effect Analysis method to evaluate the process flow for ear, nose and throat patients, and to redesign the process to enhance patient safety. In two One Day Clinics, processes were prospectively analysed using the Healthcare Failure Mode &amp; Effect Analysis method. Similar potential failures were reported in both hospitals. The major failure mode was linked to the absence of an active identity check throughout the process. The process was therefore redesigned by implementing a surgical safety checklist and an active identity check protocol. Although the Healthcare Failure Mode &amp; Effect Analysis is a time-consuming method, this systematic approach by a multidisciplinary team has been found to be useful in detecting failure modes that need immediate safety responses. The involvement of all disciplines and an open safety culture during the procedure were the most important conditions. The Healthcare Failure Mode &amp; Effect Analysis is a useful instrument for detecting the failure modes in this care process. ","237":"Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) asses the health status or health related quality of life from the patient's perspective. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of adenotonsillectomy on symptoms and daily functioning in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using an electronic questionnaire, and to determine if this is a feasible method to evaluate treatment outcome in this patient population. The electronic questionnaire was administered to the parents of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for SDB on the day of surgery (T0), and two weeks (T1) and six months (T2) after surgery. The questionnaire scored symptoms in 5 different fields (snoring, sleepiness, behaviour, appetite, and apnoea). Higher scores indicated more pronounced symptoms. The score on T0 measured the preoperative symptoms. The main outcome measure (the change in scores between the postoperative measurements and the preoperative measurement) was analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Eighty-eight percent of invited patients participated in the study. Six percent had no access to internet, and another 6% did not wish to participate. Language problems were not reported. Response rates for T1 and T2 were 82.6% and 79.7% respectively. The T1 and T2 scores were significantly lower than the scores on T0 for snoring, behaviour, apnoea, and sleepiness. The T2 appetite score was significantly higher than on T0, which indicates an improvement of appetite. A comparison of pre- and postoperative results from an electronic disease-specific questionnaire indicated significantly improved symptoms and daily functioning in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for SDB. High participation and response rates indicated it was feasible to assess treatment outcome by means of an electronic questionnaire. ","238":"Signs and symptoms of the sinonasal tract may be originated in any organ system. Distinguishing these from original sinonasal disease poses a great diagnostic challenge. The ENT specialist usually faces an unresponsive or relapsing case, with an atypical presentation. We address this issue by trying to provide a wider perspective when dealing with sinonasal manifestations. We reviewed the literature exploring heterogeneous groups of diseases and systemic conditions that might interfere with normal sinonasal physiology. The most current and valid information have been included in an effort to delineate such manifestations and clarify the distinguishing signs and tests. A great variety of systemic conditions with sinonasal manifestations, including connective tissue, autoimmune, infectious, vascular, hematological, gastrointestinal, and endocrine diseases, were included. We address their distinguishing characteristics and diagnostic work-up. Signs and symptoms of the sinonasal tract can originate from either local or systemic disorders. The keys to dealing with such disorders are understanding the patterns in which systemic diseases can manifest, and using special diagnostic tools specific to each condition to confirm or rule out particular diagnoses. ","239":"We present an interesting case of superior and posterior semicircular canal dehiscence in pregnancy. We present a case report and a review of the world literature concerning semicircular canal dehiscence. A 34-year-old woman presented with sound and pressure induced vertigo at 22 weeks gestation. A thinly sliced computed tomography (CT) scan of the petrous temporal bones viewed with coronal reconstructions was performed post-partum. This showed the presence of both left superior canal and posterior canal dehiscence. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of semicircular canal dehiscence in pregnancy. The diagnosis of semicircular canal dehiscence should be suspected in pregnant patients with sound induced vertigo. ","240":"Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition with variable expression. It is a subset of auto-inflammatory diseases characterised by recurrent inflammatory crises and is associated with chronic recurrent urticaria, sensorineural deafness, periodic arthritis and secondary amyloidosis. The diagnosis of MWS is a clinical one with sufferers classically presenting in childhood with a moderate fever and non-pruiginous urticaria. We describe a case of a six-year-old girl who was successfully diagnosed and treated with Anakinra. Muckle and Wells originally described this syndrome in 1962; however, only recently was it discovered to be genetically linked to chromosome 1q44 and subsequently to missense mutations in the CIAS1\/NALP3\/PYPAF1 gene. Since then, treatment has evolved and it remains one of few treatable causes of congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss.","241":"Extracranial meningiomas are common tumours but may occur in unexpected locations. Awareness can avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate management of these tumours. We report the case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male with en plaque meningioma of the external ear canal and an intracranial temporal lobe meningioma. The patient underwent extended canal wall down atticomastoidectomy with preservation of the ossicular chain and tympanic membrane and en bloc resection of the bony posterior canal wall, tumour, and overlying skin. Radical removal of a grade I meningothelial meningioma was achieved. The tegmen tympani and dura were not breached. No connection with the temporal lobe meningioma was demonstrated. The patient recovered completely and experienced a marked improvement in hearing. No clinical signs of recurrent or residual tumour have occurred. Careful clinical examination and extensive radiological workup is required to avoid missing the unusual diagnosis of concurrent meningioma of the temporal bone and temporal lobe, and miss the chance to treat this disease adequately. ","242":"We describe the case of a 12-year-old girl with acute otitis media complicated by acute mastoiditis, epidural empyema, thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus and paralysis of the abducens nerve. The patient underwent a mastoidectomy on the left side combined with drainage of the epidural empyema through an extended burr holl and received intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks and anticoagulation for 12 weeks. This report discusses the intracranial complications of acute otitis media, which were a common problem before the advent of adequate antibiotic drugs but have become rare since their introduction.","243":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of N2O-O2 mixture (Inspired O2 30%) on middle ear pressure (MEP) in children compared with the effects of an air-oxygen mixture (Inspired O2 50%). The study included thirty child patients who underwent general anaesthesia for different reasons, with the exception of ENT problems and ear interventions. They were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 (15 children: 10 male and 5 female) received a N2O-O2 mixture (Inspired O2 30%); and group 2 (15 children: 10 male and 5 female) were given an air-oxygen mixture (Inspired O2 50%). MEP was measured using a portable impedance analyser before the operation (PreO),10 minutes after intubation (10AEn), 30 minutes after intubation (30AEn), 10 minutes before extubation (10BEx), 15 minutes after the operation (PO15), 30 minutes after the operation (PO30), 1 hour after the operation (PO1h) and 6 hours after the operation (PO6h). The pressure and compliance values were the same in groups 1 and 2. The pressure-time graphs for the two groups were different: in Group 2, MEP rose quickly at 10AEn and positive pressure values were seen in the middle ear. MEP then fell rapidly until the end of the surgery and lower and negative pressures (Mean -50 daPa) were observed at PO6h. In Group 1, MEP was elevated at 10AEn and positive pressure was found (but not as high as in Group 2). MEP then fell more slowly. In other words, positive pressure in the middle ear persisted longer and the middle ear was subjected to positive pressure and nitrogen over a longer period. Separate analyses were made in Groups 1 and 2 of pressure differences and of compliance values at eight measurement points using the Friedman test. Differences in pressure values were found to be statistically significant in both Group 1 (p = 0.000) and Group 2 (p = 0.000). In Group 1, all the 10AEn and 30AEn values were significantly higher than the PreO, PO30, PO1h and PO6h values. The 10BEx value was significantly higher than the PreO and PO1h values. The PO15 value was significantly higher than the PreO value. In Group 2, the PO6h value was significantly lower than the 10BEx, 10AEn and 30AEn values. The PO1h value was significantly lower than the 30AEn values. The MEP values increased in Group 1 in younger and taller children and in children receiving anaesthesia for shorter periods. MEP values increased in Group 2 in younger and taller children, and in heavier children. MEP values fell with the length of anaesthesia. In brief anaesthesia, nitrogen was not removed from the middle ear quickly in Group 1: middle ear pressure values were higher. The nitrous oxide remained in the middle ear longer and so the possibility of ear toxicity may increase. In Group 2, 50% O2 was rapidly absorbed and removed from the middle ear and so middle ear pressure was not as high. It may be concluded that air-oxygen mixture (Inspired O2 50%) anaesthesia should be recommended as being more reliable in tympanoplasties and other middle ear interventions than a N2O-O2 mixture (Inspired O2 30%). ","244":"Many people, such as soldiers, are routinely exposed to gunshot noise during target practice. It is suspected that this high-intensity noise may affect audition through repeated Transient Threshold Shifts (TTS); it can also mechanically alter auditory components such as waves. This study investigates the scope of gunshot noise from the AK-47 rifle (Kalashnikov) and the impact on the shooters' audition. Forty soldiers (80 ears) were recruited in this study. They were all young and being exposed to gunshot noise for the first time. Gunshot characteristics were measured before exposure. The soldiers underwent auditory evaluation with Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and Oto-Acoustic Emission (OAE) once before exposure and immediately (less than one hour) after exposure. The AK-47 gunshot noise pressure level varied between L(AIm) = 73.7 dBA to L(AIm) = 111.4 dBA. Fourteen participants had subclinical hearing impairment in their pre-exposure evaluation; this number increased to 16 after the exposure. Six months post-exposure and later, the number of cases with impairment had fallen to eight (improvement in 50%). Both pre- and post-exposure OAE results were within normal values, while PTA results indicated a significant threshold alteration only at 6 kHz. The results of this study confirm that exposure to gunshot noise with no ear protection can represent a significant hazard for auditory function, especially at higher frequencies. ","245":"The purpose of this study is to describe the results of universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) in 2229 newborns and to assess the effectiveness of a two-stage automated transient evoked otoacoustic emission (a-TEOAE) test protocol. Between May 2007 and January 2008, a universal newborn hearing screening program, instituting two-stage a-TEOAE, was evaluated. The hearing status of the newborns who failed the two-stage screening tests were evaluated with the auditory brainstem response (ABR) test during the diagnostic stage. The risk factors for hearing loss determined by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing Loss (JCIH) and prematurity, consanguineous marriage, and birth type as presumptive risk factors were recorded. During the study period, 2229 newborns were screened. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was identified in 8 newborns. Fourteen newborns were lost to follow-up. One hundred thirty six newborns were high-risk neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients. The prevalence of SNHL was 2.9% (4\/136) in NICU newborns, and 0.19% (4\/2079) in the well-baby nursery. SNHL prevalence in the study group overall was found to be 0.36% (8\/2215). Craniofacial anomalies and family history of hearing loss were found to be significantly related to SNHL in newborns. Prematurity and consanguinity that are not listed among JCIH risk factors were also found to be statistically significantly related with SNHL. This is the first report of a universal hearing screening program in the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. Two-stage a-TEOAE is an efficient and feasible hospital-based screening protocol in newborns. ","246":"To understand the relationship between the vidian canal and surrounding structures of the sphenoid sinus, and to discover factors related to the formation of various canal corpus types using preoperative computed tomography (CT). This retrospective study included 265 patients with 570 sides of identifiable vidian canal. All patients underwent paranasal sinus CT with 3-mm contiguous coronal and axial sections. Subsequently, the relationships amongst the different canal corpus types, pneumatization of the pterygoid recesses, morphometric parameters, and surrounding anatomical landmarks were investigated. Dehiscence of the bony roof of the canal was much more commonly seen in canal corpus types 2 and 3 than type 1 (p &lt; 0.001). The presence of pterygoid recess pneumatization was more commonly seen in canal corpus types 2 and 3. More extensive pneumatization of the pterygoid recess was associated with a greater distance from the canal to the foramen rotundum (p &lt; 0.001), but there were no significant differences in the distance from the vidian canal to the vomerine crest (p = 0.465). Pterygoid recess pneumatization might alter the position of the vidian canal relative to the sphenoid corpus and the distance to the foramen rotundum, but not the distance to the vomerine crest. Therefore, analyzing the canal corpus type and pneumatization of the pterygoid recess may play a key role when choosing a surgical approach in endoscopic vidian neurectomy. ","247":"The aim of this study was to determine vitamin B12 levels in patients with non-pulsatile tinnitus and to assess the efficacy of replacement treatment in tinnitus and hearing in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. We assessed 100 patients (mean age, 43.87, SD 10.12; 62 females, 38 males) and 20 healthy volunteers (9 females, 11 males). Patients whose blood serum vitamin B12 levels were below 180 pg\/mL were deemed to be vitamin B12-deficient. The effect of vitamin B12 replacement treatment on hearing was examined using audiometric tests between 250 and 20000 Hz, and we compared results with a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after treatment, which helped to produce an objective assessment of the therapeutic results in tinnitus. Tinnitus was found to be unilateral in 57% of cases (the right ear in 56% and the left ear in 44% of these cases) and bilateral in 43% of cases. Of the patients with tinnitus, 63 had low B12 vitamin levels, and 37 had normal B12 vitamin levels. No statistically significant difference was found with the control group levels (p = 0.80, odds ratio = 1.13). No significant change was observed in tinnitus severity after vitamin B12 therapy. Eight of these patients reported some relief in tinnitus on the VAS, but the rate of improvement was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). In the tinnitus patients with low B12 vitamin levels, audiometric tests conducted after B12 vitamin treatment revealed a significant improvement in hearing levels only at the 250 Hz frequency. No change was observed at other frequencies. B12 replacement treatment was not effective in these patients with tinnitus. Some patients improved following vitamin B12 supplementation but the results were not significant. More studies are needed to find the reasons for, and effective treatment of, tinnitus since the aetiology of subjective tinnitus is highly variable. ","248":"To investigate the function of the auditory efferent system in patients with chronic idiopathic tinnitus, but normal pure-tone audiograms. We studied 15 subjects with normal hearing that had experienced either unilateral or bilateral persistent tinnitus for at least 3 months. The ears of the 15 subjects were classified into tinnitus-positive-ear (TPE) and tinnitus-negative-ear (TNE) groups. The control-ear group (CE) comprised the ears of 15 subjects with normal hearing and no tinnitus. We measured different types of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), including spontaneous (SOAEs), transient evoked (TEOAEs), and distortion product (DPOAEs). We also analyzed contralateral suppression of OAEs and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). Data were compared among TPE, TNE, and CE groups. The data associated with cochlear mechanics, including the prevalence of SOAEs, the number of SOAE peaks, and the overall TEOAE responses in the absence of a contralateral stimulus, were not significantly different among the TPE, TNE, and CE groups. In the TPE group, contralateral stimuli failed to significantly suppress overall TEOAEs, and contralateral suppression of DPOAEs was significantly reduced over a limited frequency range. Furthermore, the TPE group showed prolonged latencies in waves III and V of ABRs. This study demonstrated that abnormal contralateral suppression of OAEs and ABRs indicated a dysfunction in the ipsilateral efferent medial olivocochlear system; this might play a role in normal-hearing tinnitus. ","249":"Acne formation is a common dermatological problem which, if left untreated, may lead to severe facial scars, a consideration that may be particularly important for patients who seek cosmetic surgery. Postrhinoplasty acne development has not yet been discussed in the literature. We therefore decided to evaluate the occurrence of acne in nasal plastic surgery in a case-control study. One hundred and twenty patients were selected for this case-control study and were then assigned to case and control groups, each consisting of 60 patients. None of the participants was a known case of acne and those with any specific skin condition were excluded from the study. The cases were patients whose external nasal structures had been affected by the procedure; the control group consisted of matched patients who were candidates for closed septoplasty. After the operation, acne formation was evaluated in all participants and a comparison was made between cases and controls looking at the surgical method employed, and at the patients' personal and family backgrounds. Twelve patients, all from the case group, developed postsurgical acne; all these patients had undergone open rhinoplasty. Age, gender, family history for acne and recent medication use prior to the surgery showed no significant correlation with acne formation. The incidence of acne after nasal plastic surgery was significantly higher than in the control group, especially when the method of surgery was open rhinoplasty. ","250":"Laryngopharyngeal reflux has been implicated as a causative factor in the aetiology of sleep related breathing disorders. However there are no reports on the association of this disorder and primary snoring in the absence of obstructive sleep apnoea. This study was undertaken to investigate any link between primary snoring and the presence of laryngopharyngeal reflux. A matched case-control study was performed in a district general Ear Nose Throat outpatient population in the United Kingdom. Twenty six patients referred for snoring without sleep apnoea (cases) were individually matched for gender, body mass index and age, to 26 patients referred for other otorhinolaryngological complaints (controls). Snoring was not an exclusion criterion for the controls. Exclusion criteria for both groups were previous referral or treatment for snoring and\/or sleep apnoea, nasal obstruction symptoms (as a potential cause of snoring), and known history of gastrooesophageal reflux with medical treatment longer than two months. The main outcome measure was prevalence of laryngopharyngeal reflux based on the Reflux Symptom Index score. Patients seeking medical advice for primary snoring are fourteen times more likely to report Reflux Symptom Index scores of more than 13 than controls. Laryngopharyngeal reflux may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of primary snoring in the absence of sleep apnoea. This constitutes 3b level of evidence. ","251":"Preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the two most widely accepted diagnostic techniques used for the assessment of parotid gland tumours. We retrospectively evaluated the ability of FNAC and MRI to predict malignancy in parotid gland tumours. Over a period of 10 years (2002-2011), parotidectomy for primary parotid gland tumours was performed in a consecutive series of 178 patients. Preoperative MRI was performed in 75% (133\/178) of cases, and preoperative FNAC was performed in 70% of cases (124\/178). Both modalities were applied in 53% (94\/178) of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were analyzed retrospectively for each subgroup of patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for predicting malignancy were 45%, 89%, and 84%, respectively, for FNAC (including only diagnostic cytology), and 40%, 88%, and 81%, respectively, for MRI. In the subgroup of patients who underwent both MRI and FNAC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 50%, 85%, and 80%, respectively. Preoperative MRI values improved significantly after introduction of diffusion-weighted (DW) acquisition in 2007 (71%, 93%, and 91%, respectively). Compared to previously published results, the high number of nondiagnostic smears and the low sensitivity rates in our series were disappointing, In part, this can be explained by the low percentage of malignant tumours and the high number of low-grade tumours among these. We discuss possibilities for improving preoperative performance, such as ultrasound-guided FNAC. ","252":"Adult rhabdomyoma is a rare benign tumour that arises from skeletal muscle. It is mostly found in the head and neck region, and it should be included in the differential diagnosis of benign lesions. A 62-year-old man presented with dysphagia, and flexible endoscopy revealed a submucosal mass obliterating the right pyriform sinus. Computed tomography imaging revealed that the mass was hyperattenuated and extended from the right pyriform sinus to the true vocal cord. The mass was excised transorally under general anesthesia with a carbon dioxide laser. Microscopically, the tumour demonstrated features of adult-type rhabdomyoma. One year after surgery, the patient had no signs of recurrence. Rhabdomyoma is a rare neoplasm of the pyriform sinus. This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumours in this region. ","253":"The concomitant appearance of an inverted papilloma and a fungus ball in unilateral maxillary sinus is rare. These disease entities may be difficult to distinguish before surgery. A male patient presented with the characteristic symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. A preoperative sinus computed tomography scan revealed unilateral sinus opacification, hyperdense calcified spots, and bony erosion of the medial maxillary sinus wall. During the operation, a cheesy, clay-like fungus ball was removed. In addition, a papillary appearance of the sinus mucosa led to the suspicion of inverted papilloma behind the fungus ball and nasal polyps. The histopathology showed an inverted papilloma concomitant with a fungal ball and some inflammatory polyps. In addition to preoperative imaging, one should be aware of the potential etiology; careful intraoperative reevaluation is imperative for clinicians to avoid misdiagnosis and to provide adequate management of the underlying disease. ","254":"Palatal myoclonus (PM) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the soft palate musculature causing objective clicking tinnitus. Two forms are recognized as distinct clinical entities, with poorly understood pathogenesis: essential and symptomatic PM. The intrusive nature of the tinnitus prompts patients to seek medical advice. Conventional medical treatments with anxiolytics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants have limited efficacy in these patients. In this case report, electromyography-guided injection of botulinum toxin type A (Botox; Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) to the involved salpingopharyngeus and tensor veli palatini yielded satisfactory results with minimal temporary adverse effects.","255":"Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis (NEO) is a life-threatening progressive infection of the external auditory canal, mastoid, and skull base. Here, we review the clinical findings for a series of NEO patients. This case review study includes 18 patients with NEO (males: 11 (61.11%), females: 7 (38.88%), with a mean age of 65.11 years (range: 40-79)), hospitalized at Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan province, Iran, during 2007-2011. The most common presentations were otalgia 18 (100%), otorrhea 15 (83.33%), edema and erythema of the external ear canal 14 (77.77%), and hearing loss 11 (61.11%). We found osteomyelitis of the skull base that involved cranial nerves (most commonly the facial nerve) in 8 patients (44.44%), which seemed to be a higher incidence than reported in previous studies. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in ear specimen cultures in only 7 cases (38.88%), which could be attributed to inappropriate topical and oral use of antipseudomonal agents before proper diagnosis. Nine patients underwent surgical debridement. All cases responded to systemic antipseudomonal antibiotics with no mortality. However, recurrence occurred during the follow-up period in two cases; yet, the patients responded to retreatment. The life expectancy is increasing for diabetic and immunocompromised patients; thus, it is necessary to identify those who have a high risk for NEO, especially older diabetic patients who complain of otalgia and otorrhea that are resistant to routine treatment. Immediate diagnosis and proper treatment is crucial to prevent complications and mortality. ","256":"A 46-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with complaints of aural fullness and hearing loss for two days. On audiometric examination, she had sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. Mean pure tone audiometry (PTA) was 53dB. Her medical history was significant for oral medication-controlled diabetes mellitus and chronic thyroiditis. Laboratory studies showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 40 mm\/h and an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) level of 33.1 EU\/ml. ANCA-associated vasculitis was considered. The patient was started on immunosuppressive treatment. Seven months after the initial episode, the patient suffered a relapse. At 17 month follow-up after the initial event, the patient is healthy with normal hearing. Serum MPO-ANCA is within normal limits.","257":"Many patients with reflux disease present with atypical symptoms (globus pharyngeus, constant throat clearing, chronic cough, hoarseness, catarrh, dysphagia, halitosis, choking episodes, or asthma-like symptoms) due to laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Because such patients can be easily misdiagnosed, doctors in primary care should be aware of LPR and its proper treatment. This study aimed to determine whether doctors working in the primary care setting are aware of the atypical manifestations of reflux and the differences in treatment between LPR and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This study was conducted among primary care doctors referring to the Ear, Nose, and Throat department of Karditsa (Greece) General Hospital. A questionnaire regarding the clinical manifestation and treatment of GERD and LPR was supplied to 60 doctors working in the primary care setting of Karditsa prefecture. Fifty-one doctors returned the questionnaire. Twenty-three (45%) were acquainted with the entity of LPR and 8 (15.7%) were acquainted with the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI). The most common symptoms, for which proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were prescribed, were: heartburn (76.5%), heartburn combined with other symptoms (17.6%), halitosis (1.96%), hoarseness (1.96%), and choking episodes (1.96%). Most of the surveyed doctors prescribed PPIs for fewer than 12 weeks (92%), once daily (70.6%), and preferably in the morning (50%). Forty-seven (92%) provided advice regarding lifestyle modifications. The majority of surveyed doctors were unaware of LPR or the RSI. More awareness is required in the primary care setting to recognize LPR early and treat it properly. ","258":"To investigate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of deep neck abscesses in different deep neck spaces and to evaluate the false-positive results. We retrospectively analysed the clinical charts, CT examinations, surgical findings, bacteriology, pathological examinations and complications of hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of deep neck abscess from 2004 to 2010. The positive predictive values (PPV) for the prediction of abscesses by CT scan in different deep neck spaces were calculated individually on the basis of surgical findings. A total of 162 patients were included in this study. All patients received both intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage. The parapharyngeal space was the most commonly involved space. The overall PPV for the prediction of deep neck abscess with contrast-enhanced CT was 79.6%. The PPV was 91.3% when more than one deep neck space was involved but only 50.0% in patients with isolated retropharyngeal abscesses. In the false-positive group, cellulitis was the most common final result, followed by cystic degeneration of cervical metastases. Five specimens taken intra-operatively revealed malignancy and four of these were not infected. There are some limitations affecting the differentiation of abscesses and cellulitis, particularly in the retropharyngeal space. A central necrotic cervical metastatic lymph node may sometimes also mimic a simple pyogenic deep neck abscess on both clinical pictures and CT images. Routine biopsy of the tissue must be performed during surgical drainage. ","259":"1) To evaluate the effectiveness and side-effects of endoscopic surgical treatment for maxillary sinus fungus balls, and to describe approaches to limiting recurrence of the disease and surgical complications. 2) To compare the results of this nasal endoscopic treatment with the results of treatment using a vestibular approach to the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus as described in the literature. An institutional retrospective review was conducted for patients undergoing treatment for a maxillary sinus fungus ball using endonasal surgery alone from January 2005 to December 2010. A total of 100 patients were included in the study (58 women and 42 men, average age 54 years). The median follow-up time was 32 months. Three patients had a recurrence after our team performed endonasal surgery. No patients experienced complications. Our results are consistent with previous findings, indicating that the postoperative complication rate for endonasal surgery is low by comparison with the vestibular approach. Both techniques have similar outcomes. The nasal endoscopic route offers similar rates of success with a negligible complication rate. ","260":"We analyzed the effects of stereotactic radiosurgery on tumour control and cranial nerve function in patients with vestibular schwannomas (VS) secondary to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Irradiation was performed with a Gamma Knife, model C equipped with a high-precision, robotized positioning system (APS). This study included 18 patients with 25 VSs secondary to NF2 that were treated from 2001 to 2010 with radiosurgery at our Gamma Knife Center. The radiosurgical procedure included high-resolution conformational dose-planning with multiple, small-diameter isocenters, a single-fraction, low-dose irradiation prescription, and highly accurate gamma rays delivery to the target with the APS. The median follow-up time was 4.4 y. For 16 tumours in 12 patients with available follow-up data, we observed an actuarial tumour control of 87.5% at 2 y and 80.2% at 5 y, based on the Kaplan-Meier method. No patient developed facial weakness. Serviceable hearing was preserved in 78% of cases. Patients treated for bilateral and unilateral tumours had similar outcomes. Radiosurgery could control tumour growth and preserve hearing function and facial weakness in patients with VS secondary to NF2. The enhanced techniques of radiosurgical irradiation provided with the Gamma Knife model C have improved the results of this treatment alternative to microsurgery. ","261":"A decreasing but still substantial proportion of elderly persons with hearing aids use them only occasionally. Because the prevalence of age-related hearing loss is increasing, it is important for the hearing rehabilitation process to be effective. The aim of this study was to use a mailed questionnaire to evaluate the rate of hearing aid use and the reasons for minimal use or nonuse. Questions about hearing aid use and associated problems were included in a survey of hearing mailed to 4,067 people in age cohorts of 70, 75, 80 and 85 years in an industrialized urban community in Finland. In this sample of 249 hearing aid users, 55.4% used their hearing aid daily, and 27.3% used it &gt; 6 hours a day. The percentage of subjects who never used their hearing aid was 10.7%. Use of hearing aids tended to decline with advancing age. The most common reasons for minimal use were disturbing background noise, acoustic feedback problems, battery cost, and a lack of motivation to use the hearing aid. Compliance with hearing aid use by the elderly is increasing, but a significant proportion of hearing aids are still used only occasionally or never. We discuss methods to improve compliance in this patient group. Our results may be used to reexamine existing procedures for fitting hearing aids for counseling, which may increase patient compliance with hearing aids, leading to greater benefits from their use. ","262":"To analyse temporal bone erosion sites (including scutum, labyrinth, facial canal, mastoid tegmen, posterior fossa dural plate and sigmoid sinus plate) in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Retrospective case review in a tertiary referral centre. Medical records were reviewed from 905 patients (121 complicated; 784 non-complicated) who received a mastoidectomy as a minimum intervention for the treatment of CSOM. All types of temporal bone erosion were found to be more frequent in patients with complicated CSOM. Erosion in the scutum, mastoid tegmen, posterior fossa dural plate and labyrinth was observed significantly more frequently in complicated-CSOM patients with a cholesteatoma. Granulation\/polyp tissue invaded the sigmoid sinus and facial canal at a rate similar to cholesteatoma. Our study demonstrates that bone erosion is more frequent in complicated-CSOM patients. Temporal bone erosion can be seen in both cholesteatomatous and non-cholesteatomatous CSOM patients. Granulation\/polyp tissue was as important as cholesteatoma in the erosion of the facial canal and sigmoid sinus plate. ","263":"To investigate the reliability of preoperative computed tomography (CT) in patients with chronic otitis media (COM) as assessed by otologist-ENT surgeons, compared with surgical findings and respective radiological assessments, and to identify areas of the middle ear that are difficult to evaluate reliably with preoperative CT. Fifty patients with COM underwent preoperative temporal bone CT reported by a qualified radiologist. Each operating surgeon completed a standardized questionnaire regarding the status of 10 middle-ear structures after the operation. Two otologists blindly reviewed the scans. AC1-statistics between the radiology\/otology report and the intra-operative findings were calculated. In the attic, malleus-incus complex, tympanic cavity, and round window niche, the otologists' assessments of CT scans corresponded better to intra-operative findings than did the respective radiology report. In the lateral semicircular canal and sigmoid sinus, the otologists' assessments also outperformed those of the radiologists in cases of erosion. Radiological assessments outperformed those of otologists in only one of 10 studied areas: confirmation of an unexposed dura in the tegmen area. The scutum and oval window represent difficult areas for which to obtain a reliable preoperative CT scan report. Otologists' assessments regarding the pre-surgical status of the temporal bone in COM appear more reliable than those of radiologists. This finding has serious implications in current clinical practice, and should be considered when designing strategies for Radiology Head &amp; Neck training. The inherent limitations of CT may necessitate modifications to imaging and operating strategies. ","264":"To monitor the noise exposure of care providers during otological surgery due to drilling and suction in the operating room. A clinical study monitoring different standard otosurgical procedures was conducted; cochlear implantation (CI), mastotympanoplasty, and mastoidectomy alone. Noise exposure to the surgeon and assistant were monitored with wireless personal noise dosimetry and stationary sound monitoring. Both maximum peak level in dBC (Lpeak) and time-average sound pressure level in dBA (equivalent level or Leq) were measured during drilling episodes. Frequency analysis in one third octaves covering the frequency bands 6.3 Hz to 20 k Hz was performed using a sound analyzing program. When averaged over the entire procedure, the sound pressure level was highest for the surgeon and the assistant with values of 76.0 dBA and 72.5 dBA, respectively, during CI. Lpeak was 135.9 dBC. Leq for the stationary sound measurement was 74.2 dBA. During cortical bone work using a cutting burr, 84.6 dBA was measured. Mean values of L95% (estimation of the background noise) were between 55.8 dBA and 61.2 dBA. Frequency analysis showed the highest sound pressure level for all procedures was between 2.5 kHz and 3.15 kHz. This is the first study to use personal sound dosimetry to monitor noise exposure during otosurgical drilling. In accordance with other studies, the results presented show sound levels below international occupational noise level regulations. However, the measured noise exposure during drilling could have negative effects on care providers based on unfavorable acoustical comfort.

These guidelines provide a framework for both the medical and surgical treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as otitis media, allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic inflammation of tonsils and adenoids, and laryngitis. In addition, the role of vaccinations and immunomodulatory therapies is discussed. Whenever possible, the evidence levels for specific treatments comply with the Oxford Levels of Evidence.","268":"Children undergoing medical or surgical treatment for ENT disorders should receive care from doctors familiar with the specificities of paediatric ENT pathology working in dedicated clinics where there are facilities for the activities that children usually indulge in and accommodation for parents. Many aspects of care for children with ENT problems involve a multidisciplinary team consisting of ENT surgeons working alongside a range of medical and paramedical professionals and nurses specifically trained in childcare, as well as in ENT nursing. Within this multidisciplinary approach, we will discuss some important aspects of the psychosocial approach and nursing, anaesthesia and pharmacotherapy that should be considered in order to raise the safety and quality of patient care in paediatric otorhinolaryngology.","269":"Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is a common paediatric\/otolaryngological disorder that may be associated with secondary growth or facial growth impairment, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive deficits, or smell loss. Surgical removal of the hypertrophic tissue eliminates the mechanical obstacle of the airways and is therefore curative in most cases. The purpose of the present review is to outline the impact of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and adenotonsillectomy on growth, facial growth, sleep, behaviour and smell.","270":"Hearing processing and communication abilities development may be influenced by chronic inflammation of the airways in children, especially in case of otitis media and\/or adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The present review summarizes the influence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy on speech abilities as well as the consequences of otitis media, with a particular focus on peripheral and central hearing, on the development of language, attention, and memory skills.","271":"In children, all ENT cavities are particularly prone to the development of chronic inflammation. This is due to many predisposing factors, of which the most common are unfavourable anatomy, absence of nasal blowing, day care attendance, allergy, immature immunity, gastro-oesophageal reflux and tobacco smoke exposure. The aim of this paper is to outline the most specific paediatric clinical aspects of chronic pharyngo-tonsillitis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, adenoiditis and laryngotracheitis and the important influence that some of these pathologies exert on the others.","272":"Air pollution is one of the great problems of this century and it plays an important role in the increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory problems in the upper airway in children. Since their lungs and immune system are not fully developed when exposure begins, newborns and children appear to be more sensitive to the effects of both outdoor and indoor air pollution. Furthermore, children spend most of their time indoors and are exposed more often to pollutants in indoor air. The link between health problems, chemical products and allergens (the latter mainly from cats and mites) has been extensively studied. Other important indoor contaminants are fungi, which are often present in damp buildings and can cause severe respiratory disease by producing spores, allergens, volatile irritant compounds and toxins. A proper identification of mould contamination of this kind is vital for correct diagnosis, treatment and the prevention of health problems, and improvements have been observed after the removal or cleaning of the contaminated materials and improvements to the ventilation of buildings. While a possible association between respiratory symptoms, such as rhinitis, and the presence of fungi in the indoor environment has been documented by several authors, other studies have observed no significant relationship. The development of standardised sampling, detection and diagnostic tests will be essential to understand the proper role of fungi in the indoor atmosphere and their impact on public health.","273":"A child's immune system cannot depend on a memory-type immune response and it also induces cytokine responses less efficiently. Biological conditions like allergy or cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency or gastrooesophageal reflux can induce and maintain background inflammation in children's upper airways, making newborns and children more susceptible to upper airway infections and inflammations. This paper will describe in brief how allergy, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency, nasal and paranasal anatomical variants, and gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) can affect the immune and inflammatory responses in upper airways and how they could interfere with immunity development and maturation in children. Literature review. Chronic inflammation induced by infection, allergy, cystic fibrosis or immune deficiency is multifactorial in origin and is strongly influenced by physiological, immunological, anatomical, environmental and, above all, genetic parameters. Finally, the direct role played by nasal and paranasal anatomical variants and GOR is also discussed. These conditions should be screened systematically in all children presenting chronic clinical features of upper airway inflammation. ","274":"A child's immune system has to initiate the immune response from scratch and cannot depend on a memory-type of immune response. Moreover, the immune system in newborns is also less efficient in inducing cytokine responses. In consequence, newborns and children are more susceptible to upper-airway infections and inflammation than adults. This manuscript summarises basic considerations relating to immune and inflammatory response in the upper airways and presents data about the processes involved in immunity development and maturation in children. Literature review. Inflammation is a complex set of interactions between soluble factors and cells that can arise in any tissue in response to both exogenous (infectious, toxic...) and endogenous (auto-immune, ischaemia...) insults. It interacts actively with the adaptive immune response by launching the antigen processing and presenting phases. Reduced cytotoxic response during foetal life, poor T-lymphocyte response to mitogens, immaturity of T and B lymphocytes, inadequate cytokine synthesis, a marked deficiency of antibody production and reduced neutrophil, complement and natural killer activity are important contributors to the complex physiological deficiency of immunological function in neonates and young children. The importance of the control and self-limitation of the inflammatory reaction is demonstrated by observations that, in certain chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions, the inflammatory response causes more damage to the host than the microbe. ","275":"This paper outlines the normal functioning of the child's upper airway: defending the lower airway by means of air conditioning, filtration, initiation of inflammatory reactions or immune responses. We investigate the hypothetical mechanisms that explain the influence of, and interrelations between, mouth breathing and obstructive sleep apnoea on craniofacial development. We advise orthodontic diagnosis and\/or intervention at a young age.","276":"This paper reviews the contribution of the different parts of the oral cavity and the pharynx to the basic physiology of breathing, phonation, speech, swallowing, and of Waldeyer's ring to the functioning of the immune system.

Traditional literature data, mainly emanating from text books, were supplemented with information based on a non-structured PubMed search covering the last two decades. Historical knowledge has most often been confirmed, sometimes supplemented and only rarely challenged by present-day studies. Recent studies focus mainly on the clinical application of modern imaging techniques. Interest in the development of relevant parts of the upper respiratory system remains as lively as ever. Imaging techniques with low or absent radiation exposure may give rise to a novel field of research, especially with respect to paediatric rhinosinusitis. ","278":"","279":"Approximately 90% of tumours of cerebellopontine angle and internal auditory canal are vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas) and meningiomas. Lipochoristomas are rare benign masses that represent only 0.15% of cases. We report the case of a 39-year-old man who consulted us for right-sided hearing loss and tinnitus. Tonal audiometry showed a down-sloping right sensorineural hearing loss in frequencies above 2000 Hz. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a heterogeneous lesion in the right internal auditory canal with areas of hyperintensity on noncontrast T1-weighted MRI and suppression of much of the signal of the lesion with persistence of some areas of enhancement on T1-weighted fat-suppressed images. Correct imaging diagnosis through MRI (high signal intensity on noncontrast T1-weighted images together with a missing signal in fat suppression sequences) is essential in order to avoid unnecessary surgery or radiation therapy, which are not recommended in the treatment of these lesions. ","280":"A 62-year-old man complaining of vertigo and progressive hearing loss was diagnosed with an arachnoid cyst at the right cerebellopontine angle based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this case-report, we used computed tomography (CT) cisternography to determine whether the arachnoid cyst communicated with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space. Differentiating between a noncommunicating and communicating arachnoid cyst is required for presurgical evaluation. CT cisternography is a less used but reliable radiological technique for determining the presence of communication, and could therefore be included in the diagnostic work-up of arachnoid cysts. The patient underwent surgery with fenestration of the arachnoid cyst; his vertigo improved and his hearing was preserved.","281":"Extraosseous plasmacytoma (EOP) is a rare plasma cell proliferative disorder that commonly affects the head and neck region. We report the first case of a plasmacytoma of the lacrimal duct. A 66-year-old man presented with an isolated plasmacytoma of the right lacrimal duct and was treated surgically. The tumour grew slowly for a few months. CT scan and MRI showed a right lateral nasal mass extending from the right lacrimal duct toward the floor of the right maxillary sinus. The lesion was removed completely by endoscopic nasal surgery. EOP accounts for up to 3% of all plasma cell tumours. Management of this rare lesion involves surgery and radiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Guided by a literature review, we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic management of EOP. ","282":"In Belgium, thyroidectomy is currently an inpatient procedure because of potential life-threatening post-operative complications that include hypocalcemia, laryngeal nerve damage and haemorrhage. Thyroidectomy can only be performed on an outpatient basis if the complication rate is low. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of outpatient hemithyroidectomy. Between March 2008 and September 2010 we selected 54 patients who met our inclusion criteria for outpatient hemithyroidectomy. The procedure was carried out through a standard cervicotomy under general anaesthesia. No drains were used. We analysed patient outcome based on complications, unplanned admissions and readmissions. The mean age of the 54 patients was 46 years, and most of them were women (81%). The mean duration of surgery was 64 minutes, and there were no intra-operative complications. After an observation period of at least 3 hours, 44 patients (81.5%) were discharged as planned. Ten patients (18.5%) required admission for urine retention (n = 1), social circumstances (n = 1), persistence of nausea (n = 3), delayed anaesthesia recovery (n = 4) and patient preference (n = 1). All 10 were discharged the next day, and none were readmitted. Our study shows that outpatient hemithyroidectomy performed by experienced surgeons in carefully selected patients can be safe and is associated with a low complication rate. However, this series is small and larger studies are needed to confirm the results. ","283":"To investigate the role of smoking, alcohol, coffee consumption, demographic factors, toxic agents, and occupation in laryngeal carcinogenesis. A case-control study included 70 patients with histologically confirmed laryngeal cancer and 70 controls with non-neoplastic conditions unrelated to diet\/smoking\/alcohol. Relative risk, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multiple logistic regression. Current smokers had 19.46 OR of laryngeal cancer compared to non-smokers (p = 0.006). The respective OR for alcohol consumption was 3.94 (p = 0.006). While the risk increased in heavy drinkers, there was no difference in duration of alcohol consumption. There was a strong and consistent relation between laryngeal cancer and the consumption of Greek\/Turkish coffee cups\/day (p = 0.002, OR = 1.77). Diesel exhaust fumes also seemed to increase the risk of laryngeal cancer, although the association was found to be no longer significant after analysis with logistic regression. The present study confirmed the relation of smoking and alcohol with laryngeal cancer. However, other factors such as coffee and diesel exhaust fumes may play an important role in laryngeal carcinogenesis. ","284":"To investigate whether mean platelet volume (MPV) levels rise in patients with nasal polyposis (NP) and whether higher MPV levels are correlated to the extension of polyps in these patients. This study included 50 patients with NP and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects as controls. The Lund-Mackay staging system was used to assess paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with NP, and paranasal sinus CT scores were recorded. MPV was measured in a blood sample collected in EDTA tubes and was also used for whole blood counts in all patients. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Student's t-test were used to compare the results of the two groups. NP patients had higher MPV levels than the control group (9.60 +\/- 1.06 fl and 8.77 +\/- 0.88 fl, p &lt; 0.001 respectively). However, there was no significant correlation between MPV and paranasal sinus CT scores. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate MPV levels in patients with NP. Our results suggest that MPV, a determinant of platelet activation, is elevated in patients with NP. Increased platelet activation may be related to an increase in cardiovascular risk in patients with NP. ","285":"Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps is an uncommon pathology in the pediatric population and may be associated with systemic disease. In this study we aimed to characterize children who underwent nasal surgery at our medical center due to nasal polyps and review the current literature related to pediatric nasal polyps. We retrospectively reviewed all medical records of patients younger than 18 years who had sinus surgery from 2000 to 2010. We collected demographic and clinical data including age, sex, laterality, revision operations, and comorbidities including asthma, allergy, and cystic fibrosis (CF). Thirty-one patients age 8.8 to 18 years (mean 13.7) were treated surgically in our hospital. Thirteen had antrochoanal polyp, 16 had chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, and 2 had mucocele. Among patients treated for nasal polyps, there were 6 boys and 10 girls, mean age was 14.2 years, and 14 (87.5%) had bilateral disease. Mean Lund McKay score was 15.8. Five (31.2%) had asthma, 15 (93.7%) had sleep breathing disorder, and none had known allergy. Three patients (18.7%) had more than one surgery, including one patient with CF. Nine healthy children were tested for CF; one was positive. Nasal polyps in children are more common in teenagers, are usually bilateral, and are commonly associated with bronchial asthma. There was no association with allergy. Meticulous anamnesis and a high index of suspicion are recommended to manage other comorbidities. ","286":"To evaluate the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in middle ear effusion from Chinese adult patients with otitis media with effusion (OME). A total of 60 aspiration samples collected from adult patients (ranging from 19 to 73 years old) were included in the study. The effusion samples aspirated from the patients' middle ears were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and cultured for 7 days under microaerobic conditions. Subsequently, Gram staining and urease testing were performed to identify HP. Of the 60 middle ear effusion samples, 24 (40%) were shown to be HP-positive by PCR assay. Of these, seven specimens were confirmed HP-positive by both culture and urease test. The present study clearly demonstrates the presence of HP in the middle ear effusion of some Chinese adult patients with OME. This finding suggests that HP may be involved in the etiology of OME. Additional studies are needed to investigate the exact role of HP in the pathogenesis of OME.

The patient was successfully treated with endovascular embolization.","288":"To evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of hearing-impaired children fitted with either a cochlear implant and a hearing aid or bilateral hearing aids, and to compare their outcomes with those of normal-hearing peers. We also investigated the impact of demographic, clinical, and audiological results on QOL. Cross-sectional study using a generic QOL questionnaire. Questionnaires were completed by children and their parents. Eighty-eight children were divided into three groups: bilateral deaf children with a cochlear implant and a contralateral hearing aid (bimodal group), bilateral deaf children with bilateral hearing aids (hearing aid group), and normal-hearing children. The Spanish version of the KINDLr test was used. Responses were correlated with demographic, clinical, and audiological data. The questionnaires revealed a high health-related QOL with a total self-rating score for the children and a proxy score for the parents of 75 or higher in five out of six domains. No significant difference was found in the QOL among the three groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the self-rating and the proxy total scores, and no significant association was found between the QOL and the variables of the study. Our results indicate a high level of QOL in hearing-impaired children and their families following treatment with either bilateral hearing aids or bimodal stimulation. Children and their parents reported a QOL similar to that of normal-hearing children. ","289":"Recent studies show that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may also affect the macula of the saccule. We investigated vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) results in patients with BPPV. The study group included 31 patients (31 ears) diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV and the control group included 23 healthy volunteers (46 ears) with no neurotologic symptoms. After VEMP recordings were performed, mean latency values for p13 of the study and control groups were compared. VEMP responses were elicited in all controls (46 ears). In the study group, responses were normal in 19, delayed in 5, and absent in 7 ears. There was a significant difference between abnormal VEMP rates for patients versus controls (p &lt; 0.001). Although VEMP responses were elicited in all non-affected ears of patients, there was a delayed response in 6 (19%) non-affected ears. This was statistically significant when compared with controls (p = 0.002). There was no correlation between abnormal VEMPs and the number of canalith reposition maneuvers required (p = 0.392). Our findings suggest the prolongation of mean latency values for p13 of VEMP in patients with BPPV might signify neuronal degeneration in the macula of the saccule, and the absence of VEMP waves might represent the extent of damage. Also, high latency values for p13 in non-affected ears of patients might indicate bilateral neural degeneration in BPPV. ","290":"To investigate the possible association between chronic noise-induced hearing loss and the volume of mastoid pneumatization. The study involved 46 subjects employed in the press and montage department of a gun factory: 28 in the study group with noise-induced hearing loss and 18 in the control group with no hearing loss. The volume of mastoid pneumatization was measured with computed tomography. Student's t test was used in the comparison of the mastoid volumes of the study and the control groups. The intergroup evaluations showed no significant difference between the study and control group with regards to age, use of substances or ototoxic drugs, systemic diseases, use of personal hearing protectors, duration of occupational and non-occupational noise exposure was observed (P &gt; 0.05). The mean values of mastoid pneumatization in the study and the control groups were 9717.6 mm3 and 11005.8 mm3, respectively. Although the volume of mastoid pneumatization was smaller in the study group than in the control group, this difference was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). This preliminary study showed that there was no significant correlation between mastoid pneumatization volume and chronic noise-induced hearing loss. However, this correlation could be significant in further studies with a larger number of subjects. ","291":"The preferred setting for the treatment for vestibular schwannoma these days is multidisciplinary and multimodal. A balance has to be struck between a wait-and-scan attitude and a more active approach (surgery or radiotherapy). An initial wait-and-scan attitude is a reasonable management option because many tumours do not grow during a prolonged period of observation. The different surgical approaches may or may not involve attempts to preserve hearing. Stereotactic radiotherapy as treatment of choice is often considered in the elderly patient presenting with a vestibular schwannoma smaller than 2.5 cm with documented growth. This paper will review current treatment modalities and the respective pros and cons. A decisional algorithm as currently adopted by our skull base team is presented at the end of the paper.","292":"Paraffinomas (also known as 'sclerosing lipogranulomas' or 'myospherulosis') are a widely acknowledged complication of cosmetic paraffin injections but they are rare following functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Our first case features a 45-year-old woman presenting with a peri-ocular swelling two weeks after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. The procedure was complicated by a fractured lamina papyracea. A nasal packing with antibiotic ointment was left in situ. Initially, the inflammation was controlled successfully with corticosteroids but the swelling persists to this day. Our second case is a 45-year-old man who suffered from a recurrent swelling of the right eyelid after endoscopic sinus surgery. Multiple treatments with oral antibiotics and corticosteroids brought about no improvement. Debulking surgery was performed and a PDS film was placed between the peri-orbita and the bony orbital floor but the swelling recurred. The patient finally consulted a plastic surgeon as a last resort, but the reconstructive procedure only exacerbated the clinical picture. In both cases a biopsy was performed which established the foreign body reaction typical of a paraffinoma. At present, both patients still suffer from this condition. The complete resection of a paraffinoma is seldom possible because of diffuse infiltration and recurrence is very likely. We therefore conclude that paraffin-based ointments should not be used with nasal packing after sinus surgery, especially when there has been a lesion involving the orbital wall. ","293":"The authors present a potential complication associated with the surgical management of post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage using absorbable cellulose haemostatic dressings. The article discusses the deficiencies of our current understanding of how best to manage this common and potentially life-threatening ENT emergency. A 40-year-old man presented to Accident-and-Emergency with a post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage on the 7th postoperative day. The bleeding was managed surgically, with suturing of the faucial pillars incorporating a piece of Surgicel into the closure. Two days later the patient experienced an episode of partial airway obstruction, due to a piece of dislodged haemostatic material, owing to failure of the closure. The techniques used in the operative management of post-tonsillectomy bleeding are not formally evaluated or discussed in the current literature, and in some cases are unreliable or even potentially hazardous. Further discussion, research, and formulation of a more stepwise approach would be of considerable benefit. ","294":"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) are rare neoplasias, often having progressive growth and an unfavourable outcome. Patients relapse regularly and the tumour metastasizes frequently. Early diagnosis and intense therapy, including radical resection and adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy, are necessary to achieve cure or prolonged survival. A woman aged 60 years, survived 137 months from an initial diagnosis of fibroma of the sinus, which later proved to be intracerebral progressive malignant metastasized nerve sheath tumour. A literature review and various case reports showed that MPNSTs are generally highly malignant, and often cannot be cured. Patients can be cured if the tumour is completely removed following adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy, depending on the tumour location.

Its application into the external ear canal (EAC) is a challenging problem for clinicians. We present 3 case reports of patients who presented at our hospital with superglue in their EACs: 1 was accidental, 1 was iatrogenic, and 1 was intentional. To our knowledge, iatrogenic application of cyanoacrylate glue to the EAC has not been reported previously. We describe our management of these cases and review similar cases reported in the literature. These cases highlight the pressing need for changes in the size, shape and colour of the containers to make them more easily recognizable and distinctive.","296":"To assess differences between the coping strategies of the mothers and fathers with hearing-impaired children. A cross-sectional study was conducted looking at parents of children with moderate to profound hearing impairment. The parents with more than one child with a hearing impairment, the parents of children with additional disabilities and syndromes, single parents, and parents with their own hearing impairments were excluded from the study. A Brief COPE Scale questionnaire translated into Malay was used to assess the coping strategies. The questionnaire includes 28 items and was rated using a four-point Likert scale. Independent t-testing was used to compare the coping strategies of mothers and fathers. Simple linear regression was used to determine the association between age and coping strategies. There were 72 participants. The number of mothers and fathers was equal. Religion, active coping and acceptance were the highest three scores in the domains, while substance use and behavioural disengagement were least used in both groups. The domains of religion, seeking emotional support and seeking instrumental support scored significantly higher in mothers than in fathers (p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of problem-focused strategies (p = 0.016) but not in terms of emotional-focused strategies (p = 0.134). There were significant negative linear correlations between age and seeking emotional support, humour and instrumental support ( p &lt; 0.05). There were gender differences in the coping strategies among parents with hearing-impaired children. These are important factors that should be considered when counselling and establishing support groups for the parents of these children.

A cohort of 35 patients (34 males and 1 female, mean age 59.2 years) who underwent a horizontal glottectomy between June 2001 and June 2010 was analysed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 77.9 +\/- 28.1 months. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse overall survival and disease-specific survival. All of the patients were decannulated and put on a normal diet following nasogastric feeding tube removal. The overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 97 and 93% respectively. The 3- and 5-year disease-specific survival rates were 100 and 97% respectively. There were 2 local recurrences (5.7%), 1 distant metastasis (2.8%), and 2 second primary tumours (5.7%).

Retrospective comparative study of all patients undergoing CPM between 2001 and 2010 at a single UK centre. Patients were classified as having either CPD (n = 15) or non-specific cervical dysphagia (NSCD) (n = 12) based on contrast swallow results. They completed a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire regarding their ability to swallow solids preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Scores were compared between groups, and symptom recurrence at 12 months postoperatively was also noted. The median VAS for all patients in both groups preoperatively was 5.5 and improved postoperatively to 8.0 (p &lt; 0.001), and median preoperative ratings between groups were similar (CPD = 6.0 vs. NSCD = 5.5; p &gt; 0.05). The CPD group scored better postoperatively compared to their NSCD counterparts (CPD = 9.0 vs. NSCD = 7.5; p &lt; 0.001). Recurrence rate at 12 months was lower in CPD (12.5%) compared to NSCD (60%) patients. After CPM, patients with CPD showed significant improvement in swallowing solids, as did patients with NSCD, although to a lesser extent. CPD patients experienced better outcomes compared to their NSCD counterparts, including lower complication and recurrence rates. Larger studies are required before CPM can be advocated as the standard of care for NSCD patients. ","299":"Language delays are common in childhood, may be associated with delays in other areas of development, and can affect school performance. Various tests designed for general developmental screening or specifically for language are used to assess developmental status in preschool children. Knowledge of the probabilities of normal developmental milestones may simplify detection of problems and delays. The aim of this study was to determine the milestones of language development in Turkish children. We assessed data from application of the Denver II Developmental Screening Test's Turkish standardization to 1,993 children, 976 (49.0%) boys and 1,017 (51.0%) girls aged 0.6-82.0 months. We used binary logistic regression to analyze the predicted probability of accomplishing the language items on the Denver II Developmental Screening Test. We determined the sequence of assessed language items and the ages associated with accomplishing those items, as well as the ages at which 25, 50, 75, and 100% of children passed the items. Language items followed a sequential route. Graphs had polynomial slopes. Curves for normal development allow detection of aberrations in the predicted course of language development, and may facilitate earlier diagnosis of delays in language. ","300":"Although adenotonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the pediatric population, its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL) has not been well established. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of adenotonsillectomy on children's HRQL. Parents of the children who underwent adenotonsillectomy were invited to our clinic approximately one year after the surgery for a face-to-face survey to evaluate their child's HRQL. In total, 119 parents of children who underwent adenotonsillectomy for different reasons were interviewed. To quantify the benefit of the operation, the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory (GCBI) was used. The mean GCBI score was 58 +\/- 17.5 (minimum -22.9, maximum 79.2), indicating an increase in overall HRQL. Gender had no influence on the GCBI scores (p &gt; 0.05). Satisfaction scores of the children aged 2-6 years were significantly higher than those of other age groups. Surgical treatment of chronic adenotonsillar disease has a positive impact on children's HRQL. Although surgery is highly effective in all age groups, in terms of children's quality of life, better results can be obtained if the operation is done in the earliest years of life.

Patients with total apnea-hypopnea index values &lt; 5\/per hour sleep were included in the study. Patients completed the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and snoring visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 24 months after surgery, and a VAS for pain after the operation. Twenty-four patients were in the mUP3 group with a mean age of 42.1 +\/- 11.8 years, and 26 in AP group with a mean age of 43.2 +\/- 10.4 years. Snoring VAS values were significantly decreased after surgery in both groups (p &lt; 0.025), but changes between operative groups were not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). Patients' ESS scores in both groups significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.025), but ESS score changes between groups were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05). Two years postoperatively, patient satisfaction was 85% in the AP group, and 70% in the mUP3 group. Pain VAS values were significantly lower in the AP group than in the mUP3 group (p &lt; 0.001). Eight patients (33.3%) in the mUP3 group and one (7.7%) in the AP group reported nasal regurgitation of liquids upon swallowing during the first week postoperatively. Two years after the operation, 10 patients (41.6%) in the mUP3 group and 9 (34.6%) in AP group still had a lump sensation in the throat. We compared the efficacy of the mUP3 and AP techniques to treat patients with primary snoring and found less morbidity and more patient satisfaction in the AP group. ","302":"Quality of life (QOL) assessment in patients with nasal obstruction has not been well studied. The main objectives of this study were to determine the QOL of patients after septorhinoplasty, to measure the efficacy of septorhinoplasty with a validated quality-of-life instrument--the Nasal Obstructive Symptoms Evaluation (NOSE) scale--and with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) QOL scores comprising patient assessments of nasal function. The patient population consisted of a consecutive series of 50 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty at the ages of 18 to 48 years between 2009 and 2011. Quality of life was assessed with the NOSE scale (pre- and postoperatively) and with GBI scores (postoperatively). Demographic data, along with patient assessments of nasal obstruction with a linear analogue scale, were recorded. The mean patient age was 28.3 +\/- 14.6 years (age range, 18-48 years). Twenty-eight patients were male (56%) and 22 (44%) were women. Evaluation of each of the 5 items on the NOSE scale individually revealed that patients experienced improvement in all areas. In this study, there was a statistically significant fall in all five parameters (p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). The mean total GBI score was 34.89 +\/- 22.53 and the mean general subscale score was 38.25 +\/- 24.31. The mean social support score was 19.67 +\/- 33.79 and the mean physical health score was 36.67 +\/- 27.97. Each patient had improved QOL scores on the GBI and NOSE scales (P &lt; 0.05). This study found improved QOL after rhinoplasty in Turkish adult patients. With proper pre-operative assessment and selection, excellent functional and psychosocial outcomes can be expected. NOSE and GBI are valuable tools for the assessment of benefit from nasal septal surgery for nasal obstruction and may be applicable in clinical practice. ","303":"Nasal plastic surgery is a common procedure, which may cause complications. Many patients are concerned about possible changes in the ability to smell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of nasal surgery, by itself, on the sense of smell in a group of patients with minimal endonasal pathologies and no pre-operative olfactory alterations. In this prospective study from January 2009 until January 2011, we evaluated post-rhinoplasty olfactory changes in a series of 100 rhinoplasty candidates. Olfactory evaluation was performed both subjectively and objectively. The subjective evaluation contained a 0-to-100 Visual Analogue Scale and a five-choice qualitative questionnaire; while, the objective evaluation was performed using the same odor variant of the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT40). Then, the results were analyzed by age, sex, operation method, symptoms, and time-interval groups. Subjective and objective scoring revealed no significant change in terms of postsurgical olfactory outcome. According to subjective grading, 26 patients had improvement, 61 had no change, and 13 had deterioration of the smell sense. Closed rhinoplasty resulted in a better smell outcome after surgery according to the Visual Analogue Quantitative Score (P = 0.034). Rhinoplasty does not appear to significantly change the preexisting olfactory status. ","304":"Cholesterol granulomas are benign lesions that sometimes occur on the petrous apex (PA). We report our experience using an endoscopic endonasal approach to remove PA cholesterol granulomas. A retrospective patient chart analysis was conducted at a tertiary care university hospital. Four patients (3 females, 1 male) were included in this study. Patients' ages ranged from 27 to 78 years. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis and computer-assisted navigation were performed. The most common symptom was abducens nerve palsy. The largest granuloma measured 5 x 2 cm and was located on the left side. An endoscopic endonasal approach was chosen and navigation was applied (3\/4 patients) to identify the optimal area for opening the granuloma. No complications occurred, and patients were free from recurrence during the follow-up period. The endoscopic endonasal approach to PA cholesterol granulomas is feasible and safe. Intra-operative navigation is recommended to identify the position of the internal carotid artery and determine the safest area for opening the granuloma without damaging the artery. Another advantage of this approach is an easier follow-up through diagnostic nasal endoscopy. ","305":"Here we present a case report of a patient suffering from occupational rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma due to IgE-mediated carmine red allergy. This is the first description of carmine red allergy in a screen-printing worker in which the diagnosis was documented by quantification of specific IgE antibodies, by skin tests, by a flow-assisted basophil activation test, and by a carmine red challenge test.","306":"A 68-year-old female presented with a right parotid mass and partial frontal peripheral facial nerve palsy. Pre-operatively, the mass was thought to be benign. Surgical intervention consisted of parotidectomy with sacrifice of the facial nerve due to the nerve's involvement in the tumoural process and its intrapetrosal course. Immediate nerve reconstruction was performed by an interposition graft of the great auricular nerve. Pathological examination revealed a schwannoma of the facial nerve. Review of the literature on this rare parotid gland tumour is reported.","307":"A solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a rare tumour that originates from the mesenchyme and arises mainly in the pleura. In this report, we present a rare case of a 77-year-old man with a SFT in the left nasal cavity. On CT and MRI, a large mass is seen in the left nasal cavity, extending to the choana. The mass was radically resected via functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Histological examination showed a fibroblastic mesenchymal tumour with a prominent hemangiopericytic vascular branching pattern that stained diffusely positive for the immunohistochemical markers CD34, Bcl-2, and CD99, which was compatible with the histopathological diagnosis of a SFT. Imaging and histological features are discussed, along with the reports in literature, clinical management, and follow-up of this pathology.","308":"Leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) of the sinonasal tracts are rarely reported. We present a case of an LMS of the left inferior nasal concha, and discuss the management options with review of the literature. A 72-year-old female patient presented with epistaxis. Clinical examination and medical imaging showed a tumour arising from the left inferior nasal concha. An endoscopic resection was performed. Anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the tumour to be a grade 3 LMS with uncertain posterior margins. The patient was a Jehovah's Witness and refused more radical surgical resection due to religious beliefs; therefore, adjuvant conformal radiotherapy (60 Gy) was performed. LMS of the nasal cavity is a rare and locally aggressive tumour with a high tendency of recurrence, requiring radical surgical resection and long-term follow-up. The prognosis of a nasal cavity LMS is better than that of an LMS located in the paranasal sinuses.","309":"Schwannomas are rare tumours arising from the peripheral nerve sheath. Nearly half of all schwannomas occur in the head and neck region, but the sinonasal tract is rarely involved. We report on an extremely rare case of vidian nerve schwannoma accompanied by mucopyocele with symptoms of oculomotor palsy and CSF leakage. An exclusively endoscopic endonasal approach was performed to excise the tumour and the dural defect was repaired. To our knowledge, this is the first time a vidian nerve schwannoma has been excised in an exclusively endoscopic approach. We first review the literature and then discuss the benefits for patients undergoing this type of operation.","310":"PROBLEMS\/ OBJECTIVES: Septoplasty and septorhinoplasty are two important surgical operations in otorhinolaryngology. Tension pneumocephalus is a rare, but potentially fatal, intracranial complication of these operations. We present two cases of tension pneumocephalus following nasal surgery. Both patients had tension pneumocephalus, meningitis, and defects in the skull base. One patient underwent endoscopic repair of the defect, while the second case expired despite medical and neurosurgical management. ","311":"Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis causes significant morbidity among affected children and usually requires frequent surgeries. We present a prospective case series including nine children at a Mexican tertiary referral center. All enrolled patients had severe disease that had required at least four surgical procedures, with a median of 6. Two children had tracheobronchial involvement, one had lung parenchymal disease, and one had a tracheostomy performed during his first surgery. To assess the efficacy of intralesional cidofovir in lowering the surgery rate. Prospective case series. Tertiary referral center in Mexico City. Nine Mexican children with severe disease were enrolled. Intralesional cidofovir was applied after surgical debulking at a concentration of 5 mg\/mL with a four to six week interval. Six of the nine patients had a notable decrease in the rate of surgeries, with three patients remaining disease-free with follow up ranging from 1.8 to 3.3 years. No patient demonstrated laboratory abnormalities. Two patients showed moderate and mild dysplasia on papilloma biopsy distinguished by a lack of epithelial maturation with no mitoses or cellular atypia. Two patients died several months after the last injection. Intralesional cidofovir appears to be effective in the treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, although further studies are required to determine its safety. ","312":"To develop a valid and reliable assessment tool for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Data were collected prospectively in an observational study through evaluations at two tertiary academic institutions, i.e. St. Paul's Sinus Centre, St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and King Fahd Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from December 2006 to December 2009. A 2-page evaluation form was developed in conjunction with the Objective Assessment of Technical Skills Surgery (OSATS) evaluation form developed by Reznick et al in Toronto to assess residents' surgical skills. A Likert scale (1-5 where 5 = excellent) was used for evaluations. The Global Rating of Endoscopic Surgical Skills (GRESS) evaluation instrument was designed with input from academic otolaryngologists, fellowship-trained rhinologists, and experts in medical education. The experts' comments were incorporated, establishing face and content validity. Residents from various levels of training were assessed objectively using this instrument. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest and inter-rater reliability was measured using intra-class correlation. A total of 31 assessments were completed by 15 residents. GRESS showed high reliability in the context of internal consistency (alpha = 0.99), test-retest (0.95, CI = 0.83-0.98), and inter-rater reliability (0.86, CI = 0.31-0.98). This pilot study demonstrated that GRESS is a valid and reliable assessment tool for operating room performance. ","313":"To compare anatomical variations in sinusitis patients and control subjects. We reviewed and compared the computed tomography (CT) scans of 87 sinusitis patients after adequate medical treatment and scans of 103 healthy subjects. All images were scored for sinusitis severity using the Lund-Mackay scoring system. Anatomical variations such as septal deviation, concha bullosa, presence of the Haller's cell, paradoxical middle turbinate, prominent agger nasi cell, and Onodi cell were also recorded. Of the 190 evaluated CT images, 55.2% of the cases and 47.6% of the controls had septal deviation (p &gt; 0.05). The prevalence of concha bullosa was 68% in patients and 61% in controls (p &gt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the evaluated anatomical variations between cases and controls in this study. Mucosal inflammation may play a more essential role than anatomical variation in the development of sinusitis. ","314":"Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) has become the procedure of choice to treat chronic rhinosinusitis. However, no standard method has been suggested to measure FESS outcome. In this study, we used different methods to measure FESS outcome, to determine which method was the most accurate. Forty-nine patients with chronic rhinosinusitis who underwent FESS were enrolled in this study. Nasal polyps were present in 27 patients. On the day before FESS and 12 weeks after the procedure, all patients filled out a Chinese-language version of the 31-item Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure (CRSOM-31) and received acoustic rhinometry to measure the second minimal cross-sectional area (MCA2) of the nasal cavity, as well as an endoscopic examination and a computed tomography (CT) scan. When CRSOM-31, MCA2, endoscopy, and CT scores were analyzed, a good correlation was observed between preoperative endoscopy and CT scores in patients with or without nasal polyposis (r = 0.459, p = 0.016; r = 0.578, p = 0.005, respectively). Postoperatively, a good correlation was observed between CRSOM-31 and CT scores in patients with nasal polyposis (r = 0.405, p = 0.036), as well as between CRSOM-31 and endoscopy scores in patients without nasal polyposis (r = 0.64, p = 0.001). Our results showed that it is difficult to choose a method with which to measure FESS outcome accurately. However, a longer follow-up time and more patients are needed to justify these short-term postoperative results. ","315":"Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by problems in the inner ear, vestibulocochlear nerve, or brain central processing centers. This study aimed to analyze the patient-reported etiology, clinical aspects, and hearing evolution of patients with profound sensorineural hearing loss (PSNHL). Retrospective. A total of 310 adult patients diagnosed with PSNHL in one or both ears between January 2002 and January 2008 were studied at a secondary center. Most subjects were military-aged males who were diagnosed with PSNHL during routine examinations prior to recruitment. A pure-tone audiometry test was performed in all patients. Auditory brainstem response was recorded in 142 (45.8%) patients. A total of 310 adult patients (276 males [89%] and 34 females [11%]) with a mean age of 23.1 (range 20-81) years comprising 486 ears consisting of 176 (56.8%) bilateral and 134 (43.2%) unilateral PSNHL cases were evaluated. Etiology was based on patient self reporting. The disease was congenital in 93 (30%) patients and acquired in 217 (70%). Etiology was unknown in 35 (11.3%) patients. Acquired hearing losses were rapid in 188 (86.6%) and progressive in 29 (13.4%) patients. Articulation was impaired (no understandable speech) in a total of 146 patients (47.1%), including all patients with congenital PSNHL. The cause of hearing loss is often understood from medical history. Taking measures for the most common causes (congenital hearing loss and childhood infectious diseases) may reduce occurrences of PSNHL cases. Auditory screening and beginning hearing rehabilitation as soon as possible in newborns is vital. ","316":"This study on patients undergoing surgery for vestibular schwannoma investigated tumour (i) the effect of pre-operative factors on tinnitus, (ii) the effect of translabyrinthine or hearing preservation surgical approaches on tinnitus, and (iii) the effect of postoperative tinnitus status on the patient's quality of life (QOL). Seventy-nine patients who underwent vestibular schwannoma (VS) excision between 2001 and 2005 were selected. Postoperative tinnitus status was evaluated using a standard questionnaire for tinnitus, and QOL was measured using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Overall, 58% of patients noted tinnitus before tumour removal. Pre-operative tinnitus was not associated with age, gender, tumour size, or hearing thresholds. The total percentage of patients suffering postoperative tinnitus was 64%. Hearing preservation approaches showed no difference in terms of changes in tinnitus compared to the translabyrinthine approach. Twenty-one patients (30%) reported better QOL, 40 patients (56%) reported worse QOL, and 10 patients (14%) reported the same QOL. A significant association was found between tinnitus worsening as measured by GBI score and QOL. Most patients do not report significant changes in their tinnitus status after surgery. Tinnitus evolution is unpredictable and not related to the type of surgical approach. Thus, tinnitus should not be used as a criterion for selecting the surgical approach. Tinnitus worsening appears to influence QOL following surgery for VS. ","317":"Acute otitis media (AOM) commonly affects young children and occasionally results in serious complications\/sequelae. This pilot cost-of-illness study aimed to assess the economic burden of long-term AOM complications\/sequelae in Belgium, and to establish a thorough methodology for a larger study. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients aged 10-20 years with long-term complications\/sequelae considered to be AOM-related, and &gt; or = 8 years of follow-up. From a list of 215 eligible patients, we selected 25 patients representing each of seven categories of complications\/sequelae. Included patients had a mean age of 12.9 years; nine had chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma; six sensorineural hearing loss; six chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane; and one each with conductive hearing loss, facial paralysis, neurological impairment after intracranial complications, and complications of surgery. During 8-15 years of follow-up, the most common complications were hearing loss, chronic otitis media (OM), and cholesteatoma. These generally occurred &gt; 5 years after the first AOM event, although chronic OM occurred after a mean time of 3.3 years. Yearly public health care payer (PHCP) costs ranged from Euro 119 to Euro 7957 per patient, and were highest for patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Yearly costs to the patients ranged from Euro 7 to Euro 289 per patient, and were also highest for patients with sensorineural hearing loss. Although complications\/sequelae of AOM are rare, they can result in substantial costs. The applied methodology should be feasible for a larger study, with some minor adjustments. ","318":"We present the case of a term neonate referred shortly after birth because of breathing and feeding difficulties. Fiber-endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity showed a pendulating mass in the nasopharynx. A complete surgical resection was performed and the baby recovered completely. Microscopic examination of the mass showed an overlying non-keratinized squamous cell lining with an atypical cell population in some fragments. Histological features were compatible with a high-grade epithelial tumour like a midline carcinoma, but a final diagnosis of a salivary gland anlage tumour was established. Flexible fiber endoscopy is the method of choice for examining the nasal passages and oropharynx in neonates with respiratory distress. Congenital salivary gland anlage tumour is a rare cause of neonatal nasal obstruction; it is benign and complete excision results in a cure. Histologically, it may mimic a malignant tumour owing to the high mitotic index. ","319":"Since the introduction of Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccinations in child immunisation programmes, a significant decline in the incidence of epiglottitis has been observed among children. However, recent studies show an increase in the incidence of adult epiglottitis without any identifiable predominant causative pathogen. Adult disease is known to have a slightly more protracted course. Vigilance is nevertheless indicated due to the risk of a rapidly evolving airway obstruction. In this paper, we discuss three recent cases of adult epiglottitis in a tertiary care unit, and review of the current literature. In two of these cases frank abscess formation was already present at the initial evaluation. In spite of very close monitoring, with securing of the airway, administration of intravenous antibiotics and drainage of the abscess, the eldest patient died. The other patients recovered completely.","320":"Bilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients with Parkinson's disease is a life-threatening complication. The need for surgical treatment such as a tracheotomy or laser arytenoidectomy is determined by the severity of the patient's symptoms. A case of bilateral vocal cord paralysis in a patient with Parkinson's disease treated with an urgent tracheotomy is reported.","321":"Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a perplexing entity in otology. Susac's syndrome (also called retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy) is a rare disorder that consists of microangiopathy of the brain, retina, and inner ear, and usually affects women in young adulthood. We describe the clinical aspects, radiographic findings, and management of one such case. A 30-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of sudden onset of bilateral deafness and headache. During her hospitalization, she developed discrete right hemiparesis and hypoesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple signal hyperintensities and atrophy of the corpus callosum. The differential diagnosis was a myelinating condition, such as multiple sclerosis or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Retinal fluorescein angiography helped the diagnosis of Susac's syndrome. ","322":"A 32-year-old woman developed altered consciousness two days after initial symptoms of acute otitis media, with purulent discharge from the right ear. She was quadriplegic, with spontaneous eye opening, mild neck stiffness, and lacking vestibular-ocular reflexes. Upon admission, the patient was subjected to brain computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture. CT was consistent with pansinusitis, right middle ear otitis, mastoiditis, and sphenoiditis. No brainstem lesion was evident; brain MRI demonstrated ischemic and secondary hemorrhagic lesions in the pons and cerebral peduncles. The dura mater in the petroclival space was intensely inflamed, and likely responsible for reduced basilar arterial blood flow. Lumbar puncture yielded clear cerebrospinal fluid; gram stain examination was negative and culture remained sterile. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were cultured from the purulent ear discharge. The final diagnosis was locked-in syndrome consecutive to inflammatory changes compressing the basilar artery. ","323":"We report a case of Pott's puffy tumour, a subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone associated with an underlying frontal osteomyelitis, in a 5-year-old boy. Ultrasonography played a crucial role in the diagnosis of our patient, suggesting the presence of a Pott's puffy tumour with epidural abscess by showing a subperiosteal abscess associated with erosion of the frontal bone. Subsequently, the diagnosis of Pott's puffy tumour with epidural abscess was confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT scanning. Prompt neurosurgical intervention with drainage of abscesses and debridement of bone sequestrate, together with prolonged antibiotic therapy, significantly contributes to a favorable outcome.","324":"Success rates for revision dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) are lower than primary DCR. Scarring of the sac may limit the surgeon's ability to achieve good nasal and lacrimal mucosa apposition. The aims of this study were to assess the long term safety and efficacy of intra-operative use of adjunctive mitomycin C (MMC) treatment in endoscopic revision DCR surgery over 12-24 (mean 17) months. This was a prospective, nonrandomized consecutive case series that included 20 adult patients (20 eyes) with failed primary external DCR who underwent revision surgery under assisted local anaesthesia. During revision endoscopic DCR, intra-operative adjunctive MMC (0.2 mg\/mL) was applied to the osteotomy site of the lacrimal sac and scar tissue surrounding the surgical osteum for 5 minutes. The surgical success rate was determined based on the patency of the nasolacrimal system by irrigation and resolution of patient symptoms. Endoscopic revision DCR surgery with MMC was successful in 90% of cases (18 of 20 cases). No adverse effects (eg, abnormal nasal bleeding, mucosal necrosis, infection) or any other surgical adverse events were observed. Adjunctive intra-operative MMC application with endoscopic DCR surgery had a good success rate in patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction that required revision surgery. Further large, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings. ","325":"We reviewed our experience with MTC (medullary thyroid cancer), focusing on recurrence and survival, recommendations for the extent of lymph node (LN) dissection and surgery for recurrent disease. Of 51 MTC patients treated between 1988 and 2008 at the University Hospitals Leuven, 38 previously untreated patients were analysed. Overall and disease-specific (DSS) five-year survival rates were 75% and 82%. Variables univariately associated with DSS were age, pN, stage, vascular invasion, pre-operative recurrent laryngeal nerve function and last calcitonin level. Recurrence occurred in 10 patients (26%). For recurrence, age was no longer a prognostic factor and post-operative calcitonin, number of positive LN and of positive compartments proved to be prognostic factors. Of 21 clinical NO patients, 2 out of 6 (33%) undergoing a prophylactic central neck dissection (ND) based on per-operative palpatory suspicion proved pN+, and 2 out of 9 patients (22%) undergoing a prophylactic lateral ND were pN+. Five patients surgically treated for recurrence did not achieve long-term normalisation of calcitonin, but remained alive with locoregional control. Overall survival and DSS rates are within the range reported in the literature. The results confirm that (1) total thyroidectomy and central compartment dissection is the treatment of choice in the cN0 patients, (2) additional ipsilateral lateral ND is needed for cN+ disease in the ipsilateral lateral compartment, and (3) in the clinically uninvolved contralateral lateral neck, per-operative inspection should serve as a basis for a decision about further ND. Locoregional control and prolonged survival is achieved in surgically treated locoregionally recurrent MTC. ","326":"Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in children; its main indications are recurrent episodes of acute tonsillitis and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The effectiveness of tonsillectomy for severe recurrent tonsillitis is generally accepted; however its socio-economic cost is less well investigated. This study aims to determine and compare the societal cost of a tonsillectomy and a severe throat infection. The costs for both tonsillectomy and severe throat infection were evaluated. Costs of the surgical procedure and hospital stay were calculated based on resource use and personnel input at the participating hospital. The cost of work-related disability for both treatments was measured based on a questionnaire filled in by 275 parents of children undergoing a tonsillectomy. Data from two Belgian institutions (NIS and FOD) were used to calculate the cost of parents' absenteeism. An episode of acute tonsillitis in the child results in a longer period of parents' work absenteeism (mean of 3.1 +\/- 0.3 days) compared to tonsillectomy (2.2 +\/- 0.2 days). The cost of economic productivity loss amounts to 613 Euros (NIS) or 759 Euros (FOD) for acute tonsillitis and 435 Euros (NIS) or 539 Euros (FOD) for a tonsillectomy. The medical costs linked to the surgical procedure at the local department correspond to 535 Euros and for an acute tonsillitis to 46 Euros. From societal perspective, a tonsillectomy costs the equivalent of 1.4 times the cost of a severe throat infection. This indicates that in children suffering from recurrent acute tonsillitis, watchful waiting results in a higher cost compared to tonsillectomy, given the cumulative costs of parents' absenteeism. ","327":"To quantify the bystander-effect of 2.5G mobile telephones (2.5G-MTs) on the speech perception of digital hearing-aid (dHA) users. Differences in the susceptibility of behind-the-ear (BTE) compared to in-to-the-ear (ITE) dHAs were also assessed. Prospective-comparative study conducted at a tertiary referral centre (ENT Department) and a HA-fitting laboratory. Key-word recognition scores from open-sentence lists were calculated. Power-analysis determined that a minimum of 60 subjects with SNHL (30 in each group), using either BTE or ITE dHAs, were required for reliable study outcomes. Sixty-four adults were tested with a functioning 2.5G-MT at almost physical contact with their ear; thirty subjects used BTE and 34 ITE dHAs. Aided word recognition score differences between studied groups and within each group, while a 2.5G-MT was activated. Cut-off inclusion criterion regarding baseline aided word recognition score was 75%. Baseline aided word recognition scores for ITE dHAs were better compared to BTE ones (p &lt; 0.01). Following the 2.5G-MT activation, this difference disappeared. No statistically significant difference in word recognition was observed between the examined groups, or within the BTE group, from the bystander-effect of the 2.5G-MT. ITE dHAs proved more susceptible to electromagnetic interference (p &lt; 0.05). The bystander-effect of 2.5G-MTs on the speech perception of dHA users is either minimal, or not significant. The observed compatibility has a positive impact on the lives of millions of people worldwide. The long-standing theory of more interference in BTE compared to ITE HAs is not confirmed by the results of the present study. EBM level of evidence: 2c. ","328":"There are numerous cochlear implant fixation techniques to prevent soft tissue complications related to device migration. The literature does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the most suitable fixation method. Cochlear implants (CI) are becoming a routine treatment for patients with severe to profound deafness. Steadily growing numbers of implant centres and surgeons worldwide are inevitably leading to higher rates of complications, including device migration. It is currently unknown whether this can be prevented by proper implant fixation during surgery. The low prevalence of this complication makes it challenging to interpret publications regarding CI fixation techniques. An exhaustive literature review reveals a variety of different fixation techniques. Most authors advocate the creation of a bony well for the CI receiver\/stimulator (R\/S); however, an increasing number of surgeons no longer secure implants at all. Here we give an overview of all published fixation methods, with special attention to the evidence-based quality and descriptions of the advantages and drawbacks of each. Literature review reveals an absence of level I evidence-based publications addressing device migration. Existing publications report on too few cases to draw a conclusion on whether surgical fixation prevents implant migration. To have statistical power, studies of alternative or new fixation methods should include high numbers of implantations in each study arm and the studies should be longitudinal and prospective. In default of other evidence, it seems fair to define good practice as the creation of at least a bony well and\/or (bony) sutures. ","329":"Aminoglycosides may decrease the expression of some proteins participating in ion-exchange in the cochlear lateral wall. Connexin 26 expression in the lateral wall may play a role in acquired hearing loss by maintaining the endocochlear potential and potassium concentration in the endolymph. We examined the effects of gentamicin on the expression of connexin 26 to obtain a better understanding of aminoglycoside ototoxicity. We detected changes in connexin 26 protein and mRNA expression in the cochlear lateral wall using immunohistochemistry staining, western blotting, and real-time PCR in rats after administration of a single dose of gentamicin. The expression of connexin 26 increased over time in type III fibrocytes after gentamicin administration. Elevated protein levels were detected 3 h after the single injection of gentamicin; while, mRNA levels increased after 24 h. Connexin 26 plays an important role in the acute effects of high-dose gentamicin and is probably involved in the pathogenesis of ototoxic deafness. ","330":"We investigated the relationship between possible underlying neurological dysfunction and a significant discrepancy between verbal IQ\/performance IQ (VIQ-PIQ) in children with language, speech or learning difficulties. In a retrospective study, we analysed data obtained from intelligence testing and neurological evaluation in 49 children with a significant VIQ-PIQ discrepancy (&gt; or = 25 points) who were referred because of language, speech or learning difficulties to the Multidisciplinary University Centre for Logopedics and Audiology (MUCLA) of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium. The group of children broke down into a group of 35 children with PIQ &gt; VIQ and a group of 14 children with VIQ &gt; PIQ. In the first group, neurological data were present for 24 children. The neurological history and clinical neurological examination were normal in all cases. Brain MRI was performed in 15 cases and proved to be normal in all children. Brain activity was assessed with long-term video EEG monitoring in ten children. In two children, the EEG results were abnormal: there was an epileptic focus in one child and a manifest alteration in the EEG typical of Landau-Kleffner syndrome in the other. In the second group of 14 children whose VIQ was higher than the PIQ, neurological data were available for ten children. Neurological history and clinical neurological examination were normal in all cases. Brain MRI was performed in five cases and was normal in all children. EEG monitoring was performed in one child. This revealed benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. In a small number of children (9%) with speech, language and learning difficulties and a discrepancy between VIQ and PIQ, an underlying neurological abnormality is present. We recommend referring children with a significant VIQ-PIQ mismatch to a paediatric neurologist. As an epileptic disorder seems to be the most common underlying neurological pathology in this specific group of children, EEG monitoring should be recommended in these children. Neuro-imaging should only be used in selected patients. ","331":"","332":"Syphilis is a sexually-transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, and is transmitted either through sexual contact or vertically across the placenta. Rates of infection were at a low point in the early 1990s. Since then, increasing numbers of new cases of infections have been observed in all Western countries. Presentation of three patients with syphilis who presented within a short period of time in an ENT outpatient clinic. One must be aware of the increasing incidence of syphilis, even in head and neck disciplines. Typical symptoms of an early infection are an ulcerous lesion in the mouth, with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. The main therapy is high doses of penicillin G administered intramuscularly. Other simultaneous sexually-transmitted diseases, especially HIV infection, must be excluded. Unnoticed and untreated patients may develop late and life-threatening complications. ","333":"Carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) is an emergency complication in patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancers. The classical management of CBS is the ligation of the common carotid artery, because suturing is not be possible due to infection and necrosis of the field. In this case report, we present a patient with CBS, in whom we applied a self-expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) stent and observed no morbidity. Endovascular stent is a life-saving technique with minimum morbidity that preserves blood flow to the brain. We believe that this method is preferable to ligation of the artery in CBS.","334":"To present the management of a rare case of progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in a patient with superficial siderosis secondary to a cavernoma. A case report and a review of the literature concerning superficial siderosis. The patient benefited significantly from a cochlear implantation. Careful assessment and adequate counselling is necessary to determine the best approach to hearing rehabilitation in patients with superficial siderosis of the central nervous system. Cochlear implantation in patients with superficial siderosis is controversial due to the retrocochlear origin of the hearing loss and, although the case presented had a successful outcome, the results might deteriorate with time. ","335":"Congenital cholesteatoma may arise in various locations within the temporal bone. The rarest site of origin is the mastoid process. We report an unusual case of a 52-year-old man with mastoid congenital cholesteatoma that manifested as a persistent ear discharge. The preoperative suspicion was based on the imaging findings and the patient's history. A simple mastoidectomy was conducted and the cholesteatoma was completely removed while using facial nerve monitoring. Although rare, mastoid congenital cholesteatoma can be considered as an alternative in the differential diagnosis of persistent otorrhea.","336":"Sinonasal malignant neoplasms are uncommon, with an annual incidence of less than 1\/100,000. About 80% of these are squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are next in frequency. Lymphoma of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx are rare, constituting less than 5% of all extranodal lymphomas. A 47-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of severe headache and progressive facial pain. He also complained of right-sided visual acuity. He had a manifest exopthalmia with disturbed eye movements. Nasoscopy showed a large mass with atypical appearance. CT and MRI showed a bilateral ethmoid mass invading the frontal sinuses, the right orbit, the lamina cribrosa and the right frontal cerebral region, and growing posteriorly through the choana. The first biopsies were inconclusive, showing only necrotic cells and purulent inflammation with epithelial elements. A larger biopsy demonstrated a high-grade malignant tumour with necrosis. The differential diagnosis of undifferentiated sinonasal carcinoma, undifferentiated neuro-endocrine tumour or T-cell lymphoma was suggested. In the meantime our patient developed high fever and sudden-onset pancytopenia. Bone marrow punction showed 65% blasts, leading to the diagnosis of AML type M2. He was immediately referred for chemotherapy, but died in intensive care before his first session. The biopsy of the sinonasal mass was diagnosed surprisingly as a natural killer cell lymphoma stage IVB. Natural killer cell lymphoma is rare in Europe. The simultaneous appearance of a NK-cell lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia has, as far as we know, never been described in the English literature before. ","337":"We describe the rare simultaneous appearance of an atypical adenolymphoma with a glomus caroticum tumour on the same side of the neck in a middle-aged man. This case report is the first to describe this coexistence. Due to the atypical, cyst-like presentation of the Warthin's tumour, a final diagnosis was made only after surgical resection and histopathological examination. Both the adenolymphoma and glomus caroticum tumour were successfully removed surgically.","338":"We present a case report of a patient with a putative diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome of the nose. We would like to bring this disorder to the attention of rhinologists. A 53-year-old man presented with a history of extreme, constant, debilitating pain in his nose that started after he underwent several extensive nasal surgeries. Examination revealed atrophic nasal mucous membranes at the nasal septum. No other abnormalities were found. The pain did not diminish despite administration of analgesics and neuropathic pain medications. We propose a diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome of the nose. The large number of nasal surgeries performed worldwide and the far reaching consequences of this debilitating syndrome indicate that it merits further investigation to determine whether it is a distinct disorder that should be recognized as such. ","339":"Outpatient clinic letters are a widely used and effective means of communication between hospital staff and general practitioners. This study audited the letter format used by consultants and specialist registrars (SpRs) at an otolaryngology clinic to assess the readability of different formats. The two-cycle audit was performed at the Otolaryngology Clinic at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London, England. A readability score (0-4) was assigned to the letters as an indication of how easy it was to extract information from structured or unstructured (paragraph) format letters. In the first cycle, 71.91% of the SpR letters followed a structured format and had an overall mean readability score of 2.87\/4; 46.58% of the consultant letters followed a structured format and had an overall mean readability score of 1.25\/4. In the second cycle, after the results of the first audit were presented to the participating physicians, 84.72% of the SpR letters followed a structured format and had an overall mean readability score of 3.41\/4. Consultants followed a structured format in 52.56% of the letters, which had an overall mean readability score of 2.04\/4. We found that a structured format for outpatient letters was better than unstructured format. This audit helped change the structure and consequently the readability scores of the clinic letters. ","340":"Although polyps seem to be a manifestation of the chronic inflammation of nasal\/paranasal sinuses mucosa in both allergic and non-allergic subjects, the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis remains unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the clinical characteristics of nasal polyposis in non-allergic and allergic patients, to compare the cytokine levels in nasal secretions in atopic and non-atopic nasal polyp patients and to correlate these levels with eosinophil counts in nasal polyp tissue specimens. This study included thirty patients with nasal polyposis (13 atopic and 17 non-atopic) requiring surgical treatment. Nasal secretion samples were collected from the nasal cavities of all 30 subjects a few days before the surgical treatment. The levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), tumour necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 were measured using the flow cytometric method. Each of the 30 patients was staged clinically according to nasal symptom score, endoscopic score and Lund-Mackay computed tomography (CT) score. All these patients had undergone sinus surgery. Eosinophils were counted in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of all nasal polyp samples. Our results showed that allergy does not modify the symptoms, or the endoscopic and CT findings, of nasal polyposis. We found significantly higher concentrations of IL-4 (p &lt; 0.01), IL-5 (p &lt; 0.05), IL-6 (p &lt; 0.05) and TNF-beta (p &lt; 0.05) in nasal secretions of allergic nasal polyp patients than in non-allergic ones. Eosinophil counts were significantly higher in tissues of atopic patients' polyps than in non-atopic subjects (p &lt; 0.01). No correlation was observed between cytokine levels and eosinophil counts. Non-atopic and atopic patients' polyps have different immunological patterns. Our results showed that the presence of Th2 cytokines was a more significant feature in allergic patients with nasal polyposis than in non-allergic patients. ","341":"Nasal packing (NP) after septoplasty has some negative aspects. The nasal septal suture (NSS) is therefore becoming increasingly preferred. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of NSS and NP on pulmonary function tests. Sixty patients who suffered from nasal blockage resulting from nasal septal deviation and who were otherwise healthy were included. Patients were randomized into two groups, NP or NSS. Pre-operative spirometry was performed for all patients. The NP group received a finger glove packing for two days after septoplasty, whereas no additional dressing was used for the NSS group. Narcotic analgesics were not used for pain relief after septoplasty in either group. Spirometry was performed post-operatively on the third day for all patients and before removal of the NP for the NP group. We observed statistically significant differences between pre-operative and post-operative values of forced vital capacity (FVC; p = 0.008), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1; p = 0.006), and forced expiratory flow ((FEF)25-75%; p = 0.011) in the NP group. In comparison, pre-operative and post-operative values did not differ for FVC, FEV1, FEV1\/FVC%, and FEF25-75% in the NSS group. NP negatively influenced pulmonary function based on spirometric parameters, while NSS did not. ","342":"Septoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in otolaryngology practice. Prophylactic use of antibiotics is controversial. Disruption of nasal flora may predispose individuals to infection. We investigated the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis and septoplasty on nasal flora. We included 115 consecutive patients who underwent septoplasty because of symptomatic nasal septal deviation. Patients were divided into study and control groups. Study patients received prophylactic parenteral sodium cefazoline twice a day beginning intra-operatively and while the nasal packing remained in the nose for 48 h, and expandable polyvinyl acetate (Merocel) packing covered with antibiotic ointment containing 0.2% nitrofurazone was inserted into each nostril at the end of the operation. Control patients received neither parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis nor antibiotic ointment around the Merocel packs. Both groups received oral prophylactic cefuroxime axetil for 5 d after nasal packing was removed. Nasal flora was determined pre-operatively, post-operatively when nasal packing was removed, and 3 mo after surgery. Study patients were compared to control patients at pack removal and 1 mo after surgery The effect of antibiotic use in septoplasty on nasal flora was as follows: Increased isolation rate of gram-positive rods (p = 0.007), decreased methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci (p = 0.002). Pre-operative and post-operative culture results at 3 mo were compared. The effect of septoplasty on nasal flora was as follows: Decreased coagulase-negative staphylococci (p = 0.05), decreased Klebsiella (p &lt; 0.001), decreased gram-positive rods (p &lt; 0.001), increased methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (p &lt; 0.001). Septoplasty increases S. aureus colonization and decreases normal flora. Antibiotics do not protect against S. aureus colonization and contribute to a decrease in normal flora. Antibiotics do not seem to confer benefit in terms of flora changes. Studies investigating flora changes with a longer follow-up should be conducted. ","343":"The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of Ericksonian hypnosis in reducing the impact of tinnitus on patients' quality of life. A controlled prospective longitudinal study was designed. The severity of tinnitus was assessed with Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) before hypnotherapy and then 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after therapy. Health Survey SF-36 was used to assess health-related quality of life before and after hypnotherapy. Thirty-nine patients with severe idiopathic subjective tinnitus were enrolled in the study. The mean SD age of the patients was 44.5 +\/- 12.5 years, ranging from 21 to 65 years; 48% were female. Mean THI scores assessed at the beginning and 4 times after commencement of therapy were evaluated. The changes in THI scores were significant. Health Survey SF-36 was assessed separately. The greatest increases were seen in physical role followed by emotional role difficulty. The preliminary results of our study demonstrated the effectiveness of Ericksonian hypnosis in the study group. ","344":"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and significance of traditional risk factors associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in a population of 615 neonates who attended the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium between January 2005 and December 2007. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiometry using 40 dB stimuli was performed in all 615 neonates. A retrospective medical database analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of 14 predetermined risk factors. The evaluated risk factors were ototoxic medication, hyperbilirubinemia, in utero infections (including CMV, rubella, syphilis, herpes, and toxoplasmosis), craniofacial anomalies, syndromes associated with SNHL, low birth weight (&lt; 1,500 g), low Apgar score, mechanical ventilation lasting for 5 days or longer, bacterial meningitis, family history of hereditary childhood SNHL, endocranial hemorrhage, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, convulsions, and sepsis Uni- or bilateral hearing impairment was diagnosed in 25 out of 615 neonates (4.1%). In utero infections (especially CMV), craniofacial anomalies, and syndromes known to include SNHL were significant risk factors. For the remaining risk factors, no significant correlation with SNHL was found. In this study, only in utero infections (especially CMV), craniofacial anomalies, and syndromes known to include SNHL were significant risk factors associated with SNHL. Adequate management of hyperbilirubinemia and ototoxic drug administration may eliminate some of the major historical risk factors associated with SNHL in NICU neonates. ","345":"Leksel Gamma Knife (LGK) radiosurgery is a safe and efficient therapeutic approach for vestibular schwannoma (VS) with low side effects. The goal of radiosurgery is not necessarily to cause significant tumour necrosis or to obtain a complete radiographic response, but to halt the tumour's growth permanently through its biological elimination. The 2 major aims of radiosurgery for VS are long-term tumour control and functional hearing preservation. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with LGK radiosurgery in the management of VS and to evaluate the hearing preservation rate after a minimum one-year follow-up. Between January 2000 and January 2011, 415 patients with unilateral VS underwent LGK radiosurgery at the University Erasmus Hospital of Brussels. There were 349 patients with previously untreated VS (86 grade I, 96 grade II, 141 grade III, 9 grade IVa, 17 unknown grades, according to Koos) and 66 patients with post-operative residual tumour. All patients in our series underwent evaluation with high resolution neurodiagnostic imaging including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical evaluation as well as audiological tests that included tonal and speech audiometries. The Gardner Robertson (GR) classification is used to report the results of this study. We identified 276 patients treated for VS with LGK, tested and retested with speech and tonal audiometries by the same team, and followed for a minimum of one year. Before LGK, 144 patients had serviceable (85 GR class I and 59 GR class II) hearing; 95 (65.97%) of these patients had preservation of serviceable hearing (Pure tone average &lt; or = 50 db and Speech discrimination &gt; or = 50%) at minimum one-year audiological follow-up. It was observed that 44 of the 85 GR class I patients (51.76%) maintained their level of audition and 66 of these (74.64%) preserved serviceable hearing. In the 34 patients with preradiosurgery non-serviceable hearing (GR class III-IV) 25 of these patients (73.52%) maintained their hearing. The tumour was stable or declining in size in 90.44% of cases. LGK radiosurgery provides excellent tumour control in vestibular schwannomas and has low toxicity even after long-term follow-up. ","346":"","347":"The management of hypervascular skull base tumours is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Skull base surgery may be challenging because of the risk of serious intra-operative bleeding and of potential injuries to lower cranial nerves and\/or large cervical vessels. Over the last four decades, advances in neuro-interventional procedures have produced a range of adjunctive endovascular techniques in addition to conventional surgery. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) allows for a better understanding of tumour vascularisation and its relationship with Surrounding vessels. Tumoural devascularisation and the occlusion of feeding arteries is a useful adjunct to surgery because it allows for the reduction of intra-operative blood loss and induces ischaemic necrosis of the tumour. Finally, surgery-related iatrogenic vascular lesions may be successfully treated with endovascular techniques. Nevertheless, endovascular procedures in the head and neck region are associated with infrequent but potentially serious complications. An extensive and comprehensive knowledge of head and neck vascular anatomy is therefore necessary. This article provides a review of the indications for, and results of, diagnostic, pre-operative and therapeutic endovascular procedures for the management of skull base tumours and related surgical complications.","348":"Over the past two decades, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) leak repair has advanced from open invasive intracranial approaches to transnasal endoscopic ones that avoid the traditional morbidities of frontal craniotomy approaches--such as anosmia, intracranial haemorrhage or oedema, seizures, memory deficiencies, and behaviour disorders--reducing morbidity, reducing hospitalisation times and accelerating return to work, and therefore cutting indirect costs. The diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhoea is both clinical and radiological. The presence of CSF in clear nasal drainage should be established by analysis for CSF markers. Localisation of the leak site involves radiological investigation, mainly Computerised Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In addition to suppressing symptoms, the main goal of the closure of CSF rhinorrhoea is to prevent ascending meningitis. The operative management of cerebrospinal fluid leak is advised in the following circumstances: persistent, posttraumatic CSF leaks after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative treatment; all cases of spontaneous CSF fistulae; cases with intermittent leaks; delayed posttraumatic leaks; cases of CSF leak with a history of meningitis; false CSF rhinorrhoea coming from the petrous bone via the Eustachian tube. The graft material used depends mainly on the authors' experience and did not significantly influence the success rate. The main steps in the surgical procedures do not differ as much from one author to the other: accurate localisation of the defect; creation of a raw surface around the defect to accept the graft and to help in the formation of synechiae to support the seal later; plugging of the defect with fat covered with fascia lata supported by absorbable gelatin and Merocel. The differences between the authors relate to the use of fluorescein to locate the defect, the importance of prophylactic antibiotherapy, the plugging materials, the technique of underlay or overlay grafting, the use of fibrin glue and the need for lumbar drainage. The success rate for endoscopic repair of CSF rhinorrhoea is high: approximately 90% at the first attempt. Recent reports in the literature highlight the group of patients with spontaneous idiopathic CSF leak as a group with specific attributes and treatment challenges.","349":"Recent advances in technology and techniques in neurosurgery and otolaryngology have revolutionised skull base surgery with the introduction of endoscopic endonasal approaches. One of the greatest limitations of endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is the repair of osteodural defects. Numerous reconstructive techniques have been developed that maximise endoscopic endonasal approach efficacy and minimise complications. The choice of technique for closure depends on different factors and is based on an individual approach in each patient. In particular, size, the localisation of the defect and the presence of a high-flow CSF leak are major determinants of the reconstructive options. Free tissue transfer remains the mainstay for the reconstruction of smaller defects. However, local vascularised flaps and the nasoseptal flap in particular now play a pivotal role in the reconstruction of larger defects. These flaps have significantly reduced the morbidity and risk of post-operative CSF leaks after endoscopic endonasal approaches.","350":"Lesions in the clivus and suprasellar region are rare but challenging pathologies for physicians. The most common tumours are chordomas and chondrosarcomas, but a wide variety of histopathological tumours can be found in these areas. Their deep location in the midline and their close relationship to important neurovascular structures frequently make total removal difficult. Neurosurgeons are often required to perform aggressive external-approach surgical therapy, which is usually associated with high levels of morbidity and a discouraging tendency for recurrence during long-term follow-up. Fortunately, over the past few years, close collaboration between otorhinolaryngologists and neurosurgeons has led to the development of minimally invasive surgery along the entire neuraxis, with endoscopy being used as the primary visualisation tool. This has been further augmented by the concept of team surgery: ENT surgeons and neurosurgeons working simultaneously throughout all phases of the surgery (approach, resection, and reconstruction). This concept has also changed the surgical approach as a whole, making the endonasal route the main approach for treating these types of lesions in carefully selected patients and external approaches the second-place option. The endonasal approach has revolutionised skull base surgery as it enables less aggressive surgery (reaching deep-seated structures without the need for craniotomy and brain retraction). It is therefore associated with lower morbidity and an absence of visible scars, with encouraging initial oncological prognosis. The aims of this paper are to describe the anatomical landmarks for this approach, to relate our experiences and to provide a literature review.","351":"The aim of this study was to analyse the results of minimally invasive endoscopic unilateral transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas. A series of 83 patients presenting with a pituitary lesion was reviewed retrospectively. Surgical procedures were performed between February 2007 and December 2010. The extent of resection was evaluated on post-operative contrast-enhanced MRI. We also reviewed our complications and compared them with the literature. Our series included 10 micro- and 73 macro-adenomas, with cavernous sinus invasion in 60.3%. Fifty-three per cent were non-secreting. Complete resection of the macro-adenomas was achieved in 22.5% of the cases. Complications were as follows: 2 deaths (2.5%), 2 sinusitis (2.5%), 5 CSF leaks (6.2%), 1 meningitis (1.2%), 16 post-operative anterior lobe insufficiency (19.8%) and 4 persistent diabetes insipidus (4.9%). Thirty-seven patients (44.6%) presented with a compression of optical pathways with an improvement of visual acuity in 94.3%. Purely endoscopic unilateral endonasal transsphenoidal adenoma resection is minimally invasive surgery leading to a good rate of gross total tumour resection and it is associated with a low complication rate. ","352":"PROBLEMS\/OBJECTIVE: This study describes the variety of tumours originating in the olfactory cleft which have been treated with endonasal endoscopic surgery. The study is a retrospective review covering a seven-year period (2004-2010) of the medical records of all patients in whom a tumour originating in the olfactory cleft was excised (72 patients: 63 men and 9 women; age: average of 61 years; range, 19 to 90 years). The most common tumours in the series were adenocarcinoma (43 [60%] patients), inverted papilloma (7 [10%] patients), respiratory epithelial adematoid hamartoma (6 [8%] patients) and olfactory neuroblastoma (5 [7%] patients). The olfactory cleft can be identified as a new surgical field for endonasal endoscopic surgery. This anatomic region is amenable to endoscopic evaluation and the excision of tumours. Exenteration of the olfactory cleft appears to be a key technique for removing adenocarcinoma and can be extended to exenteration of the olfactory groove in cases with intracranial extension. Partial exenteration of the olfactory cleft would seem to be a suitable way of removing benign tumours like inverted papilloma or respiratory epithelial adematoid hamartoma. ","353":"Malignant tumours of the sinonasal tract represent a rare condition, accounting for only 0.5-1% of all malignancies in the Western population. Patients with malignant tumours of the nasal cavity and sinuses form a heterogeneous group when it comes to histology and treatment protocols. This review of adenocarcinoma of the sinonasal tract aims to provide a comprehensive overview of aetiological factors, histological subtypes, diagnostic workup, currently available treatment options, survival analysis and prognostic factors for treatment outcome. The current treatment of choice is surgical resection, using whichever approach allows access for the removal of the entire tumour with a curative intent.","354":"Draf in 1991. The procedure--which is also known as the modified endoscopic Lothrop procedure--aims to create the largest possible anteroposterior and lateral to lateral opening between both frontal sinuses and the nasal cavities. This requires the resection of the medial floor of both frontal sinuses, the intersinus septum and the superior nasal septum. The authors present a retrospective study including a cohort of 120 patients who underwent surgery in six Belgian university ENT departments. Mean follow-up was 24.6 months (range: 5-36 months). This paper describes the surgical procedure and reviews the indications, comorbidities, outcomes and complications of the type III frontal sinusotomy. Some correlations are also established with the data published in the worldwide literature. The authors conclude that the Draf III is a demanding procedure requiring considerable expertise in endoscopic sinus surgery. The procedure is effective with a success rate of 87.5%. Indeed, 12.5% of patients only experienced closure of the neoostium while 20% of all the patients had unchanged or worse symptomatology. The percentage of post-operative complications is 7.5%. All complications were managed successfully.","355":"","356":"Literary parody is a mode of expression characterized by irony. Every people, every language showcases its own genius in it.

To avoid neurological complications or even death, surgery is the preferred treatment for large tumours with an extrameatal diameter &gt; 3.0 cm. We present the case history of a man with a large vestibular schwannoma who had refused treatment and was seen again eighteen years later. This patient had not developed symptoms other than the initial hearing loss. Repeated imaging showed that the tumour had not grown and the brainstem compression had not progressed. This case history illustrates the unpredictable growth pattern of vestibular schwannomas. Apparently, even large tumours in close proximity to the brainstem may remain stable for many years. However, there still are no valid arguments to refrain from therapy in patients with a large vestibular schwannoma, since reliable growth predictors are not available. ","358":"To report a second primary giant cell tumour (GCT) of the temporal bone and infratemporal fossa. Medical records were analyzed in the context of the available literature. A 30 year-old male developed a temporal bone GCT with infratemporal fossa extension 12 years after undergoing successful surgical treatment of a GCT of the femur. These tumours were histologically distinct, suggesting the development of a second primary GCT rather than metastatic disease. This case differs from prior reported cases by surgical approach. Complete removal was achieved but required resection of the zygomatic arch and dissection of all upper facial nerve branches. The patient is disease free after 3 years with acceptable functional and cosmetic results. Complete resection of GCTs of the temporal bone and infratemporal fossa is advocated. Surgical techniques that allow for visualization of the facial nerve and increase surgical access can enhance overall clinical success. ","359":"Pneumoparotid is a rare condition in which air is insufflated through Stensen's duct into the parotid gland. This causes mostly painless swelling in the parotid region. We report on a 7-year old girl presenting with painless unilateral swelling of the left parotid region, present for one month. Computer tomography showed the presence of air in the left parotid gland and in both the left and right Stensen's duct. A thorough history revealed the girl was insufflating the parotid glands intentionally as a response to stress. The patient was comforted and instructed to avoid insufflation manoeuvres, which resulted in complete resolution. Pneumoparotid should be considered part of a differential diagnosis in children and adolescents presenting with painless uni- or bilateral swelling of the parotid gland. Supportive and conservative treatment is advocated. ","360":"We report on a clinical case of simultaneous and unilateral involvement of the facial and superior laryngeal nerve in a patient with chronic renal disease undergoing haemodialysis. A 75-year-old man with chronic renal failure was referred to our department suffering from severe odynophagia. During flexible endoscopy, vesicles were found on the mucosa of his right supraglottic larynx. Two days later, peripheral facial nerve palsy with a mild auricular rash appeared in the patient. The clinical presentation suggested varicella-zoster virus reactivation, which was confirmed serologically, and appropriate treatment was administered. Involvement of more than one cranial nerve in herpes zoster infection is possible, especially in vulnerable patients such as those with chronic renal failure. It is also important to suspect involvement of the superior laryngeal nerve in cases of odynophagia and throat pain, even when hoarseness is absent. ","361":"Microdebriders are powered tools used in ear, nose, and throat surgeries. In this case, a use of a microdebrider in a patient who underwent revision endoscopic sinus surgery for nasal polyposis resulted in a destructive complication, namely a large skull base defect.","362":"Pneumosinus dilatans (PSD) and pneumocele involve the expansion of one or more paranasal sinuses. We present the first cases of frontal PSD and pneumocele associated with nasal polyposis. We also attempt to explain the development of these rare pathologies through this unexpected association. Two cases are described. A 31-year-old man presented with chronic rhinosinusitis for many years and a left frontal protrusion. Physical examination found nasal polyposis and CT scan showed an abnormally enlarged left frontal sinus without bone destruction. The second patient was a 17-year-old man who presented with a left frontal protrusion and orbital encroachment associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. Physical examination also found nasal polyposis and CT scan showed an abnormally enlarged left frontal sinus with focal thinning of the bony sinus walls. Focal or generalized thinning of the bony sinus walls differentiates pneumocele from PSD; otherwise, these two entities share the same physiopathological and clinical courses. Many explanations have been proposed for their development including increases in intra-sinus pressure, weakening of bone by tumor invasion, intracranial hypotension, spontaneous drainage of a mucocele, and congenital or hormonal causes. Yet, its physiopathology remains unknown. These two cases support the pressure mechanism of development. ","363":"Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) is standard practice in sinonasal disease and is becoming more accepted in the performance of anterior skull base resections. We report our experience with image-guided surgery (IGS) in difficult cases of paranasal sinus (PNS) and skull base pathologies and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this technique. A retrospective chart review was performed for the period 2004-2009. Degree of PNS involvement, indication for IGS, incidence of major complications, need for revision surgery, and technical data regarding the system were gathered. Sixty-two of 86 patients were followed for at least one year and therefore included in the analysis. Indications for IGS were mostly revision surgery for polyposis (42%), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) of frontal and\/or sphenoid sinuses (14.5%), skull base tumours (30.6%), and foreign body removal (4.8%). Revision rates after IGS in polyposis, CRS, and benign skull base tumours were 7.7%, 11.11%, and 7.1%, respectively. IGS is of particular benefit in the management of sinonasal polyposis, benign skull base tumours, palliative surgery, and foreign body removal. IGS may avoid trauma to the orbit and anterior skull base and reduces the rate of revision surgeries rendering more meticulous and complete operations possible. We also think it could be helpful for foreign body removal. ","364":"The aim of this study was to use transnasal endoscopy to observe transport through the maxillary ostia in the ethmoid infundibulum, to gain more basic scientific information about the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus. Transnasal observation of 512 patients in a supine or seated position was conducted with 0- and 70-degree nasal endoscopes. Drainage pathways of mucopurulence at the natural maxillary ostia were observed. A dye test was also performed in 53 patients to clearly observe real-time transport of activated carbon in the ethmoid infundibulum. Among 914 ethmoid infundibula, mucopurulence and activated carbon were transported out of 31 and 53 natural maxillary ostia, respectively. All ethmoid infundibula drained at the inferior edges of the ostium, despite patients' supine or seated positions. Fourteen cases of mucopurulence and 17 cases of activated carbon flowed circularly in the ethmoid infundibula. The flow of activated carbon from the natural ostium to the nasopharynx could also be observed simultaneously or solely. However, there were 6 ostia through which no activated carbon flowed back into or drained out of the sinus, despite flow from the natural ostium to the nasopharynx or circular flow. The drainage pathway of the maxillary ostium is its inferior edge. The accessory ostium is only necessary to promote circular flow. Mucopurulence or activated carbon, which flowed circularly in the ethmoid infundibulum, can also be gradually transported to the nasopharynx. Revision surgery may not be necessary for all patients with circular chronic maxillary sinuses. ","365":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with a thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC) or fistula. The records of 49 patients (9 female, 40 male; mean age: 23.16 +\/- 1.13 years; range 6 to 56 years) operated on between January 1995 and July 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient's age, sex, duration of symptoms, clinical features, pre-operative diagnostic tests, treatment, histopathologic diagnosis, and post-operative complications were noted. All patients underwent the Sistrunk procedure. Fifteen patients (30.6%) were &lt; or = 20 years old, while 3 (6.1%) patients were 40 years old at the time of operation. There was cyst formation in 26 patients (53.1%) and fistula formation in 23 patients (46.9%). The lesions of 41 patients (83.7%) were located in the midline, while the lesions of 8 patients (16.3%) were located in the paramedian neck (5 left side, 3 right side). The most common presenting symptoms were painless mass in the midline of the neck and recurrent suppuration of fistula formation. Neck ultrasonography (USG) was the most common pre-operative diagnostic procedure and was performed on all patients with cyst formations. There were no major complications postoperatively. There was recurrence in only one patient after the Sistrunk procedure. One patient was incidentally diagnosed with thyroid papillary carcinoma after histopathological examination. A TGDC is the most common congenital mass in the neck and is usually located midline. USG is suggested for a clinically suspected TGDC. The Sistrunk procedure is a safe and successful technique with low complication and recurrence rates. Even though carcinomas arising in TGDCs are uncommon, histopathological examination must be routinely performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy. ","366":"This study was designed to evaluate health related quality of life post thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism with respect to clinical benefit and patient satisfaction. This is one of the first such studies in the literature evaluating quality of life post thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism. A total of sixty-three patients who underwent thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism over a four and a half year period were included in the study. All surgery was preformed by a single surgeon. Sixty-three patients were contacted on average 26 months post thyroidectomy (range 4-51 months). The main indication for surgery in our series was failure to respond to medical therapy representing 92% (58\/63) of cases. The main cause of hyperthyroidism was Grave's disease which represented 81% (51\/63) of cases, toxic multinodular goitre accounted for 14% (9\/63) of cases and 5% (3\/63) of patients had a toxic adenoma. Ninety-five percent (60\/63) underwent total thyroidectomy and 5% (3\/63) underwent partial thyroidectomy. Eighty-one percent of patients were female (51\/63) and 19% (12\/63) were male. The median age of patients was 43 yrs (range 18-73 yrs). HRQL was significantly improved in physical, mental and social dimensions in the majority of patients. This study evaluates quality of life in a standardized analogue fashion, with significant improvement reported in all quality of life measures and we conclude that thyroidectomy remains an excellent treatment option for patients with hyperthyroidism. ","367":"This study aimed to assess speech perception and communication skills in adolescents between ages 8 and 18 that received cochlear implants for pre- and peri-lingual deafness. We studied 15 adolescents, aged 12 to 23 years, with late cochlear implantation. Speech perception was assessed with the Bishop sentences test and a memory number sequence test at 3-9 years after cochlear implantation. A questionnaire completed retrospectively was used to investigate communication skills pre- and post implantation. Six individuals achieved grammar comprehension scores comparable to children 8-10 years old with normal hearing; only 3 individuals achieved a percentile rank higher than 50% in the memory number sequence test. The self-reported communication skills improved after cochlear implantation in all adolescents. Speech perception skills of adolescents with late implantation for pre- and peri-lingual deafness are typically inferior to those of children with normal hearing at the age of 10. However, when the evaluation of the cochlear implant outcome was broadened with the use of a questionnaire, many individuals reported that they participated more actively in conversations, spoke more actively to unknown individuals, and were more easily understood by others. ","368":"The effect of noise on employees of dental clinics is debatable. The purposes of this study were to determine the intensity and frequency components of dental instruments used by dental staff nurses and the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss. We performed a comparative, cross sectional study on a group of dental staff nurses. Participants underwent ear examination followed by pure tone audiometry. Pure tone audiometry was performed at least 48 hours after the participants were free from noise exposure. Noise induced hearing loss was defined as failed definitive threshold at a frequency of 4000 Hz greater than 20 dB. The intensity level, noise spectrum, and frequency of hand piece, saliva suction, and scaler were recorded during the dental procedure. A total of 65 dental staff nurses were included. The mean intensity of hand pieces, scalers, and saliva suctions were 88.7 (SD2.2), 87.1 (SD2.6), and 77.4 (SD6.3) dBA while their most prominent frequencies were 3880, 7997, and 3513 Hz, respectively. Three of the subjects had slightly more than 20 dB hearing loss at 4 kHz on audiogram; all were affected unilaterally. These three individuals worked as dental nurses for 11, 13, and 21 years, respectively. Therefore, the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss was 5.0% (95% CI: -1.0%, 10.0%). Dental staff nurses might have an increased risk of noise induced hearing loss, depending upon individual factors influencing susceptibility and duration of noise exposure. ","369":"This study aimed to validate the Dutch version of the Spatial Hearing Questionnaire (SHQ). The original English SHQ by Tyler et al. is a useful and reliable self-reported assessment of spatial hearing. It has excellent construct validity and significantly correlates with other measures of auditory function. Our goal is to have similarly high internal consistency reliability and construct validity for the Dutch version of the SHQ. We obtained the Dutch version of the original American English SHQ by the process of translation and back-translation. The SHQ was assessed in 71 patients at the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department of Antwerp University Hospital. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha value. Factor analysis was performed and compared to results from previous psychometric analysis of the original SHQ. Construct validity was checked by comparing scores obtained in patients with asymmetric and symmetric hearing loss. The internal consistency of the Dutch version of the SHQ was very high with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.98. Comparison of a group with asymmetric and symmetric impaired patients revealed significant differences in the SHQ total score and most subscale scores, emphasizing good construct validity. The SHQ was successfully translated to Dutch. The psychometric characters of the Dutch questionnaire are similar to the original SHQ in English, with high internal consistency reliability. The Dutch version of the SHQ, Vragenlijst voor Ruimtelijk Horen, is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring spatial hearing abilities in both clinic and research settings.

Currently, this nerve is not addressed well in the pertinent literature. Pre-operative diagnosis of IN tumours is clinically challenging due to the lack of related symptoms. Symptoms are typically caused by the functional deterioration of neighbouring anatomical structures. In this report, we describe a patient with a schwannoma that arose at the porus acusticus of the internal auditory canal; during surgery, this proved to originate from the IN. We discuss our findings in the context of previously reported cases of IN schwannomas and analyse the vague characteristics and symptoms of this rare tumour.","372":"A 34-year-old man developed an ovoid swelling in the right buccal submucosa adjacent to Stensen's duct. Computed tomography revealed a 25 x 20 mm, well-demarcated calcified mass. The excised mass was encapsulated by soft tissues and contained a calcified nodule measuring 15 x 15 x 10 mm. Histopathologic examination revealed the absence of neoplastic cells. The peripheral wall of the mass was infiltrated by inflammatory cells and contained hemorrhages with minimal calcifications. The central portion of the mass was composed of foreign body granuloma-like changes and multiple calcified nodules that were diffusely hyalinized with fibrous connective tissue. The patient has been followed for six years with no recurrence. Accurate diagnosis is important to avoid unnecessary and mutilating surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a calcified nodule in the buccal submucosa of an adult.","373":"Arnold Chiari Malformation Type II can be associated with basilar invagination through an elongated retroflexed odontoid process (dens axis). Traditionally, decompression surgery has been performed transorally under microscopic vision or via transcutaneous latero-cervical\/posterior approaches. Endoscopic approaches were introduced a few years ago. We report of an eleven-year-old girl with Arnold Chiari Malformation Type II who had undergone surgery eight years ago for posterior cranial fossa decompression at the department of neurosurgery. At that time, an external transcutaneous median approach was performed to resect the posterior arch of the atlas. The patient now presented with the initial symptoms of brainstem compression as a result of an elongated retroflexed odontoid process and craniocervical instability. An endoscopic transoral\/transnasal approach was chosen for the resection of the dens. Endoscopic surgery was successful and the complete resection of the dens was achieved without any complications. In a second intervention, orthopaedic surgeons performed cranio-cervical arthrodesis. ","374":"Haemangiopericytoma is an uncommon vascular tumour of the sinonasal region with different clinical and pathological presentations. Given its origin from Zimmerman's pericytes around the capillaries, profuse bleeding during surgical manipulation is a characteristic sign. The open approach, with or without pre-operative embolisation, is therefore the usual technique for the resection of a large sinonasal haemangiopericytoma. We report on a case of haemangiopericytoma with massive unilateral involvement of the maxillary, anterior and posterior ethmoids, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses with extension to the ipsilateral orbit causing proptosis and diplopia. The tumour was completely removed endoscopically, and the dura exposed in the posterior part of the frontal recess was covered with a septal mucosal graft.","375":"A 36-year-old woman presented with a feeling of pressure in the right orbit and proptosis of the right eye after a \"common cold\". Computed tomography (CT) of the maxillofacial region revealed, and endoscopy confirmed, a mass in the right ethmoid sinus, eroding the lamina papyracea and extending into the orbit. Pathology of multiple biopsies revealed a nasal neoplasm composed of neuroectodermal and mesenchymal neoplastic elements, suggestive of a malignant ectomesenchymoma (MEM). Magnetic resonance imaging was used for MEM staging. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen show no evidence of distant metastases. Due to the intracranial and intraorbital extension of the tumour, radical surgery was not an option. Appropriate chemotherapy (6 cycles of vincristine\/ifosfamide\/adriamycin and 2 cycles of vincristine\/ifosfamide\/cisplatin) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy were administered. Twenty-eight months after treatment, there was no evidence of residual or metastatic disease.

REAH are shiny, polypoid, exophytic masses with a rubbery to firm texture. They may arise and co-exist in the setting of inflammatory polyps. We present a case of a 49-year-old patient who was referred to the department with a clinical diagnosis of chronic nasal sinusitis. Results of post-op histopathological examination show a mild change of the respiratory epithelium requiring, among others, differentiation from inverted papilloma and adenoid carcinoma.","377":"In this retrospective study, we describe our experience in the diagnosis and management of rhinocerebral mucormycosis (RCM), a rapidly lethal fungal infection. Between 1997 and 2007, five patients hospitalized for suspicion of RCM. Computed tomography was performed in all cases, and diagnosis was confirmed after anatomopathological or mycological examination. All patients underwent medical and surgical treatment. Follow-up was clinical and radiological with a mean period of 17 months. All patients were diabetic. Exophthalmia, rhinorrhea, and ophthalmoplegia were the most frequent symptoms observed. One patient had loss of visual acuity and another exhibited peripheral facial palsy. One patient had extensive hemifacial cutaneous necrosis. Nasal endoscopy revealed black necrotic lesions in one case, and another patient had a tumefaction localised in the left middle meatus. Necrotic lesions were most often found in the orbit, the maxillary and the ethmoidal sinuses on computed tomography (four cases for each site). One patient had thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinus, and another had an intracranial extension. All patients were administered ordinary insulin and intravenous amphotericin B. Surgical debridement of the nasal cavity and the involved sinuses was performed through lateral rhinotomy (four cases) or endoscopy (one case). Unilateral orbital exenteration was associated in two cases. Progression was favourable in four cases; one patient died from sepsis despite aggressive treatment. Early diagnosis is crucial for the management of RCM. Treatment of underlying disorders, use of intravenous amphotericin B, and aggressive surgical intervention are key in reducing morbidity and mortality rates. ","378":"Septal deviation is often found in conjunction with other pathological conditions that adversely affect nasal patency. Anterior septal deviation, together with contralateral alar collapse, is a relatively rare type of anatomical and functional incompetence. In our experience, it can often be resolved with septoplasty, without the necessity of surgery involving the external valve. The aim of this paper was to verify this hypothesis prospectively. Twelve patients with anterior septal deviation and simultaneous alar collapse on the opposite side were prospectively enrolled in the study. Subjective assessment of nasal patency was made on post-operative day 1, and again 6 months after surgery, using a subjective evaluation of nasal breathing. The width of the nostril (alar-columellar distance) on the side with the alar collapse was measured during inspiration pre-operatively, 1 day after surgery and again 6 months after surgery. Immediately after surgery, all patients reported improved or excellent nasal breathing on the side of the original septal deviation. On the collapsed side, one patient reported no change in condition. With the exception of one patient, all measurements showed some degree of improvement in the extension of the alar-columellar distance. The average benefit 6 months after surgery was an improvement of 4.54 mm. In our group of patients (anterior septal deviation and simultaneous contralateral alar collapse and no obvious structural changes of the alar cartilage) we found septoplasty to be entirely suitable and we recommend it as the treatment of choice in such cases. ","379":"To determine the relationship between peri-operative predictors of morbidity and mortality in advanced head and neck cancer patients. The records of 37 consecutive patients who underwent major surgery for advanced head and neck cancer were reviewed. We evaluated factors potentially predisposing to major complications after major surgery for treating advanced head and neck cancer. Twenty-seven men and ten women with a median age of 59 years were included. Eighteen of the thirty-seven had an albumin level &lt; 3.5 g\/dl. All the post-operative complications occurred in hypoalbuminemic patients (p = 0.001). The fatal complication appeared in the patient with a albumin level &lt; 0.5 g\/dl. The definitive model with logistic regression analysis showed that peri-operative albumin level and the site of origin of the tumour involved a five- and twofold increase respectively in the risk of major complications after major surgery in advanced head and neck patients. The results suggest that hypoalbuminemia is common among head and neck patients. Hypoalbuminemia, as the site of origin of the tumour, is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in head and neck patients who receive surgical treatment. ","380":"Resection of pathological parathyroid glands is the only curative therapy in primary hyperparathyroidism. Adequate pre-operative localization of the pathological glands is very useful, whichever surgical technique is preferred. The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare high resolution ultrasonography and sestamibi scintigraphy as pre-operative imaging techniques and to explore their relationship with certain demographic and biochemical variables. Data from 368 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism referred for surgery were retrospectively analysed. The results of pre-operative imaging were compared with the operative findings and the anatomopathological report. In predicting the correct side of the lesion (right or left), ultrasonography had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84%, whereas sestamibi imaging had a PPV of 93%. If both imaging techniques had a concordant positive result, the PPV was 99%. The PPV in predicting the correct quadrant, however, was only 61% for sestamibi scintigraphy and 40% for ultrasonography. In our study, sestamibi imaging was better than ultrasonography as a single pre-operative localization imaging method for primary hyperparathyroidism. A concordant positive result was exceedingly reliable in indicating the side of the lesion. It seemed far more difficult to predict the quadrant correctly, especially because of misinterpretation of the upper adenomas. ","381":"To evaluate the role of pre-operative infection in thyroglossal duct cyst recurrence and post-operative complications of Sistrunk procedure. Medical records of 55 patients undergoing thyroglossal duct cyst excision from 1998 to 2005 were reviewed. The following data was collected: age at operation, gender, surgical technique, presence and length of infection prior to operation, time interval between resolution of infection and operation, recurrence, management of recurrence, and complications. Forty-two patients (76.3%) had no recurrence following Sistrunk procedure, while 13 patients (23.7%) underwent one or more additional procedures due to recurrence. Our results indicate that 61.5% (8 of 13) of those with a failed Sistrunk had pre-operative thyroglossal cyst infection that lasted more than 6 months. In 92.3% of patients with recurrence, the interval between resolution of infection and time of operation was less than one month. Effective treatment of thyroglossal duct cyst infection, at least one month pre-operatively, is warranted to reduce post-operative recurrence rate.

Tonsillectomy cases performed using the cold dissection method between 1998 and 2008 at 5 distinct health centers affiliated with the Baskent University were retrospectively reviewed.The seasonal distribution of hemorrhage cases was assessed and the rates of hemorrhage were compared with average air temperature in each region. A total of 4118 patients who underwent tonsillectomy the cold dissection method were included in this study. Post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage occurred in 71 (1.7%) patients. Intraoperative bleeding control was provided with bipolar cautery in 65 (91.5%) cases and bipolar cautery and suture in 6 (8.5%) cases. The season and air temperature had a significant influence on secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage with a significant increase in secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage cases during the winter months (p &lt; 0.05).

A young pregnant woman presented with sensorineural hearing loss after clarithromycin intake. The subject's hearing returned to normal limits after drug discontinuation and short-term treatment with low dose steroids. Newer macrolides are considered to be safer regarding ototoxic effects, and a few cases have been previously described. The present case adds to the body of knowledge concerning clarithromycin ototoxicity. Clinicians should be aware of this rare complication and a thorough otologic history should be established prior to macrolide administration.

Histogenesis remains controversial, although the consensus tends toward a pluripotent stem cell of the middle ear mucosa as the origin of the lesion. The tumour is characterised by dual differentiation with exocrine and endocrine components. The most common symptoms are conductive hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo. The treatment of choice is complete surgical removal of the tumour with no adjuvant radiotherapy being required. We report the case of a 23-year-old man presenting with chronic otitis media, conductive hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus who, some years previously, had suffered from an episode of facial nerve palsy. Conservative therapy failed and so surgery was performed. Tumour-like masses were encountered and histological and immunohistochemical examination revealed a neuroendocrine adenoma of the middle ear. This rare entity should be considered as differential diagnosis when treating chronic inflammatory disease not responding to conservative therapy or dealing with unclear expansive processes of the middle ear. MRI scans should be performed since CT scans are inconclusive.

Retrospective study design in a tertiary referral neurology unit. We studied a total of 123 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma who underwent microsurgical removal of the lesion. Nine patients were excluded because they had clinically abnormal pre-operative facial function. Pre-operative electrophysiological facial nerve function testing (EPhT) was performed. Short-term (1 month) and long-term (1 year) post-operative clinical facial nerve function were assessed. When pre-operative facial nerve function, evaluated by EPhT, was normal, the outcome from clinical follow-up at 1-month post-operatively was excellent in 78% (i.e. HB I-II) of patients, moderate in 11% (i.e. HB III-IV), and bad in 11% (i.e. HB V-VI). After 1 year, 86% had excellent outcomes, 13% had moderate outcomes, and 1% had bad outcomes. Of all patients with normal clinical facial nerve function, 22% had an abnormal EPhT result and 78% had a normal result. No statistically significant differences could be observed in short-term and long-term post-operative facial function between the groups. In this study, electrophysiological tests were not able to predict facial nerve outcome after vestibular schwannoma surgery. Tumour size remains the best pre-operative prognostic indicator of facial nerve function outcome, i.e. a better outcome in smaller lesions.

Nonetheless, there is currently no definitive evidence that steroid therapy is effective and appropriate for BM. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of systemic steroid therapy for treating BM. This prospective study included 23 patients affected by BM with sensorineural hearing loss (median age, 45.8 years). The subjects were divided into two groups: Group A received only systemic antibiotic treatment and Group B received systemic antibiotics plus systemic steroid treatment. There were no differences between the groups in terms of the sensorineural hearing loss recovery.

Patients were followed for at least two years post-operative, without evidence of local, regional, or distant disease. Only patients with squamous cell carcinoma limited to the endolarynx requiring total laryngectomy with or without elective neck dissection for surgical management of cancer and with no pre-operative treatment were included. Dysphagia was evaluated by PSS prior to surgery and again two years postoperatively with an emphasis on eating in public and normalcy of diet domains. Video fluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing was performed one year after treatment. The relative number of patients with low mean scores in PSS (i.e. usually swallow paste of fluid food in presence of some selected persons or alone; &lt; or = 50) increased after total laryngectomy (p = 0.04). Patients with lower scores reported more frequent spasm of the pharyngoesophageal segment (p = 0.005). Mean scores of both domains decreased after surgery (p &lt; 0.05).

Group A received bilateral complete nasal packing, without an airway. In the other two groups, an airway designed from a poly-vinyl chloride, uncuffed endotracheal tube (number 5) was placed below the nasal pack between the inferior turbinate and septum on one (Group B) or both sides (Group C) of the nasal cavity. Patients were monitored in the ward when asleep, especially overnight, for blood pressure and SpO2 levels. Almost all patients in Group A had nasal obstruction with dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, and disturbed sleep. Only 33-40% patients in Groups B and C had similar complaints. Blood pressure rose &gt; 20 mm of Hg in 20 (67%) patients in Group A, while no patients in the airway groups showed any change in blood pressure. In Group A, the average SpO2 during sleep decreased &gt; 4% from baseline in 10 (33%) patients and negative middle ear pressure was found in 5 (17%) patients.

A retrospective review of medical records was conducted at the ENT Department of the Catholic University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium. The study analyzed the medical data of patients with rhinologic symptoms suspected of having allergies. The study included 1326 patients with a mean age of 35 +\/- 18 years (range: 3-88 years); 52.8% were males. Rhinitis without nasal abnormalities (42.1%), chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (16.5%) and nasal abnormalities (16.1%) were the most prevalent findings. About 31.6% of patients were sensitive to at least one allergen, and the most common aeroallergens were dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (62.1%) and grass pollen (53.2%).

The majority of cases are associated with Epstein Barr virus infection (EBV). The first manifestations of PTLD are frequently observed in the ENT area with adenoidal and\/or tonsillar enlargement. We present the case of a 12-year old girl with a total nasal obstruction and tonsillitis five months after a kidney transplantation for bilateral congenital kidney hypoplasia. The EBV genome was detected by polymerase reaction three months after surgery. Fiberoptic examination revealed an obstructive necrotic mass in the naso-pharynx. The anatomic-pathologic analysis revealed necrotic adenoids. Necrotic tonsillitis is common. Necrosis of the adenoids, although rarer, can also occur and explains the important respiratory distress. Since two thirds of PTLD patients present with clinical symptoms in the ENT area, the otorhinolaryngologist should be aware of this complication. ","402":"To describe a case of bilateral congenital cholesteatoma (CC) of the middle ear with a focus on diagnostic clues, treatment and a review of the pertinent literature. An 8-year-old child was incidentally noted to have whitish bilateral retrotympanic masses with normal hearing and referred to our department in January 2005. Microscopic examination of the ears and CT scan of the temporal bones led to a presumptive diagnosis of bilateral CC. The lesion on the right side was surgically removed, followed by that on the left side after 6 months; a retroauricular transcanal approach was adopted in both ears. Anatomic integrity of the middle ear was achieved with preservation of pre-operative hearing. No signs of recurrence were evident 20 months after the last surgery. Bilateral CC is a rare finding but otologists must be aware of it. Surgery must be planned early in order to achieve radical removal of the pathology and the preservation of middle ear structures. ","403":"The Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a rare clinical feature characterised by perceptual disturbances including visual disturbances and distortion of the body image. This uncommon--but often easy to recognise--syndrome, to which children seem particularly susceptible, can be defined in patients with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. This report describes a 10-year-old child with a mild upper airway obstruction and manifestations of the Alice in Wonderland syndrome resulting from an acute EBV infection. Because meningo-encephalitis was considered in the differential diagnosis, an MRI examination was performed under midazolam sedation, leading to a severe life-threatening upper airway obstruction.","404":"To highlight a rare scenario where a delay in diagnosis caused unilateral blindness. A 45-year-old Aboriginal woman with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presented with a severe left-sided headache, pyrexia and positive blood cultures. Following admission, the patient rapidly developed unilateral blindness, but did not inform her physician until 21 hours after onset. High-resolution CT scanning of the sinuses showed erosion of the bony covering of the optic nerve. Sinus surgery was performed. Despite the discovery of pus under considerable pressure, and clearing the sphenoid sinus of pus and debris, vision was not restored, even at 2-month follow-up. Two pathological processes are postulated here: that erosion of the bony optic canal allowed the optic nerve to be exposed, allowing the ensuing sinusitis to cause irreversible nerve ischemia, and immunosuppression meant the patient's immune response was inadequate to cope with the sinusitis, with devastating effects. ","405":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is commonly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma, but association with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal tumours is rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the hypopharynx. A 63-year-old male patient suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with swallowing disorders and a sore throat. Panendoscopy with laser surgical resection of tissue specimens was performed. Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic diagnostics, including EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization, confirmed the diagnosis of an EBV-associated DLBCL of the hypopharynx. Ten weeks after the diagnosis, the patient died of disease related to multiple complications. We hypothesize that the EBV infection was triggered by long-term immunosuppressive therapy that led secondarily to the development of a DLBCL. Otorhinolaryngologists should keep in mind that lymphomas might develop in the entire pharynx. ","406":"It is well known that basaloid squamous call carcinoma (BSCC) is more aggressive than the usual form of squamous cell carcinoma. However, current information about the prognostic significance of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in the larynx is sparse. We investigated p63, p53 and Ki67 in BSCC of the larynx. In a retrospective study conducted from January 2000 to June 2006, we used immunohistochemistry to analyse the protein expression of p63, p53, and Ki-67 in paraffin-embedded tumour samples from 22 BSCC patients and compared the clinicopathological parameters with the survival outcome. Positive p63 expression was found in 16 of 22 BSCC specimens (72.7%). Expression was higher in cases without lymph node metastasis than in cases with lymph node metastasis. This investigation found an inverse correlation between the expression of p63 and lymph node status in BSCC. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study of p63 expression in laryngeal BSCC. ","407":"Up to 30% of the adult population experiences tinnitus at some point in life. The aim of the present study was to validate the Mini-Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) in a Dutch-speaking population for measuring tinnitus-related distress and compare it with the extended version normally used in clinical practice and research. We assessed 181 patients at the Tinnitus Research Initiative clinic of Antwerp University Hospital. Twelve items from the TQ chosen by Hiller and Goebel based on the optimal combination of high item correlation, reliability, and sensitivity were selected and correlated to the different subscale and global scores of the TQ. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and the Guttman split-half coefficient was used to confirm reliability. Correlation to the global TQ score was .93, internal consistency was .87, and reliability was .89. This study further revealed that the Mini-TQ correlates better with the different subscales of the TQ in the Dutch-speaking population. The convergence validity was confirmed, ensuring that this new instrument measures distress. In addition, the norms suggested by Hiller and Goebel were verified and established. Based on these results, the Mini-TQ is recommended as a valid instrument for evaluating tinnitus-related distress in Dutch-speaking populations for a compact, quick, and economical assessment. ","408":"Although gradual frequency and amplitude variations originating from intonation or vocal instability are not related to voice quality, jitter and shimmer are sensitive to such variations. These parameters are therefore calculated by subtracting the average of a group of successive periods from the middle period; the period number that is averaged is called the smoothing factor. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of smoothing factor size on frequency and amplitude perturbation measurements. A prospective study was designed, incorporating recorded voice samples from ten male and ten female healthy adult volunteers; samples were analyzed with the Multi Dimensional Voice Program for Multi-Speech. We used all low smoothing factor sizes up to 21, and then skipped smoothing factor sizes in steps of ten, resulting in 28 different levels. Smoothed pitch perturbation quotient and smoothed amplitude perturbation quotient values increased as the smoothing factor size increased. Smoothing factor size was correlated with smoothed pitch perturbation quotient and smoothed amplitude perturbation quotient values in males (r = 0.589 and r = 0.698, respectively) and females (r = 0.736 and r = 0.847, respectively). Our study revealed an exact relationship between smoothing factor values and perturbation measures. At low smoothing factor values, perturbation measures are sensitive to short-term variations, whereas at high smoothing factor values, they are less sensitive to short-term but more sensitive to long-term variations. ","409":"It is estimated that about 92,000 new cases of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer occurred in Europe in 2008. During the past 30 years in the USA and Western Europe, the prognosis for oral cancer has clearly improved thanks to the possibility of reconstruction with microvascular free flaps, resulting in broader and safer resections. The anterolateral thigh flap is now being increasingly employed for this goal. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the anterolateral thigh free flap in the reconstruction of oral cavity defects. Between July 2004 and February 2009, we harvested 73 free flaps for the reconstruction of soft tissue defects in the oral cavity of 70 patients at our institution. The oncological and functional results in these 70 patients were evaluated, particularly in those patients reconstructed with anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap. We also evaluated the quality of life using the FACT-H&amp;N questionnaire. We observed no significant differences in functional and oncological results between patients reconstructed by ALT and patients reconstructed with other flaps. Swallowing may be more difficult in patients who undergo adjuvant irradiation. In our opinion, the very low morbidity at the donor site, great versatility, and very long pedicle make the ALT free flap the first choice for reconstructing soft tissue defects in the oral cavity (particularly mobile tongue). ","410":"While the effects of early visual deprivation on auditory and tactile functions have been widely studied, little is known about olfactory function in early blind subjects. The present study investigated the potential effect of early blindness on the electrophysiological correlates of passive odour perception. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in eight early blind humans and eight sighted controls matched for age, sex and handedness during olfactory stimulation with 2-phenyl ethyl alcohol and trigeminal stimulation with CO2 Latencies, amplitudes and topographical distributions were analysed. As expected, the olfactory and trigeminal ERP components showed normal latencies, amplitudes and topography in both groups. Olfactory stimuli generated responses of smaller amplitude than those observed in response to trigeminal stimulation. In addition, ERP analyses did not reveal any major difference in electrocortical responses in occipital areas in early blind and sighted subjects. These results suggest that passive olfactory and trigeminal stimulation elicit the same electrophysiological responses in both groups, confirming that the neurophysiological correlates of the cross-modal compensatory mechanisms in early blind subjects do not appear during passive olfactory and trigeminal perception.","411":"Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is a common problem. A Song stent is a useful and simple treatment with low morbidity. However, the success rate is limited, especially in long-term follow-up. The aim of the present study is to determine the presence of biofilms in failing nasolacrimal stents. Thirty-three polyurethane nasolacrimal stents were implanted between January 2006 and December 2007 using Song's technique. Patients were followed for a mean of 21.5 months (range 11-30 months). Removed nasolacrimal stents were preserved in saline and examined using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Eighteen nasolacrimal stents were removed because of the failure of the device (follow-up range 11-30 months). Seven stents were recovered for this study. Biofilms were identified in all the specimens studied. Five prostheses showed occlusion caused by mucus or granulation tissue. Biofilm colonisation of nasolacrimal stents could play a major role in prosthetic failure leading to stent occlusion. Mucus, granulation tissue and irregularities of the biomaterial are factors that facilitate biofilm colonisation. Non-stick material for newly developed stents or drugs capable of destroying the polysaccharide matrix should be considered as future therapeutic options. ","412":"Advanced salivary gland cancer is a rare disease that comprises different histopathological tumour types; correspondingly, data on palliative systemic treatment are scarce. Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP) has been reported to induce a reasonable response rate, although fewer than 100 cases have been described. We conducted a retrospective review of advanced salivary gland cancer patients treated with CAP. Fifteen consecutive patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic progressive salivary gland cancer treated with CAP were identified over a five-year period. The mean age at start of treatment was 53.5 years, and the male\/female ratio was 11\/4. The most common histological subtypes were adenoid cystic carcinoma and adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS), with the parotid gland as the most frequently affected anatomical site. A response rate of 60% was achieved, with one complete and eight partial responses and six stable diseases according to RECIST criteria. No patient progressed under treatment. An average of 5.4 treatment cycles were administered; median time to progression after ending CAP was 6.6 months, and median overall survival was 15.1 months. Patients with adenocarcinoma NOS appeared to benefit more than patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, but had a shorter time to progression. Except for neutropenia with neutropenic fever and alopecia, no NCI-CTC grade III or IV toxicity was observed. This retrospective study confirms the clinically meaningful efficacy of CAP in advanced adenocarcinomas NOS of the salivary gland in routine practice, with acceptable safety levels. ","413":"","414":"Reading textbooks or manuals about rhinoplasty techniques, the novice may be disconcerted by the multitude of different surgical manoeuvres, all intended to achieve the same result: a cosmetically appealing and functional nose. This article describes a survey of 30 rhinoplasticians that investigated, using a questionnaire with 51 items, current opinion and practice in rhinoplasty with the aim of identifying areas of consensus or disagreement. Only 16 questions in 51 (31%) identified a strong consensus, mainly in the areas of informed consent, lateral osteotomies, and the accuracy and predictability of some graft procedures (columellar strut, spreader graft). There was also a consensus about the rejection of some unusual procedures (electric-powered rasping of the dorsum, allopathic implants). However, no consensus was found in many domains, such as tip or columella management, resection of the dome, dome sutures, alar batten grafts, dorsal graft, nasal packing, pre-operative functional investigations, morphing, alar base reduction or the management of septal perforation. Our survey found a dramatic lack of agreement about rhinoplastic procedures, which remain highly dependent on the skill and experience of surgeons who favour the techniques with which they have achieved good results in the past. It also identifies a case for adopting, as in other fields of medicine, guidelines based upon consensual expert opinion and the evaluation of outcomes with appropriate and validated instruments.","415":"The literature includes few publications dealing with the measurement of rhinoplasty outcomes. We also lack reliable instruments for such measurements. In a population of 228 patients who underwent rhinoplasty performed by the same surgeon, we evaluated patient satisfaction using Alsarraf's questionnaire and an evaluation of cosmetic improvement using standardised pre- and post-operative photographs (Photograph Score from 1- great to 7- monstrous). We correlated these data with the severity of the pre-operative nasal deformities, (Predictable Difficulty Score) with the complexity of the surgical procedure, (Surgical Complexity Score) and with four specific surgical procedures (Spreader Grafting, Domal Interruption, Grafting of the Dorsum, Tip Grafting). Both Alsarraf's questionnaire and the photograph score identified a significant difference between the pre-operative and post-operative data and appear to be reliable instruments for measuring patient satisfaction. The questionnaire takes into account the functional outcome that the PS did not. In our hands, the mean improvement evaluated by the questionnaire was 50.2%, and 2.8 according to the PS, regardless of primary or revision surgery, traumatic or non-traumatic nose, mixed cosmetic\/functional or purely cosmetic goals. The relative size of the difference between the pre- and post-operative scores was linked more to the satisfaction of the patient than to the absolute post-operative level. These two instruments (the questionnaire and the photograph score), although they are in agreement, did not allow for the establishment of any correlation between the satisfaction of the patient and the predicted difficulty score (PDS), the surgical complexity score (SCS), or three of the four specific procedures that were considered (SG, DI, GD and TG). Domal interruption was the only procedure in which we found that patient satisfaction was higher than with the other procedures (65.6% for the questionnaire and 3.8 for the photograph score).","416":"Rhinoplasty occupies a unique position in facial plastic surgery due to the central position of the nose in the face and the vital functions of the nose. Among facial plastic surgeons, secondary rhinoplasty in adult cleft-lip patients is considered to be one of the most challenging surgical interventions due to the congenital distortion of the cartilaginous and bony nasal pyramid, with consequences for both nasal aesthetics and breathing. In spite of the challenging nature of the procedure, post-operative satisfaction is high, matching that of non-cleft-lip patients, as long as appropriate surgical techniques are applied. Specific rhinoplasty methods are used in unilateral or bilateral cleft-lip patients with extensive grafting, combined efforts for aligning the nasal dorsum and the creation of symmetry in the nasal tip, medialisation of the anterior nasal spine with augmentation of the premaxilla, correction of nasal vestibulum stenosis and specific post-operative care with a nasal vestibulum device. This review aims to address some specific surgical issues relating to cleft-lip rhinoplasty, resulting in the high subjective satisfaction rate reported by cleft patients operated upon in the University Hospitals Leuven.","417":"Grafting is one of the current range of instruments that rhinoplasticians deploy to achieve durable and desired aesthetic and functional outcomes. Grafts can be classified according to anatomical site and, in the vast majority of cases, they involve augmentation rhinoseptoplasty. Visible grafting material is used for aesthetic purposes and functional grafting may involve invisible grafts. This article reviews the more widely described and more common indications for grafts in rhinoseptoplasty. The authors' rhinoseptoplasty philosophy involves a preference for autogenous grafts rather than alloplastic implants to achieve both aesthetically and functionally favourable results, particularly in long-term follow-up. They also prefer grafts in an open approach, reserving graft insertion with an endonasal approach for selected cases. The rate of complications associated with grafting is very low. The aim of this paper is to discuss the relevant anatomy, functional purpose and terminology, and to describe the authors' philosophy for grafting in rhinoseptoplasty.","418":"The use of grafts in rhinoplasty has increased exponentially over the past three decades, specially after the advent of the external approach to the nasal dorsum. The same results can be achieved with the endonasal approach, with judicious use of a small number of grafts, and still maintain the structural integrity of the nose.","419":"We discuss the physiopathology and relevant anatomy of the nasal valves--internal and external--paying particular attention to the dynamics of the airflows in this area. We describe and comment on methods for medical examination, anterior rhinoscopy, endoscopy and fibrescopy of the valve, as well as the causes and sites of nasal valve dysfunction. We propose a review of the various treatments, medical and surgical, with a special emphasis on nasal valve surgery. Surgical techniques commonly used by the authors in daily practice for nasal valvuloplasty (such as spreader grafts and Z-plasty of the nostrils) are discussed and illustrated in depth. Some one-year postoperative results are presented and discussed.","420":"In this article, we give an overview of safe and consistent techniques for nasal tip surgery. A change in the morphology of the tip has an impact on the profile of the face. A knowledge of facial proportions is therefore important when performing rhinoplastic surgery. We prefer an external approach because it provides the best overview and because the possibility of bimanual working makes manipulation of the lower lateral cartilages easier. The techniques described here can be used to alter the nasal tip in a controllable way.","421":"The rhinoplasty surgeon can choose from different osteotomy techniques. Historically, when changing the bony contour of the nasal pyramid, more attention has been devoted to refining approach to osteotomy techniques and adapting the instruments used. The importance of less damage to the soft tissues led rhinology surgeons to develop more refined osteotomy instruments. The author gives an overview of historical developments leading to our current array of techniques for addressing specific demands about aesthetic and functional outcome. A brief outline is given of the advantages, drawbacks and pitfalls of different osteotomy techniques.","422":"The authors present their surgical experience with the management of patients with dorsum deformities using a precise technique: the external percutaneous approach. The indications for this technique have still not been set out very clearly in the rhinological textbooks or manuals, and so novices (and not only novices) have difficulty in understanding and applying it. We therefore try to systematise and clarify these indications in brief, together with the technical details, providing a comparison with another technique that is in very widespread use at present: the internal lateral osteotomy. Although the external percutaneous approach is not used very often--in our experience in 30% of cases only--we find the results very satisfactory and we recommend it when it is required by the anatomic conditions.","423":"Nasal dorsal hump reduction is a frequently performed and basic step in non-functional rhinoplasty. The literature has described multiple techniques for nasal hump removal. However, most of the descriptions consider new or modified techniques. No papers have been published comparing any of these different surgical interventions. The aim of this paper is to review several techniques in common use, looking at their inherent advantages and disadvantages in the light of the authors' personal experiences. Particular attention is devoted to a comparison of component and composite hump reduction. The latest trends in hump removal techniques aim for predictable and realistic results with pleasing aesthetic outcomes based on precise resection techniques and the optimal preservation of nasal anatomy and function.","424":"Open structure rhinoplasty (OSR) is an old technique that has gained in popularity amongst plastic surgeons and otolaryngologists over the past twenty years. Opponents of the external approach cite potential problems such as unnecessary scaring, reduction of tip support, extended operative time and excessive post-operative tip swelling. However, even relatively inexperienced rhinoplastic surgeons embrace this approach, especially in cases with more complex tip deformities and skeletal abnormalities. Concerns about scarring and post-operative tissue reaction due to the more \"aggressive\" external approach make it necessary to consider the indications for the open approach carefully. Various incisions have been described for open rhinoplasty to reduce scarring, such as the Z, V, reverse V, and W incisions. There should be a strong emphasis on post-operative care in open approach rhinoplasty since open structure rhinoplasty is generally considered to be a more traumatic technique than the endonasal approach. Careful incision and dissection of the skin flap in the right surgical plane and proper suturing are essential to avoid short- and long-term complications. In conclusion, the external approach is preferable in selected cases where extended exposure (asymmetry cases, for example), per-operative assessment (revision cases), grafting and suturing are required. It allows the surgeon to work bimanually during reconstruction and the better per-operative evaluation reduces the revision rate.","425":"The endonasal approach to rhinoplasty can deal adequately with the vast majority of nasal problems that present to the facial plastic surgeon. Adequate training of surgeons can overcome the rigid dichotomy of \"endonasal\" versus \"external\" approaches and pave the way for a combination of the best of both worlds towards the concept of hybrid rhinoplasty.","426":"Recent years have seen the emergence of software for pre-operative morphing in rhinoplasty. However, a number of issues persist, such as price, time investment, limited number of modifiable variables, reduction of complexity, false expectations, informed consent, medico-legal implications and classical ENT practice. The use of preoperative morphing cannot be recommended yet.","427":"A critical step in successful surgery is the precise definition of the surgical goals by both the patient and the surgeon. Much of the discussion between the surgeon and the patient is about managing expectations. Today's technology provides an easy way of forecasting the result of a rhinoplasty procedure, as long as surgeons themselves do the morphing. In a retrospective study of 133 rhinoplasty patients, we analysed the correlation between pre-operative morphing and surgical results. The match was good (identical or similar) in 85.7% of patients (n = 114), approximate in 11.3% of patients (n = 15), and poor in 3% (n = 4). There was a significant correlation with an increased need for adjunctive procedures or revision surgery when the match was approximate or poor. The approach also proved useful for careful pre-operative planning by the surgeon, requiring detailed facial analysis and the establishment of precise goals before surgery. Overly optimistic morphing is not recommended given the risk of raising false expectations.","428":"Acoustic rhinometry (AR) and rhinomanometry (RMM) study two different parameters of nasal ventilation: respiratory function and the anatomy of nasal cavities. This article looks at their usefulness, in particular in the surgical field. We list the normal values for these tests. Nasal obstruction is a symptom of multifactorial origin. Nasal patency is only one factor influencing the sensation of nasal ventilation. Despite the range of divergent opinions in both the literature and among rhinological clinicians, the objective assessment of nasal patency in functional rhinoplasty or septorhinoplasty seems to be advisable. The roles of AR and RMM still have to be established.","429":"","430":"A royal otitis. The young king of France, Francis II, the eldest son of Henry II and Catherine de Medici, died in Orleans from the effects of the complications of a chronic otitis on 6 December 1560.

A 56-year-old woman came to our emergency service with a 2 wk history of nasal obstruction, headache, and facial pain. A nontraumatic nasal septal abscess complicating acute isolated sphenoiditis was diagnosed. Under general anaesthesia, we drained the septal abscess and performed an endoscopic transnasal sphenoidotomy. Bacteriological cultures revealed viridans streptococci in the septal abscess and sphenoid cavity. We discuss the patient's diagnosis, possible complications, and treatment. There are limited reports in the literature on this subject. Our report emphasizes the need to determine whether an infection is associated with a non-traumatic nasal septal abscess. The incidence of severe complications is directly related to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, a prompt and correct diagnosis immediately followed by appropriate treatment is necessary.","432":"The authors report on a patient whose unilateral chronic maxillary sinusitis was caused by the migration of a silastic implant used for orbital floor repair. A 32-year-old woman presented with a three-year history of right-sided maxillary discomfort that was associated with a purulent discharge. Her medical history included chronic allergic rhinitis and the placement of a silastic implant after a right orbital floor fracture at the age of 14. The silastic implant was then removed endoscopically in a right maxillary sinus meatotomy. The symptoms improved within three weeks after surgery. Orbital implant migration is a rare cause of chronic unilateral sinusitis, and it must be suspected on the basis of a careful anamnesis, appropriate clinical examination, and sinus computed tomography. Misdiagnosing such a condition may increase patient morbidity by leading to inappropriate treatment. ","433":"Formation of a mucous cyst of the nasal dorsum after rhinoplasty is a rare complication, and a limited number of cases has been reported. Located subcutaneously, mucous cysts are thought to arise from traumatically displaced mucosal remnants. This may well be the result of inadequate surgical technique, and preservation of the mucosal lining, whenever possible, is therefore advocated when performing a rhinoplasty procedure. We report a well-documented case of a patient with a mucous cyst of the nasal dorsum, which developed 40 years after the initial surgery. The cyst was excised through an external rhinoplasty approach. A thin-walled cyst, firmly attached to the bony pyramid, was easily removed from the overlying skin. Histopathological confirmation of such cysts is emphasized, as well as consideration of the technical aspects of prior surgery, since this may provide insight into risk factors involved. ","434":"Head and neck involvement in Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is not unusual. However, laryngeal involvement is a relatively infrequent manifestation and ENT specialists should consider it in differential diagnosis in laryngeal lesions of AIDS patients and\/or subjects from the Mediterranean area. Case report and review of the literature in English. Male patient presenting with a three-month history of cough and acute dyspnoea. Laryngoscopy identified a laryngeal mass occluding the glottic plane. Tracheotomy was then performed and the laryngeal lesion was removed. Histopathology showed neoplastic spindle cells that were positive to immunostain with CD-31 and CD-34, and immunoreactivity for HHV-8 was present. A diagnosis of KS was then suspected and confirmed after dermatological inspection. Purple vascular mass lesions should lead in ENT to a high index of suspicion to exclude systemic diseases. Laryngeal KS must be included in the differential diagnosis of pigmented laryngeal lesions to plan correct management. ","435":"Kaposi sarcoma is the most frequently-occurring neoplasm in AIDS patients. Laryngeal localization is infrequent. We discuss the management options for laryngeal Kaposi sarcoma based on a literature review. A 42 year old, HIV-positive male receiving HAART therapy presented with mild hoarseness and sore throat. Fiberoptic laryngeal examination identified a small purple lesion in the right ventricular fold. He underwent biopsy under general anaesthesia. The lesion was histologically diagnosed as a Kaposi sarcoma. Systemic treatment was pursued, but 6 weeks later the patient developed severe dysphagia and acute airway obstruction when the lesion became glotto-supraglottic and obstruced the airway. Transoral tumour vaporization with a CO2 laser was performed in the emergency department. Post-operative chemotherapy was administered. Three months later, the patient was completely asymptomatic and the laryngeal examination was normal. Transoral CO2 laser vaporization combined with chemotherapy is a valid option for managing obstructive laryngeal Kaposi sarcoma. ","436":"We report an extremely rare case of schwannoma of the auricle. A case report and review of the world literature concerning schwannoma of the auricle are presented. Schwannoma is a benign, encapsulated, slow-growing neoplasm. Approximately 25-45% of all schwannomas occur in the head and neck, whereas schwannomas of the external ear are extremely uncommon, with only nine cases reported in the English literature since the first report in 1977. In this report, we describe the case of a 47-year-old male patient who presented with a 2-year history of a slow-growing mass in the left auricle, which was managed by wide surgical excision. We believe this case to be the second case of schwannoma of the auricle reported. To our knowledge, this is the second report in the world literature of auricle schwannoma. Schwannoma should be considered in the evaluation of any tumour of the auricle. ","437":"We investigated the effects of subjective tinnitus on sleep quality and Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores of participants. The study group consisted of 15 patients, including 21 ears with tinnitus (6 bilateral, 9 unilateral). The control group consisted of 8 healthy patients with normal hearing and no tinnitus (16 ears). We assessed sleep quality using the Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) and mental health using the MMSE. Sleep delay (SD) was significantly higher in tinnitus patients (5.28 +\/- 2.23) compared to controls (3.25 +\/- 2.56) (p = 0.018). Subjective tinnitus loudness level (STLL) scores were higher and sleep quality was impaired in females, older patients, and patients with lower MMSE scores. Sleep quality was also worse in patients with longer tinnitus duration. In younger and well educated patients, MMSE scores were higher. Higher STLL scores and shorter tinnitus duration were associated with lower MMSE scores. Patients with newly developed tinnitus reported more disturbances and showed greater effects on mental and cognitive functioning. In subjective tinnitus patients, sleep delay values increased. Long tinnitus duration and high STLL scores may affects patients' cognitive functions as shown by decreased MMSE scores. Furthermore, mental status changes in tinnitus patients were frequently overlooked. ","438":"To help obstetric hospitals and clinics to implement newborn hearing screening and to test the feasibility of a pre-paid model for screening. From July 2005 to August 2008, we organised a coordinated newborn hearing screening team with portable automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) to provide in-patient screening after delivery and out-patient re-screening at one month of age in birthing facilities throughout Changhua County, Taiwan. This was a community-based study organised by otolaryngologists at a tertiary referral centre. Ten medical facilities participated in our screening programme. 7,139 out of 12,901 neonates delivered in these facilities during the period were screened for hearing loss. 105 (1.47%) babies who did not pass the in-patient screening were re-screened at one month old. Forty (0.56%) babies referred from the re-screening were sent for diagnostic work-up and six of them failed to show up. The overall follow-up rate was 94.3% (99\/105). Eleven babies with bilateral hearing loss and eight babies with unilateral hearing loss were diagnosed. The incidence of bilateral hearing loss in our programme was 1.5\/1000. The screening rate descended from medical centre to clinic (p &lt; 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the referral rates for different levels of birthing facilities (p = 0.5611). Our study demonstrates that a pre-paid model using AABR is feasible at all three levels of medical facilities. Pre-paid community-based screening might be an option for developing countries in the implementation of universal newborn hearing screening. ","439":"In this study we report a new endoscopic technique for the management of anterior glottic web (AGW). Previously, various procedures with endoscopic or open surgical approaches have been described for the treatment of symptomatic AGW. We present an original, highly effective endoscopic technique that seems to have several advantages over traditional approaches. We used this novel technique in a preliminary series of four patients. Using a CO2 laser, a curvilinear mucosal flap based on the web is elevated from the superior surface of one vocal chord. The web is divided, and the flap is sutured at the inferior surface of the opposite vocal chord, ensuring that no raw surfaces will be left exposed on this side of the larynx. We accurately describe the technique, displaying diagrams of the surgical steps. In three cases, a restoration of the laryngeal airway, with complete resolution of the AGW, was achieved. A limited residual web persisted close to the anterior commissure in the fourth patient. The new endoscopic technique utilized in our preliminary series of patients is a simple, repeatable, and effective surgical procedure for managing AGW. ","440":"To compare the efficacy of lidocaine spray 10% to tetracaine 2% solution, as a local anaesthetic for patients undergoing monopolar submucosal diathermy of the inferior turbinate. A prospective study was conducted on 48 patients undergoing submucosal diathermy of the inferior turbinate. Patients were randomly assigned to receive tetracaine 2% solution (24 patients) or to receive lidocaine spray 10% (24 patients). Patients were asked to evaluate the severity of pain during the procedure using a visual analogue scale. Patient data, pain scores, and potential complications were assessed statistically. The tetracaine group had significantly lower mean pain scores compared to the lidocaine group: 2.29 vs. 3.04 (p &lt; 0.001). There were no complications or side effects from tetracaine. Tetracaine 2% solution applied locally is an easy, safe, inexpensive, and effective analgesia for submucosal diathermy for inferior turbinate hypertrophy. ","441":"To compare the thermal welding technique (TWT) with cold dissection (CD) for adult tonsillectomy. A prospective, double-blind, non-randomised study was planned for 20 adult patients undergoing tonsillectomy; a total of 16 patients were included for evaluation. In all patients, the right tonsil was removed by TWT, the left tonsil by CD. Indications included chronic tonsillitis with or without upper airway obstruction. Patients with peritonsillar abscess history or bleeding disorders were excluded from analysis. Age, gender, dissection and hemostasis time, intra-operative hemostasis method, post-operative pain using a visual analogue scale, and extent of healing of the tonsillar fossa on the tenth post-operative day were evaluated. TWT was significantly superior to CD with regard to intra-operative hemostasis (p = 0.029). There were statistically significant differences between the two techniques in a post-operative pain score (p = 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the two techniques in dissection and hemostasis time (p = 0.321), nor in the healing of the tonsillar fossae on the tenth day of the surgery (p = 0.285). Compared with CD, TWT provides sufficient hemostasis and lower post-operative pain, as assessed in a limited number of adult tonsillectomy cases. ","442":"Tonsillectomy performed as day surgery has become popular over the last fifteen years. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding the safety of this practice, especially in children of very young age. We sought to determine the safety of outpatient tonsillectomy in children aged three years old and younger. A retrospective study of all tonsillectomies performed in a major pediatric hospital during a two-year period was conducted. Age, gender, indication for tonsillectomy, other procedures performed simultaneously, seniority of operating surgeon, and reasons for hospital admissions during the first post-operative week were recorded. Patients with inappropriate records for the analysis were excluded. A total of 1058 patients were studied. Tonsillectomized children were divided into two age groups: greater than 3 years old (n = 951) and 3 years old or younger (n = 107). Male gender, obstructed sleep disordered breathing as indication for surgery, seniority of the operating surgeon, and age of 3 years old or younger were not associated with post-operative complications. Outpatient tonsillectomy can be managed safely regardless of age, as long as specific factors, such as good recovery room supervision, exist. ","443":"A tonsillectomy, with or without an adenotomy ((A)TE), is a common surgical procedure in children. The most important indications are recurrent tonsillitis and upper airway obstruction secondary to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the current (A)TE practice in Belgium reduced the need for medical care. The database of the Christelijke Mutualiteit, one of the most important health insurance organizations in Belgium, provided data on approximately 11,000 (A)TE's in children aged 0 to 15 years, performed by different ENT-specialists from Jan 1st 2002 to Sept 30th 2003. We compared the use of antibiotics during the 12 months before and the 12 months after (A)TE. We also compared the number of visits to pediatricians and general practitioners during the 12 months before and the 12 months after surgery. The median antibiotic use dropped from 4 boxes in the year before the operation to 1 box in the year after the operation. The median number of doctor visits also dropped from 7 visits in the year before to 4 visits in the year after (A)TE. Although there are no generally accepted guidelines on the indications for (A)TE in Belgium, the current practice effectively reduced the need for medical care.

Trepanation was discussed briefly before being rejected. The autopsy on the King confirmed that it would have been justified. Even though there was no skull fracture, there was a secondary rebound trauma resulting in a subdural haematoma in the occipital area. This paper examines why the trepanation option was rejected (Figure 1).","445":"To report an unusual case of Kimura's disease associated with intracranial hemorrhage, the first such report in the literature. A 38-year-old man presented with chronic neurological disorders and a 10-year history of left cervical soft tissue swellings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cranium showed a subacute\/chronic hematoma in the left occipitotemporal lobe and a chronic infarct in the right parietal lobe. Cervical computed tomography (CT) and MRI showed multiple masses on the left side of the neck and parotid gland. Histopathologic examination revealed lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration, proliferation of hyalinated blood vessels, and interstitial fibrosis. Steroid therapy (2 mg\/kg per day) was started and the lesions regressed partially. The masses and some enlarged regional lymph nodes were resected. Intracranial hemorrhage can either be a coincidental finding or complication of Kimura's disease. MRI and CT are effective modalities in radiologic diagnosis of this condition. ","446":"Lymphangiomas, or cystic hygromas, are relatively uncommon congenital malformations of the lymphatic system that usually present during the first years of childhood. They are rare in adults. A search of the literature on MedLine revealed only few reports about lymphangioma as a cause of difficult airway management after the neonatal period. Herein, we present a case of difficult intubation due to protruding macroglossia in a 5-year-old girl diagnosed with recurrent lesions of lymphangioma. We also discuss possible problems in airway protection, drug choice, and post-operative follow-up associated with surgical excision of these lesions.","447":"Laryngocele is defined as an abnormal dilatation of the laryngeal ventricle. It is a very rare entity, and the exact underlying mechanism is still unclear. Laryngoceles are associated with larynx carcinoma but not yet lung cancer. A 46-year-old man presented with stridor, wheezing, dyspnea at rest, hoarseness evolving over two months, and cyanosis secondary to cervical swelling. His medical history included a 72 pack-year smoking habit and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for 10 years. Airway management included a surgical tracheotomy for respiratory distress. A neck CT revealed laryngocele. A chest X-ray showed a left basal pulmonary opacity. Bronchoscopic exploration found an infiltrated and narrow left stem bronchus with complete stenosis of the lingula. Pathology revealed a small cell lung carcinoma. Our case shows the possible association of laryngocele and lung carcinoma. The pathophysiology was explained by the long history of tobacco smoking and the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic cough. ","448":"Rhinophyma is characterized by a slow progressive enlargement of the nasal skin that cannot resolve spontaneously. Clinically, the lower two-thirds of the nose becomes enlarged and hypervascular, developing a reddish-purple discoloration and a nodular appearance. It is believed that rhinophyma represents the end stage of acne rosacea. The treatment modalities are medical and surgical. This study describes a 62-year-old man with rhinophyma that was treated with a radiofrequency technique. The pathological examination was compatible with acne rosacea. After surgery, a broad-spectrum sunscreen was applied until reepithelialization was complete. We recommend the radiofrequency technique for treatment of rhinophyma. ","449":"Primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the jaw is a rare lesion, comprising 2-3% of all mucoepidermoid carcinomas reported in literature. Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxilla is rarer, comprising only 8% of the mucoepidermoid carcinomas found in the jaw. A 52-year-old man suffered from central mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the right maxilla with cervical metastasis, and underwent partial maxillectomy and neck dissection in our hospital. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology, dental orthopantomography, CT, and PET\/CT scans. The man was followed-up regularly and was disease free after 21 months. Primary central mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the jaw is a rare lesion and radical surgical resection is the preferred treatment.

One hundred tinnitus patients were evaluated by the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) at the beginning of the study and after nine months of treatment. All subjects were submitted to counselling and sound enrichment from the simple sound amplification provided by the open ear canal hearing aids. Initial mean THI score was 54.22 (+\/- 20.37) and final mean score was 28.32 (+\/- 16.50), p &lt; 0.0001. No statistically significant correlations were found between THI value reduction and the studied parameters. Open ear canal hearing aids were useful in all tinnitus patients with mild hearing loss. ","452":"Clinical auditing is a systematic process for improving quality of care. The primary goal is to compare current practice with established standards. A common dataset enables the comparison of results, and takes into account the effect of case mix, surgical techniques and follow-up periods on outcome. The Common Otology Database (COD) is a joint effort of an international group of otologists to standardise reporting on middle ear surgery, including myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty, stapes surgery and cholesteatoma removal. It aims to identify audit data using the internet (http:\/\/www.ear-audit.net), provide a storage system for otological data, to create a prospective database allowing statistical analysis with sufficient power and to produce standards for comparative auditing. The COD provides two levels of data entry, anonymising surgeon and patient data. Level 1 is designed for general otorhinolaryngologists and trainees, and only records main outcomes. Level 2 is designed for benchmark otologists and includes detailed information about pathologies, risk factors, aim of surgery, surgical findings, procedures, follow-up periods and complications. Level-2 surgeons are required to submit pre-operative data on all patients scheduled for surgery in order to eliminate bias as a result of selective reporting. The COD began in January 2004 and is continuously including patients. In May 2009, 2,291 cases were entered in the level-2 benchmark database, including 1,218 myringoplasties (53.2%), 576 ossiculoplasties (25.1%), 695 stapes surgeries (30.3%) and 532 cholesteatoma surgeries (23.2%). Currently, 151 surgeons use the database system (levels 1 and 2 combined). Eighteen otologists were invited to contribute to the level 2 database. Eight contributors complied with the validation criteria. Others did not cooperate, citing a lack of resources to support data input, or their health system discouraging follow-up. Some were also reluctant to have their outcome data subjected to external validation. The COD has engaged the otological community to participate in a large-scale audit of current practice. The number of surgical procedures included has attained a level of power that will allow introductory statistical analysis. ","453":"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in the uncommon disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has been previously reported. We analysed the relationships between AS, anti-TNF drug treatment, and SNHL. We determined pure tone thresholds in 28 consecutive patients with AS who were treated with the TNFalpha inhibitors etanercept or infliximab, or with a TNFalpha inhibitor plus methotrexate (MTX). SNHL was diagnosed in 16 patients (57.1%): 7\/7 (100%) of those treated with anti-TNFalpha plus MTX, and 9\/21 (43%) of those treated with anti-TNFalpha alone. We found a significant association between SNHL and treatment modality (p = 0.011) or treatment time in months (p = 0.020). The SNHL rate was significantly higher in patients treated with anti-TNFalpha plus MTX than those treated with anti-TNFalpha alone. The culpability of anti-TNF therapy was supported by the association between SNHL and treatment time, which was longer for anti-TNFalpha plus MTX than for anti-TNFalpha alone. SNHL may be due not only to AS, but also to drug-induced vasculitis of the labyrinthine artery or its cochlear branch. ","454":"The diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis in intensive care patients remains problematic. However, it is essential since maxillary sinusitis causes numerous complications and there is an effective treatment. The aim of this study was to compare A-mode ultrasound with sinus computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis in intubated patients in critical care undergoing mechanical ventilation. Prospective clinical study in 140 maxillary sinuses in the surgical ICU of a university hospital. In each intubated and mechanically ventilated patient undergoing cerebral CT scan for any reason, a bedside A-mode ultrasonography of the maxillary sinuses was performed the same day. The A-mode ultrasound result was compared with the result of the sinus CT scan for the diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of A-mode ultrasound compared with CT were 66.7%, 94.7%, 75.0% and 92.2% respectively. All the empty sinuses were correctly identified as being empty. Given its very good specificity and negative predictive value, bedside A-mode ultrasound may be a useful first-line examination for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care, especially to eliminate suspicion of maxillary sinusitis. ","455":"Both nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy and nose blowing can generate high pressures in the nose and sinuses. Nose blowing generates higher pressures than nCPAP therapy, but the duration of nCPAP therapy is considerably longer than the duration of nose blowing. Therefore, nCPAP could cause bone deformation. The aim of this study was to document the influence of the pressure generated by nCPAP therapy on the structure and dimensions of the sinuses and on the nose-blowing patterns of the patients. The study included nine patients, who had recently been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and had not received any previous treatment for OSAS. Before nCPAP therapy was started, they all underwent computer tomography (CT) in the prone position with sequential coronal slices followed by pressure measurements during nose blowing. After the initial measurements, nCPAP therapy commenced. All of the patients were treated with a fixed-pressure device and nasal mask for 6 mo. nCPAP therapy compliance was checked after 6 mo. At the end of the 6 mo treatment with nCPAP, coronal CT scans of the sinuses and pressure measurements during nose blowing were repeated. Although CPAP therapy provides continuous positive pressure for several hours at night, bone structure and sinus dimensions appeared to be unchanged after 6 mo of therapy. However, CPAP therapy seemed to have an effect on the nose-blowing pattern of the patients, with a significant decrease in nose blowing pressure after 6 mo of CPAP treatment. ","456":"Sphenoid sinus agenesis is a very rare entity. In this study, we evaluated the CT scans of 1193 patients and detected cases with sphenoid sinus agenesis despite the absence of craniofacial anomalies or syndromes. The CT scans of 1193 patients who had undergone endoscopic sinus surgery in our clinic between 1999 and 2008 were retrospectively evaluated. Of the patients, 652 (54.6%) were female and 541 (45.3%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range: 13-75 yrs.). In this study, we identified eight patients (0.67%) with sphenoid agenesis. Three patients (37.5%) had bilateral, 3 patients (37.5%) had left, and 2 patients (25%) had right sphenoid agenesis. None of the patients had craniofacial anomalies or syndromes. Sphenoid sinus agenesis is rarely seen in the absence of craniofacial anomalies or syndromes. In our study, its incidence was 0.67%. Awareness of sphenoid sinus agenesis and\/or hypoplasia is very important, particularly when transphenoidal hypophysectomy is planned. ","457":"Standard methods to examine nasal flow are experimental and do not yield locally detailed results. Using the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM), we computed nasal air flow and investigated the relationship between nasal obstruction and anatomical conditions. Because of its mathematical structure, the LBM can be immediately applied to various nasal cavities that are characterized by an extremely intricate geometry. In the present study, the higher efficiency of the LBM allowed for high resolution and detailed analysis of the flow structures in the nasal cavity. Based on a previously validated simulation of nasal airflow in an artificial model, we acquired the nasal geometry of an individual by computed tomography and applied the LBM to numerically solve Navier-Stokes equations and thereby determine nasal flow. In contrast to frequently used standard finite-volume methods, our method facilitated grid generation and computational parallelisation. The grid modelling of the nasal cavity comprised 4.9 million nodes and the computational time on a high-performance computing cluster was less than 12 hours. The velocity and pressure of the calculated airflow was visualized in every tiny recess of the nasal cavity and areas of interest could be easily identified. Computer-assisted visualization of patients' 3D nasal flow structures may be useful for diagnosis, and for planning surgical interventions. Although numerical analysis is far from real-time, and the generation of geometric models still requires a large amount of manual interaction, our simulation approach will be useful for nasal flow research.

There was at least official collusion between the physician and the magical powers of the sovereign. Both sides were well advised to show consideration for one another (Figure 1).","459":"It is rare for neuroendocrine tumours to originate in the sphenoid sinus and the nasopharynx. Neuroendocrine tumours can be classified into typical carcinoids, atypical carcinoids and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Case report and a review of the world literature concerning the clinical presentation, histopathological features, optimal treatment and prognosis of nasopharyngeal extramedullary plasmacytoma. Reports of patients with symptomatic extramedullary plasmacytomas of the nasopharynx eventually being documented with histopathological evidence are not uncommon; however, the converse appears to be an extremely rare event. The patient was completely asymptomatic and following a paroxysm of coughing, expectorated a polypoidal nodule, which on histopathological investigation had features suggestive of extramedullary plasmacytoma. Although these tumours commonly present with significant nasal symptoms, this exceptional presentation in an asymptomatic patient has never been previously reported. Unusual presentations of rare tumours can pose considerable diagnostic dilemmas to both the surgeon and histopathologist. Awareness of these rarities is important to ensure the best patient care.

We present the clinical and radiological features of a 47-year-old-man with Wyburn-Mason syndrome who suffered from recurrent bleeding episodes primarily at the nasal corner of the left orbit. After radiotherapy and several angioembolisations, surgical reduction with exenteration of the left orbit was performed and resulted in reduced bleeding. Two years later the patient presented with maxillary sinus empyema. Due to massive endonasal bleeding, endoscopy could not be performed and the maxillary empyema was treated via a transorbital approach. Although close observation represents the standard of care in Wyburn-Mason syndrome, patient-specific management decisions are required in the presence of symptoms or complications. In the presented case, surgical intervention proved to be successful.

A case of Wegener's granulomatosis that mimicked an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour is reported. The clinical presentation, staging of the disease, histology, and follow-up are analysed. Histopathology of the temporal bone failed to provide an accurate diagnosis, even after immunocytochemical analyses. The diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis was suspected after biopsy of a pulmonary mass and was confirmed by the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in blood samples. Irrespective of the aetiology, a pseudotumour of the temporal bone should always be investigated by biology and radiology. Radiological investigations will allow staging of the disease and specific localisation for biopsies. ","463":"Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a reactive myofibroblastic proliferation that may be misdiagnosed as a sarcoma because of its rapid growth, rich cellularity, and mitotic activity. NF is uncommon in the auricular region. We describe a case of nodular fasciitis of the external auditory canal in an 8-year-old male. An excisional biopsy was performed, and the pathologic examination was consistent with nodular fasciitis; however, the lesion recurred within a month requiring that a total excision be done. The patient is without recurrence 7 months after the total excision. Because its histologic features closely mimick a malignant lesion, NF must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mass originating from the external auditory canal to avoid overly aggressive and functionally debilitating treatment.

Case report. We report the clinical presentation, imaging studies and surgical procedures used in the study. The angiographic study showed that the blood supply of the mass originated from the posterior auricular artery. Via a retroauricular approach, this artery was isolated and ligated in order to control the intra-operative bleeding. A canal wall up mastoidectomy with posterior tympanotomy and a tympano-canaloplasty were performed, permitting a complete excision. At 36 months of follow-up, no clinical and radiological signs of recurrence were detected. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice, with rare recurrence of the hemangiomas. Pre-operative evaluation is based on computed tomography (CT scan), but should be followed by magnetic resonance angiography (MR-angio) or intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), especially in case of wider lesions. ","465":"We aimed to verify the extent of a previously cited relationship between tympanosclerosis and atherosclerosis by investigating subjects with dysfunction in lipid metabolism but no clinically apparent symptoms of atherosclerotic disease. Forty hypercholesterolemic patients were submitted to Doppler ultrasound examination of carotid and vertebrobasilar arterial regions; results were matched to otoscopic findings. Otoscopy was performed to evaluate for sclerotic plaques of the tympanic membrane, which represent the most common, clinically non-relevant manifestation of tympanosclerosis. A control group of 41 randomly chosen healthy subjects were also included. Nine (22.5%) of 40 subjects with hypercholesterolemia showed tympanic sclerotic plaques at otoscopy compared to 2 (4.9%) out of 41 control patients. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02). An even stronger association (p = 0.01) was found between tympanic and arterial plaques in the study group, as we identified tympanic sclerotic plaques in 7 (41.2%) out of 17 patients with positive Doppler ultrasound signals for arterial plaques. Only two (8.7%) out of 23 subjects without plaques on Doppler ultrasound examination had tympanic sclerotic plaques. The results of this study confirm the existence of a link between tympanosclerosis and atherosclerosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a link between these findings in preclinical atherosclerotic conditions. ","466":"Facial nerve palsy is a distressing complication of parotid surgery. We determined to analyse parotid surgery outcomes in a district general hospital in order to identify our own risk factors leading to increased incidence of facial nerve palsy. Primarily, we aimed to determine the efficacy of peripheral versus proximal facial nerve identification in preventing facial nerve damage. This was a retrospective study of hospital records. The records of sixty-four patients aged between 32 and 84 years who had attended our Otolaryngology department over a six-year period were analysed, with notes made of operative procedure, identification of the facial nerve and post-operative facial nerve palsy. The Neurosign400 facial nerve monitor was used and the degree of facial nerve paralysis was assessed using the House Brackmann (HB) classification of facial nerve paralysis. Sixty-four patients underwent parotidectomy. Thirty-two patients had the peripheral branch of the facial nerve identified while another thirty-two patients had proximal nerve identification. Six patients had HB 2 facial nerve palsy, but all completely recovered within six months. Four out of the six patients had peripheral identification of the facial nerve. Although peripheral versus proximal identification of the facial nerve was associated with greater incidence of temporary facial nerve paralysis, all the patients recovered within six months. This study may indicate that exposing a peripheral branch of the facial nerve with the help of Neurosign400 is a useful way of performing parotidectomy where proximal identification of a nerve is not possible. ","467":"Endoscopic sinus surgery has become popular for the management of sinonasal inverted papillomas (IP). The purpose of this report is to review our 13 years of experience in managing IPs. Retrospective chart study. Sixty-seven patients with sinonasal IPs were treated in our department from 1991 to 2004. Seventeen were managed using an endonasal non-endoscopic approach, 39 endoscopically, 8 through external techniques, and the remaining 3 using a combined approach. After 1994, as we gained experience using endoscopic sinus surgery, most cases were treated endoscopically. In only 3 cases, where the tumour attachment site was in the lateral \/ anterior wall of the maxillary sinus and in the lateral wall of the frontal sinus, could the lesions not be accessed by extended endoscopic techniques, and an appropriate combination with external methods was required. The mean follow up period was 91 (range, 36-146) months. The recurrence rate was 59% using an endonasal non-endoscopic approach, 12.5% using an external incision, and 12.8% using endoscopic techniques. Average time to recurrence was 15 months. Our findings suggest that endoscopic sinus surgery for sinonasal IP is a viable approach, with a low rate of recurrence and minor morbidity. Complete tumour resection at the site of attachment, including a surrounding rim of normal mucosa and drilling the underlying bone, is the key to successful treatment when it is combined with the preservation of healthy tissue. Non-endoscopic endonasal surgery is no longer a treatment option because the recurrence rate is too high.

Twenty-four patients diagnosed with nasal polyposis in Haseki Education and Research Hospital ENT Department between March and June 2008 were included in the study. The AOPP serum levels in NP patients and 24 healthy controls were measured with spectrophotometry and the results were compared statistically. AOPP levels were significantly higher in the study group compared with the control group. Our findings suggest that AOPP levels can be used as a marker of oxidative stress in patients with nasal polyposis. Future studies are neccessary to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidant therapy.

Sleep endoscopy is a dynamic evaluation of the UA that can be used to determine the site(s) of collapse during respiratory events. This study evaluates the feasibility and outcome of sleep endoscopy in patients with OSA, compares the findings with the literature, and reviews the therapeutic advice given to patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the data for 70 OSA patients in whom UA surgery was considered. Sleep endoscopy was performed after IV administration of midazolam and propofol. The UA was visualised and assessed for the location of UA flutter, narrowing or collapse. Feasibility and safety were evaluated retrospectively. Outcome data were described as type and pattern of flutter and\/or collapse. Treatment advice given to the patients was reviewed. Sleep endoscopy showed monolevel palatal collapse in 31.9%, monolevel tongue\/hypopharyngeal collapse in 27.8% and multilevel collapse in 31.9% of patients. In 5.6% of patients, no collapse was found. In all patients except 2, reliable assessment proved possible of the site(s) of obstruction. No side effects were reported. Sleep endoscopy is feasible and safe in daily practice when sedation is performed by an anaesthesiologist and can be used to locate the site of collapse in the UA. Sleep endoscopy findings in our study sample, as well as in the literature, differ according to the content of the study sample and the method of sedation. Treatment advice may differ from sleep endoscopy findings since other factors such as age and patient preferences need to be considered.

In this study, our goal was to determine the incidence of unexpected pathological findings in routine tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy specimens. The results are discussed in the light of current literature. The patient data were obtained from the archives of the departments of otorhinolaryngology and pathology. Between November 1992 and July 2006, chronic, recurrent infections or obstructive problems led to bilateral tonsillectomies, adenoidectomies, and adenoidectomies plus tonsillectomies being performed in 435, 502, and 770 patients respectively. Five hundred and fifty-nine of 1272 adenoidectomy specimens and 1132 of 2410 tonsillectomy specimens were sent to the department of pathology for histopathological examination. The histopathological results for all the adenoidectomy specimens reported chronic inflammatory processes. Only one of 1132 tonsillectomy specimens involved granulomatous inflammation, while 1131 were chronic inflammatory processes. On the basis of the result of our study and review of the published literature, the microscopic analysis of routine tonsillectomy and\/or adenoidectomy specimens may not be necessary, especially in young patients with no clinically suspicious factors for malignancy.

Despite the lack of generally accepted clinical guidelines about indications, the beneficial role of the procedure has been established. The aim of this study was to identify current practice relating to indications for tonsillectomies and adenotonsillectomies among Belgian ENT specialists. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to all Belgian ENT specialists. Part I of the questionnaire included questions about the ENT specialist himself\/herself and his\/her practice. Part II comprised questions about indications for TE\/ATE in children up to 16 years of age. Part III included questions about indications in adults. 238 out of 528 questionnaires were completed and returned. The majority of physicians consider TE\/ATE to be indicated if a child or an adult suffers 3 or 4 tonsillitis episodes per year. The decision to operate on children for upper airway obstruction is mainly based on clinical and anamnestic findings. A peritonsillar abscess is usually considered to be an indication for surgery. We compared the results between different groups of ENT specialists and could detect differences in decision-making only according to the number of years of ENT practice. The stringency of surgeons' indications decreases with increasing surgeon age. The majority of respondents consider tonsillectomies\/adenotonsillectomies to be indicated after 3 to 4 episodes of tonsillitis per year. In the case of upper airway obstruction in children, surgical indications are mainly based on clinical and anamnestic findings.

Ossicular chain was always preserved, so that conservative surgery (canal wall-up technique) was performed, permitting the achievement of good hearing results, bilaterally. Temporal bone involvement of Langerhans cell histiocytosis may lead to a progressive chronic disease. However, the ossicular chain can remain uninvolved, making a conservative surgical treatment possible. Careful follow-up is essential for detecting new lesions and serial CT scans are mandatory. ","475":"We treated a 41-year-old man who presented with dysphagia, fever and respiratory distress. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) extending to the C5-6 level, C5-6 spondylodiscitis and a spinal epidural abscess. The RPA was drained surgically under emergency conditions. Because the tuberculin skin test was positive, the patient underwent a triple anti-tuberculous drugs regimen. After six months of drug therapy, the epidural abscess was completely resolved. One of the most important aetiologies of RPA is thought to be tuberculous spondylodiscitis, and cervical vertebrae should be scanned thoroughly with pre-operative MRI.","476":"Polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the minor salivary glands occurring in the fifth and sixth decade with a 2:1 female predominance. The nasal cavity is involved in less than 1% of cases. The incidence of clinically recognisable pituitary adenoma is 15 cases\/million\/year. The prevalence of non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) is estimated to be 70-90 cases\/million. Both types of adenoma represent 20-45% of pituitary tumours. The report describes the first case of PLGA associated with NFPA, both incidentally diagnosed. Three months after the exeresis of the NFPA using a trans-sphenoidal approach, an endoscopic resection of the PLGA was performed. No recurrence was observed during a 13 months follow-up. Complete surgical excision is the preferred management for PLGA. Radiotherapy has not been demonstrated to be effective in treating PLGA. The prognosis is good with a very low rate of metastasis and local recurrence. ","477":"Septoplasty is a procedure performed to correct deformities of the nasal septum. Serious complications associated with septoplasty include orbital complications. Here, we present a 26-year-old male patient who developed unilateral mydriasis while undergoing septoplasty under local anaesthesia. The mydriasis resolved spontaneously in an hour without any sequel. In the present study, we emphasise the orbital complications that can be observed during septoplasty.","478":"Pleomorphic adenoma of the nasal septum presents a clinical diagnostic challenge. We report a rare case of pleomorphic adenoma of the nasal septum in a 39-year-old woman with a 1-month history of nasal obstruction. Wide surgical excision is the recommended treatment for this tumour.","479":"A rare case of lymphoepithelial cyst formed in the nasogenian sulcus is reported. Lymphoepithelial cysts are comprised of a stratified squamous epithelial lining above dense lymphoid tissue. They are uncommon in the oral region and, to our knowledge, have never been reported in the nasogenian sulcus. Surgical excision was performed and no recurrence was noted after 6 months. In this report, we describe the etiopathogenesis of lymphoepithelial cysts, as well as the differential diagnosis of nasogenian sulcus swellings.","480":"To review a case series of patients treated for intranasal pleomorphic adenoma by endoscopic surgery. From January 1995 to August 2008, nine patients with intranasal pleomorphic adenoma underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery for tumour removal at our tertiary referral center. Eight of the nine patients were available for follow-up and enrolled in the study. We collected histories and physical examination data for all patients. Pre-operative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in some patients. The post-operative course was smooth in all nine patients. No sign of recurrence was found in the eight patients who received regular follow-up, which averaged 7.01 years (range: 2 to 13 years). With the evolution of endoscopic surgery, even a large posteriorly located lesion can be approached without open surgery. Endoscopic surgery is a reliable choice, even for the treatment of large or multiple lesions. ","481":"How to optimally treat maxillary sinus carcinoma is subject to debate. This study assessed how clinical features and treatment modalities corresponded with long-term survival. Sixty-five patients at our institution were diagnosed with maxillary sinus carcinoma from 1982 to 2003. The median follow-up time was 92.9 months. We evaluated the prognostic value of age, gender, symptoms at presentation, histological classification, tumour stage, and treatment modality with regard to overall survival. The five-year survival rate was 52%. Age (p = 0.03), TNM stage (p = 0.04), T classification (p = 0.04), nodal involvement (p = 0.03), and surgery (p = 0.04) were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. There was a significant difference in the overall survival rate and months of survival between patients who underwent surgery and those who had nonsurgical treatment (p = 0.04). In patients with T3 disease, patients who received en bloc surgery had a higher overall survival than patients who received piecemeal surgery (p = 0.045). Multivariate analysis revealed that T classification was the most powerful prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.026), followed by nodal involvement (p = 0.036). Surgery was a marginally significant prognostic factor (p = 0.066). Although multivariate analysis showed that T classification and nodal involvement corresponded more with survival than did surgery, we conclude that adequate surgical removal should be an integral component of multimodal treatment. ","482":"To identify the pathogens associated with complicated ear, throat and sinus infections and to link the relevant susceptibility patterns to the empirical therapy currently advised in the Dutch guidelines. Retrospective, descriptive study of consecutive cases. Tertiary referral centre. All consecutive patients with a complicated ear, nose and throat infection who underwent surgery at a tertiary referral centre during a six-year period. The term 'complicated' was used to define infections that had spread outside the primary region of infection (middle ear cavity, pharyngeal mucosa, or paranasal sinus) and which therefore, under our policy, required surgical intervention. Microbiological culture and susceptibility pattern A total of 96 patients were included in this study. The predominant causative organisms for the infections were Streptococcus pneumonia, beta hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus milleri for ear, throat, and sinus infections, respectively. These were all susceptible to the recommended empirical therapy. Cultures from 6 patients yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to frequently used antibiotics. The mortality rate in our series was 13% for ear infections. This was caused by complicated infections in young children and patients with cholesteatoma. Ten per cent of the ear infections in adults yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 25% yielded anaerobes. Ear infections in young children and in patients with cholesteatoma should be treated aggressively. Our results suggest that patients with intracranial complications stemming from ear infections should preferably be treated with a combination therapy including antibiotics targeting gram negatives and anaerobes. The role of coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially in neck abscesses, may be more important than has been thought until now. ","483":"The Ligasure Vessel Sealing System (LVSS) is a bipolar electrosurgical device with integrated active feedback control, sealing vessels up to 7 mm in diameter. It facilitates surgery by achieving the efficient haemostasis of blood vessels encountered during dissection, and allowing the rapid and secure division of vascularised tissues, while minimising thermal injury to adjacent tissues. To report on our experience and review studies relating to the use of LVSS in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Retrospective series. Search strategy and evaluation method: LVSS has been widely used in our department since 2002. All patient records relating to the use of LVSS were reviewed, and compared to surgical procedures done by our team without the use of LVSS, with special regard to operation time and post-operative complications. Furthermore, a Medline search and thorough review was conducted for all pertinent articles on LVSS in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and those articles were reviewed. In our department, LVSS is used for thyroidectomy, laryngectomy, neck dissection, parotidectomy, tonsillectomy procedures, congenital cysts, thryroglossal cysts, and excisions of submandibular gland and parapharyngeal space tumours. LVSS provided sufficient haemostasis, operating time was shorter, and post-operative complications did not differ compared to similar surgical procedures performed without the LVSS. The Medline search revealed 16 studies published by other colleagues regarding the use of LVSS in Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery procedures (15 studies in thyroid and 1 study in parotid surgery). The results published were similar to ours. The use of LVSS in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery may have several advantages over standard methods. It is a reliable and safe device, providing sufficient haemostasis and reducing operating time. ","484":"To study current indications for adenoidectomy in Dutch children. During 6 months, ENT surgeons in 1 academic and 7 general hospitals in the Netherlands filled out a questionnaire concerning all children below 15 years of age that were selected for adenoidectomy either as a single procedure or combined with myringotomy or tympanostomy tube placement. This questionnaire collected data on patient characteristics, ENT history, and indication(s) for the procedure. Questionnaires were returned on 159 children. The study population was comparable to the general population of children undergoing adenoidectomy in the Dutch Health Care Services database concerning age and sex. Adenoidectomy alone was performed in 38%, adenoidectomy and myringotomy in 15%, and adenoidectomy and tympanostomy tube placement in 47%. In children selected for adenoidectomy alone, indications were recurrent upper respiratory tract infections or chronic rhinosinusitis in 60%, persistent otitis media with effusion or recurrent acute otitis media in 33%, and obstructive symptoms in 42%. In children selected for adenoidectomy and myringotomy and those selected for adenoidectomy and tympanostomy tube placement, indications were persistent otitis media with effusion or recurrent acute otitis media in 96% and 99%, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections or chronic rhinosinusitis in 88% and 59%, and obstructive symptoms in 33% and 24%, respectively. In Dutch ENT practices, almost two-thirds of adenoidectomies are combined with myringotomy or tympanostomy tube placement. The most common indication for adenoidectomy combined with myringotomy or tympanostomy tubes is middle ear disease. For adenoidectomy alone, recurrent upper respiratory tract infection is the most common indication. ","485":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new manoeuvre in the treatment of posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (p-BPPV) based on the idea that highly accelerated endolymphatic flow may lead a mass of otoconia to collide with the walls of the posterior semicircular canal, resulting in its disintegration and\/or in the expulsion of the free particles from the posterior semicircular canal. Our study group included 146 patients with a diagnosis of p-BPPV. All patients underwent the new manoeuvre, which consisted of several high-acceleration successive head movements in the horizontal plane performed by the same physician. The results of the study group were compared with those of a sham control group of 30 patients with p-BPPV undergoing placebo treatment. The patients of both groups were reviewed in a follow-up appointment 1 month and 1 year after the initial treatment. Complete resolution of symptoms immediately after the manoeuvre was observed in 92% of patients. At 1-month and 1-year follow-up assessment, all the patients in the study group reported complete relief from their symptoms compared with only 13% and 43% of control patients respectively. Recurrence of symptoms was reported in 12 patients (8%) from the study group, who responded successfully to one additional session. This study establishes the efficacy of the new manoeuvre in the short- and long-term management of p-BPPV. It is a quick office procedure, usually resolving this disorder with a single session, although there some limitations in patients with underlying cervical spine pathology. ","486":"To compare post aural soft tissues tolerance of the old and new titanium RetroX (Auric GmbH, Rheine, Germany) tube, and to compare the hearing improvements between the old (DSP-pro) and the new (Concertino) hearing aid units of the RetroX. Retrospective case review of 46 patients with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, fitted with DSP-pro or Concertino, and who received 51 implantations (with the old or new generation titanium tube) in a tertiary referral center at a university hospital. The RetroX consists of an electronic unit situated in the postaural sulcus connected to a titanium tube implanted under the auricle between the sulcus and the external auditory meatus. Implanting requires minor surgery (10 minutes under local anaesthesia). Three months after their implantation, patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate acoustic feedback annoyance and to undergo 3 audiometric tests: pure-tone audiometry in silence, speech audiometry in silence, and speech audiometry in noise. The new tube is more reliable (12 explantations from patients who received 26 older tubes compared with 1 explantation in 25 who received new tubes) even if the size must be adjusted more often (2\/26 for the old model and 5\/25 for the new one). Concertino allows a higher amplification before feedback appears, which improves hearing gain. The new RetroX is better tolerated than the older one, and improves hearing ability. ","487":"Following in the footsteps of Vesalius around Brussels. Every physician is indebted to Vesalius! Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) lived in Brussels for about thirty years in all. First from birth until the age of sixteen years (1514-1530), and later as an adult (1544-1559). These two periods of time in Brussels can be described by walking around some areas of the city.","488":"Nasal septal abscesses are usually formed following nasal trauma or haematoma. A nasal septal abscess is defined as a collection of purulent material (pus) between the cartilage or bony septum and the mucoperichondrium or mucoperiosteum. Sinusitis and periorbital cellulites have been reported among the etiological factors and the complications. A case of posttraumatic nasal septal abscess is reported in a 35-year-old male patient. Frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinusitis, as well as periorbital cellulites were seen to accompany the septal abscess. The abscess was surgically drained and intravenous antibiotherapy was instituted. Nasal trauma patients should be carefully assessed for posttraumatic haematoma and abscess formation, so that possible complications can be avoided by taking appropriate therapeutic measures. ","489":"Myofibroma of the external auditory canal: report of an adult case. Myofibroma is a benign fibrous proliferative disease generally reported to occur in neonates and children. Similar lesions have been reported in adults, but solitary tumours affecting the external auditory canal are extremely rare. Only one such case has been reported in the literature. The case of solitary myofibroma occurring in the external auditory canal of a 42-year-old woman is presented. The diagnosis of myofibromatosis was made on the basis of its histological appearance and corroborated by immunohistochemical staining. Clinicians and pathologists must be aware that myofibromatosis may occur in adults at extremely rare locations. Myofibroma should be included in the differential diagnosis of fibrous lesions in the external auditory canal. ","490":"An unusual tumour of the cerebellopontine angle. To report an extremely rare case of lipoma of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). A 33-year-old woman presented with vertigo and tinnitus in the left ear. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Audiometric evaluation was normal in both ears. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without fat signal suppression revealed a hyperintense lesion of the left CPA. Based on the neuroimaging findings, the diagnosis was left CPA lipoma. The patient was managed conservatively. After 48 months, follow-up MRI revealed no further growth of the lesion and the patient was symptom free. Lipomas of the CPA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vertigo and tinnitus. Accurate diagnosis by MRI is critical. ","491":"Unusual presentation of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumour which affects mainly the major and accessory salivary glands. It is an aggressive neoplasm characterized by early neural invasion and a high incidence of local recurrence and distant metastases, which may develop years after the initial resection. Surgery followed by radiotherapy seems to be the best treatment. Based on a well-illustrated case of extensive maxillary ACC involving the palate, orbit floor, and pterygo-palatine fossa, we discuss the prognosis and the importance of an early diagnosis of ACC.","492":"Head and neck reconstruction with dorsoradial forearm free flap: a preliminary clinical study. The most common criticism of the radial forearm free flap (RFFF) is donor site morbidity. Delayed or defected integration of split thickness skin graft (STSG) is the most commonly encountered complication. Defective healing or excessively thin skin coverage of important forearm structures, such as the median nerve and ulnar artery-nerve bundle, places these structures at increased risk of injury. The current study aims to modify the RFFF to utilize a dorsoradial skin island in order to protect the volar tissue aspect of these structures. Seven patients were included in the study between 2005 and 2008. All patients had oncologic resections in the oral cavity necessitating free tissue transfer. The main variation from the standard RFFF technique is that the medial incision was placed 1 cm lateral to the palmaris longus tendon. The dissection was extended laterally and dorsally, depending on the necessary flap size. The donor side defect was covered with a thigh STSG. None of the patients had partial or complete flap necrosis. This surgical modification provided tissue coverage along the course of the median nerve and ulnar neurovascular bundle. Dorsoradial forearm free flap is a feasible technique that allows preservation of tissue coverage on the volar surface of the forearm. ","493":"A preliminary report. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of reducing CPAP pressure levels and improving patient adherence to CPAP therapy by stiffening the soft palate tissue with a Pillar palatal implant. Many patients have difficulty complying with CPAP therapy if high levels of airway pressure are necessary for their therapy to be successful. Twenty-one patients (16 males and 5 females) with moderate to severe OSAHS treated with CPAP therapy underwent Pillar palatal treatment in an office-based procedure. The mean age was 49.6 +\/- 11.2 years, mean baseline body mass index (BMI) was 31.4 +\/- 3.2 Kg\/m2. At 3 months follow-up a significant reduction of CPAP pressure levels was found. Mean CPAP pressure levels before and after Pillar application were 11.2 +\/- 1.69 cm H2O vs. 9.3 +\/- 2.5 cm H2O respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The Pillar system is intended for use in stiffening the soft palate tissue, so this minimally invasive procedure, which was introduced to clinical practice as a treatment for the palatal component of OSAHS, could make it possible to reduce CPAP pressures and improve patient adherence to CPAP therapy. The preliminary results of this combined therapeutic approach indicate the safety and efficacy of the treatment of OSAHS. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term results.","494":"To establish the efficacy of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy for treating selected patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Retrospective study of patients who underwent clinical\/instrumental evaluation and surgical treatment. University ENT division with a tertiary snoring referral center. Twenty-two patients with normal body mass index affected by severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Pre- and post-operative cardiopulmonary monitoring during sleep, daytime sleepiness evaluation, post-treatment complication recording. Complete response to therapy was obtained in 78% of patients. Four patients had relief of symptoms but retained apnea\/hypopnea index scores greater than 5. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty associated with tonsillectomy can beemployed safely to treat patients with normal body mass index who suffer from severe obstructive sleep apnea. ","495":"To establish the origin of tinnitus in patients with otosclerosis. We performed a literature review to identify the characteristics of tinnitus in the general population and among patients with otosclerosis. Characteristics of tinnitus among patients with otosclerosis differ from those among the general population, suggesting mechanisms other than those implicated in presbycusis. Considerable improvements in the prevalence of tinnitus following corrective surgery demonstrate the limited contribution of diffuse labyrinth lesions. Middle ear and possibly secondary inner ear dysfunction produced by stapes blockage appear to be major etiopathogenic factors in the development of tinnitus in patients with otosclerosis. The conductive hearing deprivation produced by otosclerosis is associated with limited and reversible modifications in the central auditory pathway that are linked to tinnitus. ","496":"To report on the value and limitations of new MRI techniques in pre- and post-operative MRI of cholesteatoma. The current value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing congenital, acquired, and post-operative recurrent or residual cholesteatoma is described. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is still considered the imaging modality of choice for detecting acquired or congenital middle ear cholesteatoma. However, MRI may provide additional information on the delineation and extension of cholesteatoma and on potential complications. Detecting post-operative residual or recurrent cholesteatoma with HRCT was shown to be inaccurate due to the technique's low sensitivity and specificity. Recently, improvements in MRI techniques have led to a more accurate diagnoses of cholesteatoma using delayed contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. ","497":"To evaluate which clinical characteristics of inverted papilloma (IP) can result easily in misdiagnosis by clinicians and to determine the recurrence rate of inverted papilloma depending on diagnosis confirmation pre-operatively, intra-operatively or post-operatively. Fifty-one patients were treated for IP and 47 patients attended regular post-operative follow-up appointments for at least one year (mean: 54 months). The patients were assigned to 3 groups: group Ia, in which IP was not confirmed until the post-operative pathology findings; group Ib, in which IP was confirmed during the operation; and group II, in which IP was confirmed before the operation. There were nineteen (37%) patients in group Ia, nine patients (18%) in group Ib and twenty-three patients (45%) in group II. The recurrence rates for groups Ia, Ib and II were 33%, 11% and 5% respectively. The initial presentation of bilateral sinonasal disease can easily lead the doctor into the misdiagnosis of IP. Bony erosion, remodelling, and a widening of the natural orifice of the sinuses on a CT scan are useful signs indicating IP. The correct diagnosis prior to surgery is a determinant of outcome. The use of frozen sections should, however, improve outcome as well. In this study we highlight the high prevalence and relatively low control rate of misdiagnosed IP (pathology undetermined pre-operatively) and hope to remind clinicians that early recognition of the tumour is most beneficial to patients. ","498":"Isolated lesions of the sphenoid sinus are rare, and diagnosis is difficult because of the non-specific symptoms and clinical signs. The pathology of these lesions can be divided into three groups: inflammatory lesions, tumoural lesions, and a small group of so-called miscellaneous lesions. In a retrospective study, we evaluated the diagnosis and underlying pathology of 49 consecutive isolated sphenoid lesions all subjected to diagnostic and\/or therapeutic endoscopic sinus surgery. The diagnosis of isolated sphenoid lesions based on clinical history and clinical examination, including nasal endoscopy, was not reliable because of the non-specific symptoms and clinical signs. A definitive diagnosis could be made only by radiological imaging and\/or surgical exploration. The largest group of patients suffered from inflammatory lesions (29 patients), followed by tumoural lesions in 17 patients. Two patients had a sphenoidal cerebrospinal fluid leak, and one patient had a cholesterol granuloma. The outcome for patients who underwent a therapeutic endoscopic surgical procedure was favorable in 22% and perfect in 67%. There were no complications during or after endoscopic surgery.","499":"The aim of septo-rhinoplasty and the outcome were evaluated by the patient and the surgeon. The assessment focused on six well-defined characteristics of the nose: profile, width of the osteocartilaginous dorsum, symmetry, nasal tip, nostrils and nasal patency. Patient and surgeon assessments were compared. Both patient and surgeon opinions were obtained using a self-designed questionnaire covering the aim of the surgery, the most important positive and negative post-operative results, a general rating of the postoperative result and a rating of the pre-operative information given by the surgeon. We compared patient and surgeon views about the late (between 6 and 18 months) post-operative result of septorhinoplasty using Kappa statistics. Sixty-nine patients were studied; 44 responded. The match between patient and surgeon views was closest in respect of the pre-operative aims and negative post-operative results. Patient and surgeon opinions differed most in terms of why a result was positive: nasal width was a more important issue for patients, and nasal symmetry was more important to the surgeon. Nasal patency and profile were equally important to both. The general rating on a visual analogue scale was a mean of 7.05 out of 10. The quality of the pre-operative information was found to be good by most patients. Using a self-designed questionnaire for septorhinoplasty, we mainly found significant differences between patient and surgeon opinions in the post-operative evaluation of why results of the surgery are positively appreciated. ","500":"Large sections of the medical community have, in the past, thought of human olfaction as a minor sense that was destined to disappear soon. This view has changed completely in the last two decades. This article will attempt to highlight the most important recent advances in our understanding of the human olfactory function and focus in particular on questions for the future and developments required in this field.","501":"Olfactory and gustatory disorders increase with advancing age. Moreover, olfactory disorders are common in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since the decrease in olfactory function is usually gradual, it often remains undetected. Given the poor self-assessment of olfactory function, olfactory testing is mandatory in suspected cases to establish the diagnosis of hyposmia or anosmia. The high rate of anosmia over the age of 70 is suspected to be due to several factors such as changes in the olfactory epithelium (reduced mucus secretion, hormonal changes, changes in epithelial thickness, for example), and the reduced neuroregeneration rate in olfactory receptor cells themselves. There is no known adequate treatment for stopping or reversing this age-related decline in olfaction. In IPD, olfactory impairment precedes motor symptoms by years and is independent of dopaminergic loss. Using fMRI, altered neuronal activity in the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation during olfactory stimulation have been demonstrated, as has a link between the expression of olfactory event-related potentials and olfactory-induced brain activity. In AD--by contrast with IPD--the severity of the disease and the olfactory disorder correlate. The olfactory disorders alone, however, cannot distinguish between AD and IPD. A complete loss of gustatory function is rare, while dysgeusia is common, especially with increasing age. There are multiple possible explanations, including concomitant disease and the side-effects of medication. These need to be established on the basis of exact history and examination. Treatment remains difficult.","502":"Taste disorders are rare compared to olfactory problems, and so the workup and understanding of taste disorders is limited. In this article, we try to update knowledge about human taste disorders with a special focus on taste disorders occurring after ENT surgery.","503":"The taste system provides basic information essential to life since it identifies safe or harmful food. It is a complex sensory system with multiple different processes, starting mainly in the oral cavity where the tongue has a predominant role. The organisation of taste receptor cells, taste buds and taste papillae is presented in this review along with information regarding the five taste sensations: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. Taste signalling and the mechanisms of processing at the peripheral level will also be discussed. Retronasal olfaction plays a major role in what people consider to be flavour and therefore its mechanisms and interactions are discussed as a part of the peripheral taste system. Taste disturbances often lead to malnutrition, which is a potential life-threatening condition. Improving our understanding of the taste peripheral system will help in the management of patients with taste dysfunction and reduced dietary intake.","504":"Gustatory testing for clinicians. By contrast with the evaluation of olfactory function, which has been standardised for almost two decades, the clinical assessment of gustatory function with psychophysical and objective testing is still in its infancy. This overview will attempt to summarise the knowledge that is important for clinicians in the awareness that progress in the field is ongoing. We focus on psychophysical testing but also discuss some recent achievements in the area of objective taste testing. There are now validated tests available for simple quick scans of gustatory function but debate continues about the extent to which such tests can be used for medico-legal purposes. In addition to emerging measures such as gustatory event-related potentials and functional imaging, routine objective gustatory testing will be needed in the future.","505":"Post-traumatic olfactory loss (PTOL) is the third most common aetiology for olfactory disorders. Mechanisms that lead to post-traumatic olfactory disorders include sinonasal affections, damage to the olfactory nerve and lesions of the cerebral olfactory centres. The purpose of this review is to present an update of this condition and to present a cohort study of 90 patients. A review of the literature was made on Medline Pubmed up to May 2009 and a review was also conducted of patients with post-traumatic olfactory loss. The degree of olfactory impairment was related to the severity of head trauma and was particularly frequent in cases of occipital impact. Typically, patients experienced a sudden onset of olfactory symptoms and were more severely affected than in other aetiologies. Results from orthonasal and retronasal testing, chemosensory event-related potentials and olfactory bulb (OB) volume confirmed previous findings: patients are usually anosmic, OB volume correlates with the degree of olfactory loss (better correlation with retronasal scores than with orthonasal scores) and olfactory event-related potentials were recorded in only 18 patients. Accuracy in the evaluation of PTOL patients is based on the expertise and the time spent by the clinician on defining the complaint. Failing treatment, complete evaluation of the PTOL patients may help in counselling for the recovery prognosis, and appropriate counselling must be given to secure the environment and alimentation. ","506":"Post-infectious olfactory loss is defined as an olfactory dysfunction in the course of an upper respiratory tract infection. Quantitative olfactory dysfunction is usually moderate to severe, with many patients experiencing a qualitative disorder such as parosmia. Diagnosis is made on the basis of patient history, normal clinical examination (no inflammatory disease in the olfactory cleft) and decreased olfactory function. This paper provides an update of pathophysiology, clinical management and prognosis, and also looks at the clinical characteristic of a cohort of 122 patients from our department. Results from orthonasal and retronasal testing, chemosensory event-related potentials and olfactory bulb volume confirmed previous findings: our post-infectious olfactory patients were middle-aged women (sex ratio 2.4; mean age 53.9), with 47.5% and 18% of them complaining of parosmia and phantosmia respectively. More of them were hyposmic than anosmic (64.7% and 35.3% respectively) and 18 suffered repeat episodes. Olfactory bulb volume was correlated to psychophysical olfactory testing and orthonasal to retronasal scores. Olfactory-event-related potentials were found in about one-third of the patients and the vast majority of them had reproducible intranasal trigeminal event-related potentials. As there is no proven medical therapy for this disease, complete clinical evaluation of the patients may help to counsel patients about the recovery prognosis that applies to one-third of them.","507":"This report provides an overview of the relationship between olfaction and surgery. Surgery can be considered as treatment for some olfactory dysfunctions. Moreover, olfactory dysfunction can be analysed as a complication of some surgical procedures. An impaired sense of smell is a common problem affecting approximately 65% of patients with chronic sinusitis. Much of the literature about the effect of surgery on the olfactory system is based on subjective reports of olfactory function, which do not accurately assess objective smell dysfunction. A small number of prospective studies have been published. All studies looking at the sense of smell have found overall post-operative improvement compared with pre-operative symptoms. The range of improvement compared with pre-operative scores ranged from 13 to 91%, with a median of 31%. Olfaction dysfunction can be a complication of various surgical procedures such as laryngectomy, septoplasty, rhinoplasty, ethmoidectomy, and some neurosurgical procedures.","508":"Olfactory dysfunction is deemed to be a significant contributor to poor quality of life in different nasal inflammatory conditions like common cold, allergic rhinitis, and acute and chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps (NP). The mechanism underlying olfactory impairment in inflammatory sinonasal disease relates to either the obstruction of the olfactory cleft due to congestion of the nasal mucosa, the presence of secretions or polyps inside the nasal cavity, or to dysfunction of the sensory mucosa of the olfactory bulb resulting from local inflammation. The reduction of smell capacity in nasal inflammatory conditions may have an acute or gradual onset, often with resolution of smell dysfunction after adequate medical treatment or surgery. In contrast to the well documented effects of surgery for rhinosinusitis on smell dysfunction, the available information about the effects of medical treatment is limited. Most studies have looked at corticosteroids, evaluating the restoration of olfactory capacity as a primary or secondary study outcome parameter. Both nasal and systemic corticosteroids have a beneficial effect on olfactory dysfunction, with systemic treatment being the most powerful. This review aims to provide an overview of current knowledge about medical treatment for rhinosinusitis and its effects on smell.","509":"Cerebral imaging and olfactory disorders: a review. Olfactory disorders are often misjudged and rarely given due clinical consideration. Nevertheless, they occur in a wide range of neurological disorders, and their evaluation can help in diagnosis. Whereas psychophysical tests have been used to evaluate olfactory dysfunction in numerous diseases, functional brain imaging using olfactory stimuli is an emergent technique and few studies have been published to date. After a reminder of cerebral imaging and analysis techniques and a rapid description of our actual knowledge of olfactory processes in healthy subjects, the current review focuses on cerebral imaging studies performed on patients with neurological disorders and presenting olfactory dysfunction. Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, migraine, multiple chemical sensitivity and schizophrenia are examined.","510":"In combination with psychophysical testing and electrophysiological studies, magnetic resonance imaging plays a role in the clinical evaluation of patients with an olfactory dysfunction. Quantitative measurements of olfactory bulb volume and of olfactory sulcus depth, and the morphological depiction of structural abnormalities, make synergistic contributions to the accurate radiological diagnosis of smell dysfunction. Moreover, the plasticity of our olfactory system can be demonstrated by temporal changes in OB volumetric measurements. In this paper, we provide an outline of how to measure olfactory bulb volume and olfactory sulcus depth, with numerous illustrative cases of patients with congenital anosmia, post-infectious or posttraumatic olfactory loss and sinonasal-related olfactory dysfunction.","511":"Numerous techniques are available in the clinic for the investigation of chemosensory function. Psychophysical testing using orthonasal and retronasal stimulation routes may help to distinguish anosmic from hyposmic patients. These psychophysical tests are most frequently used for odour identification and odour threshold. Chemosensory event-related potentials using olfactory and trigeminal stimulation have become part of the routine investigation of patients with olfactory loss in specialised smell and taste centres. The interpretation of results from psychophysical testing is frequently supported by the assessment of chemosensory event-related potentials. This review will discuss these methods, including how to perform them, focusing on normative data and describing some clinical examples from our centre (olfactory and trigeminal event-related potentials).","512":"The olfactory neuro-epithelium is highly sensitive to chemicals and its direct microbiological environment. It also plays a role as an interface between the airways and the nervous system, and so it has developed several defence instruments for rapid regeneration or for the detoxification of the immediate environment. This review illustrates three of these defence mechanisms: regeneration of the epithelium, local production of metabolising enzymes and xenobiotic transporters. Toxicants can inflict damage by a direct toxic response. Alternatively, they may require metabolic activation to produce the proximate toxicant. In addition to detoxifying inhaled and systemically derived xenobiotics, the local olfactory metabolism may fulfil multiple functions such as the modification of inhaled odorant, the modulation of endogenous signalling molecules and the protection of other tissues such as the CNS and lungs from inhaled toxicants. Finally, the permeability of nasal and olfactory mucosa is an important efficacy parameter for some anti-allergic drugs delivered by intranasal administration or inhalation. Efflux or update transporters expressed in these tissues may therefore significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs administered topically.","513":"All living organisms can detect and identify chemical substances in their environment. The olfactory epithelium is covered by a mucus layer which is essential for the function of the olfactory neurons that are directly connected to the brain through the cribriform plate. However, little is known about the composition of this mucus in humans and its significance for the diagnosis of olfactory disorders. The olfactory epithelium consists of four primary cell types, including the olfactory receptor cells essential for odour transduction. This review examines the anatomical, histological and physiological fundamentals of olfactory mucosa. Particular attention is paid to the biochemical environment of the olfactory mucosa that regulates both peri-receptor events and several protective functions.","514":"The aim of this article is to summarise the anatomy of the chemosensory pathways. The vomeronasal organ, the olfactory system, the trigeminal system and the gustatory system will be reviewed in succession. For each of these systems, we will provide a description of the anatomy of the pathways sending the sensory message from the peripheral receptor to the cortical areas, passing through different relays in the nervous system. Particular emphasis will be paid to the anatomical features of the structures involved in chemosensory perception. This will help us to understand better how these systems interact and influence our social lives, our memories and our behaviour, and to evaluate patients with chemosensory dysfunction better.","515":"The nose and the plague. Although the plague does not cause any specific nasal pathology, the miasma theory and the repulsive smell of the disease were factors that contributed to a strong emphasis on the nose. To stop the spread of the disease, it was thought necessary to saturate the nose with protective scents (hence the nose of the plague doctors) (Figure 1), or simply to hold one's nose. Moreover, the nose was long considered to be an outlet for mucus from the encephalon, and so induced nose bleeding and sneezing were advised when the plague seemed to be attacking the brain.","516":"Castleman's disease is an uncommon disease of benign lymph node hyperplasia primarily affecting the mediastinum, with the head and neck region being the second most common site. A 27-year-old woman was admitted to our department due to a left lateral cervical mass. After a complete clinical and imaging examination, a neck dissection was performed, in which a mass, size 3.5 x 2.7 x 4.5 cm, was excised. The patient was diagnosed with Castleman's disease of the neck after histopathological examination. The diagnosis of Castleman's disease is always a clinical challenge, as the patient commonly presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms resembling other lymphatic diseases. Consequently, Castleman's disease should be in the differential diagnosis of congenital, inflammatory, or neoplastic cervical alterations. A review of literature, including histopathological characteristics, differential diagnosis, and treatment options is also presented. ","517":"Verruca vulgaris of the larynx (VVL) is an uncommon lesion with clinical and histopathological features that are easily misdiagnosed as verrucous carcinoma, and thus may lead to unnecessary surgery. This case study investigated clinical and pathological features that might distinguish VVL from other keratotic laryngeal lesions. A 35-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and superficial, keratotic, vocal cord lesions. The verrucoid configuration of the surface and lack of nuclear atypia enabled treatment by local excision. The biopsied lesion was sectioned and examined by immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. The patient was disease-free up to 1 year and 6 months after surgery. The exophytic, keratotic lesions of the larynx had features of cutaneous verruca vulgaris. No human papilloma virus was detected. We described histopathological features of VVL that will facilitate its distinction from laryngeal keratosis, squamous papillomas, verrucous hyperplasia, and verrucous carcinoma. ","518":"A dacryocystocele refers to a sterile cystic dilatation of the lacrimal sac resulting from a complete obstruction of the lacrimal pathway above and below the lacrimal sac. In most cases, it is a congenital disorder that typically occurs in neonates. It is characterized by a bluish cystic swelling just below the medial canthus accompanied by epiphora. In some cases, there is also an intranasal expansion beneath the inferior turbinate. When this expansion is large and bilateral, it can lead to respiratory distress in neonates since they are obligate nasal breathers. Although congenital dacryocystoceles may resolve with conservative measures, many become infected and require systemic antibiotic treatment, and most require early surgical intervention. Herein, the authors report a rare case of dacryocystocele in an adult that was successfully managed with an endonasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy. The pre-operative images and the intra-operative findings are shown, and the available literature is reviewed.","519":"Sphenoid fungal balls are rare and typically indolent lesions, unless superinfected by bacteria or invasive to adjacent neurovascular structures. If the identification or treatment of underlying complications is delayed in an immunocompromised patient, a catastrophic outcome may result. We report the case of an elderly female patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus suffering from sphenoid fungal sinusitis that is complicated by cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis and carotid artery stenosis. In spite of reasonable diagnosis and therapy, the patient's general condition deteriorated and she eventually died. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment strategy are discussed.","520":"Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the head and neck is a rare neoplasm characterized by monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells. The nasal cavity and nasal septum are the most common sites of occurrence and the neoplasm can be solitary or multiple. Extramedullary plasmacytoma is associated with the initial appearance of multiple myeloma and may precede overt manifestations of systemic disease by months or years. A seventy-year-old female presented to our clinic with a one-month history of nasal obstruction. We performed a systematic approach to diagnosis using clinical, laboratory, and radiologic investigations in order to exclude systemic involvement. The patient was diagnosed with extramedullary plasmacytoma and the mass was excised completely via transnasal endoscopy. Extramedullary plasmacytoma of the nasal cavity is rare and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nasal cavity masses. ","521":"To determine the current practice of UK ENT consultants in investigating cases of suspected post-infectious olfactory dysfunction. We prepared questionnaires and posted these to every consultant ENT surgeon registered with the British Association of Otolaryngologists Head and Neck Surgeons (BAO-HNS). Questions included preferred radiological investigation, smelling test and follow up. A total of 510 questionnaires were sent, with a response rate of 51%. Most UK consultant ENT surgeons investigated suspected post-infectious olfactory dysfunction by performing either a CT (44%) or an MRI (29%) scan, but only 37% performed formal smell tests. Most consultant ENT surgeons (76%) decide not to follow up post-infectious olfactory dysfunction. This study gives an indication that suspected post-infectious olfactory dysfunction is not investigated thoroughly in the United Kingdom, with only a minority of clinicians performing formal smell tests and a lack of consensus as to radiological investigation. Standardisation of investigations is key to adequately managing suspected post-infectious olfactory dysfunction. ","522":"The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of rhinitis medicamentosa (RM) in patients attending the ENT outpatient clinic of the General Hospital of Rethymnon (Crete, Greece) before and after the launch of an intensive nasal decongestant advertising campaign in Greece. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with RM seen at the ENT outpatient clinic in May, June and July of 2003 and 2006. We analyzed and recorded the gender, age, and related clinical information of the patients with RM. In May, June and July of 2003, 41 patients out of a total of 1780 patients attending the ENT outpatient clinic were diagnosed with RM (2.3%). In the same months in 2006, 161 patients out a total of 1898 patients were diagnosed with RM (8.5%). The frequency of RM in these groups was therefore found to have increased significantly between 2003 and 2006. In 2006, 8 out of 10 patients with RM reported that they had made their purchasing decision solely on the basis of the information supplied by the drug advertisement without consulting their doctor or pharmacist. We suggest that the intensive media advertising campaign for nasal topical decongestants (particularly on TV) which started in 2004 is probably the main reason for this \"endemic\" RM. ","523":"To describe the paranasal complications that may occur after dental implantation. A literature search was performed in order to review currently available information about the complications of dental implantations and complementary procedures. The use of dental implants has gained great popularity due to their convenience, natural look, and better speech and chewing efficiency, as well as their potential to slow and even stop jawbone atrophy. Nevertheless, an increasing number of publications have drawn attention to the possible complications of the procedure for the paranasal sinuses. Both short-term and long-term complications have been described that should be familiar to otolaryngologists. Although the procedure is performed by dentists, dental implantations may also have a major impact on the paranasal sinuses. Complications may necessitate the knowledge and cooperation of both dentists and otolaryngologists. ","524":"In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of different suture materials on wound healing and infection in subcutaneous closure techniques. Twenty-nine rats were randomly allocated to 5 groups. All subjects received 2-cm vertical dermal and subdermal incisions on their backs under sterile and proper surgical conditions. The subdermal cuts were then closed with vicryl (polyglycolic acid), biosyn (monofilament glycomer), prolene (polypropylene) and tissue adhesive (2-octylcyanoacrylate). After 10 days, all sutured areas were examined for seroma, haematoma formation and cosmetic outcome. The incisional lines were excised with 1-cm-wide skin strips and tissue hydroxyproline levels were determined. The specimens obtained were evaluated for the presence of giant cells, mononuclear cells, fibrosis and neutrophils. No differences in tissue hydroxyproline levels were found between any of the suture materials used. Fibrotic process and inflammatory cell infiltration were more prominent in the biosyn and prolene groups than in other groups. Foreign body giant cells were observed in the biosyn group. Vicryl and tissue adhesive should be preferred in subcutaneous closure techniques. ","525":"The peri-operative and immediate post-operative outcome of secondary hyperparathyroidism treated with subtotal parathyroidectomy is reported. We studied 100 patients with chronic renal failure who underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy at our department. Surgical eligibility was based on hyperparathyroidism stage, defined by symptoms of osteodystrophy and\/or the presence of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia refractory to medical treatment. Parathormone levels were measured pre-operatively and during the first post-operative days. During surgery, four parathyroid glands were identified in 86% of patients, five glands in 1%, and less than four glands in 13%. The ratio of hyperplastic to normal glands was 93:7. No correlation was found between anatomic location of the glands and the presence of hyperplasia. Parathormone decreased to normal or very low values in 93% of the patients. In seven cases, the lowest post-operative parathormone value was above 30 pg\/ml, although four glands were removed in four of these patients. In 95% of the patients with four or more identified glands, post-operative serum parathormone levels decreased to normal or very low values. In 23% of the patients with less than four glands, parathormone levels remained too high. On the other hand, post-operative parathormone values normalized in 10 patients who had less than four glands identified during surgery; in two of them, parathyroid tissue was found during postoperative pathological examinations of the resected thyroid lobe. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is an acceptable treatment in patients with refractory hyperparathyroidism. Our results indicate that there was not a perfect correlation between the number of identified glands and post-operative parathormone in a subset of patients. ","526":"To assess remission rate, treatment results, and factors for remission in patients with adult-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (AORRP). In this retrospective study, the clinical and pathological data of 51 patients with AORRP, treated in University Hospitals between 1972 and 2006 were reviewed. The male-female ratio was 7:3. At diagnosis, the median age was 43 years, and the median retrospective Coltrera-Derkay Staging and Severity score was 6 (range, 2-28). Twenty-one patients (41%) received only surgical treatment. Thirty patients (59%) were treated with surgery and adjuvant intralesional cidofovir. At the time of analysis in December 2006, 69% of the patients were in remission. Of those, 46% had been treated with adjuvant cidofovir. Of the patients who were not in remission, 87% had been treated with adjuvant cidofovir. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.005). No significant difference was found between the remission group and the non-remission group for the factors age, gender, smoking habits, alcohol habits, GERD, severity and duration of therapy. AORRP was curable in most patients after long intensive treatment, with a general remission rate of 69%. Cidofovir was a negative factor for remission (p = 0.005). No other statistically significant factors for remission were found. Although a control group was present, it was not possible to perform a randomized study with comparable groups. A well-designed placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial to assess the outcomes of adjuvant intralesional cidofovir therapy for RRP would be valuable. ","527":"","528":"This paper evokes the personality of Jean Cruveilhier, presenting an overview of ENT pathology as reconstructed on the basis of his atlas: \"The pathology of the human body\" (1829-1842). We look at the anatomo-clinical method and paint a broad picture of medicine as practised in Paris during the first half of the 19th century (Figures 1,2).","529":"Silent sinus syndrome is rare and its pathophysiology is unclear. We report a case of silent sinus syndrome characterized by progressive enophtalmos with chronic maxillary atelectasis and asymptomatic chronic maxillary sinusitis. The patient had no history of sinusitis, facial trauma, or sinus surgery. Computed tomography revealed opacification of the right maxillary sinus and inferior bowing of the osteopenic orbital floor. Silent sinus syndrome was diagnosed and functional endoscopic maxillary antrostomy without orbital floor reconstruction was performed. At one-year follow-up, computed tomography showed optimal ventilation of the maxillary sinus, restoration of the orbital floor, and withdrawal of the orbital content to its normal position. Endoscopic maxillary antrostomy without orbital floor reconstruction is effective and associated with limited risks for complications; however, the results are observed in the long term. ","530":"Nasal natural killer (NK)\/T-cell lymphoma is an uncommon disease, and only a few paediatric cases are found in the literature. We report 2 cases of NK\/T-cell lymphoma occurring in children. The primary site was the the nasal cavity in the first case (5-year-old girl) and the tonsil in the second case (4-year-old boy). Histological study showed a polymorphic neoplastic infiltrate with an angioinvasive pattern and T-cell phenotype. Ebstein-barr virus infection was established by in situ hybridization. Both underwent an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. The outcome was favorable for the 4-year old boy; however, the 5-year-old girl died two months after diagnosis.","531":"Touch imprint cytological diagnosis of nodal Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare neoplasm of the mononuclear phagocytic immunoregulatory system of unknown aetiology. Nodal involvement is uncommon. Cytological findings have seldom been described. A case study of LCH, arising in a submandibular node of a 42-year-old female, is reported. Fine needle aspiration smears were highly cellular and composed of a mixed cell population including eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. Imprint slides from the surgical specimen of the excised node exhibited Langerhans cells with nuclear grooves, leading to a diagnosis suggestive of LCH. Immunohistochemical staining of the node sections with CD1a and S-100 confirmed this diagnosis. In conclusion, cytology may favorably contribute to the diagnosis of LCH.","532":"Nerve sheath tumours are uncommon lesions in adults. Schwannomas originating from the cervical sympathetic chain are a rare subgroup of nerve sheath tumours. Moreover, the existence of Horner's Syndrome before surgery is uncommon, with only five cases reported in the literature. Here we review the presentation, imaging characteristics, and operative considerations of a patient with a large cervical sympathetic chain schwannoma, presenting with Horner's Syndrome. A 60-year-old woman with a left upper eyelid ptosis presented to our outpatient department complaining of a painless left-sided neck mass. Histopathologic examination of excised mass, which was nearly 9.0 cm x 7.0 cm x 6.0 cm, revealed a benign schwannoma. When dealing with cervical masses, schwannoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially when some neurological symptoms exist. ","533":"The main purpose of this study was to determine the vocal quality of 20 male and 9 female university teachers using a multi-parameter approach. Secondly, the effect of an academic lecture on the voice profiles of the university teachers was measured. All groups underwent subjective voice evaluations (perceptual evaluation, Voice Handicap Index, anamnesis of vocal complaints and vocal abuse) and objective voice evaluations (aerodynamic and acoustic parameters, vocal performance, and the Dysphonia Severity Index). The same voice assessment was performed after an academic lecture with a mean length of one and a half hours. The mean DSI score was + 2.2 for the male teachers and + 4.0 for the female teachers. The mean VHI score was 13. Perceptually, all voice parameters were rated as normal. The questionnaire revealed a relatively high amount of vocal abuse. No changes in the objective vocal parameters were found after the lecture. Perceptually, however, the voices of the university teachers were significantly less instable after the lecture. Although no negative changes in objective vocal quality were observed, 48% of the university teachers experienced subjective vocal changes. The authors concluded that university teachers are professional voice users with good vocal quality who suffer no handicapping effect from possible voice disorders. No important changes in the vocal profile after a teaching activity of one and a half hours were found, despite the high prevalence of voice complaints. ","534":"The objective of this paper is to present Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a new and highly promising technique in tinnitus modulation. We conducted a Pubmed and Web of Science search using the words 'Tinnitus', 'TMS' and 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation'. We report on the most relevant studies relating to the effects and stimulation parameters of TMS in tinnitus patients. It has already proved possible to reduce tinnitus using TMS and rTMS in selected patient populations with specific stimulation parameters. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors were shown to determine the amount of tinnitus reduction. Though many studies point out that tinnitus reduction can be obtained using TMS, a lot of questions still remain concerning stimulation parameters and optimal patient selection.","535":"Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) can present with a variety of symptoms that can be predominantly auditory, predominantly vestibular or both. It can mimic a wide range of otological disorders, in particular otosclerosis-like stapes fixation. Our study revealed that, in 5.3% of our patients with clinically suspected otosclerosis, SSCD was detected in high-resolution multi-detector computed tomography (HRMDCT) of the temporal bone. We therefore emphasise the value of HRMDCT with reconstructions in the plane of the superior semicircular canal and perpendicular to the superior semicircular canal in the diagnostic work-up of each patient with a tentative diagnosis of otosclerosis-type stapes fixation. Where there are doubts, VEMP testing should be performed. We believe that a number of unexplained complications after an uneventful stapedotomy procedure might be explained by a pre-operatively undetected dehiscent superior semicircular canal and therefore unwarranted surgery. The typical feature of the conductive hearing loss due to SSCD compared to otosclerosis is an air-bone gap which is much more prominent at low frequencies than at high frequencies.","536":"Over 5 years, 68,472 newborns were screened through a newly implemented universal newborn hearing screening program. In 15 cases, atresia of the external ear canal was found. The aim of this study was to estimate the hearing status of these newborns using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and auditory brainstem responses (ABRs). TEOAEs were performed during the first days after birth in the normal ears of all newborns. Diagnostic ABR audiometry was performed in 10 newborns. Unilateral involvement occurred in all newborns studied. TEOAEs were present in all the contralateral ears. Normal ABRs were recorded from the healthy ear, whereas a conductive hearing loss, of approximately 50-60 dB, was found in the involved ear. In long-term follow-up, a satisfactory level of hearing, language, and speech development was found in 9 of the newborns; it was too early to come to definite conclusions in 4 newborns and 2 newborns were lost in follow-up. In this study, all newborns with aural atresia had normal function in the contralateral ear. Yet, a comprehensive assessment of hearing is essential as early intervention is necessary in the rare case of bilateral hearing impairment. ","537":"The objective of this study was to analyse the clinical presentations, treatment course, and outcomes for patients treated for chronic otitis media associated with facial paralysis in noncholesteatomatous ears. The present study looked at 13 patients (10 men, 3 women; ranging in age from 15 to 59 years) treated for facial paralysis due to chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma. Six patients had dehiscence of the fallopian canal whereas the bony canal was intact in the remaining patients. Decompression of the facial nerve was not performed in 5 of the 7 ears with an intact fallopian canal. Four ears underwent total decompression from the geniculate ganglion to the stylomastoid foramen, while the remaining 4 ears underwent partial nerve decompression. However, statistical analysis did not show any difference in recovery between the patients with surgical decompression and those without decompression (p = 0.171). All the patients not receiving decompression had successful outcomes (80% classified as Grade I and 20% as Grade II). All patients not receiving decompression had successful outcomes. Intravenous antibiotic treatment in conjunction with steroid therapy is the mainstay management of facial paralysis due to chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma. It is therefore not necessary to decompress the facial nerve in cases of facial paralysis in noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media. ","538":"To assess the presence of middle ear pathogens in nasopharynx (NP), middle ear fluid (MEF), and middle ear mucosal swabs (MES) of 14 patients undergoing middle ear surgery. Bacteria were assessed by culture and species specific PCR. Biofilm was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of middle ear biopsies (MEBs). Bacteria were absent in CLSM of MEBs in three of the four closed and healthy middle ears. Bacteria occurred in the ear with a foreign body (middle ear prosthesis), which showed localized living and dead bacteria, indicating biofilm. Bacterial growth was present in ten patient ears, but biofilm occurred in only one patient. CLSM indicated biofilm in the middle ear of two patients for whom PCR detected Haemophilus influenzae in the MEF. The three classical pathogens could frequently be found in the nasopharynx, by culture and PCR, but not from the middle ear. Alloiococcus otitidis was detected in the MEF of all five patients with open inflamed ears, though virtually absent from the nasopharynx. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in seven. It was the only pathogen found on several occasions in all three locations in one patient. This study confirms the association of H. influenzae with middle ear biofilm, and indicates a potential role of P. aeruginosa in middle ear inflammation and biofilm formation. Biofilm does not seem to cause inflammation. It is unclear whether the predominance of A. otitidis in chronically inflamed open middle ears indicates a pathogenic or contaminant role for this organism. ","539":"This Supportive Initiative for the Global Management of Allergy (SIGMA) initiative gathered together four multidisciplinary and inter-university groups of Belgian experts in the treatment of allergic rhinitis to review the literature and come to a consensus opinion on the global management of allergy. Their conclusions were as follows. Group 1 concluded that in children suffering from allergic rhinitis, there is sufficient expert opinion in favour of continuous treatment with both H1-antihistamines and corticosteroids for controlling symptoms during periods of allergen exposure, but not to support continuous treatment during periods when symptoms are negligible in an attempt to prevent the development of new allergic diseases. Group 2 came to similar conclusions in adults. Group 3 considered adults with concomitant asthma and stressed the crucial necessity to screen each asthmatic for allergic rhinitis and institute appropriate therapy for both conditions. Even though efficacious treatment algorithms are available for both rhinitis and asthma, an integrated management of these frequently concomitant diseases is not always prescribed even though there is a proven clinical advantage of adequate treatment of the nose of asthmatics. Group 4 concluded that for both H1-antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids, safety data indicate that continuous treatment may be given without fears of adverse consequences. With regard to the cost implications of continuous therapy versus on-demand therapy, there are indications that effective treatment of allergic rhinitis by continuous treatment reduces overall drug costs, particularly that of escape medication and indirect costs in the form of days absent from work and school.","540":"\"Who are you, Nystagmus?\" A semantic and historical approach. Initially, the need to name nystagmus was logically satisfied by the use of the metaphor of a galloping horse, \"hippus\". Later, nictatio, oeil d'hypocrite and souris embodied the presumed connection between blinking and the rhythmic involuntary movements of the eyeball. Blinking was also considered by Boissier as an inseparable companion of the unsteadiness of the eyeballs. Since drowsiness is a good example of a state accompanied by blinking, it makes sense, strange though it may seem, to use the Greek word for drowsiness, \"nustagmos\", to refer to the instable movement of the eyeballs. From a poetic point of view and in the light of the rapid phase of the phenomenon, nystagmus can be thought of as \"a modern Sisyphus, the operator of the eternal return\".","541":"Necrotizing lymphadenitis of the neck. Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is a rare cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. It is a benign, self-limiting disease whose etiology is unknown. Cervical lymphadenopathy and fever are the most important signs. Here we report a 25-year-old female presenting with complaints of fever and a painless swelling in the neck for three months. An excisional biopsy of a posterior cervical lymph node was performed, and histological evaluation revealed histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. This article discusses our case of histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis of the neck as well as the relevant literature.","542":"Delayed facial nerve paralysis post middle ear surgery: herpes simplex virus activation. Facial nerve paralysis following middle ear surgery is a nightmare for the otology surgeon. Usually this is caused by surgical trauma or local anaesthetic use. It is uncommon to see onset of facial nerve palsy more than 72 hours following the surgery. We report a case of facial nerve paralysis appearing 11 days following a successful canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Viral screening for Herpes Virus type 1 confirmed the viral aetiology of the delayed facial paralysis. When an ipsilateral facial nerve palsy appears more than 72 hours after an uneventful middle ear procedure, without symptoms of any infection, suspect a viral reactivation. ","543":"A mass at fat density in the parotid gland: dermoid cyst or lipoma. Dermoid cysts (DC) of the head and neck are uncommon and account for only 7% of all dermoid cysts in the body. DCs of the parotid gland are even rarer. In this article, a 42-year-old female patient with DC of the parotid gland is presented and discussed with a brief review of the literature. Radiologic findings suggested that the mass was a lipoma, but observation of a hair in the cyst during surgery changed the clinical diagnosis to DC; this suspicion was confirmed by pathological analysis. Although DCs are rare among the parotid masses, they should be kept in mind during the differential diagnosis.","544":"A giant paediatric mandibular aneurysmal bone cyst and reconstruction with bilateral iliac bone graft. Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is an unusual, non-neoplastic, expansile lesion of the bone. ABC is not a true cyst and it is characterised by the replacement of bone by fibro-osseous tissue containing blood-filled sinusoidal or cavernous spaces. The expanding mass often disrupts the normal bony architecture, with erosion of the cortex. Surgical treatment consists of complete excision or curettage. In this report, we present a 5-year-old girl with a huge aneurysmal bone cyst in the corpus of the mandible, which was reconstructed with bone graft taken from bilateral anterior iliac crests.","545":"Electroglottography in the follow-up of bilateral vocal fold palsy. The aim of the study was to determine if electroglottography provides useful information concerning vocal perturbations within the glottis in the follow-up of patients with bilateral vocal fold palsy. Electroglottography was performed in 8 patients with bilateral vocal fold palsy (aged 43-77 years; mean, 62.6; standard deviation, 3.8; median, 66) and 8 healthy age-matched controls. Percent (%) irregularity, jitter, and shimmer were calculated by Speech Studio. The patients' severity of dysphonia was rated by experts on a four-point scale. Percent irregularity was significantly higher in patients with vocal cord palsy than in controls (p &lt; 0.05). There was strong correlation between percent irregularity, jitter, and shimmer, and perceptual degree of dysphonia in all examinations during 6-month follow-up. Electroglottographic recordings can give an objective measure of glottal disturbances in patients with bilateral vocal fold palsy. It is possible to track improvement in vocal fold contact due to return of vocal fold mobility and functional compensation in consecutive examinations. Percent irregularity, jitter, and shimmer adequately represent changes in glottal function in individuals with bilateral vocal fold palsy during 6-month follow-up. ","546":"Management of choanal atresia and personal experience: a retrospective review. To evaluate the outcomes of the transnasal repair of choanal atresia with stenting. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with choanal atresia from 1994 to 2006. Records were then analysed with respect to age at time of surgery, sex, type of atresia, complications, stenting time and follow-up time. Eighteen children aged between 1 day and 22 months old with choanal atresia were evaluated and treated. Ten patients had bilateral (55.6%) and 8 unilateral (44.4%) disease. There were 11 females (61.1%) and 7 males (38.9%). All the patients underwent transnasal repair. There were no intra-operative and postoperative complications. Only one patient required a revision procedure. Despite the advances in endoscopic technology, the puncture, dilation and stenting technique is still the senior author's preferred method of repair for choanal atresia. ","547":"Acoustic rhinometry to evaluate plastic surgery results of the nasal septum. In this study, acoustic rhinometry was used in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of 16 patients undergoing surgery for nasal obstruction. The parameters evaluated prior to and subsequent to the operation were the diameter of the nasal cavity at its narrowest point, and the total volume of the nasal cavity. This method accurately showed changes in the dimensions of the nasal cavity following surgery. As shown by acoustic rhinometry, the change in the mean minimal cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity was 67%. Similarly, the augmentation of the mean total volume of the nasal cavity was 24.15%. The change in the dimensions of the nasal cavity paralleled the improvement in clinical symptoms. Acoustic rhinometry can accurately measure the dimensions of the nasal cavity, especially at the front part. It can also be used to assess the efficiency of treatment in cases of nasal obstruction, especially plastic surgery of the nasal septum. ","548":"Management of recurrent otitis media with rapid maxillary expansion: our experience. Recurrent otitis media is a frequent problem in the paediatric population. It is commonly associated with adenoid hypertrophy and occasionally with skeletal development syndrome characterised by maxillary anatomical alterations. When this syndrome is present in conjunction with adenoid hypertrophy, surgical management with adenoidectomy and\/or myringotomy with ventilation tube positioning does not necessarily ensure a resolution of conductive hearing disorders. We used maxillary rapid expansion in 27 children with a mean age of 7 years affected by recurrent otitis media associated with skeletal development syndrome and adenoid hypertrophy. Rapid maxillary expansion acting directly on the median palatine suture expands the palate and the nasal floor, improving nasal breathing. In addition, maxillary expansion stretches elevator and tensor palatine muscles, helping to restore normal Eustachian tube function, even in the presence of adenoid hypertrophy. In our opinion, rapid maxillary expansion results in an improvement in skeletal-facial abnormalities associated with skeletal development syndrome and it can be considered a valid treatment for preventing recurrent otitis media in children affected by maxillary anatomical alterations. ","549":"Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials and caloric tests in infants with congenital rubella. Congenital rubella is rare due to maternal vaccination, but vestibular function can be markedly impaired in affected infants. Currently, vestibular testing is not routinely performed in infants. This study evaluated inner ear function in infants with congenital rubella. The study included 54 3-month-old infants: 40 healthy controls and 14 with congenital rubella that was serologically confirmed in mothers and infants. There were two subgroups of infants with congenital rubella: 6 infants with clinical symptoms of intrauterine rubella infection present at birth and 8 asymptomatic infants. Caloric testing and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) testing were performed on all of the infants. In congenital rubella there was no reaction to caloric stimulation in 43% of the ears, and no VEMPs were recorded in 64%. The hearing thresholds were below 80 dB hearing level in 21% of the ears and greater than 80 dB hearing level in 43% of the ears. The degree of vestibular organ impairment in infants with congenital rubella is higher in individuals with profound hearing loss. VEMPs were absent more frequently than were caloric responses. Vestibular testing should be routinely performed in all infants with congenital rubella.

The existence of these triangles was a response to the need to locate the vessels quickly during surgery. These eponymous masters were both scientists and men. This paper tries to place them in the context of the time and to bring them to life with a number of anecdotes.","552":"Allergic rhinitis is a major chronic respiratory disease because of its prevalence, impacts on quality of life and work\/school performance, economic burden, and links with asthma. Evidence based guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis and management have been published in the first Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) document. This document has now been updated: ARIA 2008. In this article, it is aimed to summarize the newly updated and published version of \"Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) 2008\" in a Belgian perspective.","553":"To report an extremely rare case of nasopharyngeal tuberculosis. A 35-year-old male patient presented with nasal obstruction and snoring. Nasal endoscopic examination with a rigid endoscope revealed a large mass on the posterior wall and roof of the nasopharynx. A computed tomography scan of the nasopharynx revealed a polypoid mass in the posterior nasopharyngeal wall. Histopathological examination of a biopsy taken from the posterior nasopharyngeal wall revealed granulomatous lesions with caseation necrosis. Treatment was decided after histopathological examination and intradermal positive reaction to tuberculin test, and started a week later. The patient was treated with antituberculosis drugs including isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. After six months, the nasopharyngeal examination was absolutely normal, and the patient was also symptom free. This case highlights that nasopharyngeal tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a nasopharyngeal mass, especially in patients from regions of the world where tuberculosis is endemic. ","554":"Foreign bodies may be displaced into the maxillary sinus as a result of trauma or during dental interventions. They commonly cause chronic sinusitis and\/or fungal infections. This paper presents the case of a foreign body lodged in the right maxillary sinus ostium of a 31-year-old female patient. The foreign body was observed incidentally during radiological examination. After careful clinical and radiological examination, it was concluded that the foreign body was a piece of amalgam displaced into the maxillary sinus during a traumatic extraction. It is an uncommon finding to observe an asymptomatic dental foreign body in a position so close to the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus for so many years without any oro-antral fistula formation and\/or sinusitis attacks. We describe the non-surgical approach to the case and the need for surgical management will be questioned. The importance of consultation between otolaryngologists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons will also be emphasised.","555":"To describe a rare case of inflammatory pseudotumour (IPT) at the skull base involving the right rhinopharyngeal space. A case is presented; the clinical and therapeutic issues of IPT are reviewed and discussed. The mass resembled a malignant tumour or an aggressive infectious lesion; the final diagnosis was inflammatory pseudotumour. A complete regression of the mass was achieved after treatment with high dose oral steroids followed by maintenance steroid therapy. IPT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rhinopharyngeal malignancies in order to avoid inappropriate (surgical) treatment. ","556":"Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma is a variant of epidermoid carcinoma with a morphology consisting of both basaloid and squamous cell components. It is a high-grade tumour with a propensity for nodal and systemic metastases. In this report, we present the aggressive course of a basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus in a 28-year-old patient who died only four months after the initial diagnosis. We describe the unusual spread of the disease to the scalp, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, ovaries, lungs and bone marrow.","557":"The discussion of the incidence of sinusitis in patients with nasal septal deviation and concha bullosa has been accompanied by some controversy. In this study, we assess the incidence, in conjunction with concha bullosa and nasal septal deviation, of sinus, ostiomeatal and frontal recess disease on either side in the same patients. We reviewed the CT studies conducted between 2003 and 2005 of the paranasal sinuses of 130 patients. All examinations were performed for the evaluation of a symptom referable to the sinonasal region. Fifty-eight patients had both nasal septal deviation and concha bullosa. We recorded the presence and degree of septal deviation, the direction of septal deviation, and sinus, ostiomeatal and frontal recess disease. Twenty-six patients had deviation to the right. Of these patients, nine had sinusitis on the left and ten had sinusitis on the right. Thirty-two patients had deviation to the left. Of these patients, 14 patients had sinusitis on the left and 17 had sinusitis on the right. No statistical difference was found (p &gt; 0.05). Likewise, no correlation was found with frontal recess or ostiomeatal disease. The incidence of the coexistence of nasal septal deviation and concha bullosa is high (44.6%). There does not appear to be a statistically significant difference between the laterality of sinus, ostiomeatal and frontal recess disease (p &gt; 0.05). The incidence of sinusitis in severe nasal septal deviation is higher when compared with mild (p = 0.001) and moderate groups (p &lt; 0.001). ","558":"To assess how surgical indications for endoscopic sinonasal surgery have changed over time. The surgical indications of 1173 patients who underwent endoscopic sinonasal surgery between 1994 and 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Preoperative diagnoses were chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps in 511 patients (43.6%), chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps in 434 (36.9%), concha bullosa in 113 (9.6%), nasal mass in 66 (5.6%), and others in 49 patients (4.1%). Over 60% of patients had surgery for chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps between 1994 and 1999, whereas nearly 60% of patients who underwent surgery between 2001 and 2007 had chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. Reasons for the decrease in the number of the patients with chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps and the increase in the number of patients with chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps might include: 1) Administration of maximal medical therapy; 2) Increased recognition of the possibility for false positive opacifications in computed tomography and increased understanding that not all anatomical variations predispose to sinusitis; 3) More careful \"profit and loss\" discussions with patients as our postoperative experience increased; 4) More patients with nasal polyps underwent endoscopic sinonasal surgery as surgical skills improved, and recurrences remained common. ","559":"Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMPs) are saccular responses to acoustic stimuli. They can be recorded from the sternocleidomastoid muscle ipsilaterally to the stimulated ear. Their reflex arc includes the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei. To determine the usefulness of VEMPs in localising brainstem lesions. We used VEMPs, Blink Reflex (BR) and Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BAERs) to evaluate six patients presenting with acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic brainstem lesions, or basilar dolichoectasia. MRI in patient one revealed a dorsolateral medullary infarct on the right. VEMP amplitude was reduced ipsilaterally. The R2 BR component was delayed bilaterally upon stimulation of the affected side. Patients two and three had suffered a left lateral lower pontine infarct and a right lateral lower pontine haemorrhage. In patients four and five, MRA revealed dolichoectasia of the basilar artery exerting pressure on the lower lateral pons. VEMP amplitude was reduced ipsilaterally. Patient six had an ischaemic lesion in the right upper lateral pons. The R1, R2i and R2c BR components were delayed ipsilaterally. BAERs waves IV and V were absent on the right. VEMPs were normal. VEMPs are affected by lesions of the lateral lower pons and upper medulla. Our results suggest that they may be a useful addition in the localisation of such lesions. ","560":"Surgical treatment of dislocation and fracture of the middle ear ossicles is recommended to be carried out within months of the initial injury. Here we present 6 patients with traumatic ossicular injury whose surgery was delayed over 1 year. We evaluated the clinical and pathological changes that occurred over time and assessed the surgical outcomes in delayed cases. Histories of the causative traumas, computerized tomography (CT) and tympanometry findings, pre- and postoperative hearing thresholds, and ossicular damages assessed at the tympanotomies were evaluated. The time lapse between the trauma and the surgery varied from 1 to 6 years. The resultant hearing losses were moderate or moderately severe, conductive, mixed or sensorineural type. Tympanometry and CT revealed ossicular discontinuity in only two cases. In operations, various types of ossicular abnormalities in the form of absence, displacement, fracture and\/or fixation were identified. Continuity and mobility of the ossicular chains were restored with various techniques. Air-bone conduction gap was brought to within 20 dBHL in all cases, and within 10 dB in 3 (50%) of the cases. Gains in the bone conduction were also notable. Trauma to the middle ear may result in an elevation in the air and\/or bone conduction thresholds due to ossicular disruption and fixation. Our findings confirmed that tympanotomy is superior to methods such as CT and tympanometry in delineating the type and extent of the traumatic ossicular damage, and usually gives favorable results even in delayed cases.

We conclude that AN\/AD implantee candidates should be counselled with care.","565":"Nasal intubation is used often by anaesthetists because it offers many advantages; however, rare complications do arise. A 67-year-old man was admitted to our otorhinolaryngology clinic for uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Nasotracheal intubation was performed without difficulty. At the beginning of surgery, the surgeon noticed that the nasotracheal tube had penetrated the oropharyngeal mucosa through a channel in the retropharyngeal space. The tube was left in place during surgery to prevent bleeding. After surgery, a vertical incision was made through the mucosa surrounding the tube from the inferior pouch up to the nasopharynx to prevent hematoma. The patient was extubated without complication and discharged on the second day postoperative. The oropharyngeal mucosa was healed by the 15th day postoperative. Nasal intubation tubes should be lubricated and inserted without force; the oropharynx should be examined carefully after intubation to rule out complications. ","566":"Hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular tumour with potential for malignancy that is intermediate between that of a benign hemangioma and a malignant angiosarcoma.

Constant erosion of the surrounding tissue by the expansion of the necrotic front can threaten important structures. Very few reports in the literature deal with the surgical management of these injuries. This paper reports on two cases of non-healing, slow-growing cervical ulcerations that occurred as a result of radiotherapy and surgery. After unsuccessful conservative treatment, definitive surgical repair was performed to achieve reparation of the defect and protect deep structures. The onset and characteristics of the ulcerations as well as the reconstructive options are discussed. In the treatment of surgery and radiotherapy induced chronic cervical wounds, non surgical medical treatment should be always attempted for at least 6 months, and should always include hyperbaric oxygen therapy. If conservative methods fail, surgical repair by means of transposition of well vascularized tissue is mandatory to prevent serious complications such as major vessel rupture or fistulas. ","568":"To determine the predictive value of endoscopic examination and radiological imaging in the evaluation of substomal tracheomalacia in advanced laryngotracheal stenosis. Forty nine patients with advanced laryngotracheal stenosis were preoperatively evaluated with radiological (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and endoscopy to determine the grade of laryngotracheal stenosis and presence of substomal tracheomalacia. The intraoperative findings were compared with the preoperative findings, and the percentage of operative plan changes was calculated. In a preoperative evaluation, 37 patients were found to have no substomal tracheomalacia; but during the surgical procedure, we detected substomal tracheomalacia in 12 (32.4%) of these patients and changed our preoperative plan during the procedure (p &lt; 0.05). Laryngotracheal reconstruction plans are dependent on preoperative evaluations which can change significantly during the surgical procedure. Therefore, experienced physicians who can alter the preoperative plan immediately during the procedure and successfully perform an alternative procedure are necessary. ","569":"The management of squamous cell carcinoma in undetermined primary tumours in the head and neck region (approximately 5.5% of patients) is controversial. The present report examines the outcomes for 14 patients after an initial treatment strategy directed principally at the side of the neck that is clinically involved. The distribution of nodal status was as follows: 1 N1, 8 N2A, 4 N2B, and 1 N3. Initial treatment included a modified neck dissection in 12 cases and radical neck dissection in 2 cases, plus postoperative radiation in 10 cases. Radiotherapy was directed at the ipsilateral side of the neck alone. Concomitant radiochemotherapy was given in 2 cases. The rate of disease control on the ipsilateral side was 12\/14. Two patients were treated by chemotherapy but died of their disease. The failure rate on the contralateral side was 2\/14. These two patients were successfully salvaged. During follow-up, a primary tumour was detected in one case. At the end of the follow-up, 10 patients were alive. Modified radical neck dissection combined with postoperative radiation with or without chemotherapy could be considered in N1-N3 lymph node status. Despite generally advanced disease at presentation, patients presenting with cervical metastasis from an unknown primary carcinoma have a reasonable survival expectation and aggressive treatment is warranted. Careful follow-up is required for effective salvage treatment. ","570":"The aim of this study was to evaluate hearing in a population of industrial workers exposed to occupational noise by using both conventional and extended high-frequency (EHF) audiometry, and to compare our results with the findings from a control group. A total of 139 industry workers exposed to noise were examined over a period of two years and 32 healthy subjects were used as controls. Conventional audiometry in the frequency range 0.25-8 kHz and EHF audiometry in the frequency range 9-20 kHz were performed. Thresholds in the noise-exposed group were higher than in the control group for both standard and extended high frequencies, but variability was greater in EHF. Larger differences were found in the 4,000-18,000 Hz frequency region, and especially in the 12,500-18,000 frequency zone. A statistically significant correlation between the elevation of puretone thresholds and time of exposure was found across all frequencies (from 250 to 20,000 Hz), with the exception of 10,000 Hz. EHF audiometry is a useful adjunct to conventional audiometry in the audiological assessment of subjects exposed to occupational noise. This test performs well in the frequency range 12,500-18,000 Hz, but there is greater variability in the results compared with conventional audiometry. ","571":"Congenital dacryocystocele (CDC) is recognised as a cause of nasal airway obstruction or respiratory distress in newborns. CDC is caused by the distal obstruction of the lachrymal duct and presents as a cystic formation in the inferior meatus. We discuss five cases of dacryocystocele, together with surgical management and outcome. Endoscopic endonasal marsupialisation and appropriate postoperative care resulted in definitive recovery for all patients. In newborns or infants with nasal obstruction, CDC should be considered in the differential diagnosis, and prompt endoscopic endonasal marsupialisation is mandatory.","572":"We compared the efficacy of T-tubes and bicanalicular silicone tubes in endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). We retrospectively reviewed 54 eyes of 49 patients who had experienced nasolacrimal duct obstruction and undergone endoscopic DCR. Group one had bicanalicular silicone tube stents implanted (24 eyes), and group two consisted of patients who had otologic T-tubes (30 eyes). The duration of stent placement, follow-up time, and the subjective and objective success of the procedures were evaluated. Cases were grouped as failure or success according to improvement in epiphora complaint. An endoscopic DCR procedure was successful in 19 (79.2%) cases in the silicone group and in 23 (76.7%) cases in the T-tube group. The success rate did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.83). The most common cause of failure was granuloma formation in the bicanalicular silicone tube group and spontaneous tube loss in the otologic T-tube group. The findings revealed that both the otologic T-tube and the bicanalicular silicone tube had similar success rates (76.7% and 79.2%, respectively). We believe that otologic T-tubes, which are less expensive and more easily acquired, might be offered as an alternative to bicanalicular silicone tubes in patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

Cozzolino was the first to introduce an Edison lamp through the mouth into the oropharynx to inspect the nasal fossae. Voltolini, by moving the lamp forward into the mouth, discovered the maxillary sinus diaphanoscopy. Heryng codified the clinical significance of the maxillary sinus diaphanoscopy.","574":"Unilateral vocal fold agenesis: an unusual cause of dysphonia. Unilateral vocal fold agenesis is a rare congenital laryngeal anomaly. To our knowledge, there have been no published reports about this clinical entity to date. A 6-year-old female patient was referred to our practice for persistent hoarseness of voice since birth. On physical examination, her voice was hoarse and reduced in volume. She had facial features typical of Down syndrome and macroglossia. Laryngeal examination revealed the absence of the right vocal fold. She had no further evaluation or treatment.","575":"Soft tissue sarcomas are rare malignancies in the head and neck region. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is one of the most common types of head and neck soft-tissue sarcomas. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by the development of multiple neurofibromas that can transform into aggressive sarcomas. We present an unusual case of malignant fibrous histiocytoma originating from the right vocal fold of the larynx associated with NF1 and discuss its histopathological and clinical features in light of the current literature. Because of their increased risk for malignancy, patients with NF1 should be carefully monitored for the development of additional neoplasms. Our experience supports the use of conservative surgery for treating limited lesions of laryngeal malignant fibrous histiocytoma. ","576":"Warthin's tumour usually involves the parotid gland. However, it can also arise from ectopic salivary tissue in the para-parotid and latero-cervical lymph nodes. We present the case of a 60-year-old man with a 3-month history of a smooth, mobile mass on the right side of the neck. Computed tomography (CT) scanning (coronal, axial and sagittal sections) showed a cystic lesion in the right upper neck without connection to the major salivary glands (8 x 4 x 3 cm). Complete surgical excision with a transverse neck incision was performed. Histological findings of the specimen revealed Warthin's tumour. This neoplasm should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions of the neck. Although rare, it has potential for malignant transformation. Coronal and sagittal CT scans are necessary to accurately localize the tumour and to differentiate the diagnosis from earring lesions of the parotid tail. ","577":"Vascular leiomyoma (angioleiomyoma) of the nasal cavity is an extremely rare tumour. Following a thorough review of relevant literature, we found that such tumours are more common in females. Only 4 of 30 reported cases have been found in male patients. Moreover, considering the site of the lesion within the nasal cavity, only 3 of these 30 cases originated from the nasal vestibule. Hereby, we present a case of vascular leiomyoma arising specifically from the floor of the nasal vestibule in a 68-year-old man, which is unique because it combines the specific tumour localization with the patient's gender. The patient was treated surgically. The tumour was completely removed through an intraoral incision. This is the first reported case of vascular leiomyoma arising from the floor of the nasal vestibule affecting a male patient. ","578":"To report an extremely rare case of pneumatisation of all turbinates. A 17-year-old male patient presented with nasal obstruction. Anterior rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopic examination revealed left middle turbinate and bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy, septal deviation to the right. A coronal computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed pneumatisation of both superior and inferior turbinates and a left middle turbinate, and also showed pneumatisation of the right middle turbinate. The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery of the left side with lateral lamellar resection of the middle turbinate under local anaesthesia. We present the first case in the world literature of the pneumatisation of all six turbinates. ","579":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and histopathological characteristics of antrochoanal polyps (ACPs) and to perform a comparative analysis of surgical techniques in terms of recurrence. The clinical, radiological and histopathological features of 42 patients with a diagnosis of ACP who underwent surgery in a period of 6 years (January 2000 - January 2006) were investigated retrospectively. Histopathological examinations were present for all patients and were re-examined for histological analysis. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) was performed in all patients. Transcanine sinoscopy (TS) and the Caldwell-Luc approach (CL) were used in addition to ESS in 14 and 13 patients respectively. The attachment site was detected in 21 patients (50%) and the most frequent site was found to be the lateral wall in 15 patients (71.4%). There was no relationship between the choice of surgery, the attachment site or accessory ostium, or any sinusitis with ACP. Histological examination showed prominent eosinophilia in 29 patients (69%). The follow-up time was a minimum of 12 months with a mean of 28.9 months. Three recurrences were seen after ESS. However, there was no recurrence after ESS+TS and ESS+CL. Our study showed that the most important factors affecting the choice of surgical approaches are the preference of the surgeon, the age of the patient and the presence of recurrent disease. Combined approaches with either TS or CL should be considered, particularly when the attachment site of the antral part of ACP is undetected, in order to prevent incomplete excision and recurrences. ","580":"To analyse the incidence of concha bullosa and any aetiological correlation with nasal septal deviation. Paranasal sinus computerised tomography (CT) scans were made of 143 consecutive patients with sinonasal symptoms. Patients with altered anatomy (iatrogenic or pathological) were excluded and the remaining CT scans were analysed for the pneumatisation of the middle turbinate, septal deviation and the correlation between them. Sixty-three percent of patients had some types of septal deviation and 35% had unilateral or bilateral concha bullosa. Septal deviation was present in 9 out of 13 patients (69.2%) with large unilateral or dominant concha bullosa, 10 out of 24 (41.7%) with medium unilateral or dominant concha bullosa, and 12 out of 30 (40%) with small concha bullosa. There was a clear link between the presence of a unilateral concha, or a dominant concha (in bilateral concha), and the presence of nasal septal deviation (P &lt;0.009). After the assessment of various sizes and shape of concha bullosa and the form of nasal septal deviation away from the dominant concha, we suggest that deviation is an indirect result of the presence of the concha. This hypothesis can be proved by reference to the laws of physics. ","581":"This aim of this study was to define the characteristics of the patients who underwent surgery for ankyloglossia. The patients (n = 127) with ankyloglossia underwent surgery between 1987 and 2005. The patients were evaluated for age, gender, complaints, grade, and operative procedures. This study did not cover postoperative evaluation of the procedure. The ages of the children ranged from 20 days to 7 years, and 84% of them were under 1 year of age. Seventy-two percent were boys; 28% were girls. The most common complaint of the parents of infants under one year of age was breast-feeding (35\/84). When the tongue movements of the patients were examined, 57 patients (of whom 18 were over one year of age) had limited tongue mobility. The mean frenulum length of the patients was grade 1 in 72 patients and grade 2 in 55 patients. Ankyloglossia was corrected by frenotomy. Three patients had bleeding from their frenotomy site which resolved with local pressure. General anaesthesia was preferred for 77 patients, and there was a need for suturing in 20 patients. The correction of ankyloglossia at an early age reduces the risk of latent complications. In addition, the early correction will mitigate the feeding- and speech-related concerns of parents and doctors alike. ","582":"It is now established that head &amp; neck squamous cell carcinomas represent a major group of tumours for which an improvement in the overall survival rate could be achieved by a multimodality approach. Surgery as salvage treatment also continues to play an important role in organ preservation strategies in advanced head and neck cancer. Before the prospective randomised organ preservation trial conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group demonstrating the benefits of induction chemotherapy, the standard of care for most advanced laryngeal\/pharyngo-laryngeal carcinomas was total laryngectomy\/pharyngo-laryngectomy and postoperative radiotherapy. The new approach was also supported by a similar prospective trial from the EORTC Head &amp; Neck Cooperative Group dealing with advanced hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Currently, advanced laryngeal\/pharyngo-laryngeal carcinomas are treated with chemoradiotherapy but some patients will require a more complex salvage laryngectomy\/pharyngo-laryngectomy. In a first group of 44 patients treated with sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy, median survival was 6.7 years. The overall 5-year survival rate was 52.2%. Disease-free survival at 5 years was 50%. 20\/44 (50%) of patients retained their larynx. Only 5 patients needed complex salvage surgery. In the second group of 19 patients who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy, 78.9% of the patients retained their larynx. Salvage surgery was performed in five patients. CTx and RT is an effective strategy for organ preservation without compromising the survival of patients with locally advanced pharyngo-laryngeal carcinoma, keeping surgery for salvage. ","583":"During his long life (1746-1828), Goya had many opportunities to meet patients and physicians. He saw, drew and engraved portraits of all kinds of physicians. He depicted sick persons, injured men and the disabled. He visited hospitals, praising those who tried to relieve suffering; he denounced charlatans and acclaimed the martyrs of science. Obsessed by the mouth and everything it expresses, Goya depicted himself without clemency, as a deaf man and as a patient. The deafness of the painter usually gave his work the characteristics of a nightmare. However, his depiction of medicine was also a metaphor of the struggle against the unhappiness of ordinary people, the arrogance of false scientists, the privileges of the nobility and the tyranny of the Inquisition.","584":"It is common to see nasal polyps arising from the lateral wall of the nose; however, polyps arising from the nasal septum are rare. Diagnosis of such lesions is usually made by nasal endoscopy and confirmed by computer tomography. Two cases of isolated nasal septum polyps were diagnosed from 150 consecutive functional endoscopic sinus surgeries. Both patients had septal deviation; only one had a history of allergy. The polyps were completely excised in both cases; the septal deviations were not corrected. Both patients remain disease-free after two and three years of follow-up. Nasal septal deviation does not seem to play an important role in septal polyp development, whereas local nasal inflammatory factors appear to be important for the genesis of septal polyps. Limited resection using a functional endoscopic surgical approach is the best choice of treatment to prevent recurrence of polyps. ","585":"Giant cell granuloma (GCG) is a rare nonneoplastic bone lesion that occurs mostly in the jawbones; few cases arise in the remainder of the skull, including the temporal bone. Previously, giant cell lesions of the temporal bone were regarded as giant cell tumours (GCT). The importance of distinguishing GCG from GCT lies in the presumed difference in prognosis; GCTs have higher rates of recurrence, metastasis, and malignant transformation. We describe the case of a 12-year-old child with temporal bone GCG extending to the middle cranial fossa. The patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy via retroauricular approach, associated with resection of the zygomatic process. No evidence of recurrence was found 36 months later. The diagnosis of GCG was based on clinical history, histology, imaging, and response to treatment. The patient was treated with the standard surgical approach, and has a good outcome at three years follow-up. ","586":"Aspergillus mastoiditis is a very rare condition usually observed in immunocompromised patients. Masked mastoiditis is defined as a subclinical infectious inflammatory process of the mucosal lining and bony structures of the mastoid air cells with intact tympanic membranes. To our knowledge, our report of a masked Aspergillus mastoiditis occurring in a 71-year-old diabetic woman is only the second case of masked mastoiditis in the literature. Aggressive medical and surgical management are necessary to avoid a fatal outcome from this invasive infection.","587":"Parotid gland Mycobacterial infection is a rare disease that causes parotid swelling without disease-specific manifestations. We present a case of intraparotid lymph node tuberculosis that mimicked a tumour. Computed tomography of the head and neck indicated a left parotid enlargement involving two intraparotid lymph nodes. The cervical lymph nodes of the ipsilateral posterior triangle and the submandibular and jugulodigastric areas were also enlarged. Contrast enhancement indicated homogenous tissue with no necrotic areas. A biopsy revealed a caseating granuloma most likely due to tuberculosis. A purified protein derivative test gave strong positive results (35 mm). After one month of antituberculous treatment, the cervical lymphadenopathy and left parotid lumpiness disappeared. Tuberculous parotitis and neoplasms have similar clinical manifestations. In patients with a mass in the parotid gland, a high clinical suspicion of underlying tuberculosis is crucial for establishing an accurate diagnosis and the proper management. ","588":"An aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a rare, benign fibro-osseous lesion, considered a vascular phenomenon secondary to fibrous dysplasia or a giant-cell tumour, and occurs mainly in long bones and vertebrae. In this case report a 16-year-old male presented with massive epistaxis. He was admitted with a 3-year history of chronic rhinitis, headaches, right ocular pain and recurrent epistaxis. CT scans showed a predominantly cystic, expansive mass obstructing both nasal cavities, extending to all paranasal sinuses and both orbits, with evidence of anterior cranial fossa skull base destruction. The patient underwent a craniofacial resection of the tumour performed with an external approach and an immediate reconstruction of the dural defect. Histology confirmed the lesion was an ABC associated with fibrous dysplasia. The patient's recovery was complete. A large facial aneurysmal bone cyst can damage the facial skeleton and skull base, and requires excision by a combined external approach.","589":"Concha bullosa is the most common anatomic variant of the middle turbinate that usually remains asymptomatic. If the mucosal lining of pneumatized middle turbinate becomes inflamed, symptoms such as nasal obstruction, post-nasal discharge, snoring, headache, and fever occur. We report a case of concha pyocele (concha bullosa mucocele) in a 19-year-old girl. Computed tomography identified a right intranasal mass expanding towards the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus, nasal septum and right ethmoidal cells. The concha pyocele caused obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex, leading to right maxillary, ethmoid and sfenoid sinusitis. The patient was endoscopically treated under local anaesthesia. Histological examination of the mass revealed an active chronic inflammation caused by a foreign body.","590":"Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disorder that involves many body joints including the temporomandibular joint. The frequency of temporomandibular joint involvement based on clinical and radiological findings is rather diverse and involvement may manifest as pain, restricted range of movement and locking of the joint. The aim of this study is to investigate and correlate the clinical, laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The temporomandibular joint involvement in 43 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, whose diagnoses were based on the revised 1987 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, were evaluated using clinical examination, laboratory findings and magnetic resonance imaging. Temporomandibular joint involvement was clinically observed in 28 patients (65.1%), and radiologically in 33 patients (76.7%). The most frequent physical examination finding, a \"click\" in the joint upon opening of the mouth, was found in 21 (48.8%) patients. The most frequently observed radiological finding was synovial proliferation seen in 22 (51.1%) patients. A statistically significant correlation was observed between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the findings on magnetic resonance imaging; between the rheumatoid factor results and physical examination findings; and between the findings of the physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the rheumatoid factor results, and the findings on magnetic resonance imaging were found to be important in indicating temporomandibular joint involvement in rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies are necessary to specify the risk factors in more detail. ","591":"Congenital neck masses in children and their embryologic and clinical features. Neck masses of congenital origin can be diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for internists, paediatricians and surgeons. Treatment modalities of congenital neck masses are different depending on their nature, symptoms and location. Differential diagnosis includes a variety of diseases that can cause cervical masses such as infectious and neoplastic neck tumours. Our objective is to review the embryologic and clinical features of some of the most common congenital neck masses such as the haemangioma, branchial cleft anomalies, thyroglossal duct cyst, ectopic thyroid, congenital midline cervical cleft, congenital cervical teratoma, lymphangioma, cervical thymic cyst, dermoid cyst and congenital muscular torticollis.","592":"To investigate indications, features and outcome of pediatric tracheotomy in our ENT department. A retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients who underwent tracheotomy between 1992 and 2006 in the Children's Hospital of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel. The main parameters of the study were age, gender, indications, morbidity and mortality rate, time and success of decannulation. Twenty-nine children younger than 16 years of age, 21 males and 8 females, underwent tracheotomy. Indications for tracheotomy fell into two main groups: chronic diseases requiring ventilation support (55%) and relief of airway obstruction (45%). Tracheotomies were mainly performed in young children, 76% were under 3 years of age. In this age group, upper airway obstruction was the most frequent indication. The complication rate was 36%, and the nontracheotomy-related mortality rate was 25%. The tracheotomy-related mortality rate was 3.5%. Successful decannulation was possible in 28% after a mean duration of 24 months after surgery. Of the remaining 72% for whom decannulation was not performed, 35% died mainly because of the underlying disease. Those infants failing decannulation (65%) had neurologic disorders. In accord with the literature, where a shift towards very young patients and towards indications related to chronic ventilatory support is observed, in this series tracheotomies were mainly performed for the youngest children. Relief of upper airway obstruction was the most frequent indication. Morbidity and mortality rates among this specific patient population should not be ignored. ","593":"Bonain's liquid, otherwise known as Bonain's mixture or Bonain's solution, is universally known and still in use. How many medicines can say the same after a hundred years? By contrast, Jules Aristide Bonain, a physician from Brittany, remains unknown. We pay a tribute to him in this paper, describing the origins of the famous solution, as well as Bonain's role in the treatment of diphtheria and his surprising early career as a naval surgeon, which led him to participate in France's colonial adventure at the turn of the 20th century.","594":"Developmental odontogenic cysts account for 10% of all cysts of the jaw. Dentigerous cysts are benign odontogenic cysts. They are associated with the crowns of unerupted teeth. A 24-year-old woman presented with headache, facial pain and facial swelling during the previous six months. Computed tomography revealed a dentigerous cyst in the right maxillary sinus floor. The cyst was removed and the tooth was extracted transnasally with the help of an endoscope. Our case was exceptional because it was seen in a rare area outside the dental area: it was located in the floor of the right maxillary sinus, and it was removed transnasally rather than with one of the more common approaches such as a Caldwell-Luc procedure. This article discusses the dentigerous cyst case, as well as the relevant literature.","595":"We present a case of an external laryngocele with laryngeal carcinoma. A laryngocele is a rare benign lesion of the larynx resulting from an abnormal dilation of the laryngeal saccule filled with air. When the neck of the laryngocele is obstructed, it fills with mucus and is called a laryngopyocele. There may be a relationship between laryngoceles and squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. A review of the literature found a reported association between laryngoceles and carcinomas of the larynx of between 4.9 and 54%. In this report, we present a case of an external laryngocele associated with laryngeal carcinoma. Another important point of this case is that a deep neck infection was the first symptom. In the light of the cases presented in the literature, patients with a deep neck infection should undergo CT imaging and patients with laryngoceles must also be examined with direct laryngoscopy. ","596":"Adult rhabdomyomas are rare, benign striated-muscle neoplasms that occur in the head and neck region. They are usually solitary, but can be multifocal. We report on clinical, radiographic and morphologic features of a rhabdomyoma in the floor of the mouth and the base of the tongue in a 65-year-old male. The patient presented with a painless mass in the right submandibular region. Clinical examination revealed diffuse enlargement of both sublingual and submandibular glands. Nasolaryngoscopy showed a hypervascular lesion on the right side of the base of the tongue. Radiological investigation showed the multilobulated aspect of the lesion, and an incisional biopsy of the submandibular tumour led to the diagnosis of adult-type rhabdomyoma. Surgery comprised of extirpation of both the sublingual and submandibular glands, as well as the lesion in the base of the tongue. Histological examination of the different lesions confirmed the diagnosis of adult-type rhabdomyoma. No recurrence has occurred in a follow-up period of 6 months. We compare this case with previous reports of adult rhabdomyomas in the literature.","597":"Hydatid disease located in the head and neck is uncommon, and hydatid cysts rarely present as a cervical mass. We report an unusual case of primary hydatid cyst arising in the soft tissues of the neck. The clinical presentation was non-specific. The diagnosis was suspected by the radiological findings, and confirmed by histopathology. Characteristics of this rare disease, its diagnostic difficulties, and treatment are discussed.","598":"Ceruminous neoplasms of the external ear canal are rare. Classification, clinical behavior, and management of these tumours are controversial. We report a case of carcinoma originating from the ceruminous glands of the external ear canal (EAC), operated based on a diagnosis of chronic otitis media with polyp. A 48-year-old man presented with left ear discharge and hearing loss. Clinical examination showed a well-circumscribed polypoid mass limited to the EAC. There was no history of bloody ear discharge or radiological findings of bony erosion suggestive of malignancy. Our preliminary diagnosis was chronic otitis media with polyp formation. Tympanoplasty was performed. Histopathology revealed a ceruminous carcinoma, and an additional operation involving lateral temporal bone dissection was performed, followed by 60 Gy radiation therapy. Ceruminous carcinomas should be considered in the differentialdiagnosis of middle and external ear pathologies in cases of soft tissue mass in the EAC. ","599":"To describe the clinical and radiological features of the vascular anomaly, aberrant internal carotid artery (ICA) in the temporal bone. Case reports on two patients. Aberrant ICA in the middle ear is a rare congenital abnormality usually identified on a computed tomographic scan before beginning middle ear surgery. Misdiagnosis may lead to serious surgical complications such as major bleeding, or even neurological deficit due to endovascular occlusion. ","600":"Since 1998 an integrated universal newborn hearing screening programme (UNHSP) based on automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) has been implemented in Flanders. The protocol of the UNHSP is based on guidelines defined by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP). The aim of this paper is to report on the screening protocol and to assess its feasibility. Descriptive study based upon an analysis of the screening results in the neonatal non-NICU population of Flanders between 1999 and 2004. The UNHSP, organized by Kind en Gezin (K&amp;G), uses a 2-stage protocol: children with a refer at the first screening test are retested, and those with a refer at the retest are referred to a certified centre. Screening and referral centres communicate their data to a central database at K&amp;G. From the beginning of 1999 until the end of 2004 a screening was offered to 97.91% of all eligible babies in Flanders; 91.5% of these babies were screened by K&amp;G using the Algo Portable Newborn Screener. Three-quarters of the referred babies had a confirmed hearing loss. In 57.6% of these babies, hearing loss was bilateral. Some babies had a temporary hearing problem. The false positive rate after two tests was 0.53 per thousand. All ascertained babies started early intervention, most of them before the age of 4 months. K&amp;G has succeeded in organizing a new, well-structured community-based UNHSP according to the guidelines of the AAP on Neonatal Hearing Screening. ","601":"To evaluate the relevance of routine head and neck ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), chest X-ray, and standard clinical examination for the early detection of recurrences, second primary tumours, and distant metastases in the followup of patients treated for head and neck cancers. Retrospective cohort study. One hundred ninety-five patients were reviewed. Seventy-one recurrences appeared during the follow-up period. Five recurrences were diagnosed during head and neck US and CT. Sixty-four recurrences were diagnosed based on patients' complaints or standard clinical examination. Two lung malignancies were diagnosed during the annual chest Xray. Systematic head and neck US and CT exams revealed recurrent cancers with poor efficiency and should be performed only after clinical suspicion of recurrence or second primary tumours. The value of an annual chest X-ray remains debatable. Routine clinical follow-up is clearly crucial for the detection of early recurrences and second primary tumours. ","602":"Management and treatment guidelines for rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps have been published by the European Academy for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) task force in 2005, and have recently been updated. These guidelines are evidence-based and internationally recognized, and form the basis for the here presented \"Belgian Guidelines for the treatment of ARS in general practice\", developed by the sinusitis committee. This document is intended to establish evidence-based management procedures for ARS, one of the most frequent upper airway diseases, mostly treated by the general practitioner. It is recommended to treat ARS with topical glucocorticosteroids 200 mcg BID. Antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of severe ARS, if need be, together with topical glucocorticosteroids BID.","603":"To validate the Dutch and the French version of the Tinnitus Questionnaire and characterise the subscales. The original Tinnitus Questionnaire has already proven to be a usable measurement tool to discriminate complaining from non-complaining tinnitus patients and it provides differentiation into 5 dimensions. The English version of the TQ was used. The Dutch and the French version were obtained by the process of translation and back-translation. The TQ was assessed in 167 patients whose mother tongue was Dutch and who presented at the ENT department of the Antwerp University Hospital. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Factor analysis with Varimax oblique rotation was compared to the results from previous psychometric analysis of the original TQ. The internal consistency of the Dutch version of the TQ proved to be very high, with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.95. Independent factor analysis identified the five subscales in accordance with the Hiller and Goebel's findings: emotional and cognitive distress, intrusiveness, auditory perceptual difficulties, sleep disturbances and somatic complaints. The Dutch and the French translation of the TQ are included here. The psychometric characters of the Dutch questionnaire are similar to the original English questionnaire. This questionnaire provides appropriate disease-specific health-related quality-of-life outcome measures in tinnitus patients. In addition to the TQ, we advise the incorporation of three equal-appearing interval scales in all tinnitus anamnesis and follow-up. ","604":null,"605":"To evaluate the effect of Ericksonian therapy on tinnitus Non-randomised, prospective longitudinal study. Tertiary referral centre. A total of 49 patients underwent hypnosis therapy. Fourteen patients failed to finish the therapy (drop-out rate: 35%). Of the 35 patients who completed the therapy, 20 were male and 15 female. The average age was 46.3 years (range 17-78). The treatment is based on the principles and approaches of Ericksonian hypnosis. The first session was mainly dedicated to the evaluation of the impact of tinnitus on the patient's life and to an explanation of hypnosis therapy. The next sessions were \"learning sessions\" based on relaxation and mental imaging. Exercises were first based on all senses other than hearing. Then they focused on hearing, teaching patients how to modulate sound intensity, and finally how to modulate tinnitus intensity. Patients also learnt self-hypnosis. To evaluate the effect of the treatment, tinnitus was assessed with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory questionnaire before and after the therapy. After 5 to 10 sessions (mean: 8.09 + -1.92) of Ericksonian hypnosis therapy, the 35 patients were capable of self-hypnosis with the aim of modulating their tinnitus, and the measured THI score fell for all patients. The global score improved significantly from 60:23 before EH therapy to 16.9 at discharge. Within the group, the initial score was distributed as follows: 0% slight, 14% mild, 31% moderate, 31% severe and 23% catastrophic. The t-test for dependent variables revealed significant improvements in all subgroups (p &lt; or = 0.005). The results of this clinical trial demonstrate that Ericksonian hypnosis, in particular using self-hypnosis, is a promising technique for treating patients with tinnitus. ","606":"To assess the effect of hyperbaric oxygenation on tinnitus. A Medline search from 1960-2007 yielding 22 studies. No significant effect could be demonstrated in four prospective studies. Retrospective studies indicate greater improvement in tinnitus in acute cases (49-85%) compared with tinnitus episodes exceeding three months (34-38%). One study, however, showed significantly more improvement in patients with positive expectations before therapy (60.3%) compared with those with negative expectations (19%). There are no significant data about the effect of hyperbaric oxygenation for tinnitus, but there are indications of a better effect in acute cases. However, a major psychological component and a low risk of enhancement of the tinnitus should be considered. ","607":"We report on a novel treatment for tinnitus using phase-shift pure tone sound treatment in patients with predominantly pure tone tinnitus. Thirty-five patients with pure tone tinnitus unresponsive to all previous treatment were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated three times in one week. If the patient noticed an improvement, the therapy was continued for six weeks with a home device customised to their specific treatment frequency. Twenty-one of the 35 patients (60%) responded positively to the initial therapy sessions. Tinnitus was assessed before treatment, after three in-office Tinnitus Phase-Out System therapy sessions, and after six weeks of home use of the Patient Treatment Device. The assessment instruments were a VAS loudness scale and the quality of life Tinnitus Questionnaire. Significant tinnitus reduction was obtained on VAS after three office Tinnitus Phase-Out System therapy sessions (before treatment: mean VAS = 6.4; after three therapy sessions: mean VAS = 4.9; p = 0.042) and after six weeks of home use of the Patient Treatment Device (mean VAS = 4.9; p = 0.005). When analysing the mean TQ score over treatment, there was a significant improvement in total score from pretreatment (mean TQ score = 41.9) to six weeks after home use of the Patient Treatment Device use (mean TQ score = 36.4) (p = 0.003). In view of the results obtained, the Phase-Out Treatment for tinnitus may provide the majority of patients with a significant improvement in their symptoms. Further evaluation, comparing this specific Phase-Out Treatment with more general noise stimulation treatment, will further specify the indications for this treatment option.","608":"ENT practitioners are rarely confronted with tinnitus complaints from children. The present paper describes a literature review conducted in an attempt to identify possible reasons for this. Rather than applying the vast amount of information about tinnitus among adults, it seeks to highlight those domains where differences between children and adults are of importance.","609":"Tinnitus is a common condition affecting approximately 20% of the older population. There is increasing evidence that changes in the central auditory system following cochlear malfunctioning are responsible for tinnitus. To date, few investigators have studied the influence of genetic factors on tinnitus. The present report investigates the presence of a familial effect in tinnitus subjects. In a European multicentre study, 198 families were recruited in seven European countries. Each family had at least 3 siblings. Subjects were screened for causes of hearing loss other than presbyacusis by clinical examination and a questionnaire. The presence of tinnitus was evaluated with the question \"Nowadays, do you ever get noises in your head or ear (tinnitus) which usually last longer than five minutes\". Familial aggregation was tested using three methods: a mixed model approach, calculating familial correlations, and estimating the risk of a subject having tinnitus if the disorder is present in another family member. All methods demonstrated a significant familial effect for tinnitus. The effect persisted after correction for the effect of other risk factors such as hearing loss, gender and age. The size of the familial effect is smaller than that for age-related hearing impairment, with a familial correlation of 0.15. The presence of a familial effect for tinnitus opens the door to specific studies that can determine whether this effect is due to a shared familial environment or the involvement of genetic factors. Subsequent association studies may result in the identification of the factors responsible. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on the effect of role models in the treatment of tinnitus. ","610":"Studies of tinnitus are often conducted on patient populations presenting for treatment. It is, however, difficult to generalise prevalence numbers and aetiological results from these studies to a healthy, elderly population. The first aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of tinnitus in an otologically screened population between 55 and 65 years old. Secondly, both prevalence and the specific characteristics of tinnitus were compared in subjects with either a flat audiogram, a high-frequency gently sloping audiogram or a high-frequency steeply sloping audiogram. 1147 subjects (549 males and 598 females) were recruited through population registers and underwent thorough clinical and audiological examinations. Subjects who reported tinnitus in the general questionnaire about medical history and environmental exposure were invited to complete an additional questionnaire on tinnitus history. The prevalence of tinnitus was 19.3% according to the general questionnaire on medical health and environmental exposure and 11.8% according to the additional detailed tinnitus-specific questionnaire. Furthermore, our results indicate that gender has a significant effect (tinnitus is more common in males than in females), as does audiometric configuration (tinnitus is more common in subjects with a high-frequency steeply sloping audiogram than in subjects with a flat audiogram). Both effects were significant in noise-\/solvent-exposed subjects, as well as in non-exposed subjects. Finally, comparison of \"tinnitus characteristics\" in subjects categorised by audiogram configuration revealed significant differences in loudness, pitch, temporal variability and family history of tinnitus. ","611":"The place of MRI in the diagnostic work-up of patients with bilateral perceptive hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo is under discussion. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of MRI in patients with otovestibular and cranial nerve complaints of unknown aetiology. After thorough otologic examination, 430 patients were consecutively referred for an MR examination of the cerebellopontine angle. The detection rate for essential lesions was 4.9%. Two groups of retrocochlear lesions were frequently observed: central WMLs\/atrophy and neurovascular conflict affecting a cranial nerve. MR imaging of the cerebellopontine angle, fossa posterior and petrous bones makes it possible to observe abnormalities of the vestibulocochlear nerve and inner ear. Additional T2-weighted FSE images of the whole brain make it possible to evaluate the occurrence of early central lesions. This imaging protocol can diagnose essential lesions relating directly to the complaint in 4.9% of the patients with hearing loss, subjective tinnitus or vertigo. We frequently observed two groups of lesions of uncertain significance in our study population. WMLs are present in 50% of patients with a mean age of 59 years. In the younger subpopulation aged under 51 years the prevalence of WMLs is 24%. It remains unclear whether these lesions can be accounted for by the diversity of symptoms with which the patients presented. In addition, we found a high number of neurovascular conflicts involving different cranial nerves. ","612":"Tinnitus, or the phantom perception of sound, is one of the great unsolved problems of otology. It is present in all patients with hearing loss and, in approximately 5-10% of individuals, it has a significant impact on quality of life. Progress in the treatment of tinnitus has been limited by a lack of animal models that can be used to study the neurophysiology of tinnitus and to examine prospective treatment. In the last ten years, several physiological and behavioural animal models of tinnitus have been developed that have significantly increased our understanding. The next ten years will see the application of these models to drug development and electrical stimulus approaches to curing tinnitus.","613":"Large doses of aspirin produce reversible hearing loss and tinnitus. These effects have been attributed to the salicylate ion, the active component of aspirin. Salicylate acts as a competitive antagonist at the anion-binding site of prestin, the motor protein of sensory outer hair cells. This provides an explanation for the hearing loss induced by aspirin. However, the molecular mechanism of salicylate-induced tinnitus remains obscure. One physiological explanation is that salicylate ototoxicity is likely to originate in an alteration to arachidonic acid metabolism. Arachidonic acid potentiates NMDA receptor currents. We therefore tested the involvement of cochlear NMDA receptors in the occurrence of tinnitus. Tinnitus was assessed with a behavioural test based on an active avoidance paradigm. Results showed that the tinnitus induced by salicylate may be suppressed by the introduction of NMDA antagonists into the cochlear fluids. To determine if the activation of NMDA receptors was linked to cyclooxygenase inhibition, we investigated the effect of mefenamate (a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Since NMDA antagonists also blocked mefenamate-induced tinnitus, we suggest that salicylate-induced tinnitus is mediated by cochlear NMDA receptors through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Target cochlear NMDA receptors may therefore present a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of tinnitus.","614":"This article provides a clinical step-by-step approach for assessing a patient with tinnitus as primary complaint. The medical diagnosis of the disease provoking the tinnitus has to be made first in a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging. The psycho-acoustic characteristics and the influence on health-related quality of life is a compulsory complementary assessment to establish a complete picture of the patient.","615":"Tinnitus is presented in view of translational research from research to clinical application.","616":"The attested history of osteogenesis imperfecta began three thousand years ago and it continues down to the present day. Through the centuries, we find a dislocated mummy of a child of Ancient Egypt, a young Arab named Satib, a Viking prince known as \"Boneless\", a subject of Louis XIV with a broken skeleton and finally, in the 20th century, a young deaf mother with blue sclerotics and a jazz pianist unable to walk except on crutches... Without being exhaustive, this review of contrasting cases attests to the universality and to the permanency of this disease.","617":"Temporal bone tumours are rare head and neck cancers that may involve both the parotid and the neck. In cases with concomitant temporal bone and parotid tissue involvement, tumour origin determination can be challenging. A tumour with parotid and temporal bone involvement is usually of temporal origin. The tumour may also be a rare parotid neoplasm with intratemporal invasion through the facial nerve, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma. These are slow-growing, yet locally aggressive tumours marked by late-stage distant metastases. We describe a case of parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma invading the temporal bone via the facial nerve, presenting as primary temporal bone tumour with parotid tissue involvement. We emphasize the significance of intracranial involvement by perineural invasion. Tumours mimicking temporal bone neoplasms can originate from the parotid tissue and invade through the facial nerve. Preoperative fine needle biopsy evaluation is indispensable for malignancy type determination and surgical planning. ","618":"Sphenoid pyoceles with intracranial extension are extremely rare lesions that can mimic tumours and usually cause ophthalmological symptoms. Their infectious nature mandates urgent surgical decompression since pyoceles can cause intracranial and orbital complications. A 16-year-old male presented with intense headache and dizziness lasting three days. On admission, the patient gave a five-year history of chronic rhinitis, nasal congestion, and progressively worsening headaches. Ophthalmological examination was normal. CT and MR scans disclosed distension of the sphenoid sinus by a pyocele 55 mm in diameter, extending to the presellar region through the eroded cribriform plate. The patient underwent an endoscopic transnasal sphenoethmoidectomy. After surgery he reported improvement in all preoperative symptoms and was asymptomatic at 3-months follow-up. A huge sphenoid sinus pyocele with intracranial extension may cause no ophthalmological symptoms. It can be safely managed using endoscopic techniques. ","619":"Angiomatous polyps are the extremely rare variant of sinochoanal polyps that are characterised by dilated, large vascular spaces. A 27-year-old female patient presented with a three-month history of unilateral right-sided nasal obstruction and recurrent mild epistaxis. Paranasal computed tomography demonstrated a mass in the right maxillary sinus extending through the nasal cavity. It was resected with both endonasal endoscopic and Caldwell-Luc approaches. Histopathological examination identified an angiomatous nasal polyp. Follow-up of thirteen months showed no recurrence.","620":"Hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare vascular neoplasms that arise from the pericytes of Zimmerman. They account for 2-3% of all soft tissue sarcomas in humans and they occur mainly in the musculoskeletal system. 15 to 30% of all HPCs occur in the head and neck region. Only 5% are located in the sinonasal region, where they display a more benign behaviour than in other parts of the body. We will describe a case of a right-sided HPC, in the posterior third of the middle turbinate. We will also discuss the epidemiology, the macro- and microscopical characteristics, the clinical and pathological findings and the treatment of this particular neoplasia.","621":"Transnasal endoscopic orbital decompression is emerging as a new minimally invasive technique that avoids the need for cutaneous or gingival incision. This surgical approach appears to be a safe and effective procedure, even for the treatment of ocular disease, and it can be performed under general or local anaesthesia. The authors present a case of severe monolateral non-Graves' axial exophthalmos, accompanied by severe anisometropic myopia, which was treated successfully with functional endoscopic sinus surgery. The minimally invasive surgical procedure resulted in a marked reduction of exophthalmos without any severe complications and with minimal discomfort for the patient, who was discharged from hospital on the fourth postoperative day.","622":"The aim of this study is to report on ossicular necrosis in the middle ear occurring shortly after head injury. Our sample included 3 males and 2 females aged 9 to 37 years who complained of unilateral hearing loss after a head trauma that had occurred 3 to 6 months previously. The tympanic membranes were intact, and a CT-scan did not show fracture of the temporal bone. Audiometry showed a unilateral conductive hearing loss in all cases. On tympanotomy exploration, 4 of the 5 patients had a necrosis of the lenticular process of the incus and one patient had a necrosis of the posterior and anterior crura of the stapes. Additionally, the incus was displaced at the incudomalleolar joint towards the promontory in two patients. The long process of the incus was surgically aligned and adjusted to the head of the stapes through interposition of either temporal fascia or a bone chip. At the 2-year-postoperative follow-up, the pure tone audiometry showed that the preoperative air-bone gap was almost closed with a mean of 11.8 dB. It is possible that the head injury resulted in ossicular displacement in the middle ear with disturbance of the local vascular supply. Due to the tenuous blood supply to the lenticular and long processes of the incus, this portion of the ossicular chain, including the stapes suprastructure, may become more vulnerable to an ischemic process and subsequent necrosis shortly after the head trauma. ","623":"Myringosclerosis and atherosclerosis are two different pathologies seen in different parts of the body. Both of these occur following a similar physiopathological process. However this has not previously been adequately discussed in the literature. Trauma to either the tympanic membrane or to the intimal layer of the arterial wall results in the formation of a sclerotic plaque. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between myringosclerosis and atherosclerosis. A total of 421 patients with the diagnosis of coronary artery disease were included in the study. All of the patients were evaluated for the presence of atherosclerosis by coronary angiography and for myringosclerosis by otoscopic examination. The presence of myringosclerotic plaques, plaque dimensions and bilateral involvement of tympanic membranes were compared in the groups with and without atherosclerosis. Amongst the 316 patients (75.0%) shown to have atherosclerosis, 65 (20.5%) also had myringosclerosis. Amongst the 105 patients without atherosclerosis, 24 (22.8%) had myringosclerosis. There was no statistically significant relationship between atherosclerosis and myringosclerosis (p &gt; 0.05). Neither plaque dimensions nor bilateral involvement of the ears showed significant difference between the two groups (p &gt;0.05 and p &gt;0.05, respectively). We conclude that there is no similar genetic tendency between atherosclerosis and myringosclerosis. The significance of the plaque dimensions and the bilateral involvement of tympanic membranes have not been satisfactorily discussed in the literature and this is the first time that they are being addressed. In contrast to the reported articles, there is no relationship between atherosclerosis and myringosclerosis other than being similar pathological processes occurring as a result of endothelial-epithelial damage. ","624":"The aim of this study was to construct a rotational test protocol after exploring the stimulus parameters of the rotatory vestibular test. Twenty-four normal subjects were submitted to three different rotational paradigms: the sinusoidal harmonic acceleration test (SHAT), the pseudorandom rotation test (PRRT), and the velocity step test (VST). We investigated the influence of frequency and velocity on gain, phase and asymmetry values for the SHAT and the PRRT. In the case of the VST, we examined the influence of velocity and deceleration on gain, slow component velocity at deceleration, time constant, nystagmus preponderance, and time constant asymmetry. Frequency affected the SHAT response parameters, with significant phase differences between the frequencies 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 Hz, while velocity, if kept below 150 degrees\/s, had no influence on the results. In the case of the VST, responses were influenced by stimulus velocity and not by stimulus deceleration, with significantly higher gain values for the velocities 50 and 250 degrees\/s. A velocity of 50 degrees\/s tested at the frequencies 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 Hz was suggested for the SHAT and PRRT protocol, whereas a velocity of 100 degrees\/s with a deceleration of 200 degrees\/s2 was preferred for the VST. The relevance of this rotational protocol has yet to be established from patient data. ","625":"Standard rhinoplasty procedure involves bony profile alignment with an osteotome, followed by profile refinement with a manual rasp. The entire bony hump may sometimes be addressed with a rasp. Manual rasps and osteotomes, however, can be traumatic instruments, resulting in tissue oedema and bruising. The feather touch rasp is one of the powered instruments developed in recent years to improve precision and technical ease while preventing tissue trauma. The powered rasp has been frequently used at our department in the last eighteen months for hump reductions. Retrospective evaluation of 72 rhinoplasty procedures performed in 68 patients between January 2004 and June 2005. A bony hump reduction was necessary in 52 of the 68 patients. 60% of the patients were male. The mean age was 30 years. The open rhinoplasty technique was used in 65% of the patients. All humps were addressed with the feather touch rasp only. Patients were seen 10 days, 4 weeks and three months after surgery. In one patient the nasal dorsum remained too high. We found one asymmetric nasal dorsum. Another patient had a low nasofrontal angle, creating a false impression of a remaining hump. In two patients, bony irregularities appeared a few months after the rhinoplasty procedure. Overall, most patients were satisfied with the results of the hump reduction. The feather touch rasp makes safe and gradual bony hump reduction possible, with fragments being aspirated and the overlying skin being well protected. ","626":"Doctor Joseph Gensoul (1797-1858) has at least two claims to fame as an ENT physician: he was the first to practise the total resection of the superior maxillary bone, and he described a disease that was later to be known as \"Ludwig's angina\". In this paper, we try to project an original light on Gensoul by reference to Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880). We also look at how Flaubert's celebrity and Gensoul's glory fared differently.","627":"A case is presented in which a meningioma of the olfactory region caused olfactory loss as the only presenting symptom. Diagnosis was delayed by the presence of mild chronic sinusitis, presumed to have been responsible for the presenting hyposmia. The meningioma was initially not detected on a CT scan of the sinuses. A well conducted anamnesis and objective assessment of total anosmia through smell identification tests raised the suspicion of a sensorineural olfactory disturbance. The tumour was finally diagnosed on MR imaging. The paper discusses the practical management of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction.","628":"Antrochoanal polyps (ACP) are almost always unilateral. Only two bilateral cases have been reported to date, both of them in children. There have been no investigations of the aetiology of the bilateral occurrence of these lesions, possibly due to the rarity of bilateral ACPs. In this paper, we report on the first adult case of bilateral ACPs and review the literature.","629":"This paper presents a case of true silent right maxillary sinus associated with facial haemangiomae. A 45-year-old woman consulted an ophthalmologist for an asymptomatic \"sinking in\" of her right eye over a six-month period. Two venous haemangiomae were found: one in the right lower eyelid and one on the right of the upper lip. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a prominent right superior palpebral sulcus. Evaluation included computed tomography (CT) of the orbits, showing an increased right orbital volume and right maxillary sinusitis. The patient underwent a right endoscopic uncinectomy and maxillary antrostomy. The patient experienced a prompt resolution of the enophthalmos. Orbital implantation was not performed because the enophthalmos resolved spontaneously. No changes were observed during two years of follow-up.","630":"A choristoma is a tumour-like mass of normal cells in an abnormal location. Intra-oral choristomas are rare lesions. We report on two cases of cartilaginous choristoma, one in the tongue, the most frequently involved oral structure, and another in the upper oral vestibule. We discuss the lesion's clinical features and their differential diagnosis. The widely accepted metaplastic, embryonal and tumoral histopathologenetic theories are discussed. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, and no recurrence has been reported.","631":"Hydatid cysts in the neck are quite rare, even in areas where the disease is endemic. The role of radiological investigation is important and, in these cases, the involvement of other organs should be investigated. The cyst should be excised as a whole, without being ruptured, to prevent any treatment complications. This paper presents a case of an isolated hydatid cyst localised in the supraclavicular region without any pulmonary or hepatic involvement.","632":"To present the case of a patient with a large mucous cyst originating from the postcricoid region that was removed by radiofrequency excision. A 75-year-old male who complained of progressive difficulty in breathing, dysphonia, and throat discomfort upon swallowing presented at our clinic. Computerized tomography imaging showed a 4 x 4 x 3 cm cystic mass in the hypopharyngeal region. The patient had been on medical therapy for rheumatoid arthritis for 25 years, and his ability to extend his neck was totally restricted. Thus, the Kleinsasser operating laryngoscope could not be inserted; instead, the blade of a flexible intubation laryngoscope and a 30 degree rigid nasal endoscope was used to visualize the lesion. The walls of the cyst were excised from the postcricoid region using a radiofrequency device to avoid bleeding. Radiosurgery of these kinds of lesions produces less hemorrhage and may provide a suitable alternative to classical surgery. ","633":"To demonstrate the functional long-term results after reconstruction of the lower lip with the tongue flap. We describe the surgical technique and long-term results of lower lip reconstruction with the tongue flap and review five cases in which this technique was used to reconstruct defects of the lower lip, particularly the lip vermilion. Between 1993 and 2003 we performed reconstruction of the lower lip using the tongue flap in five patients. All patients were followed for 2 to 10 years (mean 3.4 years). The procedure achieved good functional and aesthetic results, with no major complications, in particular no flap necrosis. One patient complained of paresthesias of the tongue which resolved within 24 months. Speech was unaffected by use of the tongue flap, although eating and drinking were temporarily impaired prior to the flap separation at the second and final stage of surgery. The tongue flap is a simple and reliable technique for reconstruction of part or all of the lip vermilion. The technique is easy to perform and provides good aesthetic and functional results. ","634":"To report the radiographic and surgical findings, speech perception performance, and complications of cochlear implantation for patients who were affected by far-advanced otosclerosis. Five patients, 2 males and 3 females, with a family history of otosclerosis and who previously underwent stapedectomy to improve hearing were included in this study. CT scans of all ears were graded according to Rotteveel's grading system. All patients underwent cochlear implantation according to standard procedures. A control group of 10 non-otosclerotic postlingual implanted adults matched for age was used. On CT scanning, one patient had solely fenestral disease (type 1), 3 patients had localized retrofenestral disease (type 2), and 1 had diffuse retrofenestral disease with loss of the normal architecture of the cochlea (type 3). In all otosclerotic patients, the electrode array was fully inserted. However, in two patients (type 2 and 3) a thickened otic capsule was present and required more drilling than normal. One patient (type 3) experienced postoperatively facial nerve stimulation with normal fitting parameters. Otosclerotic patients showed excellent speech perception after implantation and obtained similar results to those achieved by the non-otosclerotic patients. Patients suffering from far-advanced otosclerosis may benefit from cochlear implantation and achieve speech performance scores comparable to non-otosclerotic implantees. Regarding surgery and facial nerve stimulation, attention should be taken to these cases in which the extension of otosclerosis is more severe on CT scanning (type 2 and mainly 3). Postoperative facial nerve stimulation can be managed successfully by resetting the current levels for comfort level. ","635":"Objective measurements do not evaluate the biopsychosocial impact of a voice disorder. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) measures the influence of voice problems on a patient's quality of life. To investigate if the VHI can monitor biopsychosocial impact of voice disorders and to provide a frame of reference for use of the VHI in general ENT practice. VHI scores and subscores were analysed in 272 controls, 237 patients with initial voice complaints (\"new patients\") and 92 patients before and after microsurgery (\"operated patients\"). The VHI scores of the controls were not normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: &lt; .001). The total VHI scores for the 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles were, respectively, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 6.0, 12.0, 23.0 and 32.8. In the controls, there was not a significant effect of gender on either VHI totals or subscores (p = 0.060-0.858). In the \"new patients\" group, males scored significantly higher on the functional subscore (p = 0.004). There was a very weak negative correlation between age and VHI totals and subscores in controls (correlation coefficient: -0.092 to -0.187). There was a significant difference in VHI totals and subscores between subjects with and without voice complaints (p &lt; 0.001). In the patient group, VHI scores of professional voice users (PVUs) were not significantly different from those of non-PVUs (p = 0.112-0.753). In controls, a significantly higher score was found for PVUs in the P domain of the VHI (p = 0.017). After microsurgical treatment, 82.0% of patients had a lower total VHI score, and 93.3% reported an improvement in voice. In the patient group, the median postoperative VHI score was almost halved. Gender and profession did not have a significant influence on the total VHI score. There was a weak tendency for VHI to decrease with age. The VHI is a useful instrument for quantifying the biopsychosocial impact of a voice disorder, and is able to monitor changes in self-perception of voice handicap after treatment.

Furthermore, as a consequence of his operation, Freud was required to wear a prosthesis that he probably named \"the monster\". This paper provides some details about the physicians who cured Freud and looks at the prosthesis he was forced to wear until his death.","638":"Reports indicate that the incidence of multiple primary tumours in head and neck cancers is high. However, most of these tumours are either metachronous primary or secondary tumours of the same histopathological type. The development of a synchronous primary squamous cell skin cancer of the nose and an in-situ vocal cord carcinoma is something unusual. We present the case of a patient with a primary neoplasm along the lateral side of the nose up to the bone of the pyramid, including the skin of the inner side of the nose and an infiltration of the inferior nasal concha on the right side, together with a small synchronous primary lesion of the left vocal cord. To the best of our knowledge the case described is the first in the English medical literature and we discuss the complete management of synchronous head and neck malignancies, emphasising the importance of panendoscopy in the prevention of pitfalls in diagnosis and the therapeutic procedure.","639":"Branchial cleft anomalies are developmental disorders of the neck. Our aim is to report the diagnostic and treatment procedure followed in three cases of second branchial cleft abnormalities in adults. A patient aged over 40 underwent surgical excision of a well-encapsulated cystic neck structure and two further patients of a branchial sinus and branchial fistula respectively. Prior to surgery the patients were assessed by means of imaging techniques, FNA cytology and cytometric DNA analysis. Neutrophils, debris, mature squamous epithelial cells including degenerate forms and lymphoid cells were the key features in the cytological diagnosis. DNA analysis of the pre-operative cytological material in two cases revealed euploidy, thus indicating no malignancy. Histological examination of the lesions after excision established the diagnosis in all cases. No recurrences were reported. Although congenital lesions, the second branchial cleft abnormalities usually present in adulthood and have to be distinguished from benign and malignant lateral neck swellings. FNA cytology as well as DNA ploidy determination contributes to the establishment of the diagnosis of branchial cleft abnormalities and their differential diagnosis. ","640":"Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a non-neoplastic fibro-osseous lesion. Paranasal sinus involvement is infrequent. Involvement of the frontal sinus, sphenoid sinus, and middle turbinate is rare, and only sporadic cases have been reported in the literature. Nasal turbinates and especially the inferior turbinate are the least involved bones of the craniofacial region. To the best of our knowledge, only one case with McCune-Albright syndrome had FD of the inferior turbinate. Here, we report a rare case with FD of inferior and middle turbinates and review literature concerning FD of the craniofacial region.","641":"Foreign bodies within the parotid gland retained after trauma are rarely observed, due in part to ease of detection. Few, however, particularly wooden foreign bodies, may not be identified clinically and radiologically. A 44-year-old male was admitted complaining of recurrent swelling and pain in the left parotid gland with recent history of penetrating parotid trauma and foreign body removal. Ultrasonography revealed a high degree of parenchymal heterogeneity and an 18 x 5.7 mm linear mass shadow. Following superficial parotidectomy, an approximately 1 x 2 cm wooden fragment that was buried in the masseter muscle and surrounded by granulation tissue was palpated and extracted. Any suspicion of a residual foreign body after penetrating parotid gland trauma can be clarified with a detailed radiological examination, which may provide further guidance for treatment. The treatment modality of parotid foreign bodies is early surgical exploration, and in delayed cases, superficial parotidectomy may be needed. ","642":"A case of metastatic carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (PA) of the submandibular gland is reported. While reports of local recurrence of this cancer are numerous, few cases of distant metastases have been reported. We report a case of a 52-year-old male patient with a history of PA diagnosed ten years previous. The patient presented reporting that the mass had increased size and pain during the previous six months. Needle biopsy results of this mass were compatible with a poorly differentiated carcinoma of the salivary ducts. Radical surgery with wide right neck dissection was performed with curative intent. Three years post-surgery liver and bony metastases were detected. In conclusion, the potential for malignant transformation of PA demands close follow-up of younger patients.","643":"Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland. We present a case of metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma (MPA). The patient died in 2002 at the age of 64 years, following on an initial diagnosis of a pleomorphic adenoma of the right parotid gland at the age of nineteen, multiple local recurrences and finally rib metastases. Histological examination of the excised tissue from the parotid gland and the metastases showed it to be a pleomorphic adenoma without any signs of malignancy, although the metastatic deposits consisted mostly of a myoepithelial component. Both in our case as in most of the literature, MPA follows a probable incomplete removal of the first tumour. We conclude that the first operation is of great importance for the prevention of late recurrences and metastatic spread.","644":"The effect of very low birth weight on otoacoustic emissions. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of very low birth weight (VLBW) on the measurement of transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) in newborns. TEOAEs were recorded in all VLBW newborns (birth weight &lt; 1500 g) who were admitted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Iaso Maternity Hospital, during a period of 1 year. Twenty-four VLBW newborns were included in the study. Their mean birth weight was 1283 g and they had mean gestational age 31.3 weeks. Forty full-term newborns with absence of any risk factor for hearing impairment were used as controls. TEOAEs were present in 97.5% of controls, but only in 79.2% of the VLBW group. Statistically significant differences were found between VLBW newborns and controls in most TEOAE measures. Increased rate of initial 'fail' in hearing screening, in conjunction with statistically confirmed lower TEOAE measures in VLBW newborns, justifies special care and long term follow-up for this group of newborns. ","645":"Today's indications for cochlear implantation. During the last twenty years, the indications for cochlear implants (CIs) extended significantly due to positive experience with CIs, improved CI technology, and safer surgery. This paper reviews the classical and emerging indications for CIs anno 2007. Providing a postlingually deaf adult with a unilateral CI has been the earliest indication and remains the standard indication. However, CIs are also indicated for prelingually deaf adults, and for children younger than one year old. Recently, CIs are also indicated for adults with residual hearing: when best aided sentence recognition scores in quiet are lower than 70%. CIs for patients with residual hearing sometimes imply the use of a bimodal CI; a device that stimulates the cochlea both electrically and acoustically. Another promising evolution is bilateral implantation. Nowadays, it has also become possible to place a CI in the malformed cochlea. When an auditory nerve is absent or when implantation failed despite a functional device, auditory brainstem implants can restore some form of hearing to the deaf.","646":"Comparing the microdebrider and standard instruments in endoscopic sinus surgery: a double-blind randomised study. It is frequently stated that microdebriders provide better mucosal preservation in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), and therefore better and faster healing, when compared to the standard Blakesley instruments. However, evidence from comparative prospective studies is lacking. In this study, we compared the results of microdebriders with traditional surgical instruments for ESS. A prospective, randomised, comparative, double-blind study in 50 patients undergoing bilateral ESS. Each patient was operated on with both instruments: one side of the nose with the microdebrider only, and the other side with standard instruments. The outcome of surgery was measured by using a symptom score and an endoscopic score at five time points during the first six postoperative months. Both instruments resulted in symptom improvement and in endoscopically visible healing over time, but no significant difference was found between the two techniques. In endoscopic evaluation, only the total score at 3 weeks after surgery was significantly better in the microdebrider group. No significant difference was found at any other time point. Synechia formation, patency of middle meatal antrostomy, and open access to the ethmoid were the same in both groups. In this study of endoscopic sinus surgery the use of the microdebrider does not offer major advantages compared to the standard instruments.

In this article, the general and specific characteristics of the nose of the unilateral and the bilateral cleft patient are described, and careful preoperative assessment is emphasized. Considerations concerning the timing of the operation before or after the puberty growth spurt are discussed. Guidelines are given for a systematic correctional surgical approach, dividing the operative procedure into septal surgery, tip surgery, osseo-cartilaginous vault surgery, maxillary augmentation and alar base reallocation. A description is given of special postoperative care with a custom-made vestibular device to prevent stenosis of the vestibulum and deformation of the nasal tip caused by scar tissue retraction in the postoperative period.","649":"Middle ear disease is a frequent problem in young children with cleft palate (CP). Less is known about otological status in the adolescent CP population. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of current knowledge in the literature concerning the aetiology of middle ear disease in CP patients and the middle ear status of older children with CP, and to compare the situation in our centre to this background through an assessment of the otological status of patients in our CP population. A literature review was conducted to summarise current knowledge about middle ear status in CP patients. A retrospective analysis was performed of the medical records of 20 CP patients between the ages of 10 and 15 who were treated and followed at the University Hospitals Leuven. The available otological data, otoscopic findings, information about hearing and surgery performed was collected for each patient when aged three and above ten years. Current knowledge indicates that middle ear function improves as CP patients get older. In our study, otoscopic appearance was acceptable in 63% of ears of children aged over ten years of age. Otitis media with effusion (OME) was far less frequent above this age than around the age of 3, with a decrease from 50% to 13% of all ears. Above the age of 10, tympanic perforations were present in 13% of ears and retraction of the tympanic membrane in 23%. Despite a very high incidence of OME in young CP patients, the long-term otological prognosis is not necessarily sinister. A favourable natural evolution, diligent otological follow-up, early diagnosis and treatment of middle ear disease with the use of tympanostomy tubes are the likely contributors to the acceptable otological result in older CP patients. ","650":"Velopharyngeal insufficiency is the main morbidity associated with clefting of the secondary palate. Therefore, it is important to monitor speech production in all children with a history of cleft palate. Diagnosis and management of velopharyngeal insufficiency is an important function of the cleft palate team. The surgical approach used in the Craniofacial Center at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, USA is presented. Assessment of velopharyngeal function, as it relates to surgical intervention and measurement of outcome, is reviewed. Surgical management using Furlow palatoplasty and sphincter pharyngoplasty is discussed.","651":"This paper presents an assessment protocol for the evaluation and description of speech, resonance and myofunctional characteristics commonly associated with cleft palate and\/or velopharyngeal dysfunction.

These problems are mainly present in childhood but remain a matter of concern for many years. Speech and language pathologists are involved in speech and language assessment and speech therapy procedures. This article gives an overview of the standard procedures of the speech pathologist in a cleft palate team and discusses the relationship between the team and private practices or school teams, as well as the practical aspects relating to reimbursement by the National Institute of Health and Invalidity (RIZIV).","653":"Patients with orofacial clefts need multidisciplinary care, which should be provided by teams of specialists working in this field. Usually the following disciplines participate in such teams: paediatrics, plastic and reconstructive surgery, orthodontics, genetics, social work or nursing, ENT, speech therapy, maxillofacial surgery, prosthetic dentistry, psychology and oral hygiene. Narrative review. An overview is given of the orthodontic treatment protocol and the role of the orthodontist in cleft palate treatment from birth until 20 years of age for a child with a complete unilateral or bilateral cleft. The orthodontist has proven to be an essential partner in the cleft palate team. The orthodontist is not only responsible for the active orthodontic and facial orthopaedic treatment of the child with a cleft. More importantly, he or she is also the guardian of the child's maxillofacial growth. By nature, orthodontists have a long-term treatment perspective in mind, which will assist the team in their consideration of treatment techniques, sequence and timing in relation to the effect on maxillofacial growth. Moreover, standardised records collected by the orthodontist provide a valuable basis for retrospective studies of treatment outcome and inter-centre comparisons. Finally, in recent times, orthodontists seem to be quite often the motor behind large-scale inter-centre randomised clinical trials in the field of CLP. ","654":"We describe the way our multidisciplinary team manages cleft lips and palates at our centre at the Catholic University of Louvain. Since 1987, we have opted for the neonatal repair of the cleft lip and nose, and closure of the cleft palate at three months of age. Multidisciplinary follow-up then takes place to detect and correct the sequellae. The children are seen once a year by a plastic surgeon, an otorhinolaryngologist, a maxillofacial surgeon, a speech therapist, an audiologist, and an orthodontist. Secondary corrections are scheduled depending on functional, aesthetic, and psychological requirements.","655":"The purpose of this retrospective of prospectively acquired data was to evaluate and to compare global evolution in children with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate treated at the Brussels cleft centre following two different surgical treatment protocols. A series of forty-four patients operated for non-syndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate were included in this study at the age of approximately ten years. Twenty-six children (17 males, 9 females) were treated according to the Malek surgical treatment protocol: the soft palate was closed at a mean age of 3 months, followed by simultaneous repair of the lip and hard palate at a mean age of 6 months. Eighteen children (15 males, 3 females) underwent one-stage \"all-in-one\" closure of the lip, hard and soft palate at a mean age of 3 months. Craniofacial morphology was evaluated by means of digital lateral cephalometric analysis. Cephalometric data were compared to a control, non-cleft group (n = 40) matched according to age. Data concerning otological status and speech were collected in the same series of children. Statistical analysis showed that the inclination of the maxillary (MxPVSN) plane to the anterior cranial base was significantly increased (p &lt;0.001) in both cleft groups compared to the non-cleft group and significantly increased (p = 0.002) in the Malek cleft group compared to the \"all-in-one\" cleft group. Otological status was not improved by an early complete closure but by close follow-up and the repeated placement of ventilating tubes. Speech was found to be satisfactory in the majority of children of both groups at six years after speech therapy. Only 15% needed further surgery with pharyngeal flaps. There were no significant differences in anteroposterior midfacial morphology between the Malek and \"all-in-one\" protocols at ten years of age. One-stage \"all-in-one\" closure resulted in less downward inclination of the maxillary plane to the anterior cranial base compared to the Malek protocol at ten years of age. Early complete closure of the cleft resulted in no significant change in otological status or the occurrence of nasality. However, early complete closure of the cleft allowed for earlier intelligibility of speech compared to the staged later closure. ","656":"From 1989 to 1993, 113 previously untreated patients were admitted to the Multi-disciplinary Cleft Lip and Palate Team of the University Hospitals Leuven. Palate repair was performed in our centre by one surgeon (FO) in 88 patients. Our current surgical technique consists of a single-stage supraperiosteal retropositioning (modified Veau-Wardill-Kilner) for patients with a soft cleft palate only (SCP) or a soft cleft palate with up to 1 cm of the hard palate (HSCPpa). Patients with a larger or complete cleft of the secondary hard palate (HSCP) and patients with unilateral (UCLP) or bilateral (BCLP) cleft lip and palate undergo two surgical stages for palate closure: a supra-periosteal retropositioning is performed around 12 months of age, and a modified Langenbeck closure of the hard palate around 60 months of age. To assess velopharyngeal function with speech as outcome measure. Velopharyngeal function was assessed in two ways. In one assessment, a \"hard\" outcome measure was the number of patients undergoing pharyngoplasty following palate repair in our centre (n = 88). In the other assessment, velopharyngeal function was evaluated in a homogeneous sub-population of 44 non-syndromic cleft patients with normal to slight impairment of the following functions: mental development, language development, and hearing. In this group, prospectively collected data about hypernasality and nasal emission were analysed retrospectively using a semi-objective nasality index (NI). Articulation was evaluated using a subjective articulation index (AI) representing articulation errors (retro-articulation, glottal stops and facial grimacing) associated with velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). Mean follow-up was 114 months. Despite rigid assessment by a phoniatrician and speech pathologist, only 1 patient out of 88 patients with soft palate surgery in our institution was thought to need pharyngoplasty. In the sub-cohort of 44 non-syndromic patients, nobody needed a pharyngoplasty. In the latter cohort, at the age of about eight years, 27 patients (61.5%) had undetectable nasality, 13 patients (29.5%) had an NI of 1 or \"mild\" nasality, and 4 patients (9%) had moderate nasality. At this point in time, articulation errors associated with VPI were noted in 14% of patients. In this subgroup of cleft palate patients treated following the Leuven protocol, there was no need for secondary pharyngoplasty. Ninety-one per cent of patients had no, or only mild, rhinolalia aperta by the age of eight years, and 84% did not display VPI-related articulation disorders. This suggests that velopharyngeal function in patients treated by this protocol is excellent compared to results in the literature. ","657":"The aim of cleft palate surgery is to minimise damage which results in impaired maxillary growth, and to maximise outcome in terms of velopharyngeal function. Techniques developed by the author, building on work by many and employed by the North Thames Cleft Lip and Palate Centre at Great Ormond Street Hospital\/St Andrew's Centre (GOStA) appears to offer one way of achieving these aims.

Prevalence varies between populations, with an average of 1\/700. CL\/P has a major clinical impact, requiring surgical, dental, orthodontic, speech, hearing and psychological management throughout childhood. The aetiology of CL\/P is mostly unknown, and it is thought that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Several causative genes for inherited syndromic forms of CL\/P have been identified, and some recent studies have shown that these genes also contribute to the occurrence of isolated forms. Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is one of the best models for non-syndromic CLP. It is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by the presence of pits on the lower lip in addition to CL\/P. Pits are the only feature distinguishing VWS from isolated clefts. Interestingly, in numerous VWS patients, the lip pits are very small and not readily diagnosed, thus mimicking isolated CL\/P. Mutations in the IRF6 gene were shown to be the major genetic cause of VWS.' We performed direct sequence analysis of IRF6 on samples from a large European cohort and identified mutations in 27 (80%) families. This shows that IRF6 is the major causative gene of VWS in Europe also. Moreover, it is the gene to study when a seemingly isolated CL\/P patient has minor signs, such as lip pits, since the identification of a mutation in IRF6 is associated with an increase in the risk of having a child with CL\/P from 4-6%, the risk of transmission of an isolated cleft, to 50%, the risk of transmission of a dominant Mendelian disorder like VWS. Moreover, we studied the association of isolated CL\/P with the IRF6 locus using two variants in a set of 195 patients from Belgium. As in an American study, a clear association was observed. This suggests that IRF6 also contributes to the occurrence of sporadic, isolated CL\/P, even if no mutation in the gene can be identified in such patients. In conclusion, genes that are mutated in familial syndromic forms of CL\/P may be predisposing genetic factors to sporadic isolated CL\/P. Due to technological advances and the availability of the human genome sequence, we have now the opportunity to try and unravel the genetic factors behind the various forms of CL\/P.

Recently, SFTs have been found in various extra-serosal locations, including the head and neck region. We report a case of SFT originating from the periorbital region of the face. Preoperative cytological examination by fine needle aspiration biopsy diagnosed a mesenchymal tumour. The patient underwent surgical resection. The mass was completely resected. Definitive histopathologic and immunohistologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of SFT. The rare localisation in extrapleural sites and the multiplicity of histological patterns can explain the difficulty in arriving at a definitive diagnosis in SFT. Usually, SFT is a benign tumour, although malignant variants exist. Clinical behaviour is unpredictable and recurrence or malignant transformation can also occur, especially in cases with macroscopically or microscopically invaded margins. Complete surgical excision and long follow-up is therefore always recommended. The recent increase in reports of extrapleural SFT indicates that this rare tumour should be included in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue head and neck tumours. ","666":null,"667":"Iatrogenic epidermal cysts have been reported in various locations following otological surgical procedures. Especially after endaural incisions, surgeons may implant squamous epithelium into underlying tissue. An epidermal cyst of the parotid region may appear years after ipsilateral ear surgery. A cystic lesion in the superficial lobe of the parotid gland was identified by computed tomography and ultrasonography in a 30-year-old man with a history of myringoplasty and endaural surgery. A superficial parotidectomy was performed to remove the mass. The mass was histopathologically diagnosed as an epidermal cyst. If a cystic lesion is present in the parotid gland in a patient with a history of otologic surgery, it must be considered that the mass is of epidermal origin. ","668":"About 70 to 80 percent of all salivary gland neoplasms, the majority of which are benign, arise in the parotid gland. Sclerosing Polycystic Adenosis (SPA) is a relatively unknown and newly described entity that is considered to be benign in nature. A 55-year-old patient was treated for SPA in our hospital. The diagnostic work-up consisted of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and histological examination. However, in our case, both the cytological appearance, which usually has a high accuracy in discriminating benign from malignant lesions, and the appearance on MR images, mimicked a malignant tumour. This case report illustrates the importance of an adequate histological confirmation of the work-up diagnosis.","669":"Castleman's disease (CD) is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by enlarged hyperplastic lymph nodes. We describe a patient who was found to have Castleman's disease as the cause of a parotid mass. The mass was the hyaline vascular type. After surgical excision of the largest masses on the right side, the patient was followed up for 6 months. Another mass in the left parotid region also became larger and was excised, with the pathological examination demonstrating Castleman's disease. Although rare in the head or neck region, Castleman's disease should be considered when investigating head-neck diseases. ","670":"A seventeen-year-old girl presented with acute otitis media, unilateral miosis and ptosis (partial Horner's syndrome) and tenderness of the ipsilateral jugular vein. A culture of the otorrhoea showed Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A CT scan revealed an infiltrate near the ipsilateral carotid artery and jugular vein. The patient was hospitalised and treated with antibiotics. Clinical signs disappeared within 6 days. This report discusses the first case with a partial Horner's syndrome as an unusual complication of acute otitis media (AOM). Imaging studies suggest extracranial lymphatic spread of the infection along the adjacent jugular vein causing pressure on the postsynaptic sympathetic fibres. Recognition of the Horner's syndrome is of importance because it may be an early sign of an extracranial complication of AOM.","671":"This article describes the technique and the preliminary results of transcanal myringoplasty for small or midsized tympanic membrane perforations with the Tutopatch (Tutogen Medical, Inc., Alachua, FL, USA), a xenograft derived from bovine pericardium. All procedures started with a Rosen incision. The meatal skin was loosened from the bone up to the fibrous annulus, which was dislocated out of the sulcus, and the tympanic membrane was elevated from the malleus handle. The Tutopatch was placed over the malleus handle, the annulus, and the denuded bone. Eleven patients were included, and follow-up ranged from 3 to 14 months. Ten of the eleven eardrums were successfully closed. One patient developed myringitis 2 months after the procedure. The average air-bone gap at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, of all but one patient was less than 10 dB. When anatomically feasible, a transcanal myringoplasty with a Tutopatch graft yields similar audiological results compared to fascia temporalis, perichondrium or tragal perichondrium-cartilage, but reduces the surgical trauma, the complications of the autograft harvesting, and the negative cosmetic and psychological impact of this procedure. ","672":"Endodontic infections of posterior maxillary teeth sometimes spread to the maxillary sinus, generating severe complications. The aim of this study is to present the various problems encountered during endodontic treatment of these teeth. The files of 125 cases of odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis were reviewed retrospectively. Chronic apical periodontitis was the cause in 99 cases and traumatising endodontic treatment in 26 cases. Foreign intra-sinusal bodies were occasionally seen as a consequence of different endodontic treatments of posterior maxillary teeth. A knowledge of dento-antral relationships is particularly important in the prevention of sinusal accidents and complications during various therapeutic manoeuvres, which should be performed according to and depending on the regional morphology. ","673":"To evaluate the prevalence of humoral immunodeficiency in patients with refractory rhinosinusitis. All patients with refractory rhinosinusitis, who were treated at or referred to the ENT Dept of the University Hospital in Leuven between January 2002 and December 2004, were retrospectively identified. Patient charts that contained information on humoral immunity testing were selected to calculate the prevalence of IgA deficiency, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and IgG2\/3 subclass deficiency. A total of 307 subjects (261 adults and 46 children) were included. Overall, 67 patients (21.8%) with refractory rhinosinusitis had laboratory evidence of a humoral immunodeficiency. We found an IgA deficiency in 7 patients (2.2%); CVID was not found in any patient (0%); IgG2 subclass deficiency in 6 patients (2.0%) and IgG3 subclass deficiency in 55 patients (17.9%). Nine patients (2.9%) had combined deficits of major and\/or subclass serum immunoglobulin levels. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of humoral immunodeficiency between adults and children. Humoral immunodeficiency is present in a significant proportion of patients with refractory rhinosinusitis. The majority of these deficiencies are subtle IgG subclass deficits, whereas more severe humoral immune disorders are a rare finding. A laboratory evaluation of humoral immune function, including measurement of serum levels of IgA, total IgG and IgG subclasses, should be part of the evaluation of patients with refractory rhinosinusitis.

Virtual reality may be an interesting new way of studying vestibular compensation in normal and pathological conditions.","676":null,"677":"Thornwaldt's cyst is a relatively rare lesion located in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Most are small and asymptomatic whereas some cause nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, occipital headache or Eustachian tube dysfunction. Nasal endoscopy is the easiest way to visualize this during a routine ENT examination. If in any doubt, MRI is the most sensitive method for detecting and evaluating its size, its anatomic relationships and its content. When the lesion is large, symptomatic or close to the Eustachian tube torus, surgery by marsupialization is the treatment option. For small lesions, the endonasal approach is recommended but for large lesions, a transoral retrovelar approach using a 70 degree telescope is the method of choice. The powered instrumentation with a specific blade for adenoid resection permits large marsupialization with minimal trauma and bleeding and excellent postoperative results. The authors present their experience and review the relevant literature.","678":"New entities, such as 'subclinical' over- and undersubstitution, are easily diagnosed after thyroid surgery due to improved testing methods, and the incidence of thyroidectomy with lifelong hormone substitution is increasing. Thus, there is a need to review conventional replacement therapy after thyroid surgery. We investigated the adequacy of our thyroid hormone replacement therapy for three months after total-, subtotal-, and hemithyroidectomy using an upper reference limit of thyrotropin (TSH) of 4.6 mU\/L. Eighty-seven patients undergoing thyroidectomy for benign thyroid pathology participated. Levothyroxine (L-T4) treatment began five days after surgery. Preoperatively euthyroid patients received 150 microg L-T4 daily following total thyroidectomy, 100 microg L-T4 after subtotal thyroidectomy, and 50 microg L-T4 after hemithyroidectomy. Preoperatively hyperthyroid patients received 100 microg L-T4 following total thyroidectomy and 50 microg L-T4 following subtotal thyroidectomy. An average of six weeks after surgery, thyrotropin (TSH) was measured (reference limits 0.15-4.60 mU\/L), and necessary dose adjustments were made. Of the patients who were preoperatively euthyroid, 45% with total thyroidectomy, 42% with subtotal thyroidectomy, and 17% with hemithyroidectomy required L-T4 dose adjustments. Of the patients who were preoperatively hyperthyroid, 60% of those with total thyroidectomy and all of those with subtotal thyroidectomy required L-T4 dose adjustments. To avoid over- and undersubstitution after thyroidectomy, an optimal replacement therapy dose is necessary. A small majority of our preoperatively euthyroid patients received adequate therapy. Endocrinological follow-up six weeks after surgery revealed the need for L-T4 dose adjustments, especially in preoperatively hyperthyroid patients. When the extent of resection was similar for hyperthyroid and euthyroid patients, the same initial dose of L-T4 was justified. ","679":"The chondrosarcoma of the larynx is an exceptionally rare tumour. It appears mainly in white men in their 7th decade. The most significant clinical manifestation is hoarseness accompanied at times by stridor. It involves mainly the cricoid cartilage and the treatment of choice is surgical excision. A case of a large tumour of the cricoid cartilage is described. The diagnostic work-up consisted of two minor operations for biopsies and an MRI scan prior to the patient being treated with total laryngectomy.","680":"Ectopic lingual thyroid is an uncommon embryological aberration characterised by the presence of thyroid tissue located in a site other than the normal, pretracheal region. The tongue is the most frequent ectopic location of the thyroid gland; the clinical incidence of lingual thyroid varies between 1:3000 and 1:10,000. We present a new case of lingual thyroid in a 10-year-old child who presented dysphagia. The radiological findings and the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. As the mass was well tolerated, surgery was not indicated. At this time, there are no signs of complications or malignant transformation.","681":"Salivary gland cysts can be benign or malignant. Salivary duct cysts are benign tumours that occur mainly in the parotid gland and represent 10% of all salivary gland cysts. We report the case of a 48-year-old man who presented with a painless preauricular mass on the right side. Superficial parotidectomy was performed based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathologic examination of the specimen revealed a parotid duct cyst. Here we report clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of the case as well as a review of the literature.","682":"PROBLEM\/OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety of tonsillectomy as a one-day procedure, we retrospectively evaluated complications of tonsillectomy within two weeks after surgery. The study included 1977 patients; 85% of the tonsillectomies were performed as a one-day procedure. Tonsillectomies were performed in Ziekenhuis Oost Limburg by one staff ENT and seven ENT residents between January 1, 1996 and January 1, 2005. We also reviewed the number of tonsillectomies performed as day surgery and their complication rate for Belgium, based on the National Office for Health and Disability Insurance billing, comparing our series with the number of tonsillectomies as day-case surgeries and their complication rate for Belgium. In our study, 26 patients (1.3%) consulted within two weeks of surgery for major or minor complications secondary to tonsillectomy. The only major complication was primary bleeding (bleeding within 24 hours after tonsillectomy), which occurred in five patients, all of whom received a revision for haemostasis. No patient required transfusion. Minor complications (21 patients) were secondary bleeding, fever, and anorexia. During the study period, there were 214,524 tonsillectomies performed in Belgium. Based on invoice information, 4676 cases of postoperative bleeding occurred, requiring a revision for haemostasis. In our centre and generally for Belgium, there was an increase in tonsillectomies as an outpatient procedure without an increase in incidence of subsequent bleeding. Day-case surgery tonsillectomy incidence had risen from 36% in 1996 to 64% in 2004 in Belgium. Considering the low bleeding and complication rates, tonsillectomy can safely be performed as a day-case surgery. ","683":"There is still no consensus regarding the necessity of sending every tonsil specimen for histological examination following tonsillectomy. To add to this discussion, we assessed the incidence of preoperatively unexpected malignancy in the postoperative tonsil specimens of adults and children in our ENT department. We conducted a retrospective study of the histopathology results of all patients who underwent tonsillectomy between January 1999 and February 2006 in the ENT department of East Limburg Hospital in Genk. The charts of patients with postoperative histopathological malignancy were further analysed and reviewed for preoperative indications of the tonsillectomy and for preoperative suspicion of malignancy. A total of 2989 patients were included in the study: 2058 children (defined as 16 years or younger) and 931 adults. No malignancy was found among the children. In 20 adults, malignancy was diagnosed, but in all cases there was a preoperative suspicion of malignancy. No patient without preoperative risk factors was found to have malignancy on pathological evaluation of the tonsils. Our results indicate that routine histopathological examination of tonsils removed for benign disease in adults and children is clinically unnecessary. We propose that on an individual basis, the surgeon should decide the need for histological examination depending on preoperative risk factors and peroperative gross examination. Such a strategy will only be medicolegally possible where there are national and scientifically (evidence)based ENT consensus reports or guidelines on this issue.

We present here Breschet's defence.","686":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of actinomyces in adenotonsillar disease, recurrent infections, or tonsillar hypertrophy in children. The study included 64 patients, ranging in age from 2 to 16 years, who had elective adenotonsillar surgery to treat either adenotonsillar hypertrophy (36 children) or recurrent adenotonsillitis (28 children). Adenotonsillar Actinomyces was present in 30 children (48%). No statistical significance was found between Actinomyces and recurrent adenotonsillitis or adenotonsillar hypertrophy. However, there was a statistically significant relationship identified between the presence of actinomycosis and age, with a greater occurrence of actinomycosis in children between 5 and 16 years old.","687":"Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare extra-pulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis, and frequently presents with tumour-like symptoms and clinical findings. Uncommon clinical features are to be expected by the ENT specialist, who should be aware of these recently changing presentations. Despite the dramatic reduction of the incidence of the disease during the last few decades, a perceptible increase in case reports has lately been noted and may prove significant. Treatment remains conservative and long-term follow-up is suggested. A relevant case of laryngeal tuberculosis presenting as a supraglottic carcinoma is presented, its diagnosis and management are detailed, and suggestions are offered based on a literature review.","688":"\"He had the form of a human being...

The objective of this study was to calculate measurement error and test-retest reliability of the Dutch version of the DHI. The translation into Dutch was performed according to a double translation method. One hundred and six patients with balance problems (range 26-78 years), scheduled for vestibular rehabilitation, completed the DHI on two occasions on the same day. The test-retest reliability was excellent, with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 for DHI sub-scores and DHI total score. Most weighted kappa values (kappaW) exceeded 0.80 indicating substantial item per item test-retest reliability. Over 80% agreement was noted for all items except for item 8 (74%). Item 8 asks whether the subject feels dizzy or unsteady while doing ambitious activities like sports, dancing and household activities. Consequently measurement errors were calculated, suggesting that, after an intervention, the pretreatment DHI total score should at least decrease with 12 points (lower bound 99% confidence interval for a true change) before the intervention could be said to be effective for an individual patient. Based on these data, the Dutch version of the DHI showed itself to be a highly reliable instrument to assess the self-perceived handicap imposed by vestibular system diseases.","690":"We investigated the effect of secondary hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) for patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss after unsuccessful conventional treatment. We retrospectively evaluated 3 groups: 100 patients without further treatment (group 1), 160 patients with secondary HBO at 1.5 ATA (group 2), and 56 patients with secondary HBO at 2.5 ATA (group 3). In group 1, a mean hearing gain (MHG) of 2.6 +\/- 15 dB was found at the end of the follow-up period. After HBO, a MHG of 3.1 +\/- 9 dB in group 2 and 19.7 +\/- 23 dB in group 3 was achieved. The results in group 3 were statistically significant in comparison to group 1 (p &lt; 0.007) and to group 2 (p &lt; 0.009). With HBO after initial therapy failure, there is a significant correlation of MHG with time delay before HBO (p &lt; 0.03). HBO at 2.5 ATA in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss after unsuccessful conventional treatment yields significant improvement of hearing. MHG is higher when time delay before HBO is shorter. ","691":"We retrospectively studied outcome of a sample of 36 congenitally deaf children who were fitted with either a conventional hearing aid (HA, N = 14) or a cochlear implant (CI, N = 22), and who received many years of audio-phonatory training by our multi-disciplinary team. In order to rate speech discrimination perception, we developed a new metric of speech discrimination performance based on several existing discrimination tests for the French language. Speech perception skills were measured with and without lip-reading cues. We also studied the evolution of auditory capacity in real-life situations, and the evolution of the intelligibility of spoken language during a five year period. To rate auditory capacity and speech intelligibility, we used commonly used metrics: CAP and SIR. During the five successive years of observation, CAP and SIR scores improve for both the HA and CI children. Improvement, however, is more pronounced for the CI children. At the end of the 5-years period, CAP and SIR scores of CI children are significantly higher than those of HA children. Our study is one of few that evaluates outcome of HA and CI fitting with age matched congenitally deaf children anno 2000.","692":"The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of levocetirizine in the treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) in patients consulting their primary care doctor. Open-label uncontrolled and non-randomised multi-centre study including patients presenting symptoms of SAR and treated with levocetirizine tablets, 5 mg OD, for 4 weeks. patients with nasal symptoms who were not on treatment or not responsive to treatment, or affected by excessive adverse events due to the antihistamines used previously. There were two visits (initial and after four weeks). Primary end point: efficacy as measured by T4SS (combined score of sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal and ocular pruritus, ranging from 0 to 12 recorded by the patient); change in Clinical Global Impression (CGI-c) as rated by the general practitioner, subjective satisfaction with and preference for levocetirizine. Secondary end points: treatment-related adverse events. 1290 patients were evaluated. Before the start of the study, 61.2% did not use any medication, 36.4% took anti-histamines which were not effective, and 27.0% of those previously treated patients experienced excessive adverse events. Statistically significant decreases (p &lt; 0.01) compared to baseline were observed for each individual symptom of the itemised T4SS as well as for the global T4SS. The CGI-c improved in 91.1% of the patients who had received treatment previously and 96.8% of those who had not. Of the patients who had received treatment previously, 91.7% (p &lt; 0.01) were satisfied with the study treatment and 84.5% of these patients reported they would prefer levocetirizine in future. All adverse events (somnolence, fatigue, headache, dry mouth) decreased by comparison with previous treatments after levocetirizine was used. Levocetirizine showed an improvement in symptom control for SAR and was preferred by patients compared to the antihistamines they had taken previously. Levocetirizine was well tolerated. ","693":"We report our experience treating papillomatosis of the larynx using CO2 laser which has a lower risk of post surgical complications. Papillomatosis has a high incidence of recurrence after surgical treatment. We treated 42 patients (10 adults and 32 children) affected by multiple papillomatosis of the larynx. Smaller papillomas were vaporized with a 7-8 Watt CO2 laser and larger papillomas were resected at the base of their implantation. A strict follow-up during the first 3 years after surgical treatment was necessary to manage recurrences with CO2 laser endoscopy. All patients presented with recurrences after the first surgical treatment, but within 18-60 months all patients presented a solution of their pathology. Post-operative complications were observed in patients who did not comply with the strict follow-up protocol and presented with large lesions requiring more invasive surgery. CO2 laser endoscopy, although it did not prevent recurrences of papillomatosis in the larynx, is a valid surgical approach in the management of this pathology. ","694":"A comparative assessment of toxic element concentrations in serum and tissue bioptates in patients with laryngeal papilloma or cancer was performed. Examinations were conducted in 60 patients (40 men and 20 women) aged 20-88 years (average 59 +\/- 05). Patients were divided into 3 groups; 20 patients with laryngeal papilloma were in group I, 20 with laryngeal cancer were in group II, and 20 with deviated nasal septums were included as a control group (III). Diagnosis of laryngeal papilloma (removed by direct microlaryngoscopy--Kleinsasser method) and laryngeal cancer (removed by the Rethi method) was histopatologically confirmed in patients from groups I and II, respectively. Patients in the control group received functional surgery to repair deviated nasal septums. Serum and tissue samples were obtained from all patients before surgery. Aluminum and lead concentrations were analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) using a Spectroflame M spectrometer. The considerable rise of aluminum and lead concentration in tissue bioptates and aluminum in serum in groups I and II in comparison to the control group suggests that these elements may play a significant part in the aetiology and development of precancerous lesions and laryngeal cancers. Measuring toxic chemical element concentrations in tissue bioptates can be useful in the diagnosis and estimation of development of precancerous lesions of the larynx as well as laryngeal cancer. Toxic elements concentration may play a significant role in carcinogenesis and may determine trends in cancer aetiology.","695":"","696":"The velopharyngeal sphincter is critical in enabling the functions of speaking and swallowing. Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) results in hypernasal speech and nasal regurgitation. A frequent cause of VPI is congenital cleft palate, but otolaryngologists sometimes encounter iatrogenic VPI after surgery. Treatment of VPI with prostheses is often successful but not always well tolerated. Many surgical procedures have been proposed to correct palatal length or to enlarge the posterior pharyngeal wall. We report two cases in which autologous costochondral cartilage was used as implant augmentation. This approach is indicated and efficient when the velopharyngeal deficit is less than 5 mm. An autologous costochondral cartilage implant procedure is safe and reversible and can be expected to incite minimal host reaction.","697":"Thymic cyst in the differential diagnosis of paediatric cervical masses. Cervical ectopic thymic tissue is rarely reported. However, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of neck masses, especially in children. We present a case of a 7-year-old male with a soft, asymptomatic right-sided cervical mass. The patient underwent complete excision of a 3 x 4 cm cyst, which was derived from a mass of soft tissue and was in close relation with the carotid sheath. Histological examination of the specimen showed a thymic cyst. The child's post-operative course was unremarkable and follow-up appointment six months later showed complete recovery. The embryological development, clinical presentation and management of ectopic thymic lesions are discussed together with a brief review of the literature.","698":"Apertura pyriformis stenosis in the newborn. Respiratory distress in the newborn can have a variety of aetiologies, the best known of which are cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Major nasal airway obstruction is probably often overlooked when acute desaturation of the neonate requires reanimation procedures, although it is well established that the baby is an obligate nose breather at birth. Nasal airway stenosis or atresia could account for a number of unexplained deaths in the delivery room. In the differential diagnosis of major nasal airway obstruction in the newborn, choanal atresia is by far the most common aetiology. However, a few cases of pyriform aperture stenosis have been reported. One child presenting this pathology was recently treated at the Brussels University Children's Hospital. Unexpectedly, the baby survived until 3 months without any medical support but had severe feeding problems. The diagnosis was confirmed by naso-sinusal CT scan. Surgery was performed at 4 months through an unusual endonasal approach which seems to be less traumatic than the classical sublabial approach. The post-operative course was satisfactory. The 9-month-old patient does not now show residual breathing problems. The presentation will focus on this unusual case.","699":"Chondrosarcomas of the nasal septum are extremely rare tumours. The clinical presentation, imaging features, histopathological characteristics, and therapeutical options for this uncommon lesion are discussed. In this report, two cases are presented, and the literature regarding this rare pathology is reviewed.","700":"Chondrosarcoma of the larynx: a report of two cases and a review of the literature. This paper describes two cases of low-grade laryngeal chondrosarcoma. In both cases, the tumours were located on the cricoid, and could be visualized with a CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis was made by a deep wedge biopsy with a CO2 laser, and after subtotal supracricoid laryngectomy. Most of the reported cases have been successfully managed by voice-sparing surgery, but the two cases reported here, needed more radical treatment.","701":"Management of an insular thyroid carcinoma invading the larynx and trachea. Carcinomas of the thyroid gland are usually classified into four types: papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic and into two main groups depending on their clinical behaviour: low and high grade malignancy. Insular carcinomas represent a rare subtype of follicular thyroid carcinoma, which are poorly differentiated. It is an aggressive and often lethal tumour. Thyroid cancers rarely invade the upper airways. We report the case of an insular carcinoma invading the larynx and trachea, which was treated by total laryngectomy, bilateral neck dissection and external beam irradiation. The patient presented no signs of tumour recurrence two years after treatment. Conservative treatment is usually recommended for thyroid carcinomas. Total laryngectomy is reserved for some extensive tumours invading the upper airways. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to manage these cancers correctly.","702":"Various approaches and techniques are used in discontinuing tracheostomy in children. The variability in the use of resources is considerable. The objective of the study was to assess decannulation in children attending our ENT department. A retrospective analysis was carried out of the medical records of patients who had had both a tracheostomy (n=7) and a decannulation (n=6) from 1998 to 2003. Tracheostomies placed at a mean age of 4.2 months were discontinued on average 26.4 months later. All the children underwent airway endoscopy in the operating room in preparation for decannulation. They had downsizing, then capping of the tracheostomy as a functional trial. One child failed decannulation and another needed a second trial for successful decannulation. The individualization of tracheostomy decannulation is necessary in children.","703":"A 55-year-old male presented with left-sided otorrhoea, hearing loss and tinnitus of 3 months duration. On clinical examination polypoid tissue was seen prolapsing in the external ear canal. A CT scan of the mastoid cells and middle ear showed otomastoiditis with osteolysis. Oral antibiotic therapy and eardrops were started. When a facial nerve paresis appeared one month later, a mastoidectomy was performed. The mastoid cells and middle ear were filled with a connective tissue-like substance. Postoperative corticosteroids were administered. Despite the therapy the facial nerve problem aggravated and the patient developed severe parietotemporal headache, meningeal irritation and somnolence. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was hypothesised. Blood analysis, including c-ANCA's, culture of the otorrhoea and biopsies of the connective tissue were inconclusive. A CT scan of the brain showed thickening of the left tentorium. A biopsy of the dura indicated a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive medication with satisfactory results.","704":"Solvents in car paints are a recognised source of occupational toxicity. In particular, they can cause DNA damage and occupational rhinobronchitis. However, little is known about their toxic effect in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) in humans. In this study, a 160 pure tone audiometric test was performed in workers in two independent factories to investigate whether toxic solvents in car paints can result in noise-induced hearing loss in workers exposed to moderate noise levels of less than 85 decibels (dB). It is shown that toxic solvents in car paints increase the risk associated with moderate noise exposure of less than 85 dB, with levels of NIHL being similar to those in workers exposed only to loud noises between 92.5 dB and 107 dB. Tinnitus and spells of dizziness were associated symptoms in all workers with NIHL, and asthma was an associated disease in workers with NIHL exposed to car paints and moderate noises simultaneously. These results may indicate that toxic solvents in car paints act in synergism with moderate noise exposure, damaging the cochlear hair cells. The results also constitute firm grounds for monitoring the hearing of these workers and adherence to strict regulations about wearing special gowns and filtered masks during working hours to protect against this preventable occupational disease.","705":"The presence of an isolated foreign body in the sphenoid sinus is a rare finding, and a retained projectile in this sinus is even more uncommon. The authors report the case of a 15-year-old male that was shot in the face with an air gun but was nevertheless able to seek for medical help. The anatomical considerations of the gunshot injury are made, and radiological assessment of the foreign body is presented. The projectile could be successfully removed with an endoscopic technique, no short or long term sequelae occurred.

Extracranially, 25% of all schwannomas are located in the head and neck. Intra-oral development is uncommon and a location in the tongue has been reported in individual cases. We present a young patient with a schwannoma in the distal right side of the tongue. The tumour had grown slowly producing no symptoms. The diagnosis was made on histological examination. Surgical enucleation of the mass was uncomplicated and there was no recurrence. We report a further case of a schwannoma of the tongue, highlighting the need for this to be considered in the differential diagnosis. ","707":"Subcutaneous emphysema and mediastinitis are rarely reported complications of tonsillectomy. We describe two patients who developed subcutaneous emphysema, one of them with mediastinitis, within a few days after tonsillectomy. The diagnosis was based on the clinical presentation and confirmed by computed tomography (CT). For the patient without mediastinitis, the emphysema disappeared after a short period of reintubation and administration of antibiotics. For the patient with mediastinitis, surgical drainage of a cervico-mediastinal purulent collection was necessary to obtain healing. The events leading to subcutaneous emphysema and mediastinitis have not been entirely clarified. They probably include direct introduction of air into the neck via either the tonsillar bed or a laryngeal or pharyngeal wound caused by intubation. The clinical presentation, treatment and possible pathophysiology of subcutaneous emphysema and medisastinits are discussed. Emphysema and mediastinitis after tonsillectomy occur seldomly. If rapidly recognised and appropriately managed, mortality can be avoided. ","708":"The skeletal lesions of primary hyperparathyroidism, including brown tumour, are rare nowadays, with the practice of checking serum calcium levels leading to an earlier diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic and histological investigations can lead to a correct diagnosis. Treatment of brown tumour focuses on the hyperparathyroidism, and is usually followed by a regression of the brown tumour. The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism and brown tumour should be considered in patients with hypercalcaemia and an osteolytic expansive bone lesion. We present a patient where a brown tumour of the mandible was the presenting symptom of primary hyperparathyroidism.","709":"Insufficient excision is one of the main factors leading to recurrence of minor salivary gland tumours. Our aim is to perform large resections with immediate reconstruction in order to provide local control, as well as to achieve better cosmetic and functional results. Four consecutive patients suffering from minor salivary gland tumours of the upper aerodigestive tract were treated: two had adenoid cystic carcinomas (one of the lateral oropharyngeal mucosa, one of the retromolar area); one had a polymorphous low-grade carcinoma (at the base of the tongue); and one had mucoepidermoid carcinoma (on the floor of the mouth). Two radial forearm free-flaps, a trapezius myocutaneous pedicled flap (including an adjacent osseous part of the scapula), and a sternocleidomastoid muscular pedicled flap were used, respectively, for reconstruction. Additional external radiation was used for three patients (60 cGy). The postoperative course was uneventful for each patient, and the ability to chew and swallow was rapidly restored. Two patients, locally controlled, with adenoid cystic carcinomas died: one from brain metastases (four years post-surgery), the other with pulmonary metastases (eight-years post-surgery). One patient is alive with a recurrent tumour of the pterygomaxillary fossa (without trismus) sixteen years after the original operation; another patient is free of recurrent disease at the base of the tongue but has recently undergone surgery, with success, for two pulmonary metastases sixty months after the initial surgery. For minor salivary gland carcinoma of the head and neck, large resection with immediate reconstruction affords fast recovery and long-lasting locoregional control. Additional radiotherapy is feasible. ","710":"Mucoceles of the sphenoidal sinus represent less than 2% of paranasal sinus mucoceles. The purpose of this paper is to report our experience in patients with mucoceles of the sphenoidal sinus. Four patients with this localization were observed in our department from 1994 to 2005. Symptoms included headache, visual loss, and rhinorrhea. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Surgery was performed using an endonasal endoscopic procedure, in one case a navigational system was used. In light of these observations and a review of literature, the etiopathogenic characteristics, clinical aspects, and therapeutic indications of this localization are discussed.","711":"Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a benign, expansile lesion of bone with slow progression and unknown origin. The purpose of this report is to make physicians aware of the symptoms, methods for differential diagnosis, and treatment options. Three cases of monostotic FD are presented; two involving the maxillary sinus, and one in temporal bone. CT scans are the definitive diagnostic and follow-up method. Surgical approaches to alleviate the symptoms, including facial deformity, are described. FD went undiagnosed for three years in these patients. All three patients were relieved of the symptoms by limited surgery, and remained asymptomatic for up to two years after the surgery, with no signs of recurrence. Practitioners should be alert to the possibility of FD, particularly if patients develop narrowing of the ear canal, or progressive postauricular or maxillofacial enlargement. Minimal surgery to alleviate the symptoms is the treatment of choice. ","712":"1) PROBLEM\/OBJECTIVE: The effect of ventilation tubes on acute otitis related symptoms (otorrhoea, earache, and fever) and on antibiotic usage was investigated in children with persistent otitis media with effusion, as part of a multicenter, randomised, controlled clinical trial. 2) METHODOLOGY: One hundred-eighty-seven children were randomly placed into either a watchful waiting group (WW group) (n = 94) or a group treated with ventilation tubes (VT group) (n = 93). Both groups were followed for 12 months. Data were collected from parental reports and from medical files kept by the attending ENT-surgeons. 3) RESULTS: There were significant differences in the reported frequency of otorrhoea (but not of earache or fever) between both groups during follow-up, i.e. children in the VT group had more episodes of otorrhoea than the children in the WW group (p &lt; 0.003). As a consequence, children in the VT group had been prescribed antibiotics more often. 4) CONCLUSIONS: Young children treated with ventilation tubes due to persistent otitis media with effusion have a higher risk of developing otorrhoea because of the tubes, and they have a higher risk of needing treatment with antibiotics.","713":"There is a wide range of partial surgical resections for the treatment of laryngeal tumours. In addition to good cure rates, the main aim is to preserve a competent and functional larynx. Functional outcomes have proven to have a substantial effect on postoperative quality of life and are usually included in clinical studies. This article reviews reported functional outcomes after partial laryngectomies, particularly when related to swallowing. In the majority of patients, reports indicate acceptable feeding without the presence of a permanent tracheostomy. However, a wide variety of methods and variables are used to describe these functional outcomes, making the comparison of functional outcome after different treatment modalities and resections difficult. More objective evaluation procedures are needed for swallowing to reveal the exact pathophysiology, spontaneous progression and prognostic factors after well-defined laryngeal resections.","714":"","715":"Initial management of a neck mass in adults is a frequently encountered problem in ENT practice.

Consensus guidelines are proposed concerning the work-up of patients with a presumed diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aero-digestive tract. ","717":"To propose national recommendations for the initial assessment of a mass in the neck in children. Comprehensive review of the available literature and consensus discussion with national experts in the field. Consensus guidelines are proposed concerning the work up of children presenting with a mass in the neck. ","718":"Stridor is the sound caused by abnormal air passage into the lungs and can exist in different degrees and be caused by obstruction located anywhere in the extra-thoracic (nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea) or intra-thoracic airway (tracheobronchial tree). Stridor may be congenital or acquired, acute, intermittent or chronic. Laryngotracheal inflammation (croup) is the most common cause of acute stridor. Laryngotracheomalacia is the most common cause of congenital, chronic stridor. Stridor is a clinical sign and not a diagnosis. The golden standard in the workup of stridor is an upper and lower airway endoscopy under general anaesthesia. Endoscopic examination under general anaesthesia requires a multidisciplinary approach and close cooperation between anaesthesiologist, paediatrician, ENT surgeon and nursing staff. Following this procedure, a place in the intensive care unit should be available for those cases presenting with stridor in which a definite diagnosis could not yet be established. Although important, pre-endoscopy assessment including history, physical examination and radiological examination, is only a guide to the type and degree of pathology found during endoscopy. About 1 out of 10 infants are found to have lesions in more than one anatomical site of the upper aerodigestive tract.","719":"Olfactory disorders may have several causes. Nasal polyposis or chronic sinusitis can result in nasal obstructions that block the access of odorants to the olfactory epithelium, and this can explain the development of olfactory disorders. On the other hand, when nasal endoscopy has revealed that the nasal cleft is free of inflammatory or tumoural disease, olfactory disorders may be explained by neuroepithelial or central nervous system disturbances. This paper will provide information about current approaches to smell disorders in otorhinolaryngology. Major causes will be reviewed as outcomes after medical or surgical treatment. An algorithm will also be given to standardise clinical investigations, including psychophysical olfactory testing, imaging and electrophysiological examinations.","720":"The usual clinical presentation of sinonasal tumours includes symptoms that are indistinguishable from inflammatory sinus disease, namely nasal airway obstruction, pain, and epistaxis. Abnormal V1 and\/or V2 sensations are a strong indication of the possibility of tumour. Computed tomography is the most reliable and informative imaging tool for evaluating the cancers of the paranasal sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging is essential for tumour mapping because of the excellent tissue characterisation and the possibility of differentiating between neoplasms and retained secretions. A wide variety of histologies may be encountered, although squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) is the most common. Radiation is a common adjuvant to surgery. The response of sinonasal tract tumours to radiation therapy varies with the stage and histology of the tumour. Rehabilitation after surgical resection may be accomplished with prosthodontics or reconstructive flaps. Bony erosion of the orbital walls does not constitute an indication for orbital exenteration. Patients with tumour involvement of the skull base, either in the infratemporal fossa or at the fovea ethmoidalis and cribriform plate, should be considered for craniofacial resection. Management of these tumours requires a multimodal approach, involving surgery, radiation therapy and, increasingly in recent years, chemotherapy. Management should therefore be entrusted to multidisciplinary teams only.","721":"These guidelines are modified from the recent EAACI Position Paper. Nasal polyposis is characterized by an inflammatory process, the factors of which are summarized. Recently, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins have been identified to modify the disease. A classification system for polyps, grading systems and epidemiologic data are given, frequent comorbidities are discussed. The diagnostic management is based on endoscopy and CT scanning. A score of severity is proposed. The therapeutic management consists of the medical treatment options, which are given with evidence-based recommendations. Surgical treatment is indicated after failure of medical treatment and commonly performed by endoscopy. Nevertheless medical therapy must be continued after surgery to prevent recurrences. Algorithms of decision are finally proposed [corrected]","722":"Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a group of multifactorial diseases characterised by inflammation of the mucosa of the nose and paranasal sinuses with a history of at least 12 weeks of persistent symptoms and signs despite maximal medical therapy. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity and asthma are the two most important associated factors. Diagnosis of CRS is based upon the medical history and either an endoscopy or CT scan. Initial medical treatment usually consists of the avoidance of all the contributory factors and then nasal douching and nasal steroids. If medical treatment fails, endoscopic sinus surgery is considered. The authors review the most important factors associated with CRS, the diagnostic work-up and different treatment options. They also present a rationale for treatment.","723":"Due to its high and increasing prevalence, its impact on quality of life, the association with multiple comorbidities and the considerable socio-economic burden, allergic rhinitis is a major respiratory disorder and represents a global health concern. The ARIA working group has proposed a new classification for allergic rhinitis into intermittent or persistent, based on the duration of symptoms. The severity of allergic rhinitis is graded according to the impact of the disease on the quality of life. The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis involves a thorough history and clinical examination. In patients suspected of having persistent AR a complete and systematic nasal examination is an absolute requirement. Anterior rhinoscopy provides limited information. Nasal endoscopy is more useful, not to confirm AR but in particular to exclude other conditions, such as polyps, foreign bodies, tumours and septal deformations. To confirm the allergic origin of rhinitis symptoms, allergy tests must be performed. The first choice test is the skin prick test. Patients with allergic rhinitis should be evaluated for asthma and patients with asthma should be evaluated for rhinitis. A stepwise therapeutic approach is recommended based on the duration and severity of disease. The treatment of allergic rhinitis consists of allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy.","724":"This article is a review of the literature on epistaxis and its treatment. Data were collected from MedLine until mid September 2005, and from others readings and books. Its first goal was to present to the Belgian ENT practitioners an overview, as complete as possible, of the modern concepts in etiologies, medical, conservative, surgical (including embolization), and adjunctive therapies of epistaxis. All these topics are discussed and commented, from a medico-surgical point of view, and also from a cost effectiveness one.","725":"Hearing loss is one of the most common congenital anomalies, occurring in approximately 1-2 infants per 1000. Left undetected, hearing impairments in infants can negatively impact speech and language acquisition, academic achievement, social and emotional development. These negative impacts can be diminished and even eliminated through early intervention at or before 6 months of age. Reliable screening tests that minimize referral rates and maximize sensitivity and specificity are available. The goal of universal neonatal hearing screening is to maximize linguistic and communicative competence and literacy development for children who are hard of hearing or deaf. Audiologic and medical evaluations should be in progress before 3 months of age. Infants with confirmed hearing loss should receive intervention before 6 months of age from health care and education professionals with expertise in hearing loss and deafness in infants and young children.","726":"Otitis media with effusion in children: B-ENT Guidelines. OME is highly prevalent among young children, with peak prevalences at around two and five years of age. Although serious complications are rare, the burden of OM is large with impaired quality of life and high direct and indirect socio-economic costs. To date, medical treatment of OME is not recommended because of the limited scientific evidence that this treatment is effective in the long term. Surgical candidacy for OME depends largely on hearing status, associated symptoms, the child's developmental risk and the anticipated chance of spontaneous resolution of the effusion. Ultimately, the recommendation for surgery must be individualized.","727":"Tumour metastasis to the anterior pituitary-hypothalamic area is rare. We present a patient who had severe headache, bitemporal quadrant hemianopsia and an expanding mass in the sella turcica as revealed by MRI. Partial resection via a transsphenoidal approach was performed and postoperative radiation therapy was initiated. Immunohistochemical investigation identified the tumour as a metastatic small cell carcinoma whose primary site remained undetected for more than 12 months despite repeated oncological evaluations. We reviewed the literature on metastatic disease of the pituitary gland.","728":"A Thornwaldt's cyst is an uncommon nasopharyngeal lesion that develops from the remnant of the primitive notochord. A 65-year-old man with a Thornwaldt's cyst is presented in this case report. The patient was diagnosed by rigid nasal endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These cases are infrequently presented in the English journals. Our study suggested that endoscopic and MRI examinations of the nasopharynx were a simple, rapid, and useful procedure for the diagnosis of the Thornwaldt's cysts.","729":"Hyponatremia is a common metabolic disorder in clinical practice and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially among the elderly. Hyponatremia resulting from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) has been reported in association with neoplasia (including a few reports in patients with head and neck malignancies) and may represent a paraneoplastic condition. Patients with SIADH present with signs and symptoms that cannot be explained by the primary tumour mass effect or its metastases. We describe a 67-year-old male patient with oral squamous-cell carcinoma of recent recurrence admitted because of symptomatic severe hyponatremia resulting from SIADH and discuss the principles of the diagnostic approach and appropriate management.","730":"Laryngeal leiomyosarcoma is rare. The authors report the case of a 48-year-old patient who presented with progressive hoarseness. This symptomatology was associated with a laryngeal tumour. Immunohistopathological study indicated a leiomyosarcoma. Acute dyspnoea resulted in an urgent tracheostomy, followed by total laryngectomy without neck dissection later. In the light of this observation and a literature review, histopathological characteristics, clinical aspects and therapeutic indications will be discussed for this localisation.","731":"Nasal polyposis is a model for the study of inflammatory processes. We analyzed the expression of galectin-7, a growth regulator, in surface epithelium, glandular epithelium, and connective tissue in human nasal polyps, and examined the effect of the glucocorticoid budesonide on its expression in human nasal polyps ex vivo. Using quantitative, computer-assisted microscopy and immunohistochemistry, we measured galectin-7 expression in nine nasal polyps obtained by surgical resection. Five polyps came from allergic patients and four came from non-allergic patients. Galectin-7 was expressed in all three polyp tissues analyzed. Treatment of polyps from allergic and non-allergic patients with 50 ng\/ml budesonide increased the extent of galectin-7 expression in the connective tissue (p = 0.01). Conversely, budesonide at this concentration did not apparently affect galectin-7 expression in glandular epithelium; only a slight decrease in the percentage of the galectin-7-immunopositive cells was observed. In the surface epithelium of nasal polyps from non-allergic patients, the percentage of galectin-7-immunopositive cells was decreased (p = 0.03) by treatment with 250 ng\/ml budesonide. In nasal polyps from allergic patients, this percentage was increased by treatment with 50 ng\/ml budesonide (p = 0.0001). These data are consistent with a role for galectin-7 in the regulation of cell growth through a pro-apoptotic effect. Galectin-7 expression coincides with the degree of epithelial stratification, and is subject to upregulation in the connective tissue in response to treatment with 50 ng\/ml budesonide. Budesonide modulates galectin-7 expression differently in the surface epithelia of polyps from allergic and non-allergic patients. ","732":"For some patients, genetic testing can reveal the etiology of their hearing impairment, and can provide evidence for a medical diagnosis. However, a gap between fundamental genetic research on hereditary deafness and clinical otology emerges because of the steadily increasing number of discovered genes for hereditary hearing impairment (HHI) and the comparably low clinical differentiation of the HHIs. In an attempt to keep up with the scientific progress, this article enumerates the indications of genetic testing for HHI from a clinical point of view and describes the most frequently encountered HHIs in Belgium. Domains of recent scientific interest, molecular biological aspects, and some pitfalls with HHIs are highlighted. The overview comprises bilateral congenital hearing loss, late-onset progressive high frequency hearing loss, progressive bilateral cochleo-vestibular deficit, and progressive low frequency hearing loss. Also, several syndromal forms of HHI are summarized, and the availability of genetic tests mentioned. Finally, the requirements for successful linkage analysis, an important genetic research tool for localizing the potential genes of a trait on a chromosome, are briefly described.","733":"The aim of this study is to use anamnesis and laryngeal examination to investigate the occurrence of the gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD (with symptoms of regurgitation and heartburn, signs of oesophagitis, and pathological pH monitoring) among patients with suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux. One hundred and sixty-nine patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux indicated by anamnesis and laryngeal examination were evaluated retrospectively with endoscopy and 24-hour double-probe pH monitoring. Combining endoscopy and pH monitoring made possible a diagnosis of GERD in 130 patients (77%). Of these patients, 58% had erosive oesophagitis and 84% had pathological oesophageal acid exposure. Of the patients with suspected laryngopharyngeal reflux and with established GERD, 49% reported gastrointestinal symptoms like heartburn or acid regurgitation. Erosive oesophagitis was confirmed in 45% of patients: grade 1 in 60 (35%), grade 2 in 10 patients (6%), and grades 3 and 4 in 3 patients each (2%). Distal oesophageal pH monitoring was pathological in 65% of patients. Of these, 93% had upright pathological acid exposure. Proximal oesophageal acid exposure was pathological in 39% of patients. Reflux can be suspected when a patient presents typical laryngeal symptoms and signs. The majority of these patients will not have typical GERD symptoms like heartburn, and endoscopic oesophagitis, mostly grade 1, is present in only a subset of patients with LPR. Oesophageal pH monitoring is the most appropriate test to demonstrate pathological oesophageal acid exposure. ","734":"Distant metastases in head and neck cancer are often to the lung, and rarely to the skin sites. To ascertain that a skin metastasis indicates a poor prognosis, a review was conducted of patients with head and neck cancer. Three out of seven patients had evidence of local recurrence at the time of development of the skin metastases, and three out of seven had evidence of distant metastases. The average survival time was 1 month after the development of skin metastases. Skin metastases may represent the first clinical evidence of impending recurrence or distant metastasis. The development of skin metastasis is associated with a poor prognosis. Current treatment options are limited in their efficacity. ","735":"To investigate patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in order to estimate the recurrence rate and treatment used as salvage surgery. The survival rate in the group of patients treated with salvage surgery was compared to that of patients who had chemotherapy rather than surgery or who refused any treatment. From 1989 to 1999, 185 patients came to our institution for laryngeal SCC. All of them underwent RT as primary treatment. Only patients with a minimum of three years follow-up (n = 143) were included in the study group. The 143 cases included 22 loco-regional recurrences (15.3%) during the minimum three years of follow-up. Recurrence was observed in the larynx in eighteen cases (81.8%), in cervical nodes in one case (4.55%) and in both the larynx and cervical nodes in one case (4.55%). There was peristomal recurrence in two cases (9.1%). Recurrence was observed after an average of 16.3 months. Fourteen patients (63.6%) out of the twenty-two cases of recurrence underwent salvage surgery. Surgery was not performed on the remaining eight patients (36.4%). The global survival rate was 92.3% after three years and 66.6% after five years in the group of patients treated with surgery. The actuarial survival rate was 100% after three years and 83.3% after five years. The global and actuarial survival rate was 20% after three years and 0% after five years in the group of patients who received chemotherapy rather than surgery or who refused any kind of treatment. The RT seems to play an important role in the loco-regional control of laryngeal SCC (especially in glottic T1). Salvage surgery for recurrence results in a good survival rate. ","736":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a relatively uncommon malignancy. The prognosis is generally good and the mortality rate is low. PTC is more common in younger patients; incidence is two to three times higher in women and in individuals with radiation exposure to the neck. We report on a 75-year-old woman with PTC admitted to our clinic for a giant mass in the neck dating back ten years. A hyperintense huge cystic lesion and hypo-intense central solid component were seen on T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. No distant metastasis was present. The PTC was treated surgically and radioiodine (131I) treatment was applied postoperatively. No recurrence was observed one year later.","737":"Laryngeal paraganglioma is a rare vascular neuroendocrine benign tumour. Surgery is the standard treatment. The pre-operative gold standard is Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Gadolinum contrast. Computed tomography scans and angiography are also useful in making the diagnosis of paraganglioma before surgical intervention. A case of a large supraglottic paraganglioma is described. Complete excision of the tumour was achieved using microlaryngoscopical-laser surgical resection. No severe complications were observed. The patient was discharged from hospital without any complaints on the fourth post-operative day and she was disease-free 36 months after surgery. The effectiveness of this conservative endoscopic surgical procedure compared to the external approaches is discussed and it can be concluded that the endoscopic diode-laser resection of even extended laryngeal paraganglioma provides a good operative field and is a safe and effective technique.","738":"We present two cases of blunt external trauma to the trachea. The first was a 19-year-old man who had suffered rupture of the first tracheal ring as a consequence of attempting suicide by hanging from a cable. The second was an 11-year-old boy who fell from a bicycle and struck his neck against the handlebars. Fracture of the second tracheal ring was found at surgery. Both cases were treated by primary repair. A surgical exploration is essential in the case of subcutaneous emphysema, even if no respiratory distress is present and a radiological evaluation is negative. Follow up, according to the extent and type of injury, is recommended to prevent post traumatic stenosis of the trachea.","739":"We report on a 9-year-old boy with neurofibromatosis type 2 and a progressive proptosis of the left eye. Imaging studies revealed a pneumosinus dilatans of the left ethmoidal and frontal sinuses and an adjacent left orbital mass. Incision biopsy of the orbital mass showed a meningiothelial meningioma. Orbital and intracranial meningiomas are frequently associated with pneumosinus dilatans. This report illustrates the relationship of pneumosinus dilatans, intra-orbital meningioma and neurofibromatosis type 2.","740":"Fungus-like sinusitis is also called eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS). This terminology is purely descriptive and refers to a rhinosinusitis, whose clinical presentation and imaging are similar to those of a noninvasive fungal sinusitis but in which fungus could not be demonstrated pathologically using the conventional silver staining technique or on culture. The authors report 2 clinical cases and recall the diagnostic criteria for the different forms of fungal sinusitis in immunocompetent patients.","741":"To determine the value of radiological features in the diagnosis of Eosinophilic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (EFRS). Retrospective review of the radiological materials of 65 patients with documented Eosinophilic Fungal Rhinosinusitis treated at the same institution. Evaluation by the ENT surgeon and the head and neck radiologist. EFRS was more common in female patients in this series. Fifty-four (83%) patients were above 30 years of age, with a peak of 18 patients (27.7%) in the seventh decade. All the patients except one (98.5%) showed bilateral mucosal thickening on unenhanced CT scans. Thirty-eight patients (58%) showed increased intrasinus attenuation on unenhanced CT scans. Thirty-seven patients (57%) showed opacification of at least one sinus; 25 (38%) showed osteitis; 11 (17%) had erosion of the sinus wall and only one patient showed minor expansion of an involved sinus. In 6 patients, typical hyperattenuation patterns on CT scans, together with distinctive MRI images, were highly suggestive of EFRS. Our data show that hyperattenuation on CT images with bone window settings suggests the presence of EFRS. This hyperattenuation is more clearly seen with soft-tissue window settings. When necessary, adjunctive MRI can provide information which might be highly predictive for the diagnosis of EFRS. However, non-specific imaging findings of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) should also be seen as possible EFRS pathology. ","742":"The optimal surgical management of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) remains a controversial topic. Preoperative and peroperative investigations quite frequently fail to detect thyroid cancer in cold nodules, and only postoperative histological examination reveals malignancy. In these cases many physicians perform a completion thyroidectomy. Others recommend a conservative approach with close follow-up because of the increased risk of complications after re-operation. In our department, routine management includes completion thyroidectomy once the histopathological report concludes that there is carcinoma, except in cases of papillary carcinoma measuring less than 1 cm. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence of contralateral malignancy and of complications after completion thyroidectomy. We reviewed the records of 29 patients--25 women and 4 men-- who all underwent completion thyroidectomy because of an unexpected diagnosis of DTC. Residual malignancy was found in 12 patients (41.4%) after completion thyroidectomy. In ten patients (34.5%) the malignancy was localised in the contralateral lobe and two patients (6.9%) had lymph node metastases. Postoperative transient hypocalcaemia (&lt; 8.0 mg\/dl) occurred in five patients (17.2%) and permanent hypocalcaemia (lasting longer than 6 months) was a feature in two patients. One patient suffered transient laryngeal nerve injury occurred in one patient and there were no permanent lesions. In conclusion, we found residual DTC in 41.4% of patients undergoing reintervention. Because of the rather low re-operation rate, we prefer to perform a completion thyroidectomy to remove potential occult malignancy and to allow for postoperative 131I-treatment in all patients with a diagnosis of malignancy in their thyroid lobectomy specimen, with the exception of papillary carcinoma &lt; 1 cm.","743":"In an evaluation of our patients with parotid gland neoplasms, we noticed that patients with a Warthin's tumour were heavy smokers. The aim of this study was to confirm earlier findings in the literature concerning a possible association between smoking and the development of a Warthin's tumour. A case control study was performed using the clinical records and discharge letters of all consecutive patients with a Warthin's tumour in the pathology database of our hospital covering the last 15 years. Patients with a pleomorphic adenoma and a group of patients visiting our audiology department were used as controls. A smoking history was found in 97.5% of the patients with a Warthin's tumour. Of the patients with a pleomorphic adenoma, 59% had a smoking history; 56.5% of the audiology group had a smoking history. Mean age at the time of the operation was 60.1 years of age in the Warthin's tumour group and 48.6 for the pleomorphic adenoma group. The mean age for the development of a Warthin's tumour is ten years older than for a pleomorphic adenoma. Furthermore, the development seems to be closely related to smoking habits. ","744":"During the five-year period from 1998 to 2002, the ENT department of the University Clinic of Kinshasa treated 343 patients suffering from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and complications. Two hundred and seven patients had simple, 28 had cholesteatomatous form of CSOM, and 108 patients presented with intratemporal or intracranial complications. Roughly half of the patient group consisted of children younger than 10 years. The simple form of CSOM affects men and women equally, but the cholesteatomatous form was more prevalent among men. Otorrhoea and hearing loss were the major presenting symptoms. Hearing loss was moderate to severe in 2\/3 and slight in 1\/3 of the audiometrically tested ears. A mastoidectomy was performed on 55% of the patients. Roughly 1\/3 of the patients presented with complications, the majority of which (69) were subperiostal abscesses. Complications other than subperiostal abscesses were associated with a high morbitidy and a few patients even died. Our data suggest that the prevalence of CSOM in the Kinshasa area is at least 4% and, in fact, has not declined over the last 20 years.","745":"Transplant patients with primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection may develop post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Since many infants are seronegative at the time of transplantation, PTLD is a major concern for paediatric transplant centres. First manifestations of PTLD are frequently observed in the ENT area with adenoidal and\/or tonsillar involvement. Retrospective study of two cases of PTLD with confirmed supraglottic involvement, their management and outcome. Only patients with pathologically and immunologically demonstrated B-cell proliferation were diagnosed as PTLD. Two infants developed an acute stridor during PTLD respectively 8 and 10 months after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). These infants were seronegative for EBV at the time of transplantation. IgM anti-EBV and\/or detection of EBV genome by polymerase chain reaction were positive. Laryngeal examination revealed hypopharyngeal and\/or supraglottic mucosal hyperplasia. Immunostaining of laryngeal biopsy was positive for latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1). Patients were treated by a reduction in immunosuppression as far as tolerated with the intent to recover natural immune response by the patient over the proliferation of EBV-infected cells. Complete remission of PTLD was observed in these two cases. Tonsillar hypertrophy and adenoid enlargement are the most encountered features of PTLD in OLT occurring in the ENT area. Acute stridor with supraglottic involvement may also be observed in PTLD and must be promptly diagnosed as the prognosis of this disorder is related to rapid reduction in immunosuppression and consequently to the recovering of a natural immune response against the EBV infection. ","746":"Synovial sarcoma is a rare mesenchymal malignancy which represents 8.5% of all soft tissue sarcomas and usually occurs in the lower extremities of young adults. Because the incidence in the head and neck region is very low, only 13 patients with endolaryngeal localisation have been reported so far. We present here a case of aryepiglottic synovial sarcoma. The tumour was completely resected, under suspension micro-laryngoscopy, using a CO2 laser. No recurrence was observed three years after the surgery. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice. The role of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is still debated. However, this tumour has a poor prognosis because of the occurrence of distant metastasis.","747":"We report an extremely rare case of metastasic renal cell carcinoma to the temporal bone which presented initially as a jugulotympanic paraganglioma. The clinical and radiological appearances were misleading.Investigations of concomitant high blood pressure revealed a tumour of the right kidney. Biopsy of the mastoid mass was histologically compatible with a metastasis from a clear cell renal carcinoma. The patient underwent a radical nephrectomy and local external radiotherapy to the head. He also received adjuvant treatment with interferon-_ and interleukin 2. The clinical presentation, the radiological and histological features, the patterns of spread, the treatment options and the prognosis of these tumours are discussed. A review of the literature confirms the extremely unusual occurrence of this localisation.","748":"Only twenty cases of osteomas of the sphenoid sinus have been reported. This tumour causes progressively worsening headaches and visual disturbance and should be resected when symptomatic or fast-growing. In selected cases, endoscopic sinus surgery offers an effective alternative to open procedures. The authors report a case of sphenoid osteoma in a 19-year old woman. Computed tomography performed because of complaints of progressively worsening headaches identified a large osteoma of the sphenoid sinus. The clinical features and radiological assessment of the disease are presented together with a review of the literature. The endoscopic technique used for resection of the tumour gave a very good result. Sphenoid osteoma is an extremely rare lesion which can be approached endoscopically in selected cases. ","749":"Paranasal sinus mucoceles are benign, expansive processes filled with mucus and bordered by respiratory mucosa. The purpose of our study was to determine risk factors for recurrence of mucoceles after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) based on clinical and radiological characteristics. We performed a retrospective review of 57 patients consecutively treated endoscopically for mucoceles between 1992 and 2002 at the UZ Leuven, a tertiary referral university hospital. Paranasal sinus mucoceles predominantly occurred in the maxillary sinus and the fronto-ethmoidal region (both 35%). In 69% of patients there was a history of sinus surgery (51%) or facial trauma (18%). Recurrence occurred in 5 of 49 patients who were treated by ESS in elective circumstances, while four of eight patients who underwent ESS at the moment of acute infection had recurrence (p = 0.004). Although all recurrences following elective ESS occurred in mucoceles related to previous facial trauma or sinus surgery, this relationship was not statistically significant (p = 0.2). In three patients, significant extension outside the sinus wall was present; three other patients had multiple mucoceles. Presence of multiple mucoceles and significant extension outside the sinus walls were also risk factors for recurrence (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). In one patient with recurrence, the frontal recess was damaged during previous ESS. Three conditions can be considered risk factors for mucocele recurrence after ESS: surgery at a moment of acute infection, presence of multiple mucoceles, and significant extension outside the sinus wall. ","750":"Chronic maxillary atelectasis (CMA) is characterized by a reduced maxillary sinus volume due to an inward bowing of one or more of the sinus walls. The disorder is probably caused by an obstruction of the maxillary ostium, leading to a persistent negative pressure within the sinus lumen. To provide insight into the epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder, a retrospective study of twelve cases that met radiographic criteria of CMA was carried out. The patients were equally divided between both sexes and were on average 25 years old. Five of the twelve patients were under eighteen years of age. The patients had chronic sinonasal complaints except two, who had a \"silent sinus syndrome\", characterized by enophthalmos associated with a marked sinus deformation. This is the first report of CMA associated with a benign nasal tumour and also of CMA following cicatrisation due to nasal packing for bleeding after endoscopic sinus surgery. All patients were treated surgically by creating a middle meatal antrostomy, thus restoring sinus ventilation. To conclude, CMA is rare and probably underestimated, especially in the paediatric population. Different entities causing a complete ostial occlusion can lead to CMA. Endoscopically restoring maxillary sinus ventilation is the recommended treatment.","751":"The RetroX is a new semi-implantable hearing aid which does not occlude the external ear canal. It consists of an electronic unit that plugs into a titanium tube which is implanted under the pinna so as to connect the retroauricular sulcus with the inside lumen of the external ear canal. Implantation requires minor surgery which can be performed under local anesthesia. Moreover, a pre-implant simulator exists and allows patients to try the device before deciding on definite implantation. The RetroX auditory implant is indicated in case of high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss with a steep slope (ski-slope audiogram). We implanted 25 adults suffering from such a hearing loss, and we report their hearing measured after 2.5 to 15 months of use. Four patients developed a persistent granulomatous reaction which disappeared after explantation. Two patients complained of acoustic feedback and needed supplementary fitting. Twenty three of our 25 subjects are satisfied or even extremely satisfied with the hearing improvement provided by the RetroX; they wear the implant daily, from morning until evening. Audiometrically, we observed a statistically significant improvement of the pure-tone thresholds at 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz. In quiet, the speech reception thresholds decreased by 10 dB SPL and in noise, speech intelligibility increased by 15% for signal-to-noise ratios between -5 dB and +5 dB. Up till now, our patients were implanted monaurally because of financial considerations and our initial inexperience with this new implant. The overall results, however, are promising and nowadays, we advise bilateral implantation for patients who tolerate the first implant. By doing so, we hope to improve hearing in noise and spatial sound perception.","752":"We recently started a hearing screening program for the newborns of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Shanghai Children's Medical Center. The program consisted of a two-step screening stage using DPOAE and automated ABR (AABR) at the age of a few days, and a diagnostic stage including otoscopy, measuring middle ear impedance and click evoked ABR at the age of two months. Babies who were referred on either the basis of DPOAE or DPOAE-AABR screening were referred for diagnostic work-up. Of the 200 NICU infants, twenty-nine (14.5%) were referred by a single session DPOAE screening. Of these, nine (4.5%) were identified by the DPOAE-AABR screening. At the age of two months, six NICU babies (3%) had a significant hearing loss based on click-evoked ABR. None of the infants who were referred by DPOAE but had passed the AABR screening were found to have actual hearing loss. Our study reports the successful implementation of a two-step screening protocol for 'at risk' babies in Shanghai. We hope that our efforts represent a first step towards the implementation of universal hearing screening throughout the People's Republic of China.","753":"To determine the prognostic factors predictive of tumour recurrence after surgical treatment for laryngeal carcinoma with total laryngectomy. Retrospective review of 308 patients with laryngeal carcinoma who underwent total laryngectomy in the ENT Department of AHEPA University Hospital between 01\/01\/1992 and 31\/12\/1999. In 238 patients, total laryngectomy was performed as primary treatment of laryngeal carcinoma, and in 70 others as treatment of tumour recurrence following radiotherapy or partial surgery. Follow-up was standardized, following a strict protocol, the mean follow-up time was 68 months. During post-operative follow-up, recurrences were observed in 96 of 308 patients (31%). The relapse rates were 27% (65 of 238) for patients treated with primary total laryngectomy, and 44% (31 of 70) for those treated for recurrence following previous treatment. The difference in relapse rates was statistically significant. In 39 of 238 (16%) cases treated with primary total laryngectomy cervical lymph node infiltration was present at diagnosis and radical or modified neck dissection was performed. The tumour recurrence rate in this group was 46% (18 of 39), while in metastatic node-free patients the relapse rate was 24% (47 of 199) [p &lt; 0.05]. Primary laryngectomy was effective in 82% of glottic, 70% of supraglottic, and only 59% of transglottic carcinoma. Concerning primary tumour extension at the time of surgery, total laryngectomy proved effective in 85% of T2 tumours, 81% of T3, and only 55% for T4. The higher recurrence rates for supraglottic and transglottic tumours seem related mainly to the higher rates of cervical lymph node metastasis at diagnosis. The majority of tumour recurrences were observed during the first two years of post-operative follow-up. Thus, 76% of the 308 patients remained disease-free after the first year of post-operative follow-up, 68% after the second year, and 67% after the fifth follow-up year. Of the 96 recurrences documented until now, 91 were loco-regional (19 at the tracheostomy), and only 5 involved distant metastases. Sixteen of the 308 patients (5%) subjected to total laryngectomy have since developed second primary neoplasms, most often involving the lungs (10 patients). Prognostic factors for recurrence following total laryngectomy include: performance of total laryngectomy as salvage surgery, degree of tumour extension, infiltration of cervical lymph nodes at the time of initial diagnosis, poor initial tumour differentiation and trans-glottic\/sub-glottic tumour localization.
