drugs have been used for first-line treatment of moderate-to-severe acne and rosacea for decades. Recently, a new third generation tetracycline, sarecycline, was US FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. This narrow-spectrum tetracycline-derived antibiotic has been shown to be effective with an improved safety profile.","1":null,"2":null,"3":"Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections and Myelokathexis (WHIM) is a primary immunodeficiency syndrome. Patients with WHIM syndrome are more susceptible to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and commonly present to a dermatologist with recalcitrant to treatment warts. Other cardinal features of WHIM syndrome include recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections, neutropenia\/lymphopenia, low levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and myelokathexis. Research demonstrated that truncating gain-of-function mutations of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 gene (CXCR4) are responsible for this disease. Plerixafor, a specific small molecule antagonist of CXCR4, is currently used for peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization in stem cell transplant recipients. It has recently shown promise for the treatment of WHIM syndrome in phase I\/II clinical trials. In this paper we review the emerging patient clinical data for this medication and highlight the role of CXCR4 in other important skin diseases including keratinocyte carcinomas, psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.","4":"Janus kinase inhibitors, also commonly referred to as JAK inhibitors, are a novel drug class that target and block cytokine signaling mediated by the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, thereby regulating immune response and cell growth. Although JAK inhibitors are mainly used for rheumatological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, their application in the field of dermatology is actively being investigated. Tofacitinib is US FDA-approved for psoriatic arthritis and showing promise for treating psoriasis. Most recently, regulatory approvals for the US were gained by ruxolitinib as a first-inclass, selective, topical therapy for atopic dermatitis and oral upadacitinib for active psoriatic psoriasis. Additionally, abrocitinib and upadacitinib have demonstrated efficacy in atopic dermatitis and are pending FDA approval for this indication. The therapeutic potential of JAK inhibitors in dermatological conditions such as alopecia areata, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and dermatomyositis are showing promising results in clinical trials. Adverse events for JAK inhibitors seem to be similar to that of biologic drugs. Common adverse effects include increased risk of infections and thromboembolic events. Further investigation is needed to not only better understand the safety profile of JAK inhibitors, but also their full utility within the field of dermatology.","5":"The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and involves inflammation, bacterial dysbiosis, and androgen stimulation. Existing systemic therapies target hormonal pathways to mitigate acne lesions; however, their use is limited to the female population and associated with systemic adverse effects. Clascoterone is the first topical therapy to target the hormonal pathogenesis of acne approved to treat acne vulgaris. In two identical phase 3 trials, clascoterone showed favorable efficacy over placebo in treating acne, with higher treatment success and a greater reduction in acne lesions. Large scale trials are required to assess the efficacy of clascoterone against its comparators and in combination with existing acne therapies; however, results from the current phase 3 trials support the therapeutic value of clascoterone, suggesting that this novel topical androgen inhibitor represents a valuable addition to the catalogue of acne therapy.","6":"Although biologics are well-studied, expertise regarding their use is often lacking. Many biologics have been added to the market in recent years with distinctive characteristics. This study was designed to create a tool to assist physicians involved in the care of patients with psoriasis undergoing biologic treatment. We used a quality improvement approach to develop and trial an educational visual aid to deliver comprehensive information about biologics in a convenient manner. As a pilot study, trialing this tool was carried out on a small scale to test the feasibility of both the study design and the visual aid itself, with 8 physician and 8 patients completing questionnaires evaluating the visual aid. From our results, the tool was helpful for improving patient knowledge of biologic treatment and their engagement in clinical decision-making. This visual aid may serve as a central convenient biologic resource for physicians.","7":null,"8":null,"9":"Consumers of personal care products must be made aware of the potential pitfalls that arise from current labeling practices and regulations. For example, terms such as \"hypoallergenic\", \"sensitive skin\", and \"baby product\" lack legal definitions, and terms such as \"fragrance-free\" are frequently misinterpreted. Personal care products are a general category that includes such items as cosmetics, drugs, dietary supplements, and consumer goods. This overview of current US FDA regulations of products in this category reviews pertinent regulatory policies and highlights potential consumer pitfalls when evaluating product labels. In particular, current labeling laws permit the use of language that may be incomplete, misinterpreted, or applied solely for marketing purposes. It is important that consumers understand the meaning of labeling terms, the regulations that govern them, and especially understand the potential pitfalls related to these terms.","10":null,"11":"The diagnosis and classification of rosacea has been modified to reflect presenting features. On exclusion of differentials, the diagnosis of rosacea is based on the presence of either (1) phymatous changes, or (2) centrofacial persistent erythema. In their absence, diagnosis can be established by presence of any two of: flushing\/transient erythema, papules and pustules, telangiectases, or ocular manifestations. Management of rosacea depends on presenting feature(s), their severity, and impact. General management includes gentle skin care, sun protection, and trigger avoidance. Evidence-based treatment recommendations include topical brimonidine and oxymetazoline for persistent erythema; topical azelaic acid, ivermectin, metronidazole, minocycline and oral doxycycline, tetracycline and isotretinoin for papules and pustules; vascular lasers and light devices for telangiectases; and omega-3 fatty acids and cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. While surgical or laser therapy can be considered for clinically noninflamed phyma, there are no trials on their utility. Combination therapies include topical brimonidine with topical ivermectin, or topical metronidazole with oral doxycycline. Topical metronidazole, topical ivermectin, and topical azelaic acid are appropriate for maintenance therapy. In conclusion, the updated phenotype approach, based on presenting clinical features, is the foundation for current diagnosis, classification, and treatment of rosacea.","12":"Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic, recalcitrant inflammatory skin condition characterized by the presence of pruritic nodules. The exact pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, although immune and neural dysregulation are indicated in driving the itchscratch cycle. Specifically, interleukin-4 and interleukin-31 pathways have been recently implicated in transmission of the pruritic sensation. There are currently no US FDA-approved targeted therapies for the treatment of PN. This article aims to review our present understanding of the disease pathogenesis and treatments, with a focus on emerging therapeutics. Specifically, this article explores the developing use of monoclonal antibodies nemolizumab and dupilumab, opioid receptor modulation and cannabinoids as potential treatments for PN.","13":"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects about 2% of the population and is associated with many comorbidities. Recent advances have demonstrated interleukin (IL)-17 signaling plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Bimekizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody treatment for psoriasis that uses a single binding site to inhibit IL-17A and IL-17F. Here we will discuss the safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.","14":"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cutaneous disease is a common complaint for patients presenting for dermatology evaluation. Infection by HPV is the major etiologic factor in the development of cutaneous warts, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and possibly a subset of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma of the genitourinary tract, most notably cervical carcinoma, is the most severe manifestation of infection with specific serotypes of HPV. For this reason, the HPV immunization (Gardasil) was developed in 2006 and upgraded in 2018 to a nonavalent formulation that includes serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. While immunization is highly effective at preventing infection with serotypes included in the formulation, it is less clear if the immunization can aid in managing active HPV infection. This review examines the available literature regarding the role of HPV immunization in managing common warts, genital warts, keratinocyte carcinoma, and epidermodysplasia verruciformis.","15":null,"16":null,"17":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory condition marked by pruritus and traditionally treated with topical corticosteroids (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI). Crisaborole 2% ointment (a topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor) is a newer topical agent for the treatment of AD. Crisaborole is indicated for treating mild-to-moderate AD and evidence from phase 3 and phase 4 trials show that crisaborole is an effective agent with a well-tolerated side effect profile for children &gt;2 years of age. The most common side effects are pain and paresthesia at the application site. Treatments with tolerable safety profiles such as crisaborole may provide an alternative to patients with TCS phobia. The role of crisaborole in AD therapy may become clearer as multiple phase 4 trials are currently underway and their results are poised to answer more questions, including its safety profile for patients as young as 3 months of age, potential use as a steroid-sparing agent, and direct comparisons to TCS and TCI, which are the current mainstay treatments of mild-to-moderate AD.","18":"Nicotinamide (or niacinamide), a form of vitamin B3 that is often confused with its precursor nicotinic acid (or niacin), is a low-cost, evidence-based oral treatment option for actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, and bullous pemphigoid. Despite its favorable safety profile and affordability, the integration of nicotinamide into clinical practice is an ongoing process, and like many over-the-counter supplements it has faced some barriers. The purpose of this article is to address some of those barriers by reviewing its efficacy, safety profile, and emphasizing the difference between nicotinamide and niacin. Lastly, we offer practical guidance around recommendations and the availability of nicotinamide, which can be hard to find for patients and providers alike.","19":"While the association between psoriasis and various comorbidities is well documented in adults, questions remain as to whether the same relationships exist in the pediatric population. However, psoriasis develops in childhood or adolescence in approximately 40% of patients, suggesting that the risk of comorbidities may also begin early in life. This presents an opportunity for prevention, early detection and intervention for children who may suffer from, or be at risk of, comorbidities. The pediatric psoriasis Comorbidity Screening Initiative, a multidisciplinary panel, devised and published consensus-based screening recommendations for pediatric psoriasis patients in 2017. As these guidelines closely align with the routine age-related screening recommendations for healthy children set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics, in the absence of signs and symptoms of comorbidities prompting additional evaluation, dermatologists should partner with patients' primary care physicians to ensure up-to-date, routine, and age-based screening.","20":"Janus kinase inhibitors, also known as JAK inhibitors or jakinibs, represent a new class of medication that have broad potential to treat dermatologic disease. Currently, the only FDA-approved dermatologic indication for this class of medications is psoriatic arthritis; however, their utility in treating other immune-mediated skin conditions including atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and systemic and cutaneous lupus is actively being investigated. Overall, these drugs appear to be well-tolerated and have a safety profile similar to that of other biologics commonly used in dermatologic practice, although an increased risk of thromboembolism has been associated. While risk of mild infection and herpes zoster appears to be increased regardless of JAK selectivity, risk of thrombosis and malignancy based on the subtype of JAK inhibition remains to be seen. Certainly, safety concerns warrant further investigation; however, early data from ongoing clinical trials offer promise for the broad utility of these medications within future dermatologic practice.","21":"Dermatosis papulosa nigra is a benign skin lesion found most frequently on the face of patients with skin of color. Elective treatment is occasionally requested. However, in view of knowledge gaps regarding aesthetic treatments for skin of color, patients can be exposed to unnecessary risks or simply denied treatment options due to physician reservation. Cosmetic treatments should balance efficacy of lesion removal while minimizing pigmentary complications. In this review, we describe the few published treatment modalities for dermatosis papulosa nigra. Alongside established surgical techniques, laser devices including the 532-nm potassium-titanylphosphate laser, 532-nm diode laser, 585-nm pulsed dye laser, 1064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser, 1550-nm erbium-doped fractionated laser and the 10,600-nm carbon dioxide laser have been successfully reported. The insight from this review can assist in increasing our understanding of safe and effective treatments for conditions that are common on skin of color.","22":"Small-vessel vasculitides (SVV) are a group of disorders that occur due to primarily systemic inflammation or as sequelae of an infection, malignancy, or other rheumatic disease. Arising in any organ including the skin, the clinical features of SVV encompass a variety of manifestations. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment should be performed as management protocols widely differ. Although rare, physicians should be familiar with the common types of SVV to ensure prompt management and prevention of severe, life-threatening end-organ damage. Given the variable manifestations and associated etiologies of SVV, the following review aims to discuss the pathogenesis of more prevalent SVVs, highlight distinguishing features to aid in patient evaluation and diagnosis, and examine evidence-based management options for treatment and care.","23":"Psoriasis is a common, chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory disorder with significant skin manifestations and substantial burden on quality of life. Interleukin-23 is a key regulator of different effector cytokines and plays a cardinal role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, inhibits this key cytokine and thus prevents the downstream inflammatory cascade. This article aims to review our current understanding of risankizumab through the analysis of the various clinical trials.","24":"There is growing awareness of the complex link between nutrition and skin. In the last few decades, our understanding of this link has grown significantly with research findings from multiple laboratory, animal, and human studies. From the impact of diet on clinical features of aging skin, to documentation of the biochemical and histologic changes that occur, our understanding of this link continues to expand and evolve. In this paper, we review the research on the impact of diet on skin aging. A number of long-term observational population studies have documented that healthier diets are linked to fewer signs of skin aging. Animal and laboratory studies have elucidated the biochemical processes that play a large role in the development of these clinical findings. A number of studies have also reported on the role of specific dietary compounds in impacting these processes, whether by combating or potentiating these forces. This body of research serves as guidance in recommending nutritional strategies that can combat the skin aging forces of oxidation, inflammation, and glycation.","25":null,"26":"The ichthyoses, also termed the disorders of keratinization, are a heterogenous group of skin diseases in which a distinctive horny layer arises secondary to excessive transepidermal water loss. Although occasionally acquired, the majority of ichthyoses are inherited and can be pinpointed to characteristic genetic mutations. Management depends on disease severity and includes topical agents and lifestyle modifications with or without oral retinoids. Genetic counseling is also an important consideration. This review aims to highlight advances in our understanding of disease pathogenesis as well as the holistic approach necessary to adequately manage ichthyosis patients.","27":null,"28":"Methotrexate (MTX), an agent originally intended for anti-neoplastic use, has been successfully employed in the treatment of a variety of dermatologic conditions. In addition to its multiple clinical indications, variable dosing and modes of administration make it a viable option for patients of all ages and most comorbidities. MTX is a folate analog that antagonizes dihydrofolate reductase, thus inhibiting thymidylate synthesis and, ultimately, the production of pyrimidine. Depending on dosage, MTX can function as an anti-inflammatory agent, immunomodulator, or antimetabolite. Patients suffering from psoriasis have benefited from MTX in addition to those with atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and mycosis fungoides. Although patients with these conditions can benefit from MTX treatment, the drug can cause adverse sequelae, including hematologic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and hepatic side effects. Therefore, the drug should be administered under careful physician supervision.","29":"Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition associated with many comorbidities and poor quality of life. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and involves numerous proinflammatory cytokines. Many biologic therapies have been developed to block the action of these proinflammatory molecules, including inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12, and IL-23. IL-23 is composed of two subunits, p19 and p40. The p40 subunit is shared with IL-12, and inhibitors of the p40 subunit can block both IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. Recent advances in the understanding of psoriasis, however, have shown IL-23 to be more important than IL-12 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This has led to the development of IL-23p19 antagonists, the newest class of biologics for psoriasis. Here, we will discuss the safety and efficacy of tildrakizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-23p19.","30":null,"31":"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous serum containing high concentrations of platelets and growth factors. PRP continues to evolve as an important treatment modality with many applications in dermatology, particularly in the areas of hair restoration, skin rejuvenation, acne scars, dermal augmentation, and striae distensae. Furthermore, combining PRP with laser therapies, microneedling, dermal fillers, and autologous fat grafting produces synergistic effects, leading to improved aesthetic results. Future studies should standardize PRP treatment protocols for specific indications. PRP holds considerable promise in dermatology with therapeutic applications continuing to expand.","32":null,"33":"The interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors have proven to be highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis. The most recently approved agent, brodalumab, had few cases of suicidal behavior, including completed suicide, in the phase 3 clinical program leading both the US FDA and Health Canada to add a boxed warning to its label. This raises the importance of identifying the psychiatric comorbidities associated with psoriasis. It is also necessary to critically examine the data from the brodalumab clinical trial program to determine whether there is enough information to establish causality and whether other factors, other than the drug, could be playing a role.","34":"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare mucocutaneous fragility disorders often presenting in infancy and early childhood with painful blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. The severity of EB blister burden varies by disease subtype. Studies have shown that patients with generalized severe epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a variant characterized by extreme fragility, develop blisters in the setting of overproduced, mutated K14 protein, a component of the intermediate filament integral in keratinocyte stability, and constitutive activation of interleukin (IL)-1 , a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Diacerein, a rhein prodrug and anthraquinone, has been shown to reduce expression of K14 and inhibit IL-1 converting enzyme. In clinical trials, topical 1% diacerein was shown to be an effective and safe, non-invasive treatment for patients suffering from EBS. This review examines the clinical trials of topical diacerein and its role in EBS. Diacerein ointment was granted US FDA Rare Pediatric Disease designation in May 2018 and Fast Track development designation in August 2018.","35":"Vitiligo is an acquired, autoimmune disease characterized by depigmented macules and patches on the skin, which occur secondary to melanocyte destruction. Available therapeutic options are broadly divided into medical, surgical and phototherapy, though treatment of vitiligo can be challenging. Early diagnosis and management can maximize treatment efficacy. The purpose of this discussion is to review updates in the management of vitiligo, including existing and emerging therapies.","36":null,"37":null,"38":"Today, a number of treatment options are now available for metastatic melanoma. Within the last decade, the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer has significantly altered the course of the disease in patients with melanoma. With more patients receiving these potentially life-saving treatments, not only have we learned more about the interplay between the immune system and melanoma, but more importantly, which treatment options are most appropriate given the clinical picture.","39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":"Chronic pruritus remains a difficult condition to treat with many non-specific therapeutic options. Recent scientific discoveries have elucidated the physiology associated with pruritus. Combined with clinical and experimental trials with immune-modulatory agents, chronic pruritus now has novel treatment options with known mechanisms of action. This review goes over recent scientific progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms governing pruritus, the cross-talk between the immune and nervous systems that regulate itch, and central nervous pathways and projections affected by itch. In light of these recent discoveries, we briefly discuss a growing body of data from relevant clinical trials investigating immunomodulatory drugs targeting specific interleukin receptors (IL-4\/13\/31) and intracellular signaling (e.g., Janus kinase) pathways. We focus on the physiological processes that control this complex physical and emotional experience, as well as the role of newer drugs used to treat chronic itch.","43":"The Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA) is a gene expression test that helps rule out melanoma and has the potential to reduce the need for surgical biopsies of atypical pigmented skin lesions. Utilizing a new technological platform for the non-invasive profiling of skin, the assay analyzes samples collected from adhesive patches for expression of two key genes (PRAME and LINC00518) known to be overexpressed in melanoma. The test result is binary (positive\/negative) based on the detection of one or both genes. PLA positive cases are generally biopsied to establish the histopathologic diagosis, while PLA negative cases are considered for ongoing monitoring. The combination of visual inspection with histopathology, the current gold standard for melanoma diagnosis, has a relatively low negative predictive value (NPV) of approximately 83%, meaning that 17% of melanomas will be interpreted as benign lesions. In contrast, the PLA has a very high NPV (&gt;99%). Further, with its high specificity (69-91%), use of the PLA can reduce the number of false positive samples subjected to histopathology review. By adding the PLA to the current care pathway, the number of surgical biopsies needed to find a melanoma (number needed to biopsy) is markedly reduced from 20-25 biopsies for dermatologists and 39 biopsies for physician assistants, to an average of 2.7. To date, unnecessary surgical procedures of benign lesions have been reduced by 88% based on a sample of more than 20,000 analyzed cases. This has resulted in fewer missed melanomas and significant cost savings to health care systems.","44":"Most people with mild-to-moderate psoriasis manage their disease with topical therapies. However, adherence to topical treatment remains a challenge, as the daily application creates a significant treatment burden. New topical therapeutic options need to offer higher efficacy and better patient acceptability, including easier application, to reduce treatment burden and enhance patient adherence. Topical foam vehicles are innovative alternatives to creams and ointments, addressing many patient challenges with traditional vehicles. Well-designed foam vehicles are easily spread over large areas of the skin, while importantly not leaving a greasy or oily film on the skin after application. Calcipotriol\/betamethasone diproprionate aerosol foam is a new psoriasis treatment option that is rapidly effective, offers greater efficacy versus ointment and gel formulations, and has been shown to increase patient treatment satisfaction. Hence, by addressing the several crucial unmet clinical needs in patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis, this optimized foam formulation is poised to improve treatment follow-through.","45":"Chronic hand dermatitis is a debilitating inflammatory dermatosis that has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected. Alitretinoin is an oral retinoid which has proven efficacy and safety in the treatment of chronic hand dermatitis through randomized controlled trials. Real-world evidence, information gathered in the clinic or community setting, as opposed to a research environment, can complement knowledge gained from clinical trials. Herein, real-world evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of alitretinoin in the management of chronic hand dermatitis will be reviewed.","46":"The class of medications known as Janus kinase inhibitors block cytokine-mediated signaling via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, which plays an important role in immunoregulation and normal cell growth. This class includes the drugs tofacitinib, approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and ruxolitinib, approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia rubra vera. The most common adverse events (AEs) reported in patients taking tofacitinib are infections, whereas the most common AEs in patients taking ruxolitinib are anemia and thrombocytopenia. Both first and second generation Janus kinase inhibitors have become promising treatment modalities for dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, vilitigo, dermatomyositis, and graft-versus-host disease. Future promising areas of investigation include treatment of cutaneous lupus, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, melanoma, allergic contact dermatitis, and lichen planus.","47":"Histamine is a key inflammatory player in the pathogenesis of urticaria, a mast-cell-driven disease characterized clinically by the development of wheals, angioedema, or both. Changes to the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria have recently been adopted due to increasing literature surrounding the efficacy and safety of up-dosing modern second-generation H1-antihistamines and the use of omalizamub, a biologic agent, as a third-line treatment. Given the prevalence of chronic urticaria and its impact on quality of life, this editorial aims to provide a summary of the proposed updated guidelines for the management of chronic urticaria as agreed upon at the 5th Consensus Conference on the Update and Revision of the EAACI\/GA2LEN\/EDF\/WAO Guideline for Urticaria in Berlin in December 2016. The chronic urticaria treatment algorithm outlined here reflects the updates and revisions made by 43 international experts representing 40 societies from 25 countries. These guidelines have yet to be published and therefore will require approval by respective national and international boards before adoption.","48":"Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease. A lack of alpha-galactosidase activity results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in cells of various systems, leading to multi-systemic effects. The cutaneous hallmark of FD is a specific distribution of angiokeratoma. Other common symptoms include cornea verticillata, acroparesthesia, and sweating abnormalities. FD-specific symptoms, history, as well as examination of angiokeratoma can assist in the differential diagnosis. Enzyme replacement therapy is the current mainstay of treatment.","49":"Interleukin (IL)-17 is important in the pathophysiology of psoriasis and has proven to be an effective therapeutic target. Brodalumab, the third commercially available IL-17 antagonist, was approved by the US FDA in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate-tosevere plaque psoriasis. As brodalumab enters the marketplace, it is imperative to investigate its safety profile. We conducted a safety assessment of brodalumab using publically available adverse event data from phase II and III clinical trials. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and candidiasis. The FDA issued a black box warning after six patients treated with brodalumab across four clinical trials committed suicide, but no causal relationship was identified. Current evidence suggests a similar safety profile for brodalumab compared to other IL-17 antagonists used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.","50":"Hereditary angioedema is characterized by severe, episodic edema of the subcutaneous and mucosal tissue. The disease carries significant morbidity and mortality due to involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and upper airway. Recent advances in the treatment of hereditary angioedema include new techniques used to isolate and purify human-derived C1 inhibitor, the production of a recombinant form of C1 inhibitor, and the development of drugs that target the kallikrein-kinin pathway. This paper reviews the mechanisms, efficacy, and adverse reactions associated with these medications.","51":"An increasing body of research indicates that dietary change may serve as a component of therapy for certain skin conditions. This includes conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis, aging skin, psoriasis, and rosacea. Certain nutrients, foods, or dietary patterns may act as disease \"triggers\", while others may prove beneficial. Avoidance or elimination diets may be helpful in some conditions, although testing may be recommended first. In terms of beneficial effects, an eating pattern that emphasizes the consumption of whole foods over highly processed foods may help in the treatment of certain skin conditions, and will certainly help in the prevention of associated co-morbidities.","52":"Approximately 16 million Americans have rosacea, an inflammatory cutaneous disorder with central facial erythema, papules, pustules, telangiectasia, flushing, and swelling being among the more commonly recognized features. Overexpression of cathelicidin peptide LL-37 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of rosacea. Azelaic acid has been found to inhibit the pathologic expression of cathelicidin, as well as the hyperactive protease activity that cleaves cathelicidin into LL-37. Given these findings, a small prospective, open-label, interventional trial was undertaken to assess the effects of azelaic acid 15% gel on inflammatory lesions of papulopustular rosacea in a real-world setting. Use of azelaic acid was associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory lesions, which persisted beyond the active treatment phase. Overall, azelaic acid 15% gel is an appropriate initial topical therapy for the treatment of moderate facial rosacea.","53":null,"54":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are part of an emerging class of anticancer medicines known as \"targeted therapy,\" which target pathways more specific to neoplastic proliferation than traditional chemotherapeutic agents. Adverse effects of such treatments are thought to be less severe, but can still be significant. Because EGFR is preferentially expressed in epithelial tissues, including the skin and hair follicle, cutaneous side effects of these agents are quite common. Not only can these toxicities severely affect patients' quality of life, but in some specific instances, they can be associated with increased response to therapy. It is of paramount importance that clinicians familiarize themselves with and understand the basic management of the range of cutaneous adverse effects caused by these drugs.","55":"Nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3, has shown the potential to treat a variety of dermatological conditions, including acne, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of nicotinamide, in both topical and oral forms, as a chemopreventive agent against skin cancer. Its anti-carcinogenic role may be due to its ability to enhance DNA repair and prevent ultraviolet (UV)-induced immunosuppression, which is known to contribute to the progression of pre-malignant lesions. Furthermore, nicotinamide is a precursor of essential coenzymes for many important reactions in the body, including the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a key coenzyme in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which transports chemical energy within cells. Therefore, nicotinamide plays a significant role in supporting energy-dependent cellular processes, including DNA repair.","56":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are common, worldwide viral illnesses that potentially impact the clinician's ability to manage patients with immunosuppressive medications such as biological therapy. In light of recent literature reviews, patients with HBV and HCV should be referred to a hepatologist or infectious disease expert prior to initiation of biological therapy.","57":null,"58":"A triad approach to the treatment of acne and rosacea has been recommended. This integrated management approach includes patient education, selection of therapeutic agents, and initiation of an appropriate skin care regime. Proper skin care in patients undergoing treatment of both acne and rosacea includes use of products formulated for sensitive skin that cleanse, moisturize and photoprotect the skin. Both acne and rosacea are associated with epidermal barrier dysfunction, which can be mitigated by suitable skin care practices. Appropriate skin care recommendations for patients with acne and rosacea will be discussed.","59":"Psoriasis is a chronic condition that affects the well-being and quality of life of patients. The disease is associated with an increased risk of depression and suicidality, which may not be fully understood by the general population. It is crucial to understand the effect this disease has on mental health and determine risk factors that may help identify patients who are susceptible to depression and suicidality. Risk factors discussed in this article include age, gender, and severity of disease in psoriasis patients. Of these, age and severity of disease are significant with a clear association of increased depression and suicidality found in patients who are younger or have more severe disease. Although there is evidence that psoriasis treatments can improve both disease and associated depression symptoms, there are high rates of undertreatment. By identifying high-risk psoriasis patients, dermatologists can aim for optimal treatment of the disease and thus help alleviate the associated psychiatric burden.","60":"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects 2% of the population. Evidence suggests that interleukin (IL)-23 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Guselkumab is a subcutaneously administered, humanized anti-IL23 monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Data from Phase I-III trials in this patient population reveal that guselkumab has proven to be superior to placebo or adalimumab based on achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90% reduction, or a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 from baseline. This article reviews the current status of guselkumab as a therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.","61":"Tofacitinib is an oral immunosuppressant approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is currently undergoing investigation (Phase III trials) for treating chronic plaque psoriasis. Tofacitinib inhibits Janus kinases (JAKs), which are essential for the signaling of multiple inflammatory pathways and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA and psoriasis. The efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the treatment of RA and psoriasis have been demonstrated in Phase III trials. Across all studies, the efficacy of tofacitinib in alleviating symptoms of RA and psoriasis were superior to placebo. Moreover, treatment was generally well-tolerated, with the most frequently reported adverse events, for both RA and psoriasis, being nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. As such, tofacitinib proves to be an effective therapeutic option for RA and a promising new therapy for psoriasis.","62":"Dermatologists have within their armamentarium numerous immunosuppressant agents, both traditional and new, that are useful in the treatment of chronic cutaneous disorders such as autoimmune bullous diseases and psoriasis. It is imperative that users of these agents are aware of potential sequelae from therapy, particularly infections. In this review, we summarize the most common immunosuppressant medications currently used in dermatology, and provide recommendations for infection screening prior to initiating treatment.","63":"Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease with epidermal hyperplasia that affects 2-3% of the population. Interleukin (IL)-17 signaling has a central role in its pathogenesis. Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-17 receptor type A. Brodalumab is highly effective in the reversal of psoriatic phenotype and gene expression patterns.","64":null,"65":"Psoriasis is a multifactorial chronic skin disease that can have significant detrimental effects on patients' physical, mental, antibodypsychosocial wellbeing. Patients often suffer from a decreased quality of life along with numerous comorbidities. Recent advances in our understanding of the innate and adaptive immune systems have led to the identification of interleukin (IL)-17 as a key pro-inflammatory mediator in psoriasis. This knowledge has in turn led to the development of newer biologic agents that have been shown to be more effective than traditional therapies. In this article, we review phase 1-3 clinical trials of the anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody, ixekizumab, for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.","66":"Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with considerable potential in dermatology due to an increase in off-label indications. Chronic graft-versus-host disease and pemphigus vulgaris are two of the most promising indications for off-label use of rituximab. It is a generally safe alternative that should be considered when traditional therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants has failed or caused significant intolerance. Currently, rituximab is only FDA-approved for treatment of follicular and diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis. Herein, off-label uses of rituximab and its efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous diseases are reviewed. ","67":null,"68":"Frontal fibrosing alopecia, described just over 20 years ago, has become one of the most frequently seen causes of scarring alopecia at many specialist hair clinics. Considered a clinical variant of lichen planopilaris (LPP), it has distinctive features and associations which distinguish it from LPP. Although largely affecting postmenopausal women, a small but increasing number of men and premenopausal women are affected. The spectrum of the disease has expanded from involvement of the frontal hairline and eyebrows, to potentially affecting the entire hairline, facial and body hair. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated but the aetiology remains uncertain. A range of treatments have been used in management of the condition, but clinical trials are required to establish effectiveness. ","69":null,"70":"Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) have been proposed as an alternative, long-term treatment option to topical corticosteroids, without the side effects commonly associated with steroid use. Currently, TCIs are only approved for treatment of atopic dermatitis in patients 2 years of age or older. This article reviews the off-label uses of TCIs and their efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous diseases. Studies show that TCIs may be effective in treating\/managing a variety of skin conditions. The strongest evidence based support on clinical outcomes has been reported for allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and vitiligo. ","71":null,"72":"Onychomycosis is a stubborn fungal infection of the nails that can be difficult to effectively manage. One of the challenges with topical therapies is penetrating the nail plate to reach the site of infection. As the first antifungal in a boron-containing class of drugs with a novel mechanism of action, tavaborole is able to penetrate the nail plate more effectively than ciclopirox and amorolfine lacquers. In Phase II\/III clinical trials, tavaborole was shown to be safe and clinically effective. Tavaborole 5% solution was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in July 2014 and is an important addition to the topical treatment arsenal against this stubborn infection. ","73":"First described in the context of diabetes, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed through a type of non-enzymatic reaction called glycation. Increased accumulation of AGEs in human tissue has now been associated with end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and, recently, skin aging. Characteristic findings of aging skin, including decreased resistance to mechanical stress, impaired wound healing, and distorted dermal vasculature, can be in part attributable to glycation. Multiple factors mediate cutaneous senescence, and these factors are generally characterized as endogenous (e.g., telomere shortening) or exogenous (e.g., ultraviolet radiation exposure). Interestingly, AGEs exert their pathophysiological effects from both endogenous and exogenous routes. The former entails the consumption of sugar in the diet, which then covalently binds an electron from a donor molecule to form an AGE. The latter process mostly refers to the formation of AGEs through cooking. Recent studies have revealed that certain methods of food preparation (i.e., grilling, frying, and roasting) produce much higher levels of AGEs than water-based cooking methods such as boiling and steaming. Moreover, several dietary compounds have emerged as promising candidates for the inhibition of glycation-mediated aging. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the critical role of glycation in skin aging and highlight preliminary studies on dietary strategies that may be able to combat this process. ","74":"Up to a third of dermatology outpatients have a significant psychiatric issue complicating their skin complaint. Although the ideal would frequently involve psychiatric assessment, those with comorbid mental illness often refuse psychiatric referral. As a result, it is imperative that dermatologists be mindful of psychiatric comorbidity in their patients and comfortable with the fundamentals of psychodermatologic diagnosis and therapy. This update summarizes current concepts, relevance, and therapeutics in psychodermatology, including aspects pertinent to depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, impulse-control, and delusional disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5, published in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association). ","75":null,"76":null,"77":"Atopic dermatitis results when aberrant barrier function and immune activation occur within the skin. Standard therapies for atopic dermatitis have fallen short, prompting efforts to discover novel therapeutics for this disease. Of these, dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the actions of both IL-4 and IL-13, has shown the greatest promise. Clinical trials of systemic dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have demonstrated marked improvement in patient symptoms, including pruritus and clinically visible disease. Importantly, dupilumab treatment has been correlated with changes in the molecular signature of diseased skin, with reduction of both inflammatory and proliferative markers. Dupilumab recently received US FDA breakthrough therapy designation for atopic dermatitis, with ongoing trials in both adult and pediatric populations. Altogether, dupilumab has shed new light on the pathomechanisms driving atopic dermatitis and is making unprecedented advances towards highly effective control of this debilitating disease. ","78":"Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs), often caused by aerobic gram-positive cocci, are most often mild-tomoderate infections that can easily be treated in an outpatient setting. With the rates of these infections substantially increasing in the past decade, owing in part to the emergence of community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), alternative options for the treatment of ABSSSIs are necessary. This editorial reviews the mechanism of action, efficacy, bacterial coverage, and potential side effect profiles for dalbavancin and oritavancin, both semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotics, and tedizolid, an oxazolidinone. Dalbavancin, oritavancin, and tedizolid have been extremely valuable additions to treatment options for ABSSSIs due to the convenient dosing regimen and the fact that there are fewer resistant organisms to these therapies at this time. ","79":"Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is a key enzyme in the regulation of immune responses of inflammatory diseases through degradation of the second messenger, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Apremilast, a selective PDE4 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by increasing intracellular levels of cAMP and promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The efficacy and safety of apremilast in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has been demonstrated in phase 2 and 3 studies and will be reviewed here. Across all studies, treatment was generally well-tolerated with some mild gastrointestinal complaints that occurred early and resolved over time, resulting in few drop-outs. Meaningful changes in dactylitis and enthesitis were also observed. Routine monitoring is not required given the absence of drug associated physiologic, biochemical, and haematological changes. Apremilast proves to be a new promising systemic therapy for treating psoriatic disease. ","80":"The etiology of papulopustular rosacea (PPR) is not well understood yet appears to involve both the innate and adaptive immune response in addition to possible infestation with Demodex mites. Current treatments for PPR consist mainly of antibiotics. Ivermectin cream 1%, a new topical treatment for PPR, possesses both anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic properties. After 12 weeks of treatment, subjects treated with ivermectin cream 1% had significantly greater reductions in PPR symptoms and enhanced diseaserelated quality of life improvements compared to subjects who received vehicle. Furthermore, PPR symptoms continued to improve with prolonged treatment (40 weeks). Ivermectin cream 1% offers a multi-pronged approach to combat the complex pathophysiology of rosacea. ","81":"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic disease of the follicular unit that often leads to marked impairment of quality of life and usually affects the axillary, perineum and inframammary regions resulting in tender subcutaneous nodules, abscesses, fibrosis and sinus tract formation. New updates on HS underscores the role of various genes as well as the innate and adaptive immune response in its pathogenesis. Although every patient requires an individualized approach to treatment, topical therapy and antibiotics are mainly used for mild to moderate disease, whereas various systemic immune modulators and\/or surgical approaches play a pivotal role in moderate to severe disease. New treatments using various immune modulators, laser modalities and other novel agents provide clinicians with better ways of managing HS. ","82":"The scalp is involved in up to 80% of individuals with psoriasis. Eighty percent of those with scalp psoriasis experience a negative impact on quality of life. Topical treatment with corticosteroids with or without vitamin D3 analogues is the mainstay of treatment. Topical therapy most suitable for the scalp is formulated as a solution, lotion, gel, foam, spray, oil, or shampoo. Twice weekly maintenance in frequent relapsers may decrease the time to first relapse. Intralesional steroids, phototherapy and the excimer laser are occasionally used for resistant cases. In patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, apremilast, adalimumab and etanercept have been shown to significantly improve scalp psoriasis. They should be considered in patients who have failed topical therapy. ","83":"Prescribing medications off-label is commonplace in dermatology. Recent policy changes on the regulatory abilities of the US FDA and legal precedents regarding this topic have led to intense debate on free speech about off-label drug use by physicians and drug manufacturers. Here, we summarize and discuss the risks and benefits of off-label promotion and how this relates to quality patient care in dermatology. ","84":"Men are a fast growing segment of the aesthetic industry. A review was performed for publications on gender differences in facial anatomy, behavior, and the use of minimally invasive aesthetic procedures in men. There are substantial facial anatomical differences between genders with men having a larger but unique cranial shape, increased skeletal muscle mass, unique subcutaneous fat distribution, and more severe facial rhytides. Men also exhibit poor behavior that can accelerate aging including poor utilization of preventive health care services, higher rates of smoking, and increased ultraviolet light exposure. Despite gender differences in facial anatomy and behavior, few studies have examined the role of gender in cosmetic procedures. Men require a unique injection technique with botulinum toxin and dermal fillers due to differences in facial anatomy. ","85":"In the past three decades, major advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The currently accepted theory is that T-cell mediated immune dysregulation triggers keratinocyte hyperproliferation in psoriasis. Recent research indicates that the Th17\/interleukin (IL)-23 pathway plays a prominent role in the amplification phase of psoriasis. The discovery of the Th17\/ IL-23 pathway provides targets for new drug development. This review focuses on the role of IL-23 in psoriasis pathogenesis and the current therapies targeting IL-23 that are in clinical trials. ","86":"External genital warts (EGWs) resulting from the human papilloma virus (HPV) are a common sexually transmitted infection and cause significant impairments in patient quality of life and sexual well-being. Therapeutic options for EGWs can be provider-assisted, but many patients opt for treatment that can be applied at home. Sinecatechins 10% ointment is a new botanically based patient-administered therapy for EGWs. It is comprised of &gt;85% catechins, green tea polyphenols that have been shown to possess antioxidant, antiproliferative, antiviral, and antitumor properties. Phase III trials of sinecatechins 10% ointment have demonstrated higher efficacy and lower recurrence rates compared to currently available patient-applied treatments. Therefore, sinecatechins 10% ointment presents an alternative self-administered topical treatment for EGWs.","87":"Acting on keratinocytes to produce antimicrobial peptides and chemokines, which in turn attract neutrophils and other inflammatory cells, interleukin-17 (IL-17) is believed to be a potent driver of plaque psoriasis. Its proinflammatory characteristics make IL-17 an attractive therapeutic target for addressing immune dysregulation. This review examines the role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis and the potential implications of its inhibition. The efficacy and safety results from Phase 2 and 3 trials with monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-17RA (brodalumab), and IL-17A (ixekizumab and secukinumab) validate IL-17 as an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. ","88":"Minoxidil is a Health Canada and US FDA-approved medication for hair loss in men and women. While 5% minoxidil foam has been approved for men since 2006, Health Canada and the FDA only approved 5% minoxidil foam for female pattern hair loss (FPHL) in 2014. Recent Phase III clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of once daily 5% minoxidil foam for treatment of FPHL, where a significant change from baseline in the target area hair count was observed compared to placebo. Similar changes in hair count for 5% foam and twice daily 2% minoxidil solution established noninferiority of the 5% foam formulation. Five percent minoxidil foam provides an additional option for women with FPHL and will soon be available in Canada. ","89":"Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a common autoimmune skin condition characterized by spontaneously recurring hives for 6 weeks or longer. The new terminology used for CIU in most countries including Canada is chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). CSU is associated with significant psychosocial morbidity with a markedly negative impact on overall quality of life. Conventional approaches with antihistamines, even at high doses, is effective in about 50% of patients suffering from CSU. A new treatment option, omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the Fc domain of IgE, has undergone the scrutiny of randomized research studies evaluating the efficacy in CSU. This editorial reviews mechanisms of action of omalizumab, efficacy, cost and potential side effect profile. Omalizumab has emerged as a very promising treatment option for patients with CSU. Future research is necessary to establish standardized protocols related to dosing as well as monitoring possible adverse effects of long-term treatment. ","90":"The pregnancy-specific skin disorders are pruritic, inflammatory eruptions. The current classification by Ambros-Rudolph et al. includes four entities: pemphigoid gestationis (PG), polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP), atopic eruption of pregnancy (AEP), and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). Although these disorders are all characterized by intense pruritus during pregnancy, they can be distinguished by timing, morphology, histopathology, treatment and potential for fetal complications. Diagnosis is made by clinical presentation, histology, and immunofluorescence. PEP and AEP typically resolve without sequelae; however, PG may lead to prematurity and low birth weight, and ICP is associated with an increased risk of prematurity, fetal distress, and intrauterine fetal demise. The potential for serious fetal complications necessitates a thorough evaluation of pregnancy-related pruritus. This article will discuss the skin disorders specific to pregnancy, with a focus on clinical presentation, potential for fetal complications, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. ","91":"Autoimmune blistering diseases are rare, but potentially debilitating cutaneous disorders characterized by varying degrees of mucosal and cutaneous bullae formation. Topical therapy is appropriate for mild and even some moderate disease activity, but systemic treatment can be considered for more extensive involvement. Corticosteroids remain the first-line systemic therapy for patients with moderate to severe bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris. While the use of systemic steroids has dramatically reduced mortality from these two autoimmune blistering disorders, treatment is also associated with multiple side effects, especially when used long-term. Steroid sparing agents, therefore, are invaluable in inducing long-term remission while minimizing steroid associated side effects. Treatment must be tailored to the individual patient's condition, and several other factors must be carefully considered in choosing appropriate therapy: 1) diagnosis, 2) severity of the condition and body site affected, 3) presence of comorbidities, and 4) ability to tolerate systemic therapy. ","92":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting children and adolescents worldwide. The relationship of AD to diet has been a matter of curiosity for many years. Here we look at the evidence in the literature of the association between AD and diet, and the effectiveness of elimination diets and diet supplementation in the management of AD. Several studies have found an association between clinical food allergy and AD, and more recent investigations have also suggested that dietary elements may promote late AD exacerbations. Diet elimination trials in select patients who are clinically allergic to eggs have shown promise in reducing symptoms. Additionally, elimination of food additives in a subgroup of patients was found to be beneficial. Finally, diet supplementations with evening primrose oil and an omega-3 fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid) may be appropriate in certain AD candidates. ","93":null,"94":null,"95":"Rosacea is a common, chronic cutaneous condition that affects the face. Two topicals and one oral medication are currently approved for the treatment of rosacea, including azelaic acid, metronidazole, and sub-antimicrobial dose of doxycycline. Identification of subtypes can help guide treatment strategies. It is essential for psychosocial implications of rosacea to be considered and conservative management, such as nonpharmacologic routine skin care, must form an important part of the overall care. Recently, new insights into the pathophysiology of rosacea have led to the emergence of etiologically oriented treatments. Ivermectin, an acaricidal agent that has been shown to be effective against rosacea refractory to other therapies, is currently in Phase 3 trials. Brimonidine, which was US FDA approved last year and recently sanctioned by Health Canada, has filled an essential therapeutic void in the targeted treatment of diffuse facial erythema. ","96":"Molluscum contagiosum is a poxvirus infection of the skin that is commonly observed in children. The molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) expresses several gene-products that are involved in its pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune system. MCV can be transmitted both to other sites of the body and to other individuals through direct physical contact as well as fomites. While diagnosis is generally straightforward clinically, management of molluscum contagiosum is controversial. Several treatment options are available for the destruction of individual lesions, but there is insufficient evidence for therapeutic intervention being any more effective than natural, spontaneous resolution. Complex cases, such as infection occurring in immunocompromised patients and in mucocutaneous sites, require an alternative approach to management. Molluscum contagiosum continues to represent a burden on children and parents worldwide. ","97":"The last couple of years have seen the beginning of a new era in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This disease is typically characterized by its poor prognosis and limited choice of therapy. Two mechanistically diverse classes of agents - BRAF inhibitors and immune modulators - have demonstrated an overall survival benefit. Along with their significant clinical benefits, there are also unique adverse events (AEs) related to these agents. While most of the AEs are mild and easily managed with supportive treatment, others require more aggressive management strategies. Education of all members of the multidisciplinary care team and awareness of these toxicities are crucial in order to optimize patient outcomes. The landscape of melanoma is continually evolving as ongoing trials are evaluating monotherapy and combination options. While these regimens continue to show promise for the future, understanding and managing toxicities of currently available therapies is required. ","98":"Topical corticosteroids (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are very effective treatments in inflammatory dermatoses, but carry risks with long-term use. TCS are associated with cutaneous atrophy and tachyphylaxis and TCIs can be irritating and contain a black box warning of an increased risk of cancers including lymphoma and non-melanomatous skin cancers. Nevertheless, they are appropriate treatments for inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) and should be used more often with disease flares and less as maintenance therapy. Given the associated risks of long-term continuous use with these pharmacologic agents, alternatives are needed with similar anti-inflammatory and barrier repair properties that can be used indefinitely without risk. Some over-the-counter (OTC) ingredients such as colloidal oatmeal and petrolatum, as well as anti-inflammatory prescription moisturizers (medical device creams), have demonstrated efficacy with little complications in skin barrier repair and symptom relief in steroid-responsive conditions. With regimented application, these non-drug options are safe and effective and can limit the longterm continuous use of TCS or TCIs. ","99":null,"100":"Hair loss is a widespread complaint that carries a significant psychosocial burden for affected individuals. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the predominant cause of hair loss seen in the dermatology clinic. Although a range of therapies are available, minoxidil remains the only approved topical treatment for AGA. Promising new topical agents are under current investigation. ","101":"The skin is often a window to systemic disease that is available to the trained eye of the dermatologist. Herein, we focus on four dermatoses with associated systemic conditions of interest: scleromyxedema and monoclonal gammopathy, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in the setting of renal insufficiency, dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease, and psoriasis as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Dermatologists can play a crucial role in recognizing the cutaneous manifestations linked with these conditions. Identifying the related underlying disorder will contribute to appropriate diagnosis and improved management. ","102":null,"103":"Psoriasis is a chronic condition which requires ongoing management with therapies that have demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy profiles in long-term use. While biologics changed the way psoriasis is treated by providing effective targeted therapy, they are not without limitations. However, small molecules are emerging therapeutic options for the treatment of psoriasis. Several oral and topical small molecules, spanning different therapeutic classes, are proving to be promising treatment options in psoriasis. While studies to date have yielded positive results, further investigation of these agents are warranted for both safety and efficacy. ","104":null,"105":null,"106":"Esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (parabens) are the most widely used preservatives in cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and industrial products. However, since the 1960s, controversy has surrounded its use and safety as a potential cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Despite the cloud of suspicion that has hovered over parabens ever since, these ubiquitous compounds have withstood four decades of extensive skin testing conducted by a variety of organizations, both North American and European, and now, it seems parabens have shown to be one of the least sensitizing preservatives in commercial use. Of the very limited reports of paraben-induced allergic contact dermatitis, these cases are often attributable to the application of parabens on damaged skin. ","107":"Administration of antibiotics, often for prolonged periods, has become the de facto standard of care for acne (and rosacea). However, the world is now facing a health crisis relating to widespread antibiotic resistance. The authors provide current evidence to suggest that dermatologists should consider a radical departure from standard operating procedure by severely curtailing, if not outright discontinuing, the routine and regular use of antibiotics for acne. ","108":"Methotrexate has been used for over half a century to treat a wide spectrum of skin conditions. It is a valuable steroid sparing agent, preventing protracted steroid courses and their undesirable side effects. While many alternative therapies exist and continue to emerge to treat these dermatologic conditions, the long history, affordability, and relative safety associated with methotrexate ensure its enduring utility. Further, ongoing research focusing on the pharmacogenetic properties of the drug may allow for more effective and targeted therapeutic strategies.","109":"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune, pleiomorphic, papulovesicular disorder associated with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. DH is characterized by subepidermal bullae on hematoxylin and eosin staining and granular immunoglobulin A deposits in the dermal papillae using the direct immunofluorescence method. Antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and epidermal transgulatminase can be measured serologically, although biopsy is still required for definitive diagnosis of DH. Gluten free diet (GFD) is the first-line therapeutic approach that can alleviate both cutaneous and intestinal manifestations of this condition, while dapsone and sulfones target the skin eruption only. Combined therapy with GFD and dapsone is an initial treatment of choice to control the cutaneous manifestations of DH. This article will provide a comprehensive review of DH, including its epidemiology, clinical and pathological findings, diagnostic evaluation, and management.","110":"Parabens are preservatives used in a variety of personal care, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food products. Studies have confirmed the ubiquitous presence of parabens, with levels detected in wastewater, rivers, soil and house dust. Parabens have also been detected in human tissues and bodily fluids, but it is the discovery of these chemical compounds in the breast tissue of patients with breast cancer that has raised public concern over their use. It is hypothesized that the estrogenic properties of parabens may play a role in breast cancer development. However, studies investigating the health effects of parabens are conflicting. At this point, there is an insufficient amount of data suggesting serious consequences from paraben use and exposure to warrant drastic avoidance measures or government regulations.","111":null,"112":"Urticaria and angioedema are common allergic manifestations and some forms of this disorder may be increasing in both prevalence and severity due to changes in medications, environment and other unknown factors. This review focuses on a rational approach to differential diagnosis and therapy of the most common forms of urticaria and angioedema.","113":"Skin cancer in organ transplant recipients is a serious problem that manifests as increased squamous cell carcinoma in longterm patients. In these patients, a combination of cumulative sun exposure as well as the immunosuppressive effects of transplant medications can cause cutaneous malignancy. Skin cancer can affect transplant patients in multiple ways. It can decrease quality of life by causing various separate skin cancers that require frequent and sometimes painful treatment, as well as possibly result in disfigurement. The more aggressive tumors pose a risk of metastasis and death. Clinical efforts aimed at reduction in skin cancers in this high-risk population include increased education and surveillance, aggressive treatment of skin cancers and pre-cancers, changes to immunosuppressive regimens, and retinoid chemoprevention.","114":null,"115":"Rosacea is a common chronic skin disorder that has significant impact on the self-esteem and quality of life of affected individuals. Currently understood as an inflammatory condition that occurs in the context of an altered innate immune response, the available topical and systemic therapies function as immunomodulators to restore cutaneous homeostasis. The goals of therapy include reduction of papules, pustules, erythema and physical discomfort with improvement in quality of life. Standard topical treatments include metronidazole and azelaic acid, although many other agents and regimens have been presented. Subantimicrobial\/antiinflammatory dose oral doxycycline was US FDA approved in 2006 for the management of rosacea, but Health Canada clearance was only recently granted for this indication. Furthermore, renewed research interest has led to the development of other emerging therapies including topical ivermectin, brimonidine and oxymetazoline that hold promise for patients suffering from this condition.","116":"Device-based therapies are promising alternatives for the treatment of onychomycosis because they can mitigate some of the negative factors associated with treatment failure. There are four categories of device-based treatments: laser devices, photodynamic therapy, iontophoresis, and ultrasound. These therapeutic modalities are noninvasive procedures that are carried out by medical professionals, reduce the need for long-term patient adherence, and avoid adverse reactions associated with conventional systemic antifungal therapies.","117":"Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is an anaerobic bacteria implicated in the pathogenesis of acne. The last 30 years have witnessed an alarming increase in resistance to antibiotics commonly employed to treat acne. Antibiotic resistance in acne represents a significant international public health concern because resistance can occur in more pathogenic bacteria than P. acnes, and an increase in pathogenic P. acnes has been reported. Current treatment guidelines offer strategies to limit the potential for resistance while achieving optimal outcome in the management of inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne.","118":"Pressure ulcer prevention and treatment remains a challenge for interprofessional teams in all health care sectors. Evidencebased pressure ulcer guidelines can be simplified with a bedside enabler utilizing the wound bed preparation paradigm. Key steps involve treatment of the cause, addressing patient-centered concerns, and administering local wound care (debridement, infection\/ inflammation control, and moisture balance before considering advanced therapies with the edge effect). Optimal outcomes are achievable with a multi-disciplinary approach that supports patients and their circle of care, which is central to every evaluation and course of treatment decisions.","119":"Dapsone 5% gel for the topical treatment for acne vulgaris was recently introduced in Canada. It represents the first new anti-acne agent to gain North American regulatory approval in the past decade. Dapsone's utility is attributable to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that improve both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, with more prominent effects occurring in inflammatory lesions. Short- and long-term safety and efficacy have been demonstrated. Especially for patients exhibiting sensitivities or intolerance to conventional anti-acne agents, topical dapsone is a novel addition to the treatment armamentarium.","120":"This review summarizes and discusses the role and efficacy of moisturizers, particularly the more recently introduced ceramide-based formulations, in the skin care regimen of patients with both active and quiescent atopic dermatitis (AD). It is now well established that a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors are responsible for disease onset and chronicity. Indeed, several novel genetic mechanisms have been recently discovered to be associated with AD pathogenesis. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that the epidermal barrier plays a critical role in the initiation, perpetuation, and exacerbation of AD. The skin of patients with AD harbors several defects in epidermal barrier function, including filaggrin and ceramides. An improved understanding of these etiopathogenic factors has led to the development of topical ceramide-dominant moisturizers to replace the deficient molecules and re-establish the integrity of barrier defenses. Some of these products have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of adult and childhood AD that are similar to mid-potency topical steroids. More importantly, they have been shown to be safe with very few associated side-effects. We recommend the addition of such new agents as both the first step of treatment and in the maintenance of clinically quiescent skin of patients with AD.","121":"Biofilms are diverse communities of microorganisms embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance which are firmly attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces. Approximately 80% of all human infections are associated with biofilms and evidence for their role in an ever-growing number of cutaneous disorders is constantly unfolding. Biofilms present a difficult challenge to clinicians due to their persistent nature, inability to be cultured with standard techniques, and resistance to conventional antimicrobial therapy. Although limited treatment options are presently available, better understanding of the molecular biology of biofilms and their pathogenicity will likely lead to the development of novel anti-biofilm agents for clinical use.","122":"Transdermal drug delivery allows for a constant rate of drug administration and prolonged action, which can be beneficial to elderly patients who are often polymedicated. Several studies have compared dermatopharmacokinetics in the young and elderly with conflicting results. Despite the potential limitations of age-related changes in skin factors and cutaneous metabolism, marketed transdermal products generally do not report age-related differences in pharmacokinetics. This overview discusses the current data, summarizes marketed product findings and highlights the importance of further studies to evaluate age-related dermatopharmacokinetics.","123":"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) may affect up to 70% of men and 40% of women at some point in their lifetime. While men typically present with a distinctive alopecia pattern involving hairline recession and vertex balding, women normally exhibit a diffuse hair thinning over the top of their scalps. The treatment standard in dermatology clinics continues to be minoxidil and finasteride with hair transplantation as a surgical option. Here we briefly review current therapeutic options and treatments under active investigation. Dutasteride and ketoconazole are also employed for AGA, while prostaglandin analogues latanoprost and bimatoprost are being investigated for their hair growth promoting potential. Laser treatment products available for home use and from cosmetic clinics are becoming popular. In the future, new cell mediated treatment approaches may be available for AGA. While there are a number of potential treatment options, good clinical trial data proving hair growth efficacy is limited.","124":"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition with negative impacts both physical and psychological. Scalp psoriasis, especially around the hairline, can cause significant impairment in quality of life due to its visibility. Options for treatment of facial psoriasis, including hairline involvement, are the use of low potency topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin D analogues. Though the use of excimer laser for scalp psoriasis has been reported, there are no cases or studies specifically examining excimer laser phototherapy for the treatment of hairline psoriasis. We present a case of rapid improvement of hairline psoriasis using a regimen of 308 nm excimer laser with clobetasol spray and recommend an algorithm for the optimal treatment of scalp psoriasis utilizing currently available antipsoriatic therapies.","125":"Changes in the skin that occur in the elderly may put them at increased risk for altered percutaneous penetration from pharmacotherapy along with potential adverse effects. Skin factors that may have a role in age-related percutaneous penetration include blood flow, pH, skin thickness, hair and pore density, and the content and structure of proteins, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), water, and lipids. Each factor is examined as a function of increasing age along with its potential impact on percutaneous penetration. Additionally, topical drugs that successfully overcome the barrier function of the skin can still fall victim to cutaneous metabolism, thereby producing metabolites that may have increased or decreased activity. This overview discusses the current data and highlights the importance of further studies to evaluate the impact of skin factors in age-related percutaneous penetration.","126":"Imiquimod 3.75% cream has recently been approved by both the U.S. Federal Drug Administration and Health Canada for the treatment of external genital warts. Herein, we provide an overview of external genital warts, review the phase 3 clinical trials leading to the approval of imiquimod 3.75% cream, and compare its efficacy and clinical use with imiquimod 5% cream. Moreover, therapeutic options have further expanded with the relatively recent introduction of sinecatechins 15% ointment, an extract of green tea leaves.","127":"Biologic compounds are being used more frequently to treat a multitude of systemic inflammatory conditions. These novel compounds are composed of antibodies or other peptides that act through one of three mechanisms: inhibiting inflammatory cytokine signaling (typically tumor necrosis factor or TNF), inhibiting T-cell activation, or depleting B-cells. The increase in use and ever expanding list of new immune modulating therapies make knowledge of the infectious complications associated with immune modulation even more important. Of particular concern is the risk for developing atypical and opportunistic infections including tuberculosis, herpes zoster, Legionella pneumophila, and Listeria monocytogenes.","128":null,"129":"Scabies is a common contagious parasitic dermatosis. Transmission of the mite Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis generally occurs by skin-to-skin contact, but with crusted scabies it may also occur through fomites, such as infected clothing or bedding. Diagnosis is usually clinical. A 2010 updated Cochrane review concluded that management of scabies is based on topical scabicides, mainly 5% permethrin. However, oral ivermectin, although not licensed in many countries, may be useful, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate or comply with topical therapy and in institutional scabies epidemics. Patients should also receive detailed information about the infestation to limit further spreading. Cases resulting from close physical or sexual contact, even without symptoms, should be systematically treated. Hygienic measures should be taken after treatment is completed. Patients should be followed to confirm cure, including resolution of itching, which may take up to 4 weeks or longer.","130":"Acne scarring is often challenging to manage. Various laser treatments are helpful in addressing abnormal color and texture in order to improve the appearance of an acne scar. This paper will review the appropriate use and side-effects of these laser treatments.","131":"The incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer continues to increase. While surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment, growing demand from patients for effective, tissue-sparing approaches with good cosmetic results has led to the development of novel therapeutic agents. Several studies have reported on the safety and efficacy of topical ingenol mebutate gel, a derivative of the plant Euphorbia peplus, in the treatment of actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma. An understanding of the history, mechanism of action, and recent trial evidence for this emerging therapy can assist physicians in counseling patients on available treatment options and in selecting appropriate therapy.","132":"Several variants of psoriasis are seen in children, the most prevalent types include plaque, guttate, and psoriatic diaper rash; pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis are less frequently observed. Genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers are both involved in the development of this autoimmune disease. As well as improving symptoms, a treatment plan should strive to identify and eliminate precipitating factors. Topical medications are the first choice therapy for children with psoriasis. Systemic agents are used to treat more severe cases. Patient education and supportive care should be incorporated into the treatment plan.","133":"High intensity long-wavelength ultraviolet A (340-400 nm; UVA1) lamps were initially developed as skin research tools; over time they have proven to be useful for treating a number of chronic dermatoses. UVA1 units and dosimetry are strikingly different from conventional UV phototherapy. The therapeutic effect of UVA1 is related to the fact that its long wavelength penetrates the dermis more deeply than UVB. UVA1 radiation induces collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1) expression, T-cell apoptosis, and depletes Langerhans and mast cells in the dermis. UVA1 exposure stimulates endothelial cells to undergo neovascularization. Ultraviolet A1 exerts significant therapeutic effects in atopic dermatitis and morphea; there is also evidence for its use in other skin diseases, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and mastocytosis.","134":"Clinical studies with topical and systemic agents for acne show remarkable improvement over a 3 month period of time, with continued progress in long-term use. However, in clinical practice it is uncommon to see these favorable results. Clinical experience and recent published data suggest that compliance, perhaps better referred to as adherence, is a major obstacle in achieving these outcomes. This article will review this problem and offer a number of suggestions, including dosing considerations and the use of laser\/light devices, to better treat the nonadherent patient.","135":"Since the elucidation of the concept of selective photothermolysis, quality-switched lasers have been the gold standard for tattoo removal. Proper patient education prior to commencing treatment is crucial to ensure realistic expectations and compliance. This article reviews appropriate device selection and technique. Clinical pearls and pitfalls are presented, as well as cutting-edge techniques and technologies are discussed in order to enable the laser practitioner to optimize outcomes.","136":"Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease involving the pilosebaceous unit. Its pathophysiology is multifactorial and complex, including obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit due to increased sebum production, abnormal keratinization, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), and inflammation. Topical agents are the most commonly used therapy for acne. First generation topicals mainly consist of single agent retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and antibacterials that target comedones, P. acnes, and inflammation. Novel topical therapies include combination products with advanced vehicle formulations that target multiple acne pathophysiologies and offer simplified treatment regimes. For example, the combination of clindamycin and tretinoin in a unique vehicle formulation allows for progressive follicle penetration and decreased irritation, resulting in increased efficacy. Furthermore, adapalene or clindamycin with BPO combinations target comedones, inflammation, and P. acnes synergistically. These newer combination products have the potential to increase both efficacy and patient adherence when compared with single agent treatment.","137":"Pregnancy is characterized by multiple physiologic changes. During the entire gestational period, both mother and infant are vulnerable to a variety of external and internal factors. Maternal disease, use of certain medications, drugs, alcohol, smoking, and radiation exposure can have devastating effects on the fetus. Pregnancy-related complications in women with psoriasis can be caused by both the disease and the treatment. The response of the maternal placenta to psoriasis-induced inflammation and comorbid conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, and depression, may also influence the pregnancy. Herein, we review the relationship between psoriasis and undesirable pregnancy outcomes.","138":"Now that several formulations of botulinum toxin type-A (BoNT-A) are on the market in North America and throughout the world, it is of great practical importance for those who administer these medications to be familiar with the differences between the formulations. These differences pertain to the stability of the medications, in particular during the period of time between reconstitution and administration, which may affect the degree of diffusion through various tissues after injection. A variety of relatively new uses of BoNT-A for dermatological conditions will be discussed.","139":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) has a predilection for infecting epidermal and mucosal surfaces such as those of the anogenital region. HPV causes substantial pre-malignant, malignant, and benign disease in both women and men, ranging from cervical, vulvar, penile, and anal cancers to condyloma acuminata (genital warts). Although HPV vaccination is becoming more common, infection rates remain high in both genders. Perception of HPV vaccine has largely centered on its ability to prevent cervical cancer in women, though indication for its use in men is expanding. The benefits to men include prevention of genital warts and, more recently, regulatory approval was expanded in the US for prevention of anal cancer. Herein, we review HPV vaccine with a focus on its new indication in men and existing controversies.","140":"The development of topical cosmetic anti-aging products is becoming increasingly sophisticated. This is demonstrated by the benefit agents selected and the scientific approaches used to identify them, treatment protocols that increasingly incorporate multi-product regimens, and the level of rigor in the clinical testing used to demonstrate efficacy. Consistent with these principles, a new cosmetic anti-aging regimen was recently developed. The key product ingredients were identified based on an understanding of the key mechanistic themes associated with aging at the genomic level coupled with appropriate in vitro testing. The products were designed to provide optimum benefits when used in combination in a regimen format. This cosmetic regimen was then tested for efficacy against the appearance of facial wrinkles in a 24-week clinical trial compared with 0.02% tretinoin, a recognized benchmark prescription treatment for facial wrinkling. The cosmetic regimen significantly improved wrinkle appearance after 8 weeks relative to tretinoin and was better tolerated. Wrinkle appearance benefits from the two treatments in cohorts of subjects who continued treatment through 24 weeks were also comparable.","141":"Cosmetic products containing ultraviolet light filtering agents are rapidly being developed and entering the marketplace. These advanced multifunctional formulations are intended to deliver both cosmetic and protective benefits. Herein, a brief discussion is presented of newer preparations and their features, as well as how their formulary attributes may contribute to improving photoprotection by encouraging adherence.","142":"The common bedbug (Cimex lectularius) is increasingly prevalent and a source of concern and questions for patients. In addition to a range of cutaneous presentations and potential for serious sequelae, bedbug bites cause significant psychological distress and create an economic burden associated with infestation control. Recognition of characteristic entomology, clinical presentation, diagnostic features and differential diagnosis can support expedient identification of patients exposed to infestations and support their appropriate management.","143":"Although biologics are very efficacious as monotherapy in patients with psoriasis, combination treatment with traditional systemic and topical therapies may increase the speed of onset and enhance efficacy without significant additional toxicity. In contrast, in psoriatic arthritis, the addition of methotrexate to anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy does not enhance efficacy in either the skin or joints.","144":"Propylene glycol (PG) is considered to be a ubiquitous formulary ingredient used in many personal care products and pharmaceutical preparations. It is an organic compound commonly found in topical corticosteroids (CS). Cutaneous reactions to PG are mostly irritant, but allergic contact dermatitis to PG is well-documented. Cosensitization to PG and topical CS can occur, making it challenging to choose the appropriate topical CS in a PG-allergic patient. This review is aimed at guiding clinicians in the selection of a suitable topical corticosteroid when presented with patients allergic to PG.","145":"Emotional stress may influence the development and exacerbation of psoriasis. The proportion of psoriasis patients who believe stress affects their skin condition (i.e., \"stress responders\") is considerably high, ranging from 37% to 78%. Stress may worsen psoriasis severity and may even lengthen the time to disease clearance. Although a pathogenic association appears likely, additional well-controlled studies are necessary to confirm such a causal relationship. Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic adrenomedullary systems has been proposed as one possible underlying cause of stress-induced flares of psoriasis. While stress may be an exacerbating factor, psoriasis itself may contribute to significant adverse psychological sequelae. Breaking this stress cycle may be an important part of any therapeutic approach. Thus, stress reduction through psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be useful in treating psoriatic patients who are stress responders.","146":"Alcohol is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in our society and is implicated in multiple health conditions, including hepatic failure, neurological damage, hematological disorders, and nutritional deficiencies, to name a few. Although alcohol induced cutaneous abnormalities can also cause significant morbidity, they tend to be overshadowed by the other disease states associated with alcohol use. In addition to the cutaneous stigmata linked to chronic alcoholic liver disease, alcohol can directly cause or exacerbate several skin conditions. In particular, alcohol misuse is implicated in the development of psoriasis and discoid eczema, as well as confers increased susceptibility to skin and systemic infections. Alcohol misuse might also exacerbate rosacea, porphyria cutanea tarda, and post adolescent acne. Herein, we review the evidence concerning the influences of alcohol in skin conditions with a focus on psoriasis.","147":"Cosmetics are an important cause of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Fragrances and preservatives are the two most clinically relevant allergens found in cosmetic products. Patch testing remains the gold standard for identification of causative allergens. Common cosmetic allergens are reviewed. Practical methods of allergen avoidance are also discussed.","148":"Vulvovaginal diseases commonly are inadequately diagnosed and treated. Most are dermatologic, but can be atypical in presentation in the warm, moist genital area. There is limited training or education for medical caregivers for these conditions. The first step is correct diagnosis, which requires time and knowledge of the normal anatomy, and careful examination. Dermatologists are invaluable for management as they recognize skin problems and can correct barrier function, control inflammation, and address itching and pain.","149":"Acitretin over the last 20 years has proven useful in a number of dermatologic diseases. Evidence of efficacy, side-effect profile, and approach to its use will be reviewed.","150":"","151":"A variety of novel therapeutic modalities have recently become available for patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). In particular, with recent FDA approvals of the three new agents vorinostat (Zolinza), romidepsin (Istodax), and pralatrexate (Folotyn) CTCL treatment has been transformed. Here, we offer a brief overview of these agents and discuss their place in the spectrum of current therapies for CTCL.","152":"Topical therapy forms the cornerstone of treatment in the management of psoriasis. It plays a significant role as monotherapy in mild to moderate psoriasis, and it is used predominantly as adjunctive therapy in moderate to severe forms of the disease. Over the past decade, the topical treatment of psoriasis has evolved from the age-old applications, such as coal tar, to the more cosmetically acceptable and efficacious options containing topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and combined agents. With the advent of topical therapies in tailored vehicles and sophisticated delivery modes, the outlook for effectively managing psoriasis with topical approaches appears promising. To ensure therapeutic success, patient education about the disease, treatment options, proper administration, and adverse effects is essential, which will alleviate the common problem of poor patient adherence and promote more optimal clinical outcomes.","153":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are an increasingly important treatment option for metastasized cancer in patients. In addition to the pivotal role of EGFR in the development and progression of malignant tumors, EGFR is also important for proliferation and differentiation of the human epidermis and hair follicles. As a consequence, cutaneous side-effects are frequently observed during cancer therapy with EGFR inhibitors. During the first few weeks of treatment, acneiform eruptions are the earliest common side-effect. Xerosis and fissures are complications appearing in later treatment phases. Paronychia and alterations in hair growth are less common and generally seen after a longer period of treatment. We present an overview of the various cutaneous side-effects associated with EGFR inhibition and discuss their respective therapeutic options.","154":"Benzoyl peroxide is one of the most widely used topical agents for acne. It has potent antibacterial and mild anti-inflammatory and comedolytic effects. To treat mild to moderate acne, it can be used alone or in combination with topical antibiotics and topical retinoids. The combination of benzoyl peroxide with either erythromycin or clindamycin is synergistic and well-tolerated. In more severe acne, when oral antibiotics are required, benzoyl peroxide can contribute to suppressing the emergence of resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes.","155":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive aged women. It is typically characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. Women with PCOS often experience dermatologic manifestations of hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism, acne vulgaris, and androgenic alopecia. This article will review the treatments for acne due to androgen excess in PCOS women.","156":"Nanotechnology is a relatively new branch of engineering and medicine that is making rapid inroads in dermatology. Nanotechnology applies the unique properties of matter on the nanoscale (1000 nm and smaller) for the purposeful design of new materials. Dermatology is already one of the leading beneficiaries of nanotechnology. In Part I of this series, we discussed the benefits of nanotechnology in dermatology. In Part II, we discuss some of the risks. Matter on the nanoscale has the potential for significant chemical volatility, which carries with it an increased risk of cellular and tissue damage. This article summarizes some of the theoretical safety concerns regarding nanotechnology and offers suggestions for addressing them.","157":"Psychocutaneous disorders involve a unique and somewhat difficult patient population, whose treatment requires the use of drugs unusual to the dermatologist and a significant investment of the clinician's time. This paper describes an effective interpersonal approach and appropriate drug therapy for patients with delusional disorders and dermatitis artefacta, as well as outlines the expectable course and prognosis in each.","158":"The elderly in North America represent the fastest growing segment of the population and the most common skin complaint in this age group is pruritus. The multitude of variables that come with advanced age means that the management of pruritus in the elderly poses a particular therapeutic challenge. Pruritus in advanced age may result from a variety of etiologies, although xerosis is the most common. In addition, certain cutaneous and systemic diseases that are associated with pruritus are more prevalent in the elderly. At present, there is no universally accepted therapy for pruritus. Currently, management of pruritus in the elderly must take an individualistically tailored approach with consideration of the patient's general health, the severity of symptoms, and the adverse effects of treatment. Physical and cognitive limitations, multiple comorbid conditions, and polypharmacy are some aspects that can influence the choice of treatment in this age group.","159":"Nanotechnology is a relatively new branch of engineering that is making rapid inroads in medicine and dermatology. Nanotechnology applies the unique properties of matter on the nanoscale (1000 nm and smaller) for the purposeful design of new materials. Dermatology is already one of the leading beneficiaries of nanotechnology. Among US patent holders in nanotechnology, the sixth largest is a cosmetics company. Nanotechnology applications have been realized in sunscreens and are being developed for the maintenance of skin health, as well as for the diagnosis and management of skin disease. This article summarizes some of the recent and anticipated advances in nanotechnology for dermatology. In part II, the author addresses the chief concerns of nanotechnology.","160":"Chemotherapy-induced hair loss occurs with an estimated incidence of 65%. Forty-seven percent of female patients consider hair loss to be the most traumatic aspect of chemotherapy and 8% would decline chemotherapy due to fears of hair loss. At present, no approved pharmacologic intervention exists to circumvent this side-effect of anticancer treatment, though a number of agents have been investigated on the basis of the current understanding of the underlying pathobiology. Among the agents that have been evaluated, topical minoxidil was able to reduce the severity or shorten the duration, but it did not prevent hair loss. The major approach to minimize chemotherapy-induced hair loss is by scalp cooling, though most published data on this technique are of poor quality. Fortunately, the condition is usually reversible, and appropriate hair and scalp care along with temporarily wearing a wig may represent the most effective coping strategy. However, some patients may show changes in color and\/or texture of regrown hair, and in limited cases the reduction in density may persist.","161":"Solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs) have an increased incidence of skin cancer, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality post-transplantation. Chemoprevention strategies are focused on reducing and delaying the development of skin cancer in these patients. Although systemic retinoids are widely used in OTRs, few randomized controlled trials have been performed. Limited data suggest that acitretin may have a beneficial role in high-risk OTRs. Since rebound flares occur upon discontinuation of retinoids, chemoprevention should be viewed as a lifelong therapy. Further studies are required to establish the efficacy and long-term safety of systemic retinoids as chemopreventive agents for high-risk transplant recipients.","162":null,"163":"Key to the management of photodermatoses is photoprotection, which includes seeking shade; wearing photoprotective clothing, wide brimmed hats, and sunglasses; and applying sunscreens. The process of selecting the most effective sunscreen depends on identification of the wavelengths of photons that are responsible for inducing the sensitivity reaction, which can be determined through assessment of patient history or by phototesting. Sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) &gt;30 that incorporate photostable or photostabilized ultraviolet A (UVA) filters (labeled as 'broad spectrum' in the US) are usually the appropriate choice for adequate photoprotection.","164":"An actinic keratosis (AK) is a pre-malignant cutaneous lesion that frequently manifests in sun-exposed areas of the skin as a small, rough, scaly erythematous papule. They are one of the most common presenting complaints for dermatologists. AKs should be treated due to their potential to progress into a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There are numerous treatments available for managing AKs including those broadly categorized as destructive, topical field, and procedural field therapies. The topical field therapies include 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, and diclofenac gel. Recently, imiquimod 3.75% (Zyclara TM) has been approved for the treatment AKs on the face and scalp. It is a reasonable alternative to imiquimod 5%, as the approved indication includes a larger surface area for treatment, shorter duration course, and the potential for less severe local skin reactions. There is no widely accepted algorithm for the treatment of AKs, as comparative data is unavailable between all approaches. Therapy choices are guided by efficacy, adverse effects, cosmetic results, and patient compliance.","165":"Seborrheic dermatitis is a recurrent, usually mild, skin disorder with typical clinical manifestations. As it most frequently involves exposed areas, such as the face and scalp, patients seek advice from a dermatologist in order to control their disease. This article will review the available treatments for this common dermatologic problem.","166":"Today, more than 10% of the Western population has at least 1 tattoo, with prevalence of up to one-fourth in the cohort younger than 30 years of age. Many of these individuals come to regret their decision within months due to several reasons, often socially-related, and seek medical treatment. The discovery of selective photothermolysis has enabled the targeted destruction of tattoo pigments with only minimal damage to the surrounding tissue and limited risk of adverse effects, which contrasts previously used nonspecific methods. This treatment modality requires laser pulses of short durations (nanoseconds) and high intensities. However, the inappropriate use of laser parameters, such as inadequate pulse duration, can unnecessarily increase the incidence of permanent adverse effects. This article provides an overview of applicable laser systems and therapeutic strategies for optimized tattoo removal.","167":"Acne vulgaris has anecdotally been attributed to diet by individuals affected by this skin condition. In a 2009 systematic literature review of 21 observational studies and 6 clinical trials, the association between acne and diet was evaluated. Observational studies, including 2 large controlled prospective trials, reported that cow's milk intake increased acne prevalence and severity. Furthermore, prospective studies, including randomized controlled trials, demonstrated a positive association between a high-glycemic-load diet, hormonal mediators, and acne risk. Based on these findings, there exists convincing data supporting the role of dairy products and high-glycemic-index foods in influencing hormonal and inflammatory factors, which can increase acne prevalence and severity. Studies have been inconclusive regarding the association between acne and other foods.","168":"","169":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated pruritus is a significant clinical symptom affecting more than 50% of patients on hemodialysis. Restricted by the availability of effective therapeutic options, the management of CKD-associated pruritus remains a treatment challenge. Evaluating research in this area is difficult, as most studies are not comparable due to differing methodologies and study designs, limited number of patients, and the lack of standardized measures. The most frequently used therapy is UVB phototherapy, eliciting favorable responses in most patients. Newer approaches, such as treatment with the m-opiod-receptor antagonist, naltrexone, have yielded conflicting results. The use of the k-opioid-receptor-agonist, nalfurafine, appears to be partially effective in relieving CKD-associated pruritus, as shown by a meta-analysis of 2 clinical trials. Promising results have been obtained by treatment with the anticonvulsant gabapentin. CKD-associated pruritus is thought to be mediated by a proinflammatory state, which explains why immunomodulating drugs (e.g., thalidomide, tacrolimus, and pentoxiphylline) are effective in some patients. Treatment of CKD-associated pruritus should be undertaken according to individual benefit-risk ratio assessments.","170":"Human skin is increasingly exposed to sunlight. In order to achieve complete protection against the cumulative detrimental effects from sun exposure, topical strategies must shield against the range of solar wavelengths that can damage the skin. Importantly, the harm sustained by the skin is not limited to that caused by the ultraviolet (UV) portion of the light spectrum, but also includes the adverse effects inflicted by near infrared energy. Consequently, in an attempt to provide the necessary broad spectrum coverage, innovative research continues through the exploration of new compounds and novel combinations of chemical and physical UV filters with molecules that are capable of interfering with and\/or preventing the deleterious effects of infrared A (IRA) radiation. Existing examples of infrared-protective active agents include mitochondrially targeted antioxidants of synthetic or natural origin.","171":"Biologic agents were introduced during the past decade as a new class of treatments for chronic psoriasis. These agents provide therapeutic alternatives to traditional topical and systemic therapies. Alefacept, the first such biologic agent, was approved by the US FDA in January 2003 for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. This review will discuss data from clinical trials that have provided new insights into the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of alefacept as a treatment for psoriasis.","172":"Genetic predisposition to melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer extends far beyond the Fitzpatrick phenotype classification scheme. Specific alleles of the gene that codes for the malnocortin 1 receptor are predictive of skin cancer risk independent of skin type and hair color. The ability to identify high risk patients independent of the red hair phenotype may help to modify routine sun and skin monitoring behaviors. In addition, as this increased skin cancer risk is likely due to impaired UVA and UVB defence mechanisms, consideration of genetic predisposition may also be appropriate for patients undergoing psoralen + UVA (PUVA) or UVB treatments for various cutaneous disorders, such as psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo. Testing aimed at improving prognostication may serve to limit the influence of certain risk factors.","173":"In atopic dermatitis (AD), the stratum corneum of patients appears to have alterations that predispose them to colonization and invasion by various bacteria, most notably Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). This bacterial co-existence is accepted to be an important factor in AD disease activity. Exactly when to initiate antimicrobial treatment is controversial, but such intervention, when warranted, has repeatedly been demonstrated to improve the course of AD. However, the increase in antibiotic resistance presents a therapeutic challenge in the management of AD patients, which highlights the need for novel mechanism topical antibacterial agents. Retapamulin is a relatively new pleuromutilin antibiotic designed for topical use. In vitro studies have demonstrated its low potential for the development of antibacterial resistance and high degree of potency against Gram-positive bacteria found in skin infections, including many S. aureus strains that are resistant to methicillin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin. Clinical studies exploring the treatment of secondarily infected dermatitis reveal that the efficacy of topical retapamulin is comparable to a 10-day course of oral cephalexin or to topical fusidic acid. Retapamulin appears to be a much needed antimicrobial option for treating the AD population due to their common carriage of bacterial pathogens and frequency of infectious complications.","174":"Eczema is a major public health problem affecting children worldwide. Few studies have directly assessed triggers for disease flares. This paper presents evidence from a published systematic review and a prospective cohort study looking at flare factors in eczema. This systematic review suggested that foodstuffs in selected groups, dust exposure, unfamiliar pets, seasonal variation, stress, and irritants may be important in eczema flares. We performed a prospective cohort study that focused on environmental factors and identified associations between exposure to nylon clothing, dust, unfamiliar pets, sweating, shampoo, and eczema flares. Results from this study also demonstrated some new key findings. First, the effect of shampoo was found to increase in cold weather, and second, combinations of environmental factors were associated with disease exacerbation, supporting a multiple component disease model. This information is likely to be useful to families and may lead to the ability to reduce disease flares in the future.","175":"Recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) is a common condition associated with the formation of vesicles around the mouth, often preceded by prodromal symptoms including tingling and burning. Treatment is targeted toward individual episodes, but in severe cases, suppressive therapy may be indicated. At present, no cure exists for this troublesome condition. The purpose of this article is to serve as a practical guide in the management of RHL by summarizing current treatments and discussing potential new therapies.","176":"Young adult populations (18-25 years of age) throughout the world have latched onto the mainstream trend of body piercing. Best health care practices for these individuals involves the knowledge of proper procedural techniques, postsite care, common complications, and treatment modalities.","177":"Hirsutism is a relatively common condition affecting about 5%-O10% of women of childbearing age. Herein, we present an overview of hirsutism with emphasis on its etiology and therapeutic options.","178":"Topical products commonly used to treat acne include retinoids and antimicrobials, due to their effects on different components of pathogenesis. Accordingly, a fixed combination of adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% was developed (Epiduo, Galderma) and was approved by the US FDA in December 2008 for the treatment of acne. The superior efficacy of this combination was demonstrated in 2 large randomized controlled trials. This paper reviews the evidence for efficacy and tolerability of the combination of the retinoid adapalene 0.1% and BPO 2.5%, a once-daily gel formulation for the treatment of acne.","179":"Methyl aminolevulinate-hydrochloride cream (Metvix [in Canada] and Metvixia [in the US], Galderma) in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) provides an effective treatment option for actinic keratoses (AKs), superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC), and Bowen's disease (BD). Good clinical outcomes have been reported in the literature. Complete responses (CRs) in AK range from 69% to 93% at 3 months. In sBCC, reported CR rates were from 85% to 93% at 3 months and almost on par with cryosurgery at 60 months (75% vs. 74%). In BD, CR rates were 93% at 3 months and 68% at 2 years. Current evidence has shown that this noninvasive treatment is superior in terms of cosmetic outcome to other management strategies such as surgery. It also offers the advantages of relative simplicity, low risk of side-effects and decreased complications due to scar formation.","180":"Photoaging and skin damage that is caused by solar radiation is well known. We have recently learned that within the solar spectrum this damage not only results from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but also from longer wavelengths, in particular near infrared radiation. Accordingly, infrared radiation (IR) has been shown to alter the collagen equilibrium of the dermal extracellular matrix in at least 2 ways: (1) by leading to an increased expression of the collagen degrading enzyme matrixmetalloproteinase-1 while (2) decreasing the de novo synthesis of the collagen itself. Infrared-A (IRA) radiation exposure, therefore, induces similar biological effects to UV, but the underlying mechanisms are substantially different. IRA acts via the mitochondria and therefore protection from IR requires alternative strategies.","181":"Imiquimod 5% cream (Aldara, Graceway Pharmaceuticals) is an immune response modifier used for the topical treatment of anogenital warts in non-HIV-infected patients. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that imiquimod 5% cream is a safe and efficacious treatment. Current data regarding efficacy shows that complete clearance of warts occurred in up to 50% of patients treated with imiquimod 5% cream applied once-daily, 3 times per week for up to 16 weeks. Recurrence rates ranged from up to 19% at 3 months to 23% at 6 months. Imiquimod 5% cream showed an acceptable safety profile; local inflammatory reactions were the most frequent adverse effects, with local erythema being the most common.","182":"","183":"Current treatments for vitiligo are largely unsatisfactory. Topical corticosteroids and phototherapy (narrow-band UVB and psoralen+UVA) are the most prescribed, however, these therapies are often not effective and have important side-effect, especially when used for a long time. Many studies have reported the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment in adults and children with vitiligo, particularly when located on the head and neck. Successful treatment is possible when it is combined with other therapies, such as narrow-band UVB, microphototherapy, helium-neon laser, or narrow-band excimer laser.","184":"Scalp psoriasis occurs in 50%-75% of patients with plaque psoriasis. It may be the only area of the body affected, or it may be associated with disease elsewhere, including psoriatic arthritis. Most cases are treated topically, usually with steroids and\/or calcipotriol. In 2008, Health Canada and the US FDA approved a stable, once-daily 2-compound gel containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (Xamiol, LEO Pharma; Taclonex Scalp, Warner Chilcott). This once-daily therapy improves patient quality of life with a quick onset of action and greater efficacy than monotherapy with either ingredient or twice daily treatment with calcipotriol 0.005% (Dovonex, LEO Pharma) scalp solution. The gel vehicle was developed for ease of use, improved cosmetic acceptability and absorption on the scalp. By 2 weeks, approximately 60%, and by 8 weeks, approximately 70% of patients have controlled disease (i.e., absent or very mild disease). At 8 weeks, the calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate gel formulation has a safety profile comparable with betamethasone dipropionate and is associated with significantly fewer adverse events than calcipotriol. Xamiol may be safely used for up to 52 weeks. No cases of atrophy, striae, or steroid purpura were noted in two 52-week studies.","185":"Pityriasis rosea is a common skin disorder in children and young adults. It is a self-limiting disease with symptoms that are typically mild and tolerable. Consequently, the best treatment remains the one followed so far by generations of dermatologists: reassuring the patient and letting the condition go away on its own. However, there are times when treatment is recommended. In this paper, we review the available treatments for this skin disease.","186":"Hand eczema affects up to 10% of the population and encompasses a diverse range of morphological presentations and underlying pathophysiological processes. This article will review the new and existing treatments that are available for this common dermatologic problem.","187":"Many options exist for the treatment of rosacea, including topical and systemic therapies, laser and light-based therapies, and surgical procedures. A classification system for rosacea identifies 4 subtypes (i.e., erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular), which may help guide therapeutic decision-making. The goals of therapy include reduction of papules, pustules, erythema, physical discomfort, and an improvement in quality of life. Standard topical treatment agents include metronidazole, azelaic acid, and sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur. Second line therapies include benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, calcineurin inhibitors, and permethrin.","188":"Photosensitivity is defined as responsiveness to light exposure. For many common dermatologic drugs, proper storage conditions are essential for maintaining drug activity. Degradation and loss of activity can occur with exposure to light, temperature, and\/ or moisture. For example, ketoconazole degrades after 24 hours of light exposure. In this article storage guidelines for common dermatology drugs are provided. We suspect that drug degradation is common due to improper storage and that improved patient instruction regarding storage will reduce degradation and alleviate some of the danger associated with improper storage and usage patterns.","189":"Onychomycosis is one of the most common nail disorders. Despite recent therapeutic advances with the introduction of effective systemic agents and transungual drug delivery systems, the incidence of onychomycosis is increasing. This is of concern, as the morbidity related to this infection also increases as our population ages with associated conditions, such as diabetes and immunosuppression from illness and medical therapy. Rational and effective treatment plans are needed.","190":"As baby boomers get older, they have shown an increasing interest in maintaining a youthful appearance. As a result, there has been a corresponding increase in topical antiaging formulations, which are commonly referred to as cosmeceuticals. These products come with a seemingly limitless number of key active ingredients and claims of reducing the signs of aging and\/or maintaining a youthful appearance. This paper reviews the more common cosmeceutical ingredients.","191":"Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that is mediated, in part by the body's T-cell inflammatory response mechanisms. Further insight into the pathogenesis of the disease and the role of various cytokines, particularly interleukin(IL)-12 and IL-23, has led to advances in the treatment of this disease. A relatively new class of drugs that inhibit these interleukins is being developed and studied. Current data regarding the efficacy of these agents show they may have the potential to become the new clinical gold standard for biologic therapy to treat psoriasis.","192":"The formation of free radicals is a widely accepted pivotal mechanism leading to skin aging. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons that can directly damage various cellular structural membranes, lipids, proteins, and DNA. The damaging effects of these reactive oxygen species are induced internally during normal metabolism and externally through various oxidative stresses. The production of free radicals increases with age, while the endogenous defense mechanisms that counter them decrease. This imbalance leads to the progressive damage of cellular structures, and thus, results in accelerated aging. Antioxidants are substances that can provide protection from endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses by scavenging free radicals. Topical antioxidants are available in multivariate combinations through over-the-counter skin care products that are aimed at preventing the clinical signs of photoaging.","193":"The treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) still remains nonspecific and is based primarily on empirical data. The goals of therapy include the management of pain and functional impairment by suppressing inflammatory responses, as well as reducing the frequency of recurrences or avoiding the onset of new aphthae. For common forms of RAS, standard topical treatment options that provide symptomatic relief include analgesics, anesthetics, antiseptics, anti-inflammatory agents, steroids, sucralfate, tetracycline suspension, and silver nitrate. Dietary modifications may also support therapeutic measures. In resistant cases of benign aphthosis or aphthosis with systemic involvement, appropriate systemic treatment can be selected from a wide spectrum of immunomodulators that include colchicine, prednisolone, cyclosporine A, interferon-a, tumor necrosis factor-a antagonists, antimetabolites, and alkylating agents.","194":"Sunscreens have been around for more than 70 years. Designed originally to protect against sunburn, recognition of the various harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation has broadened the use of sunscreens. The addition of effective UVA sunscreen agents has enabled claims beyond protection against sunburn to include prevention of idiopathic photodermatosis, actinic keratoses, skin cancer, and photoaging. This article will review some of the recent advances in photoprotection, including the development of sunscreen formulations offering higher and broader protection against solar radiation.","195":"The tremendous success of botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX(R), Allergan Inc.) in the cosmetic arena has acted as a stimulus for the development of other neurotoxins. After more than 2 decades of use, BOTOX(R) has become synonymous with wrinkle reduction and is considered to be the one of the most common non-surgical cosmetic procedures performed worldwide. Because of its vast popularity among patients seeking non-invasive methods to achieve facial rejuvenation, physicians from diverse specialties have integrated botulinum toxin injections into their existing practices. Herein, we present an overview of botulinum toxin products for cosmetic applications that have received regulatory approval or are under development.","196":"Early diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is essential for preventing disease progression and joint destruction. The majority of patients develop PsA years after the onset of their skin disease. Therefore, dermatologists are in a strategic position to make the diagnosis of PsA, and either manage it or refer the patient to a rheumatologist in order to prevent the potentially irreversible destruction of the affected joints. We will review the presentation and temporal relationship of psoriasis and PsA, the diagnosis, classification, and management, in addition to the role of the dermatologist in the early detection of PsA.","197":"The choice of treatment for psoriasis in children, as in adults, is determined by disease acuity, morphology, distribution, severity, and the presence of comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthropathy. Fortunately, most patients present with mild disease that responds adequately to topical medications. A minor subset of children will present with severe, rapidly evolving disease that requires more aggressive interventions. Advanced medical treatment with systemic and phototherapy is challenging and primarily anecdotal, as these modalities are neither well-studied nor approved for use in children. Part II of this 2-part series features an overview of systemic and light therapies including their varying degrees of effectiveness, potential side-effects and applications in clinical practice.","198":"A vast spectrum of topical anti-acne agents has emerged in response to new insights that have been gained through the understanding of disease pathophysiology and the need for clinicians to adopt an individualized therapeutic approach. Because topical agents are most commonly used for acne management, this article reviews some novel vehicle delivery advances that are poised to further enhance the efficacy of topical acne formulations, and\/or offer the possibility of simplified dosing regimens that may improve treatment outcomes.","199":"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a carcinogen that also compromises skin appearance and function. Since the UV action spectra for DNA damage, skin cancer, and vitamin D photosynthesis are identical, and vitamin D is readily available from oral supplements, why has sun protection become controversial? First, the media and, apparently, some researchers are hungry for a new message. They have also drawn attention to the emerging evidence of possible vitamin D benefits other than for bone health. Second, the controversy is fueled by a powerful special interest group: the tanning industry. This industry does not target the frail elderly or inner-city ethnic minorities, which are the groups at greatest risk of vitamin D deficiency, but rather fair-skinned teenagers and young adults, who are at highest risk of UV photodamage. Third, evolution does not keep pace with civilization. When nature gave humans the appealing capacity for cutaneous vitamin D photosynthesis, life expectancy was less than 40 years of age; long-term photodamage was not a concern, and vitamin D deficiency, with its resulting skeletal abnormalities (rickets), was likely to be fatal in early life. This article briefly reviews the pseudo-controversy , as well as the data supporting a revision of the recommendations for vitamin D supplementation. It concludes with a suggested message for patients, many of whom are understandably confused by recent media coverage of the topic.","200":"The pemphigus variants represent a group of potentially life-threatening autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases. Though systemic corticosteroids have dramatically reduced the rate of disease mortality, current therapeutic options are limited by their toxicity profiles. Advancements in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pemphigus have translated into the development of novel therapies. However, few treatments have been subject to randomized controlled trials to firmly establish therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we focus on the new and emerging therapies in the management of pemphigus.","201":"Psoriasis represents a potentially life-altering disease that can profoundly impact physical, emotional and social functioning, and overall quality of life. The majority of cases are mild and managed adequately with topical medications. A minor subset of children present with severe, rapidly evolving disease that requires systemic therapy. The choice of treatment in children, as in adults, is determined by disease acuity, morphology, distribution, severity and the presence of comorbidities such as psoriatic arthropathy. Practical considerations such as ease of use, patient acceptability, accessibility, risk to benefit ratio, cost and individual perceptions of disease and quality of life are factored into treatment decisions. Part I of this 2-part series will focus on topical agents, their varying degrees of effectiveness, potential side-effects and applications in clinical practice.","202":"A comprehensive list of drug treatments for skin disease including: Adapalene Gel 0.3% (Differin(R)), Drospirenone\/ Ethinyl Estradiol (Yaz(R)), Tretinoin 0.05% Gel (Anthralin(R)), Daptomycin for Injection (CUBICIN(R)), Retapamulin Ointment 1% (Altabax(R)), Tinidazole Tablets (Tindamax(R)), Ciclopirox Topical Solution 8%, Ketoconazole 2% Foam (Extina(R)), Terbinafine Hydrochloride (Lamisil(R)), Desloratadine (Aerius(R)\/ Azomyr(R)\/ Neoclarityn(R)), Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride (Xyzal(R)), Loratadine Dry Syrup 1% (Claritin(R)) and many other treatments introduced in 2007.","203":"Vitiligo is an acquired leukoderma that results from the loss of epidermal melanocytes, and is characterized by macules and patches of depigmented skin. With a relatively high rate of prevalence, vitiligo occurs in localized, generalized, or segmental patterns; it can run a rapidly progressive course or remain stationary. The pathogenesis of vitiligo is not yet fully understood, but the autoimmune hypothesis is the most commonly accepted one, based on which, many treatment modalities have been described. Although many therapeutic options exist and new modalities are still emerging, treatment challenges persist, as not all patients respond to available therapies. Variables that affect the choice of treatment include the extent, distribution, and progression rate of the lesions. Another challenge is the lack of a standardized scoring system, which hampers the production of level 1a evidence studies for the treatment of this condition.","204":"There exists a multitude of medical conditions that cause intractable itch, or pruritus. The successful management of this symptom depends explicitly on establishing the underlying cause. Studies have shown that drugs not traditionally used in the treatment of cutaneous disorders, such as opiate receptor antagonists, antidepressants, and antiepileptics, can provide symptomatic relief of intractable itch. These novel antipruritic agents will be explored in this review.","205":"Psoriasis is associated with comorbidities that include metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk. These conditions share etiologic features and health consequences that directly correlate with the severity of psoriatic disease. This disease, in both its skin and joint manifestations, may represent a relevant healthcare issue as an indicator of a broader, underlying disorder of systemic inflammation, and warrants more comprehensive study and multidisciplinary collaboration on its pathophysiology, epidemiology, and treatment in relation to its comorbid conditions.","206":"Optimal acne therapy must take into account not only acne type and severity, but also the impact of this skin disorder on the patients quality of life. Several validated instruments have been used to measure quality of life in acne patients. By using these instruments, acne patients have been shown to experience levels of social, psychological and emotional distress similar to those reported in patients with asthma, epilepsy and diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated that the disability caused by acne can be mitigated by effective therapy.","207":"Acne vulgaris can represent a therapeutic challenge in terms of managing ongoing symptoms and preventing scar formation. While the copious variations of available treatments address milder forms of the disease, until recently, therapies for resistant or moderate-to-severe forms were limited to systemic agents that were accompanied by potentially severe side-effects. With the addition of lasers, light sources, and aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) therapies, dermatologists may now have viable new alternatives for treating all grades of acne severity that circumvent the negative side-effects associated with many conventional options.","208":"Hand and foot psoriasis is a chronic and debilitating disease that manifests as plaque-type or pustular-type lesions. Although the palms and soles represent only 2% of the total body surface area, psoriasis of these regions may lead to physical dysfunctions that can greatly impair dexterity, mobility, and the quality of life of affected individuals. Deregulation of T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response is important in the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Efalizumab (Raptiva, Genentech) is an anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody that disrupts the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, thereby inhibiting various T-cell-mediated immune processes that include activation and trafficking. Recent evidence indicates that efalizumab may be beneficial for patients with hand and foot psoriasis.","209":"The in-office dispensing of topical skin care products by dermatologists is a source of frequent debate. Guidelines for proper dispensing have been penned by various medical organizations, yet the controversy continues. With the increasing number of physician-dispensed lines available for sale, combined with mounting medical financial issues, the ongoing debate surrounding in-office dispensing will continue.","210":"Aesthetic volume rejuvenation with dermal fillers continues to be a very popular procedure that is sought by a growing number of patients who seek the rounder softer contours attributable to a more youthful appearance, including fuller curves of the cheeks, lips, and temples. Not only are fillers easier to use, but the outcomes that equal or exceed more invasive surgical options make volume restoration an increasingly popular procedure. Continued patient demand has fueled the introduction of a wider variety of injectable fillers, which include dermal and subdermal fillers with varying degrees of viscosity and duration of benefit. There are also several dermal implants that have stood the test of time or offer innovative technologies and approaches. This article will focus on the most popular, time-tested, and innovative fillers available today.","211":"Atypical presentations of typical dermatological conditions are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This article will focus on three specific topics: eosinophilic folliculitis, psoriasis, and cutaneous mycoses. Their unique presentations in HIV and treatments are discussed.","212":"To date, the US FDA has approved three tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitors for use in dermatology. Etanercept (Enbrel, Amgen-Wyeth), a fully human fusion protein of TNF receptor II bound to the Fc component of human IgG1, is approved for use in psoriasis (2004) and psoriatic arthritis (2002). Infliximab (Remicade, Centocor) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that is approved for use in psoriasis (2006) and psoriatic arthritis (2005), and adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories), a fully human monoclonal antibody, is approved for use in psoriatic arthritis (2005). While data regarding the efficacy and safety of these therapies is abundant, it proves nearly impossible to objectively compare and contrast agents as there are no head-to-head trials. Clinical experience and post-marketing reporting has allowed dermatologists to identify the relative strengths and limitations of each agent. The well-founded enthusiasm for these agents, because of their excellent initial efficacy and safety profile, is reasonably tempered by concerns about declining efficacy over time, the risk of infection, lymphoma and demyelinating disorders, and cost. The distinct and targeted mechanism of action of the TNF inhibitors allows dermatologists to customize therapy to match the individual needs and characteristics of patients who are candidates for systemic or phototherapy.","213":"Oral contraceptives (OCs) are a valuable option for the treatment of women with acne. The use of OCs can be considered across the spectrum of acne disease severity in women. In Canada, three preparations are approved for mild-to-moderate acne, and a fourth is indicated for severe acne. These formulations contain estrogen in the form of ethinyl estradiol and a progestin. In Canada, the most recently approved OC is ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg and drospirenone 3mg (Yasmin, Bayer). With the accumulating evidence on the efficacy and safety of drospirenone-containing hormonal preparations, this formulation provides dermatologists with a new treatment option for acne and other hyperandrogenic disorders.","214":"Rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech\/ Biogen Idec) is a genetically engineered chimeric murine\/human monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, a B lymphocyte-specific antigen. Initially approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), rituximab has been increasingly used to treat a variety of immune-mediated and autoimmune diseases. While anecdotal case reports recommend its \"off-label\" use in dermatology, randomized clinical trials are required to firmly establish the safety and efficacy of this emerging biologic therapy.","215":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often overexpressed or dysregulated in solid tumors. Targeting the EGFR-mediated signaling pathway has become routine practice in the treatment of lung, pancreatic, head and neck, and colon carcinomas. Available agents with selected activity towards the EGFR include low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g., erlotinib (Tarceva, Genentech BioOncology\/ OSI Pharmaceuticals\/ F. Hoffmann-La Roche) and monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab (Erbitux, Bristol-Myers Squibb\/ ImClone Systems\/ Merck) and panitumumab (Vectibix, Amgen). Their use is anticipated to increase for treating other solid tumors that are dependent on this pathway for growth and proliferation. Health Canada and the US FDA have approved erlotinib for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). It has also been approved in the US for use against pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine (Gemzar, Eli Lilly). Cetuximab and most recently panitumumab (Vectibix, Amgen\/ Abgenix) were approved by the US FDA for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Cetuximab is also approved in the US for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The safety profile for this class of drugs is unique, with virtually no hematological toxicity, but frequent cutaneous and gastrointestinal side-effects. Although there is a dearth of randomized trials addressing treatment of the dermatological side-effects, some basic principles of management have been agreed upon and can likely improve patient compliance and decrease inappropriate dose reduction, which may negatively influence the antitumor effect.","216":"In recent years, there has been increasing concern among physicians, patient advocacy groups, and media watchdogs that laser, light, and cosmetic surgery are being practiced by poorly trained professionals, with resulting preventable injuries to patients. In response, several professional organizations have developed guidelines for the delegation of laser services to nonphysician providers. These guidelines delineate appropriate qualifications for delegating physicians and nonphysician providers, and also describe the circumstances and settings in which delegation is appropriate.","217":null,"218":"Drug Treatments for Skin Disease Introduced in 2006.","219":"Psoriasis is a common skin disease affecting 1%-3% of the world's population with significant impacts on quality of life. There is a great need for therapies that are efficacious and safe, not only for the short-term, but also for long-term management. Dovobet\/ Daivobet\/ Taclonex is a product combining two molecules, calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, that may offer psoriatic patients with an option for maintenance therapy. The efficacy and safety of this combined formulation when used over a 4-week period is well documented. A recent publication in the British Journal of Dermatology discusses the safety of this product when used for 52 weeks.","220":"As the range of soft tissue augmentation products proliferates, most will be used (with varying degrees of success) to shape and augment the lip. The range of outcomes for this indication depends on the skill of the injector, the anatomy of the patient and the intrinsic properties of the product. Permutations of these interacting factors are infinite and it is the range of combinations that is responsible for the complexity (and fascination) of lip rejuvenation with injectable products. Based on personal experience, the perfect lip is the one that \"wows\" the patient and makes them happy with the procedure. Individualizing the injection is of paramount importance and should take priority over a formulaic approach that defines each lip injection as identical. This review will discuss some of the factors that should be considered prior to injecting a lip with soft tissue augmentation products.","221":"Moderate-to-severe psoriasis is known to affect millions of people around the globe. This chronic disease substantially impacts patients by impairing their quality of life, causing psychosocial distress, and creating an ongoing financial burden. The biologics are the newest and most effective therapeutic weapon in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that can significantly alter the course of the disease in a relatively short period of time. There is a need to review the recommended treatment guidelines for moderate- to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as the perception and demands of patients are constantly changing. Real world experience with this class of drugs is expanding and more new biologics are becoming available.","222":"Dermatologic surgeons are often faced with the repair of complex facial defects following Mohs micrographic surgery. While the size or absence of critical tissue layers may be daunting, the reconstruction of these complex defects follow similar principles to those for the closure of smaller, simpler defects. There are several issues specific to these closures including whether to delay closure in order to allow wound contraction, thus decreasing the size of the wound. Yet, if the defect is adjacent to a fixed anatomic structure, this may not be an option. The tumescent technique allows for effective anesthesia over large surface areas. Although choosing a method of closure may be specific to the anatomic area, if possible, it is best to choose a 'workhorse' flap, e.g. multiple flaps or a flap and a full thickness skin graft. Occasionally, a tunneled pedicle flap may be appropriate. For large areas an artificial skin substitute may be necessary. While tissue expansion has a number of disadvantages, it may be the only option for large defects in immobile anatomic regions. While it would be optimal to close every Mohs defect, it is important to know when to refer a reconstruction that may require general anesthesia and\/or hospitalization.","223":"Rosacea is a common condition that affects people of all races. In addition to the visible aspects of this disease, it can have a psychosocial impact that must be evaluated when considering the treatment options. More aggressive and innovative uses of existing oral agents have resulted in novel therapeutic approaches, which can provide long-term therapy and sustained remission.","224":"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been proposed as a treatment for toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). A number of retrospective and prospective studies have been conducted, with varying levels of evidence for the efficacy of IVIG. Recent publications provide opposing conclusions. A multi-center, comparative, long-term analysis needs to be conducted to determine the role of IVIG in the management of patients with SJS\/TEN.","225":"Pruritus, or itch, is a common sensation that causes a person to want to scratch. It is a complex process that may negatively impact quality of life and commonly occurs with skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and urticaria. It could also be a symptom related to an underlying disease process such as cholestasis or hyperthyroidism, or simply be caused by dry skin, especially in the cold, winter months. Therapy is often aimed at eliminating the underlying cause first, followed by the management of the itchy sensation. Treatment may include prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal remedies, hydrotherapy, phototherapy, and ultraviolet therapy. This overview provides information regarding the various management and treatment options for pruritus.","226":"Acne scarring is common but surprisingly difficult to treat. Scars can involve textural change in the superficial and deep dermis, and can also be associated with erythema, and less often, pigmentary change. In general, treatment of acne scarring is a multistep procedure. First, examination of the patient is necessary to classify the subtypes of scarring that are present. Then, the patient's primary concerns are elicited, and the patient is offered a menu of procedures that may address the various components of the scarring process. It is important to emphasize to the patient that acne scarring can be improved but never entirely reversed.","227":"Pediculosis capitis, or head lice, is a world-wide public health concern affecting persons of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. It is caused by Pediculus humanus capitis, an obligate ectoparasite that lives on human hair and feeds on the blood from the skin. Upon diagnosis, treatment should be initiated, since established infestations with head lice generally do not spontaneously resolve. Chemical pediculicides are currently the standard treatment, however, issues of resistance have made it necessary to explore new alternatives. If an infestation is resistant to these drugs, then the physician should consider treating with an agent from a different class of pediculicides or, potentially, with newer nonpediculicides.","228":"Fractional laser treatment with the 1,550 nm erbium fiber laser (Fraxel Laser, Reliant Technologies) has bridged the gap between the ablative and nonablative laser modalities used to treat the epidermal and dermal signs of skin aging. By targeting water as its chromophore, the laser induces a dense array of microscopic, columnar thermal zones of tissue injury that do not perforate or impair the function of the epidermis. The significant skin remodeling that ensues can be used to treat, with limited downtime, epidermal pigmentation, melasma, and rhytides, as well as textural abnormalities that include acne-related and surgical scars.","229":"Hyperpigmentation disorders of the skin are common and can be the source of significant psychosocial distress for patients. The most common of these disorders are melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Sunscreen use and minimizing sun exposure are crucial in all cases. Topical applications are the mainstay of treatment and include phenols, retinoids, corticosteroids, and their combinations.","230":"The development of selective photothermolysis has enabled removal of targets such as melanin. Both lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) sources have been used in the treatment of pigmented lesions, however careful selection is important to ensure success. This is especially true in darker skinned individuals where the risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is high. The advent of the Q-switched laser, IPL, and now fractional photothermolysis (Fraxel, Reliant Technologies) offers a variety of ways to treat epidermal and dermal pigmentary disorders.","231":"The elderly population is increasing and drug dosing requires special considerations for efficacy and decreasing toxicity. This overview provides algorithms for adjusting drug and dosage based on current evidence-based knowledge with emphasis on drugs prescribed in dermatological practice.","232":"Plasma skin regeneration (PSR) technology uses energy delivered from plasma rather than light or radiofrequency. Plasma is the fourth state of matter in which electrons are stripped from atoms to form an ionized gas. The plasma is emitted in a millisecond pulse to deliver energy to target tissue upon contact without reliance on skin chromophores. The technology can be used at varying energies for different depths of effect, from superficial epidermal sloughing to deeper dermal heating. With the Portrait PSR device (Rhytec, Inc.) there are three treatment guidelines termed PSR1, PSR2, and PSR3. The PSR1 protocol uses a series of low-energy treatments (1.0,1.2 Joules) spaced 3 weeks apart. The PSR2 protocol uses one high-energy pass (3.0, 4.0 Joules) performed in a single treatment, and the PSR3 protocol uses two high-energy passes (3.0 4.0 Joules) performed in a single treatment. All protocols improve fine lines, textural irregularities, and dyspigmentation; however, skin tightening is probably more pronounced with the high-energy treatments.","233":"Common diaper dermatitis is an irritant contact diaper dermatitis (IDD) created by the combined influence of moisture, warmth, urine, feces, friction, and secondary infection. It is difficult to completely eradicate these predisposing factors in a diapered child. Thus, IDD presents an ongoing therapeutic challenge for parents, family physicians, pediatricians, and dermatologists. This article will focus on practical management strategies for IDD.","234":"Reconstruction of the lips requires careful attention to aesthetic and functional goals. We describe our approach to lip repair and present novel methods to maintain symmetry and function, and optimize cosmetic results.","235":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the known cause of almost all cases of cervical cancer. An understanding of the HPV genome has allowed the development of two prophylactic vaccines capable of protecting against both persistent HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with 100% efficacy in fully vaccinated women. The vaccines, manufactured by Merck (Gardasil, which was approved by the US FDA in June, 2006) and GlaxoSmithKline (Cervarix, which will be submitted for US FDA approval by the end of 2006), both target HPV types 16 and 18, which together account for 70% of cervical cancer. Merck vaccine also targets HPV 6 and 11, covering =90% of genital warts. These vaccines are highly immunogenic and have an excellent safety profile. HPV vaccines promise to offer an exciting contribution to healthcare and cancer prevention. However, many questions remain concerning who to vaccinate, the duration of protection, cost, public acceptance, and the potential for worldwide distribution.","236":"As the incidence of tattoo placement continues to increase, so does the demand for tattoo removal, with more than 10 million people in the US alone with a tattoo. Used in an appropriate clinical setting, Q-switched lasers provide relatively efficacious clearance of decorative tattoo pigment with minimal side-effects. We present our clinical experience along with literature findings on decorative tattoo removal and the important issues practitioners should consider in the management of tattoos.","237":"Skin cancer is the most common human cancer, and is currently considered a global epidemic. Recently, there has been a growing interest in immunomodulators, or up-regulators of the immune response, for the treatment and cure of various forms of skin cancer, including melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, cutaneous extramammary Paget's disease, and vulvar intraepithelial carcinoma neoplasia. Strategies to augment the host's immune response against cancer cells and\/or cancer cell antigenicity have been investigated, including recombinant cytokines, immunomodulators, dendritic cell immunization, tumor antigen vaccination, T-cell-based immunotherapy, and gene therapy. Although the current standard of care for most of these cancers includes Mohs micrographic surgery, curettage, and cryo-, laser-, or radiotherapy, immunomodulators are becoming essential in the treatment of patients who are poor surgical candidates and\/or require noninvasive therapy.","238":"Although the developing fetus was once considered protected from the outside world, we now know that it can potentially be affected by any medication given to the mother. Despite this knowledge, use of medications during pregnancy is common and pregnant women often present for treatment of dermatological disease. Therapeutic options available for these patients will be discussed.","239":"The latest techniques for endovenous occlusion, i.e., radiofrequency ablation catheters or endoluminal laser targeting water are our preferred methods for the treatment of saphenous-related varicose veins. Clinical experience with endovenous techniques in more than 1,000 patients shows a high degree of success with minimal side effects, most of which can be prevented or minimized with use of tumescent anesthesia. Within the next 5 years, these minimally invasive endovenous ablative procedures involving saphenous trunks should have virtually replaced open surgical strippings.","240":"Photoaging is a multisystem degenerative process that involves the skin and the skin support systems, including the bone, cartilage, and subcutaneous compartments. These structures provide the architectural support for the dermis, epidermis, and stratum corneum. A multiprong approach to photoaging involves reversing the undesirable changes in each of these structures. Dermatologists should become adept at treating all of the visible manifestations of photoaging.","241":"The forehead flap is a useful technique to reconstruct deep and large nasal defects. It can safely be performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting. Advantages of this flap include the fact that it provides an excellent color and texture match to the missing nasal skin. Disadvantages include the fact that it is at least a two-stage procedure and that often patients require \"touch up\" surgeries to provide the best possible cosmetic outcome.","242":"Topical metronidazole (Noritate 1% Cream, Dermik; MetroCream 0.75% Cream, MetroLotion 0.75% Lotion, Metrogel 0.75% and 1% Topical Gel, Galderma) has been used for the treatment of rosacea for over 30 years. Several placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of moderate-to-severe rosacea. It is also effective in preventing relapses of disease and is well tolerated by most patients. A growing number of formulations are available.","243":"","244":"The use of nonabsorbable sutures for lifting lax, aging skin is an increasingly popular option for cosmetic surgeons. Contour Thread (Surgical Specialties Corp.) are novel modified polypropylene sutures recently approved for this purpose by the US FDA. Design and technical modifications incorporated into this implant may reduce complications and limitations seen with previous, similar products. Early experience has been positive, although the durability of cosmetic effect and the potential for long-term complications remain to be seen.","245":"Etanercept has recently been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at a dose of 50mg twice per week for 12 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 50mg once weekly thereafter. Clinical studies have shown excellent efficacy and a good safety profile in patients with psoriasis. Extensive information on etanercept safety is available as this biological agent has been used for many years for other indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.","246":"Famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis) is an effective treatment for herpes zoster and herpes simplex. Two separate studies recently examined the effectiveness of single high doses of famciclovir for treating recurrent genital herpes and labial herpes (cold sores). In the randomized, placebo-controlled studies, patients initiated treatment at the first onset of symptoms. For the treatment of genital herpes, a 1,000 mg b.i.d. dose of famciclovir had significant advantages over the placebo, reducing the time required to heal the lesions, preventing the development of lesions beyond the papule stage, and improving the time to resolution of all symptoms. For the treatment of labial herpes, a single 1,500 mg dose of famciclovir shortened the lesion healing time, shortened the time to normal skin, and resulted in faster resolution of pain and tenderness.","247":"Twenty-two percent of women in North America have unwanted facial hair, which can cause embarrassment and result in a significant emotional burden. Treatment options include plucking, waxing (including the sugar forms), depilatories, bleaching, shaving, electrolysis, laser, intense pulsed light (IPL), and eflornithine 13.9% cream (Vaniqa, Barrier Therapeutics in Canada and Shire Pharmaceuticals elsewhere). Eflornithine 13.9% cream is a topical treatment that does not remove the hairs, but acts to reduce the rate of growth and appears to be effective for unwanted facial hair on the mustache and chin area. Eflornithine 13.9% cream can be used in combination with other treatments such as lasers and IPL to give the patient the best chance for successful hair removal.","248":"HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy has become epidemic among the greater than 1 million HIV-infected individuals living in the United States. Those affected usually have well-controlled HIV disease, and are most often healthy and living productive lives. However, their facial appearance often suggests the opposite and frequently serves as a stigma and psychological burden. Treatment approaches may be divided into three categories: 1) Surgically placed alloplastic, autologous, or synthetic implants; 2) Injection of temporary fillers; 3) Injection of permanent fillers, including liquid injectable silicone. Salient aspects of each treatment are reviewed, along with new techniques and pearls on the correct use of liquid injectable silicone.","249":"Topical agents for the treatment of psoriasis are indicated for patients whose affected area is less then 10% of their skin. However, for long-term use, their effectiveness can be limited. Topical sequential therapy involves the application of a class I corticosteroid and calcipotriene in three different phases: the clearance phase, the transition phase and the maintenance phase. It is an accepted and widely practiced technique that provides a balance between maximizing efficacy and minimizing side-effects thus offering patients rapid clearance of their psoriatic lesions and long-term maintenance of remission.","250":null,"251":"Atopic dermatitis is a highly pruritic inflammatory disorder of the skin characterized by onset in infancy or childhood and a chronically relapsing course. Mainstay treatments are emollients and topical corticosteroids, but the latter are limited by side-effects from longterm use. Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam derivative and a calcineurin inhibitor that targets T-cell activation but does not inhibit antigen-presenting cells in the skin. In multiple clinical trials comprising more than 19,000 patients, pimecrolimus cream has been shown to be very effective in suppressing atopic dermatitis and to have an excellent safety profile. This has also been shown in long-term studies (&gt;2 years) and by postmarketing experience.","252":"A tell-tale sign of the aging face is upper eyelid skin redundancy and lower eyelid bags. These changes can contribute to a \"tired\" appearance. Upper and lower blepharoplasty procedures can correct these processes. By removing skin and muscle, an upper eyelid blepharoplasty can give the eye a larger appearance. A lower blepharoplasty can remove pseudo-herniated fat, or transpose it to provide a smooth infraorbital contour. It appears that a transconjunctival approach for the lower blepharoplasty will lead to a lower incidence of eyelid malposition. An adjunctive procedure such as laser resurfacing may be appropriate. Patients should be counseled on all potential complications, including visual loss from muscle injury or hematoma, as well as the extent of postoperative recuperation.","253":"Onychomycosis is prevalent in the Canadian population, and risk factors, such as old age and diabetes, are increasing. This condition has traditionally been treated using oral antifungal agents with varying degrees of success. Recently, ciclopirox nail lacquer 8% solution became the first topical agent approved in Canada for onychomycosis. Ciclopirox nail lacquer may be safe and effective for the treatment of onychomycosis, and certain candidates may benefit from therapy. Ciclopirox may be implicated for prophylactic use in order to prevent recurrent infection and may be used in combination with oral agents.","254":"Mandibular implantation is an outpatient procedure that can be used in combination with other minimally invasive cosmetic interventions. Specifically, silastic chin implants can help create a strong chin and smooth the jaw-line in carefully selected patients. A standard surgical excision tray plus a few additional simple instruments are required, and a variety of commercially available implants are available for placement via an intraoral or submental approach. Meticulous technique minimizes the small risk of nerve injury and numbness. Chin-jowl implants may be preceded by neck liposuction and immediately followed by a face-lift to achieve overall facial enhancement.","255":"Skin cancer, the most common human cancer, is now a global epidemic. The most prevalent form of nonmelanoma skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the incidence of which continues to increase prompting development of new treatment modalities designed to add or complement current therapies. Although destructive modalities continue to be an important treatment options for BCC, nondestructive measures are a welcome addition to our therapeutic choices. Imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier, belongs to the family of immunostimulators. It enhances both the innate and acquired immune response, and has successfully treated both superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas through the localized activation of elaborate immune response. Imiquimod can either be used alone or in combination with other treatment modalities. The most common adverse effects of topical use of imiquimod are localized to the site of application and easily managed.","256":"Poly-L-lactic acid is a filler recently approved by the US FDA for the correction of facial lipoatrophy in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Currently, poly-L-lactic acid, sold under the brand name Sculptratrade mark (Dermik), is the only product approved by the FDA specifically for this indication. The market for poly-L-lactic acid will likely be larger than the HIV-infected population, as physicians use poly-L-lactic acid off-label to correct lipoatrophy associated with the normal aging process in non-HIV-infected patients. The benefits of poly-L-lactic acid are limited by the fact that multiple treatments are necessary to achieve the desired correction; its results are temporary and its cost is high.","257":"Moisturizers are widely used products that are important in many dermatologic and cosmetic skin therapies. They contain varying combinations of emollients, occlusives, and humectants to achieve their beneficial effects, and there is an overwhelming number of formulations available. To develop a rational approach for prescribing moisturizers, commercially available products can be categorized on the basis of application site.","258":"Patients frequently seek cosmetic improvement for existing scars. While no scar can be completely erased, dermatologic surgeons can employ a variety of approaches to achieve more esthetically pleasing scars. Classification of a scar abnormality guides the choice of treatment technique. Lasers and injectables are useful tools; however, for certain scar abnormalities, scalpel-based surgery remains the mainstay. This review focuses on common incisional surgical methods for scar revision.","259":"","260":"While prominent ears are considered a sign of good fortune in the Far East, Western society looks upon prominent ears in a far less positive manner. Children with prominent ears are often the subjects of verbal and at times physical abuse by their peers, resulting in adverse psychological effects. Advances in otoplasty have made it possible not only to pin back the ears, but also to reshape them, reduce their size, or make them more symmetrical. For a dermatologic surgeon, an otoplasty may be an unfamiliar surgical procedure, however, the surgery itself does not significantly differ from ear wedges or cartilage removal procedures for skin cancer, procedures with which the dermatologic surgeon is quite familiar.","261":"Actinic keratoses (AKs) are premalignant inflammatory skin lesions with the potential to transform into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There are several treatment options available for patients presenting with multiple AKs. Imiquimod is believed to stimulate and enhance host immune responses locally against skin tumors and viral infections. Five clinical studies to date have demonstrated its safety and efficacy in the treatment of actinic keratoses. Long-term follow-up studies examining recurrence rates are limited.","262":"","263":"Introduced in the 1970s as a treatment for psoriasis, mycophenolic acid has since been reformulated as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). With an improved side-effect profile and enhanced bioavailability, MMF is a promising drug for immune-mediated skin disease. Currently approved for the prevention of organ rejection, its list of \"off-label\" dermatologic indications continues to grow. As a noncompetitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), MMF inhibits de novo purine synthesis. Its relative lack of hepatonephrotoxicity and seemingly low risk of carcinogenicity offer important therapeutic advantages. While case reports and case series dominate the dermatologic literature, preliminary results are sufficiently promising to warrant larger, randomized clinical trials with this emerging therapy.","264":"There is no ideal filler, nor will there be a single product that can satisfy all requirements. However, RESTYLANE, a non-animal, stabilized hyaluronic acid (NASHA, Medicis), is a very versatile augmenting agent. It has been in clinical use for 8 years and experience has shown it to be close to the ideal filler in many respects. This review will outline the background to the use of RESTYLANE, and will focus on the clinical use of this material.","265":"The Herpesviridae family (Types 1-8) continues to inflict considerable morbidity and social stigma upon humanity. Once infected with the herpes viruses, especially Types 1-3, they establish permanent residence within our nervous system and reactivate during periods of stress, trauma, and\/or other precipitating factors. To date, there is no cure for herpes viral infections but antivirals can attenuate the symptoms and duration of episodic outbreaks. Prophylactic therapy can suppress recurrences. The first antiviral with selective activity against virus-infected cells is considered to be acyclovir. Our article will highlight the clinical indications of the current generation, valacyclovir, which is a prodrug of acyclovir. We consider valacyclovir as a second-generation antiviral, having taken into account the initial selectivity and safety profile of its progenitor, acyclovir.","266":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used for several years for the treatment of actinic keratoses and prevention of invasive nonmelanoma cancers. More recently, increasing physician expertise with the topical sensitizers and light sources employed in PDT has led to expanded applications, including its use for improvement of the visible signs of photoaging. Aesthetic treatment of photoaged skin with brief application of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid followed by well-tolerated light sources, such as intense pulsed light or pulsed-dye laser, can enhance the effectiveness of nonablative laser treatment without increasing adverse effects or downtime.","267":"Prednicarbate is a nonhalogenated corticosteroid that is used in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, for example atopic dermatitis. It has a favorable benefit-risk ratio, with an inflammatory action similar to that of a medium potency corticosteroid, but with a low potential to cause skin atrophy. Thus, prednicarbate may be a consideration in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children, and other inflammatory disorders in children and adults.","268":"Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor antagonist with anti-inflammatory effects. It is currently approved in the US for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical trials have shown this agent to have an excellent safety profile and to be well tolerated by both adult and pediatric patients.","269":"The role of lasers and intense pulsed light sources has gained increasing popularity in the management of both cosmetic telangiectasias and medically significant symptomatic varicose vein disease. These advances include endovascular technologies, novel cooling technologies, variable spot sizes and pulse durations, as well as the ability to deliver high-energy fluences. These advances have allowed the delivery of sufficient energy allowing more efficient pan-endothelial necrosis without affecting epidermal structures, and yielding a lower complication profile such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and epidermal surface irregularities. The advent of extended-pulse, longer wavelength technologies such as the 1064 Neodymium:Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser have allowed the treatment of individuals with darker skin phenotypes, as well as treatment of deep blue reticular veins up to 3 mm in diameter in a monomodal fashion. Combined approaches of sclerotherapy plus laser treatments performed during the same treatment session may produce synergistic results in selected individuals.","270":"Tacrolimus ointment (Protopic, Fujisawa) is an effective agent in a class of topical immunomodulators. Its mechanism of action is based on calcineurin inhibition, which results in decreased T-cell activation and inflammatory cytokine release. Tacrolimus ointment is safe and effective for short- and long-term treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric and adult patients. The most common adverse events associated with its use are a transient burning sensation and pruritus at the site of application. Unlike topical corticosteroid agents, tacrolimus ointment does not cause a reduction in collagen synthesis or skin thickness. Because tacrolimus ointment does not cause skin atrophy, it may be safely used for months or years on all skin areas, including the face and intertriginous areas.","271":"Lasers and intense pulsed light sources are frequently used for the treatment of pigmented lesions, and the appropriate selection of devices for different lesions is vital to achieving satisfactory clinical outcomes. In dark-skinned patients, the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is of particular importance. In general, long-pulse laser and intense pulsed light sources can be effective with a low risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) when used for the treatment of lentigines. However, for dermal pigmentation and tattoo, Q-switched lasers are effective, with a lower risk of complications. In the removal of melanocytic nevi, a combined approach with a long-pulse pigmented laser and a Q-switched laser is particularly applicable.","272":"Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a serious complication of herpes zoster that has a predilection for older individuals. PHN is often associated with significant morbidity, and it can cause insomnia, fatigue, depression and interference with daily activities in affected individuals. Treatment for PHN is initiated with antivirals during the acute herpes zoster outbreak. Acyclovir (Zoviraxr, GlaxoSmithKline), valacyclovir (Valtrex, GlaxoSmithKline) or famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis) can be used to treat herpes zoster, and all three have been shown to reduce the duration of the herpetic rash and zoster-associated pain. These antivirals are most effective when used within the first 72 hours of the onset of the rash. Side-effects of these antivirals are low and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and headache. Other treatment options for PHN include topical analgesics, opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin. Because of the complexity of PHN, most patients require a combination of treatment modalities for adequate pain relief.","273":"Numerous adaptations of face-lift techniques have been devised, and each surgical approach has its own risks and benefits, as well as proponents and detractors. All of the conventionally accepted techniques achieve removal of redundant skin. However, its the variations in approach to the deeper soft tissue structures that separate the many face-lifting procedures. A skin only face-lift was the earliest form of surgical rhytidectomy, but failed to achieve significant long-term benefit. Cosmetic surgeons of various backgrounds thus sought to achieve a more durable benefit from the surgery. While certain techniques have been classically ascribed to a particular surgeon, innovation does not occur in a vacuum and many surgeons are responsible for our current state of knowledge with regards to facial rhytidectomy surgery.","274":"Seborrheic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin disease, affecting between 1% and 3% of immunocompetent adults. While its cause is unknown, a number of predisposing factors have been reported, including the implications of Malassezia yeasts. Various treatment options are available, such as ciclopirox shampoo, which combines anti-Malassezia activity with an anti-inflammatory action. This agent has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.","275":"Disorders of hyperpigmentation are difficult to treat, particularly in dark-skinned individuals. The goal is to reduce the hyperpigmentation without causing undesirable hypopigmentation or irritation in the surrounding normally pigmented skin. The psychosocial impact caused by these disorders must be considered. Although there are many effective therapeutic modalities available, there are potentially significant side-effects associated with treatment. The most commonly used treatment is topical hydroquinone. There are other phenolic agents, such as N-acetyl-4-cystaminylphenol (NCAP), that are currently being studied and developed. The non-phenolic agents, which include tretinoin, adapalene, topical corticosteroids, azelaic acid, arbutin, kojic acid, and licorice extract, are also used for hyperpigmentation disorders.","276":"Wound care after laser skin resurfacing (LSR) is critical for achieving a successful result. The superficial thermal injury created by LSR heals more quickly and with a reduced risk of scarring under occlusion. While open and closed wound care regimens can be employed to expedite reepithelialization, closed methods with semi-occlusive dressings may decrease morbidity. Effective medications and management techniques can help to minimize expected effects of the procedure such as crusting, discomfort, pruritus, erythema, and swelling.","277":"Ciclopirox (Loprox) is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication that also has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Its main mode of action is thought to be its high affinity for trivalent cations, which inhibit essential co-factors in enzymes. Clinical trials have shown that ciclopirox gel is a successful treatment for seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp as well as for tinea pedis. Adverse effects are generally mild and include a skin-burning sensation, contact dermatitis, and pruritus. Ciclopirox is indicated in the US for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, pityriasis versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis, and cutaneous candidiasis.","278":"This paper reviews current evidence presented by recent studies on the impact of acne on psychosocial health. Study methodologies, including case-control and cross-sectional surveys, have demonstrated psychological abnormalities including depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, including pain and discomfort, embarrassment and social inhibition. Effective treatment of acne was accompanied by improvement in self-esteem, affect, obsessive-compulsiveness, shame, embarrassment, body image, social assertiveness and self-confidence. Acne is associated with a greater psychological burden than a variety of other disparate chronic disorders. Future studies with a longitudinal cohort design may provide further validation of the causal inference between acne and psychosocial disability provided by the current literature.","279":"Skin cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and even mortality in organ transplant recipients (OTRs). As the number of organ transplant patients continues to increase, dermatologists will be faced with the challenge of diagnosing and managing their skin cancers. Evaluation, management and follow up of organ transplant recipients with high risk SCC will be discussed.","280":"","281":"Tazarotene (Tazorac, Allergan) has been shown to be effective in reducing the effects of photoaging in short term studies. To determine its effectiveness in the longer term, a 24-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle controlled intervention study of 562 patients with facial photodamage was carried out followed by a 28-week open label extension. Patients were treated with one daily application of tazarotene 0.1% cream or vehicle cream to the face for 24 weeks, then tazarotene 0.1% cream for another 28 weeks. At week 24, when compared to vehicle, tazarotene resulted in a significantly greater incidence of patients achieving treatment success (over 50 percent greater improvement) and at least a 1 grade improvement in fine wrinkling, mottled pigmentation, pore size, lentigines, elastosis, irregular depigmentation, tactile roughness, coarse wrinkling and overall integrated assessment of photodamage. Additional clinical improvement occurred with continued tazarotene treatment and had not plateaued by week 52.","282":"Lentigo maligna (LM) is a pigmented lesion that occurs most commonly on the sun-exposed skin of the head and neck of an older patient. LM can be difficult to completely remove due to its occasional extensive subclinical extension. Surgical treatments, including standard excision and margin-controlled excision (Mohs micrographic surgery or rush permanent sections), are reviewed. Immunostains that can increase sensitivity and specificity of margin-controlled excision are discussed, and other nonscalpel treatments including destruction, topical imiquimod, radiation therapy and cryotherapy are briefly discussed. The gold standard treatment for LM is margin-controlled excision.","283":"A manufactured blood product derived from fractionated human plasma, intravenous immunoglobulin (i.v.Ig) contains supra-physiologic levels of IgG. i.v.Ig is currently used in the treatment of immunodeficiency syndromes, inflammatory disorders and infections diseases. Uncontrolled clinical studies and anecdotal case reports recommend its use in dermatology, but randomized clinical trials are lacking. In selecting the most appropriate i.v.Ig for the patient, convenience, efficacy, safety and tolerability of the different products should be considered. With several measures in place to ensure its safety, i.v.Ig offers new hope for the treatment of many severe dermatologic conditions.","284":"There is no consensus with regard to perioperative blood thinner management in patients undergoing cutaneous procedures. The rationale and problems associated with blood thinners during cutaneous surgery are examined and the preoperative screening and surgical management of patients taking anticoagulant medicines discussed. There are many studies that support continuation of blood thinners during cutaneous procedures supporting the conclusion that blood thinners should not be discontinued for cutaneous procedures.","285":"Oral isotretinoin, since its introduction more than 20 years ago, has been and still is the \"gold standard\" in the treatment of acne and its variants. This is the only approach to acne with the possibility of a permanent \"cure\" or long term remission. The role of isotretinoin has evolved with higher dosage schedules and use earlier in the course of the disease. The frequency of laboratory monitoring has diminished along with associated costs based on 2 decades of experience. Pregnancy-associated safeguards have become a more prominent facet of oral retinoid therapy leading to increased safety for its use in females of child-bearing potential.","286":"This new compound product containing 50 micrograms\/gram calcipotriol and 0.5 milligrams\/gram betamethasone dipropionate was recently introduced in Canada for the treatment of psoriasis. Clinical trials demonstrated that this compound was more active than either agent used alone. Recent changes in the product monograph involving the reduction in dose to once daily use has raised questions about the relevance of some previous comparisons of twice daily Dovobet. Pooling the available data from 5,500 patients in clinical trials for Dovobet will allow an inter-trial comparison of the various treatment arms, demonstrating that Dovobet, when applied once daily is significantly more effective than with twice daily applications of either its individual components used alone.","287":"With so many new peel preparations on the market today, the dermatologist must ask himself basic questions concerning the products. The most important question is directed to the medical literature rather than the advertising or marketing campaign so common among market-driven cosmetic products. Since all peeling agents--superficial, medium depth and deep--are derived from basic chemicals known to cause exfoliation, destruction and\/or inflammation of skin in a controlled manner, the clinician must ask what is new and better about the product. Peeling agents, regardless of their proprietary new name, fall into chemical families. The clinical evaluation of these generic agents is well documented in our literature as to efficacy, technical care and safety. In addition, combinations of peeling agents have been presented in the dermatologic cosmetic literature with scientific clinical trials and histology. These include: 1) The Gordon-Baker phenol peel; 2) Combination medium depth peeling; 3) Glycolic acid formulations. It is the responsibility of the dermatologic surgeon to be in control of his chemicals and his products. It is thus necessary for him to understand all the products and the peel formulation and be sure it has undergone the test of objective scientific study with clear clinical evaluations and histology. Only then will we truly know the effectiveness of the agents we are using for exfoliating and resurfacing.","288":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronically relapsing eczematous disorder of the skin that occurs in persons of all ages but is more common in children. AD is associated with other atopic diseases such as allergic rhinoconjuntivitis or bronchial asthma. Nearly 80% of children with AD eventually develop allergic rhinitis or asthma. AD can be classified as  mixed  (cases associated with respiratory allergies) and  pure . Pure AD has  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  variants. In the extrinsic type, interleukin-4 is secreted by T-cells isolated from spontaneous lesions and skin-derived T-lymphocytes express more IL-13. Due to the different immunopathogenesis, it has been suggested that antileukotriene agents may be more successful in the treatment of the extrinsic subgroup. Leukotrienes (LTs) are a class of potent biological inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. There is evidence of enhanced LT production in the pathogenesis of AD. Evidence in the literature provides a pathophysiological rationale for the use of cysLT receptor blockers in the treatment of AD. However, the exact mechanism of action of leukotriene receptor antagonists in AD is not known. In small clinical and case studies, montelukast was found to be a safe and effective alternative or steroid-sparing therapy in the management of patients with atopic dermatitis.","289":"Over the past decade, refinements in laser technology as well as advances in laser techniques have enabled dermatologic surgeons to define the most appropriate lasers to use for different scar types without the adverse sequelae and recurrence rates noted with older surgical revision techniques and continuous wave laser systems.","290":"Actinic Keratoses (AKs) are epidermal skin lesions that have the potential to develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Many of the treatment options available can cause discomfort, pain or skin irritation. Topical 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan gel (Solaraze, Bioglan Pharma) is a relatively new treatment that has been shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of AKs.","291":"The ichthyoses are a heterogeneous group of inherited scaling skin disorders that can also affect other organs. Management should be directed at both the skin and other sites. Skin therapy is not specific at this time, although new products may offer more directed therapy in the future. Moisturizers and keratolytics are the mainstay of topical therapy. Calcipotriene, retinoids, and for select types, anti-inflammatories such as topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors have also been used. Systemic therapy is limited to the retinoids. Superinfection of the skin should be anticipated and treated. Pruritus can be disabling. Failure to sweat normally may result in heat intolerance. Eye care should seek to prevent corneal changes resulting from ectropion and more specific changes associated with specific disorders. Haring can be impaired by the accumulation of material in the external auditory canal. Severely affected children may require caloric supplementation to avoid growth retardation. Affected individuals and their family should be counseled about the long term outlook and the genetic nature of their disorder, and informed of FIRST, the Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types, the lay foundation that offers support and information.","292":"Alefacept (AMEVIVE or LFA#TIP, Biogen) is the newest effective systemic therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis and was approved by the US FDA in January 2003. Clinical studies have shown that alefacept, given via weekly IM or IV injections for 12 weeks, was well tolerated, with no reported serious adverse events. Most significantly, it was found that alefacept provides a long-lasting remittive effect. These findings support the use of alefacept as a viable treatment of psoriasis, without the toxicities associated with some of the current systemic treatments available.","293":"Blepharoplasty of the upper and\/or lower eyelids can restore a youthful appearance to the aging face. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can be accomplished with little bleeding and a small incision. Laser-assisted blepharoplasty was pioneered in 1980, with the technique simplified after the subsequent introduction of the pulsed carbon dioxide laser. Laser-assistance helps mitigate bleeding during blepharoplasty. In ideal circumstances, the laser can be used as a multipurpose device that simultaneously offers cutting, cautery and blunt dissection capabilities. However, there is little experimental evidence confirming the superiority of laser-assisted blepharoplasty over more traditional scalpel surgery. For some procedures cold-steel may be preferable, and some surgeons prefer to use a knife for initial incisions and then laser for its coagulative properties. Patient factors and physician skill should guide the selection of the ideal blepharoplasty technique.","294":"Focal hyperhidrosis of axillae, palms or soles is a frequent, socially debilitating condition triggered by various emotional stimuli. There are several treatment options such as local application of metal sales (aluminum chloride) or tap water iontophoresis, which provide temporary relief for some patients. More recently, local intradermal injections of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A), a neurotoxin blocking the cholinergic stimulus of eccrine sweat glands, offers an effective treatment option with few side-effects. Patient satisfaction rates are high, although treatment effects only last a few months. For definite care, surgical procedures have to be considered.","295":"Hand eczema is a common skin disease that tends to become chronic and may interfere with many types of work. Emollients have been shown to be useful in reducing eczema activity and in the primary prevention of hand eczema. Protection of the hands is very important for the prevention of hand eczema and is a fundamental aspect of the treatment of hand eczema. Although topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, few studies of their rational use, efficacy and side-effects have been conducted. A combination of tacrolimus and topical corticosteroids may reduce the risk of steroid-associated side-effects. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and methotrexate show promising results, and acitretin may suppress keratotic hand eczema. Botulinum toxin has been used with success in the treatment of dyshidrotic hand eczema. PUVA is effective as a systemic treatment. Bath-PUVA treatment, UVB and Grenz rays can also suppress hand eczema.","296":"Hydroquinone has been successfully used to treat hyperpigmentation disorders for many years. Recently, new formulations containing hydroquinone have become available, including Lustra and Lustra-AF (Medicis). These products also contain glycolic acid 2%, an active antioxidant system (ascorbyl palmitate and tocopherol acetate), and moisturizers. Lustra-AF also contains a broad-spectrum sunscreen. Alustra contains a stabilized, high-concentration of retinol. The above formulations inhibit melanogenesis, stimulate epidermal desquamation, inhibit free radical-mediated photodamage and restore the antioxidant reservoir. The addition of retinoids may facilitate epidermal penetration of hydroquinone and prevent its oxidation. Comparative studies have shown that these agents can be effective in reducing blotchiness, mottled hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and surface roughness. In addition, these formulations have been generally well tolerated with patients rarely reporting mild-to-moderate adverse events such as dryness, redness, or peeling of the skin.","297":"Skin cleansers may be an important adjunct to the regimen of those who use cosmetics, have sensitive or compromised skin, or utilize topical therapies. Cleansers emulsify dirt, oil and microorganisms on the skin surface so that they can be easily removed. During cleansing, there is a complex interaction between the cleanser, the moisture skin barrier, and skin pH. Cleansing, with water soap or a liquid cleanser, will affect the moisture skin barrier. Soap will bring about the greatest changes to the barrier and increase skin pH. Liquid facial cleansers are gentler, effecting less disruption of the barrier, with minimal change to skin pH, and can provide people with a cleanser that is a combination of surfactant classes, moisturizers and acidic pH in order to minimize disruption to the skin barrier.","298":"There are many herbal therapies available for dermatological diseases that patients have already begun to discover. Dermatologists must be educated not only in the benefits of these therapies, but must also be aware of some of the risks and adverse effects. They need information about the effects of herbal remedies in order to better serve their patients who may be using herbs to treat their dermatological conditions. This brief review summarizes some of the more common herbal therapies used by many dermatology patients for their skin diseases, and the adverse reactions and drug interactions that may occur.","299":"Nonablative laser and light therapy is a relatively novel modality for the improvement of the visual appearance of photodamaged, scarred, and injured skin. A number of different wavelengths and devices have been purported to be efficacious for the delivery of nonablative therapy. Among the features that can be addressed are red spots and telangiectasia, pigmentation and lentigines, and their daily routines while benefiting from the cumulative effects of skin rejuvenation.","300":"Acitretin (Soriatane, Roche Pharmaceuticals) is an aromatic retinoid, effective in the treatment of severe psoriasis. This study highlights data from two existing clinical trials to capture PASI 50 and PASI 75 responder rates which represent a common metric used in current psoriasis clinical trials. A review of pharmacokinetics, safety and a discussion of relapse rate establish acitretin as an efficacious, convenient, oral treatment for initial and maintenance therapy of severe psoriasis.","301":"As hair transplant surgery has evolved, combinations of micrografting and minigrafting have enabled physicians to produce ever more natural combinations of both. A wide range of men and women can now receive significant aesthetic benefits from hair transplants. In recent years, practitioners have further refined hair transplant techniques to ensure that the hairs available for transplantation are used most efficiently. Specifically, methods of harvesting hair, preparing grafts, creating recipient sites, and placing grafts are designed to permit the maximum percentage of hairs to survive and thrive after transplantation. Careful planning, close cooperation with the patient, and a staged surgical approach can also result in hair conservation and optimal cosmesis.","302":"Etanercept (Enbrel, Amgen and Wyeth), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist, was approved in January 2002, for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The anti-inflammatory effects of etanercept are due to its ability to bind to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF, preventing it from interacting with cell-surface receptors and rendering it biologically inactive. Etanercept was evaluated for the treatment of PsA and psoriasis in a preliminary study of 60 patients and in a confirmatory phase III study of 205 patients. In both studies, etanercept was shown to be significantly superior to placebo for the treatment of PsA, evaluated by Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. It also was superior to placebo in improving psoriatic skin lesions, evaluated by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and target lesion scores. Side-effects were minimal; mild injection site reactions, which resolved during continued therapy, were experienced by approximately one-quarter of the patients. Overall, etanercept is highly effective and well tolerated by patients with PsA, with a safety profile similar to that seen in rheumatoid arthritis.","303":"","304":"Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne protozoal infection of the skin. Several species of Leishmania cause this disease in the Old World. It is manifested as chronic nodular to ulcerative lesions of the skin, which last for many months and may be disfiguring. They eventually heal leaving a scar. Local care of the lesion and treatment of secondary bacterial infection are essential for healing. Antileishmania therapy is indicated in immunocompromised hosts, patients with progressive, multiple, or critically located lesions. Pentavalent antimony compounds remain the main therapeutic option for all species. They are given intravenously (i.v.), intramuscularly (i.m.), or intralesionally. Cryotherapy, and some systemic antifungal agents have been used successfully. Oral azoles are promising new treatments for lesions caused by L. Major. Several other alternatives and their evidence are also presented.","305":"Traditionally, dermatologic surgeons have referred women seeking breast reduction to plastic surgeons for excisional mammoplasty. However, with recent advances in small cannula tumescent liposuction surgery, referral for such surgery may be unnecessary in some cases. Breast liposuction can reduce the size of female breasts that have essentially normal architecture with a minimum of visible scarring and an aesthetically pleasing result. We describe a method for liposuction reduction of female breasts that is safe, efficacious, and associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. Liposuction for breast reduction in women is an appropriate addition to the array of liposuction procedures available to the dermatologic surgeon.","306":"There is compelling evidence that oral contraceptives (OCs) are effective in the management of mild-moderate acne vulgaris, as well as cumulative evidence that elevated levels of androgens in acne patients, relative to appropriate controls, are an underlying pathophysiological factor in acne. All low dose OCs reduce serum free testosterone (T) to a similar extent, which is contrary to the traditional concept that a patient who has acne should not use an OC containing a progestin with androgenic properties. The efficacy of various OCs to improve acne has been reported in transverse, cohort and comparative studies, and more recently in multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Recently, an ultra-low dose OC (Alesse, Wyeth) was shown to effectively reduce non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions in mild-to-moderate acne, while having a profile of side-effects similar to that of a placebo. Besides its contraceptive efficacy, an ultra-low dose OC represents an attractive alternative as a single or associated medication in the management of acne.","307":"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) may account for at least 20% of all childhood dermatitis. Clinically, its morphology is identical to other forms of dermatitis in acute, subacute and chronic forms. A persistent or unusual and localized pattern is often the key to diagnosis. Treatment has centered around the use of corticosteroids, with the adjunct of antihistamines, wet dressings, and emollients for alleviation of symptoms. The newer topical immunosuppressives, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, may also hold promise as alternative therapies, although they have not been well-studied in this regard. Allergen identification, sometimes through patch testing and allergen avoidance are the keys to preventing recurrences of this disease.","308":"Chronic urticaria is a common dermatologic condition that is idiopathic in most cases. Antihistamines are the mainstays of treatment for this condition. The newer, second and third generation antihistamines are the preferred agents because of their improved safety profile and comparable efficacy to the first generation antihistamines. Desloratadine is a new non-sedating H1-receptor agonist. Based on clinical studies, desloratadine is a valuable new addition to the available treatment options and should be considered as a first-line therapy for patients with chronic urticaria.","309":"The fat compartments of the face undergo changes and are responsible for age-related alterations in facial shape. The overlying skin responds to changes in fat in much the same way as a garment clings or sags to the body underneath. By rearranging the underlying fat via suction and fat replacement techniques, a younger-shaped face can be achieved without conventional excisional surgery.","310":"Imiquimod is the first of a new class of drugs to emerge in the treatment of various dermatologic disorders. As an immune response modifier, it has been shown to have potent antiviral and antitumor properties through the stimulation of innate and cell mediated immune pathways. It is currently approved for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts, but has also been found to be an effective treatment for a host of other virus-associated dermatologic lesions, including common and flat warts, molluscum contagiosum and herpes simples 2. Oncological lesions showing improvement with the use of imiquimod include basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, malignant melanoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and cutaneous extramammary Paget's disease. Recent case studies have also found this product to be effective for treating keloids, infantile hemangiomas, porokeratosis of Mibelli, leishmanisis, and tattoo removal. This extensive array of disorders treated successfully with imiquimod warrants further study of this novel and valuable drug.","311":"Polymorphous light eruption (PLE) and solar urticaria (SU) are two photodermatoses that are induced by ultraviolet radiation and sometimes by visible light. This article will review the various means of preventing PLE and SU with an emphasis on the role of sunscreens.","312":"Butenafine is a synthetic benzylamine antifungal agent that may be fungicidal against susceptible organisms, e.g., dermatophytes. Butenafine may be effective and safe in the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis (apply twice daily for 1 week or once daily for 4 weeks), tinea corporis\/tinea cruris (apply twice daily for 2 weeks), and pityriasis versicolor (apply once daily for 2 weeks). The effectiveness of the drug persists for at least 4 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy suggesting that there is some retention of the drug in the skin following termination of active therapy.","313":"Onychomycosis is a common disease, and there are a number of factors that may affect the duration and dosage of treatment including the type of onychomycosis, the area and thickness of nail involvement, the age of the patient, and the location of the digit that is affected. We report a composite index, the Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis (SCIO) that combines these factors to give an index of the overall severity of onychomycosis. The use of the SCIO may have treatment implications; by matching patients with similar SCIO scores, it may be possible to better compare the clinical response to therapy.","314":"Seborrheic dermatitis is a common superficial dermatosis, characterized by red, flaking areas of the skin, which may in some cases be covered with yellowish flakes. The most commonly affected areas are the nasolabial folds, ears, eyebrows, scalp and chest. While seborrheic dermatitis may be easy to recognize clinically, the variability of the lesions in both appearance and location may complicate the diagnosis. Seborrheic dermatitis has been described as resembling psoriasis (in which case, the condition may be called \"sebopsoriasis\") and, when affecting the eyes or ears, has also been described as blepharitis and otitis, respectively. Seborrheic dermatitis tends to be chronic, though seasonal variation is common, with lesions worsening in the dry, winter months.","315":"Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a common occurrence among women over 25 years of age. The likelihood of developing infection increases with pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives or antibiotics, or immune disorders. However, in many cases, the etiology of the disorder is unknown. Sobel1 suggests that some cases of reinfection may actually be cases of relapse, due to either inadequate testing methods, which result in false-negative results after treatment, or to ineffective treatments. Misdiagnosis of the causative organism may also result in ineffective treatment. The most common causal Candida species is C. albicans. However, other, less easily eradicated species may also be involved.","316":"Acne is a multifactorial disease of the pilosebaceous unit in the skin. Four contributing pathogenic factors need to be elucidated and include excess sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, colonization of the pilosebaceous unit by Propionibacterium acnes, which is a gram positive anaerobic diphtheroid, and the release of inflammatory mediators into the follicle and dermis. One or more of these factors are targeted by each of the systemic therapies for this disease and its variant, including systemic antibiotic therapies, which will be reviewed here.","317":"Clindoxyl Gel (Stiefel) is a combination of 1% clindamycin phosphate and 5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel vehicle that is well tolerated and more efficacious than either active agent alone or the vehicle in reducing lesion counts and improving global scores in patients with moderate acne. It was approved for once daily use in Canada in November 2001.","318":"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is more frequent in the pediatric population and in children with atopic dermatitis (AD) than has hitherto been appreciated. Patch testing, which is mediated by different immune mechanisms than prick skin testing, is both safe and diagnostically useful for individuals with AD. It may help to identify exacerbating allergies, e.g., constituents of topical treatments in refractory AD and to formulate treatment plans that feature preventive avoidance of the offending allergens.","319":"A new compound product containing calcipotriol 50 nanograms per gm and betamethasone dipropionate 0.5mg per gm (Dovobet, LEO Pharma) in an ointment base was recently introduced in Canada for the treatment of psoriasis. Known as Daivobet in Europe, it was introduced to the Danish Market in 2001, and approved for marketing by the European Union. This compound has been shown to be more active than either agent used along. The efficacy of once daily application was not shown to be different from that of twice daily use.","320":"Psoriasis is a common dermatoses, affecting children in North America. Many papers have stressed the treatments available for adult psoriasis, but few have dealt with this disorder in children. Topical treatment modalities continue to be the first line therapy for childhood psoriasis. This paper summarizes the general topical treatments available including their clinical use, benefits, cost, and side-effects.","321":"Pimecrolimus is an immunomodulating medication that inhibits production of inflammatory cytokines in the skin and this compound was specifically developed for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. Phase II and III clinical trials with the topical formulation of pimecrolimus (Elidel cream, Novartis) have shown that it is safe and effective for use in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). The US FDA recently approved Elidel for use in patients &gt;or=2 years of age and older with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).","322":"","323":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic itchy, inflammatory skin disease that is extremely difficult to treat. Effective therapeutic agents are limited in number, and may have long-term toxic side-effects. Frustrated by these realities, many patients stop seeking help from conventional physicians and turn to alternative medical approaches. These can include so-called natural products, herbal products and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments. Herbs and medications share a common history, as most of our well-known medications were derived from plants. However, herbal remedies are largely unregulated. Many may have scientific merit and clinical benefit, but they are still scientifically invalid and inadequately monitored. Dermatologists need information about the effects of herbal remedies in order to better serve their patients.","324":"Use of medications by breast-feeding mothers is not uncommon. When prescribing a medication to a nursing mother, the physician must weigh the potential risk of exposing the infant to the medication or the risks of not breast-feeding against the benefits of the medication to the mother. Information regarding the safety of common dermatological medications during lactation will be reviewed. Based on this information, treatment recommendations will be made.","325":"Psoriasis, acne vulgaris and photoaging are common conditions. Tazarotene is a pro-drug of tazarotenic acid, a receptor-selective retinoid, which has shown efficacy in the treatment of these disorders. In the treatment of acne vulgaris, it has greater comedolytic activity than the currently available topical retinoids. In psoriasis, tazarotene normalizes keratinocyte differentiation, reverses keratinocyte hyperproliferation and has better anti-inflammatory effects than any of the currently available topical retinoids. It is most commonly used as combination therapy with a topical corticosteroid or phototherapy in psoriasis, or with an antibiotic in acne.","326":"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most frequently occurring autoimmune blistering disease in Europe and North America. Although it is primarily a disease of the elderly, children and young adults can also develop it. The aim of treatment is to suppress the clinical signs and symptoms of BP without over-treating the patient, because BP tends to spontaneously remit in most patients within approximately 5 years. Mild or localized disease may respond to super-potent topical corticosteroids alone or in combination with tetracyclines with or without niacinamide. More severe or generalized disease usually requires systemic treatment with prednisolone (dose range from 20-70 mg\/d). Additional immunosuppressant therapy is necessary for more refractory disease.","327":"Rosacea is relatively common, typically occurring in individuals of Northern European and Celtic origin between 30 and 50 years of age. It is more common in women, but may be more severe in men. Currently there is no cure available for rosacea, but it can be controlled with topical and oral drug therapy. Topical metronidazole 1% cream is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and erythema associated with rosacea. This treatment option is effective, safe and well tolerated.","328":"Moisturizers are widely used in various dermatologic and cosmetic skin therapies. Different classes of moisturizers are based on their mechanism of action, including occlusives, humectants, emollients and protein rejuvenators. Commercially available moisturizers often utilize components of each of these classes to provide their beneficial effect. Dry skin (xerosis) is the major indication of use. Others include atopic dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, and dermatoheliosis. Although generally efficacious, moisturizers can cause a number of unwanted side-effects, including occlusive folliculitis, irritation, allergic contact dermatitis and contact urticaria.","329":"The botulinum neurotoxins (BTX) are an exciting group of therapeutic agents with dramatically expanding clinical indications. The US FDA has approved BOTOX (BTX-A, Allergan) and Myobloc (BTX-B, Elan Pharmaceuticals) for the treatment of cervical dystonia. TPP Canada has also approved BOTOX for the treatment of glabellar frown lines. The US FDA is expected to approve this new indication before the end of 2002. These changes will dramatically expand the marketing of BTXs. Concerns about risks and side-effects diminish as clinical experience increases with this \"most poisonous of poisons\". In particular, the incidence of secondary resistance to the toxin's effect has been dramatically diminished with the reduction of the non-toxic protein in current batches of BOTOX.","330":"Chronic palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPP) is a disabling condition characterized by recurrent crops of sterile pustules on a background of erythema, fissuring and scaling. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in its etiology. Topical treatments are frequently ineffective although corticosteroids under hydrocolloid occlusion have been demonstrated to be useful. There is evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids, PUVA and a combination of both. Oral tetracycline antibiotics may be helpful, but rarely clear PPP. Cyclosporine has been shown to be of some benefit at low doses. The choice of systemic treatments for an individual patient is influenced as much by their potential side effects as by differences in efficacy.","331":"Genital herpes simplex and herpes zoster infections are common afflictions that are associated with significant morbidity and a decreased quality of life. Famciclovir (Famvir, Novartis) is an orally administered prodrug of the antiviral agent penciclovir. Its unique pharmacokinetic profile makes it an efficacious, convenient and well-tolerated alternative to the traditionally prescribed acyclovir. Famciclovir is used for the acute treatment and suppressive therapy of recurrent genital herpes as well as for herpes zoster and its debilitating comorbidities. Famiciclovir allows patients to manage or prevent symptoms, thereby significantly improving their quality of life. Its favorable safety profile makes it a good treatment choice for the elderly as well as for immunocompromised patients, including those infected with HIV.","332":"Although hemangiomas are frequently encountered in pediatric practice, their management has been controversial because they are notoriously unpredictable, especially in early infancy. In the past, clinicians believed that infant and childhood hemangiomas were best left untreated, due to spontaneous involution and the adverse effects of treatments such as radiotherapy and surgery. However, today there is an increased awareness of both the physical and psychological sequelae associated with hemangiomas, a small percentage of which can be life threatening and this has resulted in a renewed push to treat them. Furthermore, therapeutic advances have been made, and new therapies are on the horizon.","333":"Moxifloxacin (Avelox, Bayer), which is available for oral administration, is a broad-spectrum synthetic antimicrobial agent with excellent Gram-positive activity and good Gram-negative activity. The US FDA recently approved this drug for the treatment of bacterial skin infections.","334":"Dryness and itching in the vulvovaginal area is an increasing problem as our female population ages and becomes menopausal. This dryness and itching is often the result of estrogen deficiency, and there are typically two types of treatment: Specific Therapy (or hormone replacement therapy), and Nonspecific Therapy. Dermatologists should be able to sort out the causes of the itching and irritation, and understand the approaches to therapy.","335":"The role of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of in situ neoplasias and tumors of the skin is steadily increasing. Its principles of photodynamic action include an intratumoral enriched photosensitizer and light activation. Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has demonstrated highest efficacy in topical PDT, and has become the most clinically useful. For actinic (solar) keratoses, topical ALA-PDT using Levulan Kerastick (20% topical solution, DUSA Pharmaceuticals) is already postulated to be the treatment of choice. In December 1999, the US FDA approved this topical product for the treatment of actinic keratoses. Levulan is well tolerated and leads to excellent cosmetic results with only minor side effects.","336":"Carac (5-fluorouracil 0.5% cream, Aventis Pharma) was approved by the US FDA in October 2000, for the treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses involving the face and anterior scalp. The cream should be applied in a thin film once daily to the skin where actinic keratoses (AKs) are present. When it is applied for 1, 2, or 4 weeks, it is significantly more effective than a vehicle in the management of patients with five or more AKs at pretherapy. Pooled data from the two pivotal trials (n=384) indicate that following 4 weeks of therapy the number of subjects with total AK clearance in the Carac and vehicle groups was 52.9% and 1.6% respectively (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the corresponding reduction of AK lesion counts in the Carac and vehicle groups was 82.5% and 19.3%, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Treatment should be continued up to 4 weeks as tolerated by the patient. The most common adverse-effect is facial irritation.","337":"Antidepressant drugs can be an important component of the dermatologists' therapeutic armamentarium. When considering the use of psychotropic agents in dermatology two major factors should be considered: (1) the accurate diagnosis of the comorbid psychiatric disorder, and (2) the presence of proper indications for the use of antidepressant agents. Antidepressant drugs are used in the management of the psychiatric syndromes, which are most frequently comorbid with dermatologic disorders, i.e., Major Depressive Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Social Phobia. The antihistaminic and analgesic properties of some antidepressants such as doxepin and amitriptyline, are also of benefit in the treatment of some pruritic and neuralgic states. The specific guidelines, side effect profile, drug-drug interactions, and the most current indications should always be obtained for any particular antidepressant agent before it is prescribed.","338":"ROSASOL Cream is a novel topical formulation of 1% metronidazole in a vehicle containing sunscreens (SPF 15). This product has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory lesions, erythema, and telangiectasiae associated with rosacea.","339":"Toxicodendron dermatitis results from a reaction to an oil soluble oleoresin that is present in many parts of the poison ivy and poison oak plants. Prophylactic measures include avoidance, protective clothing, barrier creams and hyposensitization. Treatments include washing the area immediately with a solvent suitable for lipids and the use of anti-inflammatory agents, especially corticosteroids.","340":"Eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream is the first topical prescription treatment to be approved by the US FDA for the reduction of unwanted facial hair in women. It irreversibly inhibits ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step for follicular polyamine synthesis, which is necessary for hair growth. In clinical trials eflornithine cream slowed the growth of unwanted facial hair in up to 60% of women. Improvement occurs gradually over a period of 4-8 weeks or longer. Most reported adverse reactions consisted of minor skin irritation.","341":"Imiquimod (S-26308, R-837) (1-(2-methylpropyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4 amine), and immune response modifier, was approved as a 5% cream (Aldara, 3M Pharmaceuticals) by the US FDA in February 1997, for the treatment of genital and perianal warts. Drug activity results primarily from induction of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and other cytokines in the skin, which stimulate several other aspects of the innate immune response. Imiquimod also stimulates acquired immunity, in particular the cellular arm, which is important for control of viral infections and tumors. It is expected to be effective where exogenous IFN-alpha has shown utility, and where enhancement of cell-mediated immunity is needed. Recently presented Phase II clinical studies demonstrated efficacy in treating UV induced skin lesions, basal cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis. Case studies have reported benefit when treating molluscum and in prevention of keloids after surgery.","342":"","343":"","344":"","345":"Oral contraceptives (OCs) can reduce acne by lowering the production of adrenal and ovarian androgens, by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, which in turn, reduces the levels of dihydrotestosterone, and by stimulating sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thus reducing the levels of free testosterone. In newer OCs, such as Tricyclen and Diane-35, the progestin component is minimally androgenic and anti-androgenic respectively, thereby enhancing the favorable profile of these products in the treatment of hyperandrogenic disorders, including acne. The efficacy of these agents and their long-term safety profile supports their use in various grades of acne in females: * As adjunctive therapy to topical agents for women with mild non-scarring acne desiring oral contraception * As primary therapy for patients with moderate non-scarring acne in combination with topical therapy and systemic antibiotics * As one of two preferred methods of contraception in patients with scarring and severe inflammatory acne being treated with systemic isotretinoin.","346":"Treatment of metastatic melanoma using traditional chemotherapy regimens has been disappointing. However, recent work with agents that modify the host's immune system (e.g., interleukins) have provided limited but encouraging results. Interleukins are a group of molecules involved in immune cell signaling. As a high-dose, single agent therapy, Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has produced durable, complete responses in a small, but real percentage of metastatic melanoma patients, but toxicities are significant and specialized care is required. The use of IL-2 in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic and biologic agents has produced an even higher percentage of complete responses, but the trials have been relatively small to date and durability is not as well proven. IL-2 is also being tested in conjunction with vaccines, activated immune cells, and other biologic response modifiers (including IL-12). It is hoped that these will lead to further increases in the number of metastatic melanoma patients who respond in a clinically meaningful fashion.","347":"Tacrolimus, available for intravenous, oral and now topical administration, is a potent immunosuppressive agent with the ability to block the production of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and inhibit T-cell proliferation. Originally developed for use in organ transplantation, it is currently being studied for the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses. The US FDA recently approved tacrolimus ointment (Protopic (R), Fujisawa) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.","348":"Over the past century, tanned skin shifted from being unpopular to becoming the height of fashion. However, the past decade has again seen white skin become fashionable as more and more people become aware of the dangers of spending too much time in the sun. Even so, having tanned skin is still popular and probably will be for some time to come. This article will focus on cosmetic products that are designed to simulate tanning of the skin by coloring or staining the skin without sun exposure.","349":"If methotrexate were introduced as a new drug today, it would be hailed as a major advance in the management of psoriasis, as well as for a number of other conditions. Because the patent on methotrexate expired decades ago, this medication has not recently received the attention it deserves. When patients are properly screened and educated about the correct use of methotrexate, and appropriately monitored during treatment, this drug is a safe, inexpensive, well-tolerated and effective medication for the control of psoriasis.","350":"","351":"Conventional treatment options for hypertrichosis and hirsutism are tedious and time consuming. Laser hair removal offers an efficient way to permanently reduce excessive hair growth. Hair is damaged using the principle of selective photothermolysis with wavelengths of light well absorbed by follicular melanin and pulse durations that selectively thermally damage the target without damaging surrounding tissue. Patients with dark hair and light skin are ideal candidates. Multiple treatments (3 to 6) performed every 6-8 weeks are necessary to achieve a permanent reduction of hair growth. As the field develops, a better sense of the effectiveness of laser hair removal will evolve and reasonable expectations will be determined.","352":"There are three electrolysis modalities. In galvanic electrolysis, a direct current is passed down a needle inserted into the hair follicle, destroying the follicle. In thermolysis a high frequency alternating current is passed down the needle and produces destructive heat. The blend is the third modality, which combines galvanic electrolysis and thermololysis. Electrolysis satisfactorily removes hair from women and men with hypertrichosis, but women with hirsutism require concomitant hormonal management. Scarring does not occur with properly performed electrolysis. Shaving one to five days before electrolysis greatly increases efficacy because it ensures that only growing anagen hairs are epilated. The judicious use of ice packs and the recent availability of EMLA (lidocaine\/prilocaine cream) have been beneficial in reducing the sensations of electrolysis.","353":"Corticosteroids have dominated the class of anti-inflammatory agents for the past 50 years. In the last ten years, seven new corticosteroids have been developed for topical use. Characteristics common to these several chemically different corticosteroids are their class III, or high potency (USP) designation and their improved safety profile. Allergic contact dermatitis is an unexpected adverse effect that is caused by some of them, in particular budesonide and, to a somewhat lesser degree, the labile \"prodrug\" corticosteroids, such as prednicarbate and prednisone acepontate.","354":"Adatosil is a viscous silicone oil which was granted FDA approval in 1994. This designation removes the legal obstacles to usage for soft tissue augmentation. However, physicians are advised to exercise discretion when using this product. There are several caveats which govern its use, including several contraindications, as well as difficult technical application.","355":"Cyanoacrylates are surgical adhesives that provide another option for wound closure. When compared to sutures, cyanoacrylates were found to be as effective as sutures in low tension lacerations and for the attachment of some full-thickness skin grafts. In addition, clinical practitioners have found cyanoacrylates easier to apply, time saving, and more economical. There are a number of surgical adhesives either currently available or under development. The presently available butylcyanoacrylates and octylcyanoacrylates are reviewed.","356":"Botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) is a neurotoxin which blocks presynaptic release of acetylcholine. It interferes with neuromuscular transmission, temporarily paralyzing the affected muscle. Of special interest for dermatologists is the unlabelled cosmetic applications, for conditions such as wrinkles and hyperhidrosis. Labelled indications in Europe are for cervical dystonia and cerebral palsy. In the US, it is approved for treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm in adults. After repeated use of high doses, antibodies can develop in some individuals, making further treatment ineffective indefinitely. Even when used in high does for neurological conditions, the development of antibodies occurs in &lt; 5&amp;percnt of patients. In 1997, the US FDA approved a new bulk toxin source for use in the manufacture of BTX-A. It has a higher specific potency than original BTX-A formulations, reducing the amount of utilized neurotoxin protein, and thereby reducing antibody production. Another form of this neurotoxin (type B) also appears to be effective in patients who have developed antibodies to BTX-A. It is awaiting US FDA approval for treatment of cervical dystonia.","357":"","358":"Treatment objectives and pharmacoeconomic considerations are important when developing guidelines that are effective and rational. Canadian Acne Treatment Guidelines were last published in 1995. New guidelines were recently developed to incorporate therapeutic advances and data from more recent studies. Isotretinoin fulfills the major objectives of acne treatment and has clear pharmacoeconomic advantages when compared to conventional rotational oral antibiotics, antiandrogens and topical therapy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. It should be considered the standard of treatment for scarring acne and moderate-to-severe non-scarring acne.","359":"Systemic Sclerosis is a multisystem disorder with vascular instability as a clinical hallmark. Treatment currently consists of recognition and management of end-organ damage. Dermatologists can assist in the management of these patients by facilitating early diagnosis, and treating cutaneous manifestations such as Raynaud's phenomenon, cutaneous calcinosis, and digital ulceration. New potentially disease-modifying therapies are now undergoing clinical trials.","360":"Ciclopirox nail lacquer 8% (Penlac, Aventis Pharma) was approved by the US FDA in December 1999, as a component of a comprehensive management program, for use in immunocompetent patients who have mild to moderate onychomycosis of the fingers and toes without lunula involvement due to Trichophyton rubrum. The comprehensive management program includes removal of the unattached, infected nails as frequently as once per month, by a health care professional who has special competence in the diagnosis and treatment of nail disorders, including minor nail procedures. The nail lacquer is not approved in Canada.","361":null,"362":"Vitiligo is an acquired skin disorder caused by the disappearance of pigment cells from the epidermis, and results in well defined white patches that are often symmetrically distributed. The lack of melanin pigment makes the lesional skin more sensitive to sunburn. Vitiligo can be cosmetically disfiguring and is a stigmatizing condition, leading to serious psychological problems in daily life. It occurs worldwide in about 1% of the population, mostly between the ages of 10-30 years, and as often in males as in females. The cause is unknown, but might involve genetic factors, autoimmunity, toxic metabolites, and\/or a higher vulnerability of melanocytes. Some new treatments for this condition include corticosteroid + UVA treatment, UVB narrow wave band (311 nm) irradiation, and transplantation of autologous pigment cells. In widespread vitiligo, residual pigment can be removed by depigmentation agents. Sunscreens, camouflage products and good guidance may help the patient to better cope with this disease.","363":"Topical immunotherapy with diphencyprone (DPCP) for the treatment of severe alopecia areata has been used since 1983 and is felt to be the treatment of choice by many dermatologists. Although there have been no major side effects reported since its initial use, there remain some unknowns regarding its safety. Because DPCP has at least a 40% success rate for cosmetically acceptable regrowth in extensive alopecia areata, its availability is an important matter for patients with alopecia areata.","364":"Despite the predominance of itch as a leading and distressing symptom in most of the dermatological and several systemic diseases, there is relatively little progress in understanding its pathophysiology. This is most likely the main reason for the limited number of satisfactory anti-itch treatments and the fact that even today various therapies have empirical but not evidence-based character. There are no specific antipruritic drugs on the market, but there are a high number of case reports and experimental investigations describing medications with antipruritic potency. It is therefore the aim of this article to briefly review the major systemic antipruritic drugs and give a short overview on the different types of pruritus and their possible systemic therapy.","365":"Herbs have been used in clinical medicine for thousands of years. However, it is only in recent times that we have been able to employ scientific methods to prove the efficacy of many of these herbs and to give us a better understanding of their mechanisms of action. This article will focus on the use of herbs in various dermatological conditions characterized by inflammation and pruritus. Topical preparations of many of these herbs are more commonplace in Europe. However, their availability is increasing in the US. As this is occurring we are witnessing a growing marriage between alternative and traditional medicines.","366":"In the US prescription drug costs are rising faster than any other component of health care expenditures, and show no signs of slowing. Spending on prescription drugs has been estimated by the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) to be rising by approximately 12% per year, more than twice the rate for national health care expenditures (5.1%). Factors driving the rise in prescription drug costs include the introduction of new drugs, and consumer demand.","367":"Localized scleroderma, or morphea, is a chronic disease that causes a thickening and induration of the skin. For plaque type morphea, the treatments of choice include super-potent corticosteroids and calcipotriol. For the more generalized forms, as well as the linear forms, UVA is currently the best therapeutic modality. Patients with localized scleroderma are managed by both rheumatologists and dermatologists. There is still much therapeutic uncertainty in this disease.","368":"Topical corticosteroids are important in psoriasis therapy. However, there are other worthwhile options available including tar, anthralin, tazarotene, calcipotriol, topical PUVA, and topical porphyrin derivatives. With growing public reluctance to use systemic medications, topical treatments for psoriasis could become increasingly important in the future.","369":"Topical acne treatment can positively benefit patients with acne. This review summarizes clinical and prescribing information on currently available topical agents. The efficacy of the medications included in this report is supported by properly designed randomized clinical trials.","370":"Scabies and lice have afflicted man since ancient times. Permethrin is generally the treatment of choice for head lice and scabies, because of its residual effect. Toxicity and absorption are minimal. Ivermectin should be reserved for cases where permethrin fails."},"articletitle":{"0":"Sarecycline: A Narrow-Spectrum Antibiotic.","1":"Halobetasol Propionate 0.01% Lotion for Plaque Psoriasis and
