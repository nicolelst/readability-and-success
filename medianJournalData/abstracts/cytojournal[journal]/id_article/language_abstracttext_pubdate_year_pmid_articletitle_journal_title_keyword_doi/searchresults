cavity may be involved by any neoplasm, including very rare examples of involvement by central nervous system tumors leading to a malignant effusion. The serous cavity lining is rich in lymphatics with lymphatic lacunae opening directly through narrow gaps (stoma) in the lining. Carcinomas mainly metastasize to serosa via the lymphatic vessels, which may be blocked leading to effusion. Primary carcinomas of organs such as lung, intestines, liver, ovary, etc., lined by serosal membranes may spread by direct extension, resulting in malignant effusions. As standard of practice, unless specified, cytopathologic examination of serous effusions implies detection of malignant cells. As compared to a surgical biopsy from a small focal area of an extensive serosal surface, effusion fluid from respective cavity exfoliates the cells from the entire serosal surface with minimal chance of sampling artifact. Because of this, effusion fluid cytology generally provides a higher diagnostic yield as compared to biopsy of the serous lining, as demonstrated by some studies. However, various challenges related to effusion fluid cytology makes the interpretation of effusion fluid cytology a field with potential misinterpretations, especially for those without proper experience or training. Developing and following a methodical approach is important for appropriate cytologic examination of effusion fluids. Proper approach may achieve definitive interpretation even without ancillary tests. However, lack of appropriate approach and processing may introduce a significant variation in interpretation due to combination of well-recognized diagnostic pitfalls, which may lead to lower reproducibility and even serious misinterpretations. Current review discusses in brief appropriate approach to processing and evaluating effusion fluid cytology for metastatic carcinoma. At general level, this is comparable to that of other specimens; however, it is critical to modify with reference to the limitations associated with effusion cytology.","1":"Due to the remarkably wide morphologic spectrum of reactive mesothelial cells, some of the effusion fluids may be difficult to interpret with objective certainty by cytomorphology alone. Cytomorphology of well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas (responsible for the bulk of malignant effusions) may overlap with floridly reactive mesothelial cells. Even mesotheliomas including diffuse malignant epithelioid mesothelioma, are usually cytomorphologically bland without unequivocal features of malignancy. The intensity of challenge depends on the interpreter's training or experience level, institutional demographics of patients (such as type of prevalent diseases, predominant sex and age group), technical support, and quality of cytopreparatory processing. In general immunocytochemistry is valuable adjunct to facilitate objective interpretation with or without other ancillary techniques as indicated. An increasing number of immunomarkers is further refining the contribution of immunohistochemistry to this field. However, application of immunohistochemistry to effusion fluids is relatively challenging because of many variables. Multiple factors such as delay after specimen collection, specimen processing related factors including fixation and storage; ambient conditions under which paraffin blocks are archived (for retrospective testing); antigen retrieval method; duration of antigen retrieval step; antibody clone and dilution; and antibody application time are identical to application of immunohistochemistry in other areas. The significant challenge related to the potential compromization of the immunoreactivity pattern due to exposure to non-formalin fixatives \/ reagents is also applicable to effusion fluid specimens. The immunoreactivity results would be compared and corelated with cumulative metadata based on the reported studies performed and validated on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Deviating from such protocols may lead to suboptimal results, which is not uncommon in clinical practice with potential compromization of patient care and related liability. Because of this, it is critical to perform immunocytochemistry on formalin-fixed cell-block sections only. In addition, unless the interpretation criteria for immunohistochemical evaluation of effusion fluids are not modified specifically, it may not be productive in resolving some challenging cases. However, this aspect is not well elaborated in the literature. A basic and critical challenge is finding and locating the cells of interest in cell-block sections of effusion fluids. A unique approach is to choose a fundamental immunopanel which highlight the mesothelial and inflammatory cells in reactive effusion fluids to create the basic map. This allows detection of a 'second-foreign' population which can be immunocharacterized further with the help of subtractive coordinate immunoreactivity pattern (SCIP) approach elaborated here.","2":"Accumulation of fluid in serous cavities as effusions may have to be drained for therapeutic and diagnostic indications. As compared to many other procedures, the technicality of paracentesis procedures is relatively easy. As a result, effusion fluids comprise a significant proportion of specimens in most of the laboratories, including those in community settings. Because of relative complexities in the cytopathologic evaluation of effusion fluids, application of appropriately standardized protocol is critical for achieving optimum results by applying standardized steps from handling of specimens during the initial stages of collection to the final interpretation phase. Understanding various limitations and challenges during collection and processing phases by all the personnel involved, including clinicians, pathologists, and technologists is critical for optimum diagnostic yield. This review highlights various cytopreparatory techniques applicable to effusion cytology in one place. It is organized by projecting the details predominantly in the form of different tables and figures including summary of the recommended protocols with reagents and stains used. Also included is a sample of cytopathology report based on the approach discussed in this series.","3":"Bone is a frequent site of metastases and typically indicates a short-term prognosis in cancer patients. The majority of skeletal metastases are due to breast and prostate cancer. Bone metastasis is actually much more common than primary bone cancers, especially in adults. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) provides reasonably accurate pre-operative diagnosis in vast majority of cases. This study aims to elicit the cytomorphological detail of various metastatic bone tumors. A total of 109 cases of tumors metastatic to bone have been included in this study. The details of the cases were available from the archives of the department of cytology. May Grunwald Giemsa and hematoxylin and eosin stained smears were studied and examined for the cytomorphological spectrum. Cell block and immunohistochemistry tests were done, wherever feasible. Among 109 patients, the mean age was 54.52 years. There was male preponderance with 90 males and 19 females. The most common site of metastases was in the vertebra (82 cases), and 76 cases were in the dorsolumbar region. The most common type of tumor metastasizing was adenocarcinoma. FNAC is a very useful, economical procedure. There are characteristic cytological features of the metastatic lesions and the basic diagnostic categorization of the malignant tumors is possible on FNAC. Regarding the primary source clinical history, radiological features of the primary tumor, if any, and immunocytochemistry may be needed. ","4":"Definitive cytopathological interpretation of some of the effusion fluids may not be possible based on cytomorphological evaluation alone. As discussed in other reviews, this is due to various reasons specifically applicable to effusion fluids including remarkably wide morphologic spectrum of reactive mesothelial cells overlapping with some well to moderately differentiated metastatic carcinoma. The challenge is subject to various factors including level of interpreter training or experience, institutional demographics (such as type of prevalent diseases, predominant sex and age group), technical advances in ancillary support, and expertise in cytopreparatory processing. In such cases immunohistochemistry performed on cell-block sections is simple objective adjunct with or without other ancillary techniques. Ongoing increase in number of immunomarkers along with rabbit monoclonal antibodies with relatively higher affinity is further refining this field. SCIP (subtractive coordinate immunoreactivity pattern) approach, discussed as separate dedicated review article, facilitates refined interpretation of immunoreactivity pattern in coordinate manner on various serial sections of cell-blocks. However, many variables such as delay after specimen collection, specimen processing related factors including fixation and storage; ambient conditions under which paraffin blocks are archived (for retrospective testing); antigen retrieval method; duration of antigen retrieval step; antibody clone and dilution; and antibody application time are common with application of immunohistochemistry in other areas. This review is dedicated to highlight technical aspects including processing of effusion specimens for optimum immunocytochemical evaluation along with commonly used immunomarkers in effusion cytopathology. This review focuses on the technical and general information about various immunomarkers.","5":"","6":"Diagnosing hematolymphoid neoplasm by evaluating fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology sample is controversial and requires experience and clinical skills. This concept becomes more challenging when evaluating hematolymphoid neoplasm in body fluid. Differentiating between low-grade lymphoma and reactive lymphocytes is often difficult by morphology alone as reactive lymphoid cells may acquire activation morphology from being exposed to different cytokines within the body fluid. However, in most cases there are specific features that may aid in differentiating small reactive from non-reactive lymphocytes including the round shape of the nucleus, the absence of visible nucleoli and the presence of fine clumped chromatin. In large cell lymphoma and leukemia cells involvement of body fluid this concept becomes less challenging. Large cell lymphoma and leukemia cells tend to have large size nuclei, less mature chromatin, and visible nucleoli with and without cytoplasmic vacuoles. However, to reach accurate diagnosis and subclassification, the utilizing of flow cytometry, to confirm monoclonality, and other ancillary studies such immunocytochemistry, cytogenetics and molecular studies is needed.

While there are similarities to ascites, these samples have differences that must be recognized in order to avoid false positive interpretations. Non-neoplastic mesothelial alterations including heterogeneous reactive changes, endosalpingiosis , endometriosis and tumor rupture are typically not seen in ascites samples but can be seen in peritoneal washings from women with malignancies that have not extended to the peritoneal cavity. Awareness of these potential pitfalls and knowledge of the associated tumor type will facilitate accurate interpretation. When these caveats are recognized, peritoneal washing cytology results are a useful adjunct in helping to determine patient follow-up in women with gynecologic malignancies.","9":"Pleural fluid evaluation is an effective modality for identifying actionable genetic mutations to guide therapy in lung carcinoma. Clinicians requesting molecular studies often send large volumes of fluid to be processed that is not possible or cost effective and is hence not standard of practice in most cytopathology laboratories. We wanted to establish the characteristics of an adequate specimen that would yield reliable results with current molecular testing platforms. A review of 500 malignant pleural effusions, from pulmonary and non-pulmonary sources, was undertaken over a 4-year period. Of these 44 cases (from 42 patients) that were positive for primary lung adenocarcinoma were included in the study. Molecular analysis was performed on 42 specimens. A complete next generation sequencing (NGS) panel was performed on 36 specimens. Individual testing for estimated glomerular filtration rate, KRAS, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and ROS1 was performed on six specimens. The number of malignant cells and proportion of tumor to non-tumor nucleated cells (T: NT) on cell blocks was recorded as &lt;20%, 20-50% and &gt;50%. The minimum volume on which a complete NGS panel could be performed was 20 ml with cell count of 1000 and T: NT proportion of 20-50%. The minimum number of tumor cells required for successful molecular analysis for T: NT proportion of &lt;20%, 20-50%, and &gt;50% was 300, 250, and 170 cells, respectively. We concluded that tumor cell proportion, rather than specimen volume, is of prime importance for determining the efficacy of pleural fluid for molecular studies. Evaluation of both absolute and relative numbers of tumor cells is critical for assessing the adequacy and predicting successful yield for molecular analysis. ","10":"This chapter highlights the steps that would help to analyze any fluid. It highlights importance of knowing gross analysis of fluid along with biochemical information. These parameters along with clinical information are very important in arriving at a differential diagnosis. Morphologic appearances in the fluid can often become challenging and occasionally reactive conditions can reveal changes that may mimic malignancies. This chapter provides not only a framework of approach to assessment of fluid cytology but also shows how to distinguish some of the challenging reactive conditions from the diagnosis of carcinoma. The chapter also utilizes two cases to demonstrate approach to reactive conditions.

It is modified slightly from the chapter by the initial authors in the first edition of Cytopathologic Diagnosis of Serous Fluids.","11":"Morphological and architectural pattern evaluations play a major role in the rpretation of hematopoietic neoplasms. However, confirmation of diagnosis, classification, prognosis, and risk stratification are highly dependent on the utilization of multiple ancillary studies. The importance of these ancillary studies increases in evaluating serous fluid samples, as these samples lack architecture and patterns. Likewise, the morphology can be disturbed by sample preparation. The most common ancillary studies utilized are flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry for immunophenotyping, Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), cytogenetics for structural and gene rearrangements, and molecular studies for mutational analysis. Among them, flow cytometry analysis is the handiest test to perform with high diagnostic yield on serous fluid specimens. In this article we will discuss the use, caveat, and role of the most common ancillary studies on serous fluid specimen evaluation. This review article will be incorporated finally as one of the chapters in CMAS (CytoJournal Monograph\/Atlas Series) #2. It is modified slightly from the chapter by the initial authors (Choladda Vejabhuti, MD and Chung-Che (Jeff) Chang, MD, PhD) in the first edition of Diagnostic Cytopathology of Serous Fluids.","12":"Ever since the introduction of the Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test was published in 1941 in American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, PAP test linked with definitive treatment has prevented millions of women from cervical cancer in the developed countries. Due to limited availability of resources, a lack of infrastructure and difficulty in getting highly trained professionals, widespread implementation of PAP test dependent cervical cancer screening program has not been established in low and middle income countries such as India. Therefore, after availability of non-cytological tests such as visual inspection on acetic acid (VIA) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test, there is a paradigm shift in cervical cancer screening methods. In past two decades, various research work has convincingly established the utility of VIA and HPV test in developing countries. The evidences were evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and recommendations have been recently published for comprehensive cervical cancer control strategies for the low and middle income countries. For any successful screening program, achieving high coverage (&gt;70%) of the target population rather than frequent screening is the most important determinant. It is also equally important to ensure appropriate investigations of the screen positive women to establish the disease and treatment of the screen detected cases of cervical intra epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer. HPV testing is the WHO recommended test for cervical cancer screening especially in view of widespread HPV vaccination in young population leading to lower prevalence of CIN and other HPV related diseases.","13":"Signet-ring cells (SRCs) in effusion specimens represent a diagnostic challenge. In this study, a consecutive series of pleural and peritoneal effusions with benign SRCs are examined and compared with malignant SRCs. We reviewed consecutive Wright-stained serous effusion slides and searched for cases with SRCs. Corresponding ThinPrep slides and clinical histories were reviewed. Cytology cases with known signet-ring adenocarcinoma were retrieved and reviewed. Four hundred Wright-stained serous effusions were reviewed. Eighteen cases were identified with SRC-like cells. Thirteen patients had liver cirrhosis, three patients had end-stage renal disease, one patient had a history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and one patient had endometrioid carcinoma. For the latter two patients, the primary tumor showed no histologic findings of signet-ring features. In all cases, no SRCs were found on the corresponding ThinPrep slides. Five cytology cases with malignant SRCs were reviewed. Benign SRCs have a uniformly pale and markedly distended cytoplasm, and the nuclei are thin and curved. The malignant SRCs showed larger non-curved nuclei and bubbly mucin-containing cytoplasm. Mesothelial cells and histiocytes can mimic signet-ring adenocarcinoma cells on Wright-stained slides. Correlation with ThinPrep specimens is necessary before reporting, as the SRCs typically are not present in ThinPrep preparations. ","14":"While most tumors metastatic to the serous membranes are of epithelial origin, cytologists should be aware that non-epithelial neoplasms can also cause malignant effusions including sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, and, more rarely, brain tumors. The differential diagnosis of a malignant effusion is accordingly broad, especially for the small round blue cell tumors that includes not only mesenchymal tumors, but also non-mesenchymal tumors, such as neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor. Diagnosing non-epithelial malignancies in effusion specimens based entirely upon their cytomorphologic features is difficult because these neoplasms often exhibit considerable morphological overlap and their cytomorphology can differ from the original tumor. As malignant cells have a tendency to round up in body fluids these non-epithelial neoplasms can therefore mimic reactive mesothelial cells and metastatic adenocarcinoma. The use of ancillary studies including immunostaining, FISH, and molecular studies is thus often critical to reach a definitive diagnosis.

Two types of HPV, low- and high-risk type, adopt different mechanisms of infection which cannot be differentiated on morphological basis. In addition to HPV infection, many other factors such as genetic predisposition, hormonal factors, host immune response, and multiple sexual partners can modify the course and progression of the disease. The viral genome comprises early and late proteins. These early and late genes are expressed in particular course of time after initial infection. Various products of early genes (E1-E7) coordinate for completion of viral life cycle in maturing squamous epithelium by utilizing replication factors and DNA polymerase enzyme of the host cell nucleus. The late genes are mainly concerned with packaging of the viral particles and their release through mature squamous cells. The episomal form of infection seen in the low-risk group of viruses results in productive infection whereas the integrated form seen in high-risk group of viruses is the basis of disruption of host cell growth cycle by inactivating two important tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb gene by products of E6 and E7 genes. Cervical precancerous lesions and cancer are the resultant effect of the accumulation of mutations. This article discusses the virology of HPV, pathogenesis of HPV infection, and various other factors modifying the disease course.","17":null,"18":"Malignant effusions can occur in patients with neoplasia. Once a metastatic diagnosis is confirmed, the primary site of origin of malignancy needs to be ascertained. This task can be challenging without a prior history of malignancy. In some patients their effusion may be the initial presentation of an underlying malignancy. Metastases usually present with a dual population of mesothelial and malignant cells. Combining cytomorphologic examination with ancillary testing such as immunocytochemistry can help identify the origin of the foreign malignant cell population. Helpful architectural clues include a single cell pattern, solid cell ball pattern, single file arrangement, papillary formation, psammoma bodies and background mucin. Useful cellular features include the presence of signet ring cells, small cells, pleomorphic and multinucleated giant cells, squamous cells, spindle cells and pigmentation. Rarely, despite an extensive work-up the primary site of origin for a malignant effusion may remain unresolved.

Wide variations in cervical cancer incidence and mortality were observed with highest incidence rates in Sub Saharan Africa and with 85% of deaths occurring in developing regions of the world. Non-existent or inadequate screening in public health care settings and limited access to the standard treatment options explains the large geographic variation in cervical cancer rates. Persistent infection with high-risk Human papillomavirus (HPV) types is the major risk factor for cervical cancer. High parity, long-term use of oral contraceptive pills, tobacco consumption, co-infection with other sexually transmitted agents, lifestyle factors such as multiple sexual partners, younger age at first sexual intercourse, immunosuppression, and diet have been identified as the co-factors most likely to influence the risk of acquisition of HPV infection and its further progress to cervical carcinogenesis. Differential screening rates and changes in epidemiological patterns have contributed to decreasing trends in cervical cancer in some developed regions of the world. Lower rates were also observed in North Africa and the Middle East, which may be attributed to cultural norms and conservative sexual behaviors. Across world regions, HPV prevalence was highest in women younger than 35 years of age, declining to a plateau in middle age and showed significant association between national age standardized incidence rates and corresponding estimates of HPV prevalence. The five most common HPV types in HPV-positive women worldwide were HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV58, and HPV52, representing 50% of all HPV infections with HPV-16 and HPV-18 infections accounting for about 70% of the total infection burden. Tracking changing trends in the cervical cancer epidemiological patterns including HPV genotypes will immensely contribute toward effective prevention and control measures for cervical cancer elimination.","21":"Mesothelioma arises from the surface serosal cells lining the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities. It has three variants including: epithelioid, sarcomatous\/desmoplastic, and biphasic types. Mesothelioma cells, predominantly of the epithelioid type, can shed into effusions as sheets, clusters\/ morulae, papillae, or single cells. The challenges to cytologic diagnosis of mesothelioma are two-fold: 1. distinguishing mesothelial cells from metastatic malignant (most commonly carcinoma) cells; 2. distinguishing reactive mesothelial from mesothelioma cells. Immunocytochemistry is a helpful aid to cytologic evaluation for the former. The distinction of reactive mesothelial cells from mesothelioma can be more difficult, as there is considerable overlap in their appearances in effusion specimens. Recently developed ancillary molecular and genetic tests are proving to be useful in confirming the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma in cytology specimens.","22":"Diagnostic cytology of cervix can be made strong if normal cytology is known thoroughly. Cervical lining comprises three layers of squamous cells, the basal, intermediate, and superficial cells. Knowing the dimensions of these cells, especially the intermediate cells, helps to diagnose the squamous intraepithelial lesions accurately. Furthermore, recognizing the parabasal cells in the menopausal smears, either singly or as syncytial aggregates, is important to avoid overdiagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesions. The other cell type in the cervical lining is the endocervical glandular epithelium. Exfoliated endocervical cells may at times resemble endometrial glandular cells. The morphology and differences between these two cell types have been highlighted. It is essential to recognize and report endometrial cells in women of 40 years and above according to the recent Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology. The squamous epithelium of cervix and vagina is highly sensitive to estrogen and progesterone hormones. Hence, the Pap smears, if desired, can help in evaluating the hormonal status of the woman. The ratio of parabasal, intermediate, and superficial squamous cells can help in calculating various maturation indices.","23":"","24":"Cytology is the science of study of cells. It is derived from the Greek word \"cytos\" which means cells. The cells of the cervicovaginal epithelium are continuously evolving. The mature cells reach the surface and are then exfoliated. Initially, these exfoliated cells were collected from the posterior fornix, which showed cells from endocervix, ectocervix, and the vaginal epithelium. Hence, it was known as the exfoliative vaginal cytology. But now, the cells are taken directly by scraping the ecto and the endocervix. A variety of sampling devices are available in the market. The basic aim is to augment sampling of the complete transformation zone (TZ) as well as the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and cause least possible trauma to the cervical and endocervical epithelium during its use. The SCJ is of crucial significance for cervical cancer pathogenesis. Most of the precancerous changes take place within the TZ and at the SCJ. Hence, the collection of cells from this area is of utmost importance. The reliability of cervical cytology for the detection of precancerous lesions also strongly depends on immediate wet fixation of the smear. Therefore, the gynecologists or the paramedics who perform the conventional Pap smears must not only be trained in the art of cell collection and smearing of the material onto the glass slides but also learn immediate wet fixation of the cervical cells. Liquid-based preparations have made all these steps relatively easy for them as the design of the Cervex brush is such that it mostly ensures the sampling of the complete TZ and the SCJ. Pre-fixation of cells occurs in the vial containing a weak fixative and the transfer of cells onto the glass slide is standardized by the automated stations designed for this purpose. This chapter gives an in depth description of the prerequisites and precautions while collecting and preparing a Pap smear with different devices, especially for settings where conventional smears are still the norm. Instructions for women undergoing Pap smear and the medical personnel who conduct this test are also highlighted.","25":"","26":"The artificial neural network (ANN) is a computer software design or model that simulates the biological neural network of the human brain. Instead of biological neurons, ANN is composed of many layers of nodes that carry the signal and process it to make the final decision. ANN is a modern technology that is widely used in different fields of science. The ANN is reshaping the medical system and the various areas of pathology. In this paper, the basic concept and applications of ANN in cytology have been discussed. In this paper, the various articles published on ANN in the field of cytology have been systemically reviewed. The ANN is relatively less used in cytology. After introducing convolutional neural network and whole slide scanners in the commercial market, it is now essential to have thorough knowledge in this field to start diagnostic application of ANN.","27":"","28":"Cytological examination of the effusion fluid provides valuable information regarding the presence of malignancy. At times, it is challenging to diagnose malignant cells in serous effusion. The various ancillary techniques are available to solve the problem including immunocytochemistry, DNA ploidy, and multicolored flow cytometry. At present, the molecular tests on the effusion sample are of growing interest. The effusion sample is rich in cells and cell-free fluid that contains free DNA, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles. Molecular tests in effusion sample not only provide a diagnosis of malignancy but can also give valuable information that may be essential for the individualized therapy, management, and prognostic assessment. In this paper, we reviewed the application of the different molecular tests in the effusion sample.","29":"In this study, we present six cases of axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathies in the days following to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's first dose and its study for fine-needle aspiration cytology (two patients), biopsy with a gross needle (two patients), and the evolution of two other patients. Cytological smears and histological sections reveal reactive nodes, predominantly T, CD8, and the presence of atypia with striking mitosis. Differential diagnosis with viral lymphadenopathies and lymphoma is important, so the clinical correlation, in a vaccination context, sudden appearance, and progressive decrease in days of the adenopathy, is essential. In this article, we have studied the cytohistological manifestations of post-Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination lymphadenopathy and discussed its differential diagnosis.","30":"Effusion fluid cytology has propensity for both false positives (in up to 0.5%) and false negatives (in up to 30%) results. Methodical approach from collection step to final interpretation stage could prevent both false positives and false negatives, if the interpreter is familiar with various factors responsible for diagnostic pitfalls in effusion fluid cytology. For this discussion, these factors are categorized as mentioned below: Surface tension-related alterations in cytomorphologyImproper specimen processingMany faces of reactive mesothelial cells, overlapping with those of cancer cellsProliferation-related featuresDegenerative changes, such as nuclear hyperchromasia and cytoplasmic vacuolationUnexpected patterns and unusual entities.","31":"Collection of most serous fluids from various effusions is a relatively simple procedure. Because of this, serous fluids are commonly submitted for pathologic examination including cytopathologic evaluation by various clinical institutions. As a consequence, even a general pathology laboratory which may not have expertise with highly trained cytopathologist would be confronted with serous fluids for cytologic evaluation. However, cytopathologic evaluation of serous fluids is complex as compared to evaluation of fine needle aspiration cytology. This signifies the fact that all pathologists, irrespective of subspeciality cytopathology training and level of subspeciality expertise, should be conversant with the diagnostic challenges and pitfalls of effusion fluid cytology. Although, majority of effusions are due to reactive and non-neoplastic etiologies, cancer is one of the causes of an effusion as a manifestation of advanced cancer. Detecting neoplastic cells in effusion specimens in most of clinical settings is related to the advanced status of the disease, which usually is equivalent to incurable stage. Thus, interpretation of cytopathology as positive for cancer cell is highly critical in planning the trajectory of the clinical management with an obvious negative impact of false positive interpretation. Apart from cancer, effusions may be secondary to hemodynamic pathologies such as heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, cirrhosis etc. in addition to the different inflammatory conditions including parasitic infestations, bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, and other non-neoplastic etiologies including collagen diseases. Due to the cytomorphologic overlap of reactive mesothelial cells with malignant cells, general cytologic criteria for diagnosis of malignancy in single cells cannot be applied in most of the effusion specimens. This challenge is further amplified because of surface tension related phenomenon which 'round up' the cells after exfoliation in serous fluids. As a result, the native shapes of cancer cells cannot be a guiding feature. Thus the cytomorphologic features of cancer cells in serous fluids may not be same as seen in routine cytopathology of exfoliative, brushing, and fine-needle aspiration specimens. The cancer cells may continue to proliferate after exfoliation in the nutrient rich effusion fluids and may form proliferation spheres. It is crucial to consider these factors when interpreting effusion cytology. Amongst malignant effusions, adenocarcinomas are the most common cause of metastatic cancers, but almost any type of malignancy including melanomas, hematopoietic neoplasms, sarcomas, and mesotheliomas may involve serous cavities. The interpreter must be aware of the wide range of the cytomorphologic appearances of reactive mesothelial cells in effusion fluids. It is essential to understand these and other nuances related to effusion fluid cytology. Understanding potential pitfalls during various stages from processing to application of ancillary studies would increase the diagnostic accuracy and minimize atypical interpretations and false positivity.","32":null,"33":"Serous fluids are excessive accumulation of fluids in a serous cavity as effusion.

The series would be compiled finally as a book after minor modifications of individual review articles to accommodate the book layout on the topic as second edition of 'Diagnostic Cytopathology of Serous Fluids' book. The approach is primarily directed towards detection of neoplastic cells based on morphology alone or with the help of various ancillary tests, including commonly applied immunocytochemistry to be interpreted as second foreign population with application of SCIP (subtractive coordinate immunoreactivity pattern) approach in effusion fluid tapings. As the role of molecular pathology tests is increasing, this component as ancillary testing will also be covered as applicable. Because a picture and sketches are worth a thousand words, illustrations and figures are included generously even at the risk of moderate repetition. The clinically important serous cavities include peritoneal cavity, pericardial cavity, and two pleural cavities.

Programmed death ligand 1 expression (PD-L1) immunotherapy has been successful for treating lung and other cancers with PD-L1 expression. However, in many unresectable PDAC cases, cytological samples are the only available tissues for PD-L1 testing. The aim of this study is to retrospectively compare the expression of PD-L1 using cytological and surgical samples. Paired formalin-fixed cell blocks and surgical samples from the same patients with confirmed diagnoses of PDAC (n = 28) were sectioned for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. Using tumor proportion score (TPS) and combined positive score (CPS) to evaluate paired cell blocks and surgical samples, we counted and analyzed the data. With TPS, the PD-L1 was expressed in 9\/28 (32%) of PDAC surgical samples and in 9\/28 (32%) of paired cytological samples. Overall, the PD-L1 expression had a correlation of 26\/28 (93%). With CPS, the PD-L1 was expressed in 20\/28 (71%) of PDAC surgical samples and in 16\/28 (57%) of paired cytological samples. The PD-L1 expression had a correlation of 20\/28 (71%) and a discrepancy of 8\/28 (29%). The PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in moderately-differentiated PDAC than in well-differentiated with TPS. Cytological samples are useful for evaluating PD-L1 expression with TPS because the concordant rate was 93%. With CPS, cytological samples are limited due to the scant inflammatory cells with the concordant rate of 71%. Extensive sampling of the pancreatic tumor may improve the detection of immune cells expressing PD-L1 in cytological samples. With TPS, PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in moderate-differentiation of PDAC than in poor- and well-differentiation. ","35":"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) may be used as the first-line pathological investigation for evaluation and early diagnosis of the breast lesion.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a widely accepted, well-tolerated, cost-effective, minimally invasive diagnostic method for pre-operative evaluation of salivary gland lesion that aids management decisions. The present study aims to reclassify the salivary gland FNAC aspirates by applying MSRSGC and calculating the risk of neoplasm and malignancy for each diagnostic category. The present study is a retrospective observational study done for 54 months. A total of 168 cases of salivary gland FNA, 54 cases were excised in our institute for histopathology. Retrospective reviews were performed, and the FNAC cases were reclassified according to the Milan system, and the results of FNAC and final histology were correlated, wherever available. Furthermore, the risk of malignancy was calculated for all the diagnostic categories. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy (DA) of FNAC were determined. In the present study, the age of patients ranged from 3 to 86 years, with a mean age of 39 years. Among all the patients, 61.3% were male, and 38.6% were female. However, only 54 salivary gland FNA samples for which histopathology was available were categorized into six categories. Among them, category IV (neoplastic) had a maximum number of cases of 66.6%. The rate of malignancy was calculated for all diagnostic categories as follows: (1) Non-diagnostic: 0.0%, (2) non-neoplastic 0.0%, (3) atypia of undermined significance 100%, (4a) benign 5.5%, (4b) uncertain malignant potential 33.33%, (5) suspicious for malignancy 00%, and (6) malignancy 80%. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and DA for differentiating between benign and malignant neoplasm were 36.3%, 94.4%, 66.6%, 82.9%, and 80%. Two false-positive and seven false-negative neoplastic cases were noted. FNAC is a reliable, minimally invasive diagnostic method with high DA for diagnosing salivary gland lesions. Most salivary gland lesions can be accurately diagnosed on FNAC with adequate sampling and cytopathologists experience.

However, morphologic features of borderline serous tumors (BSTs) of ovary in ascitic fluid have been rarely described. The aim of our study was to evaluate the morphologic features of BST with and without ascitic fluid involvement (BST+ and BST-, respectively) and compare with those of serous carcinomas, both in conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) smears. Out of 30 BST cases reported in 3 years, seven cases had BST+. We compared the cytomorphology of seven cases of BST+, seven cases of BST-, and seven cases of serous adenocarcinoma with positive ascitic fluid cytology. Both conventional and LBC smears were studied in all cases and compared. Histopathology of omentum in these cases was also studied. Most cases with BST+ had regular papillary fragment borders with nuclei showing mild-to-moderate pleomorphism, fine nuclear chromatin with small nucleoli as compared with serous carcinomas all of which had irregular borders with moderate-to-severe nuclear pleomorphism, coarse chromatin, and macronucleoli. A combination of cytoarchitectural and nuclear features can help in suspecting BST in ascitic fluid. Ascitic fluid cytology together with tissue histology can increase the rate of the detection of peritoneal implants.

Of all the gynecologic cancers (ovary, uterus, cervix, vagina, and vulva), only cervical cancer has a screening test. Cervical Pap test (or Pap smear) is the best screening method for cervical precancerous lesions and is best reported using a unified and a well-established reporting system like The Bethesda System. In this system, \"Epithelial cell abnormality: Squamous\" includes squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) category which encompasses a spectrum of squamous cell lesions starting from the precancerous lesions of low-grade SIL (LSIL) to high-grade SIL (HSIL), and ultimately invasive squamous cell carcinoma. However, depending on the qualitative and quantitative limitations with the specimen, some equivocal morphological features suggestive of squamous cell abnormality may fall under equivocal category: \"Atypical Squamous Cells\" (ASCs), which are subdivided into two categories; \"Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance\" (ASC-US) or \"Atypical Squamous Cells, HSIL cannot be excluded\" (ASC-H), based on the suspected underlying lesion LSIL versus HSIL, respectively. This review provides the key cytologic features that distinguish Bethesda squamous categories from other important entities, using algorithmic approach and illustrations of common cytomorphologic patterns for clear identification of those entities in practice.

All smears have been qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in premalignant and malignant lesions using cytology and cytomorphometry. The subjects included in this study were selected from patients suffering from premalignant and clinically suspicious malignant lesions. Specimens were collected from the most representative site in study groups and normal buccal mucosa in the control group. The smears were evaluated under fluorescence microscopy for AO and DAPI and under light microscopy for conventional PAP and MGG. We studied 5 HPF to compare the number of normal cells to dysplastic cells. These were then subjected for cytomorphometric and statistical analysis. Assessment of quality using quality index revealed that PAP has better diagnostic efficiency as compared to MGG because the quality index of PAP was 0.87 and that of MGG was 0.74, the quality index of AO was 0.9, and that of DAPI was found to be 0.82, hence proving AO to be better in comparison with DAPI. We found that among all the four stains used AO is reliable, has greater efficacy, and can be easily performed with less cost.

The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC) has been introduced to bring uniformity in the reporting of salivary gland FNAC and improve the clinic-pathologic communication resulting in better patient management. The aim of the present study was to assess the application of the MSRSGC on FNAC specimens of salivary gland lesions at a tertiary care hospital. All salivary gland aspiration cytology cases along with histopathology follow-up of salivary gland lesions, wherever available, over a period of 36 months were analyzed and re-categorized according to MSRSGC into six categories and the risk of malignancy (ROM) was computed. Of the 123 patients, 23 (18.69%) were classified as non-diagnostic, 39 cases (31.7%) as non-neoplastic, one (0.81%) as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), benign neoplasm in 49 (39.8%) cases, uncertain malignant potential in two cases (1.63%), suspicious of malignancy in two cases, and malignant in seven cases (5.69%). Out of 123 cases, histopathological correlation was available in 34 cases, for which the ROM was calculated. The ROM was 0% for non-neoplastic, 11.1% for benign neoplasm, and 100% each for salivary neoplasm of uncertain neoplastic potential, and 100% for malignant categories. In the present study, the distribution of cases according to MSRSGC was comparable with the previous studies. The proportion of cases classified as AUS was within the goal set by MSRSGC at less than 10%. A risk-based stratification of salivary gland lesions in the form of MSRSGC is essential in the present era to guide and alert the clinician about the subsequent management plan and convey the ROM.

The cytopathological diagnoses were compared with the histopathological results of the same excised lymph nodes. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy rate were calculated. A total of 392 lymph nodes were aspirated during the study period.

They are especially critical for immunocharacterization of the lymphoid population especially when flow cytometry is not available or cannot be performed. In addition, cell-blocks allow various molecular pathology tests including gene rearrangement studies and FISH, proteomics analysis, and microbiology\/histochemical special stains. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for mass lesions, lymphadenopathy, and effusion fluids are common cytopathology specimens which are frequently cell-blocked. The differential diagnosis of enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) and mass lesions is broad and includes reactive processes, granulomatous lesions and malignancies including solid tumor metastases and various types of hematological malignancies, of which lymphoma would be most common. Depending on the patient population, most lymphomas may be diagnosed with immunocharacterization on cell-block or\/and flow cytometry in concert with excellent cytomorphology in Diff-Quik stained FNA aspirate smears. However, a proportion of lymphoma cases (up to 12-30%) may still require an excisional LN biopsy to evaluate architectural parameters. Similarly, various effusion fluids suspicious for lymphoma can be immunocharacterized by immunostaining of cell-block sections (or\/and by flow cytometry).

They are essentially microbiopsies that are formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin. This has become more prevalent with greater sample procurement due to the advent of newer biopsy techniques and needles. Cell-blocks allow retrieval of small tissue fragments from cytology specimens that sometimes cannot be processed by alternate cytologic techniques. They represent concentrated, cell-enriched preparations that provide cytologists with the opportunity to evaluate cellular architecture, as well as to perform ancillary testing. A cell-block compatible sample may thus obviate the need for a more invasive procedure such as a tissue biopsy. Microscopic examination of cell-blocks is quick, avoids obscuring material, permits cells to be evaluated in one focal plane, and allows the histologic architecture such as glandular differentiation, papillary formations, and sometimes invasion to be easily identified. This new era of \"cytohistology\" accordingly requires practicing cytologists to become more familiar with histopathology.

A cytologic-histologic correlation was performed for FNACs performed in pediatric patients for a clinical diagnosis of neoplastic lesions at both the centers. Relevant clinical details and histopathology, wherever available, were retrieved. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FNAC in diagnosis of malignant lesion were calculated from the cases with available histologic correlation. Of the 266 cases included, there was a slight male predominance with lymphadenopathy being the most common presentation and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as the most frequent diagnosis in cases clinically suspected to have a neoplasm. Histologic correlation was available in 112 cases with 100% concordance in liver and kidney tumors. Few rare cytologic diagnoses such as papillary renal cell carcinoma, mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver, and thymolipoma could be accurately rendered on FNAC smears in conjunction with the clinic-radiologic features.

","68":"Biological behavior of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan NETs) is difficult to predict on morphology alone. The assessment of proliferation by the Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) is considered to be an important prognostic parameter in these tumors and has been endorsed by the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for Pan NETs. Although widely accepted on surgical specimens, there is varied opinion on grading of these tumors on cytology samples. This study aimed at classification and grading of Pan NETs on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) using the recent 2017 WHO criteria and assess the reliability of Ki-67 grading by comparing it with histology samples wherever available. Search of cytopathology lab records over a 3-year period (June 2015-May 2018) revealed 33 cases of pancreatic NETs diagnosed on EUS-FNA specimens. Using the guidelines of 2017 WHO classification and grading of Pan NETs, retrospective grading of these Pan NETs was done. They were graded as Grades 1, 2, and 3 well differentiated Pan NETs and poorly differentiated Grade 3 neoplasms based on Ki-67 PI and cytomorphology. Cytomorphological features were compared across the three grades. The cytological grading was then compared with the histological grading where available. Ki-67 grading on cytology was done in 32 cases (22 on cell block and 10 on smears), of which 19 (59.4%) were Grade 1, 8 (25%) were Grade 2, and 5 (15.6%) were Grade 3 tumors. The most common cytomorphological features observed in Grade 1 tumors were small round uniform cells with granular chromatin and prominent plasmacytoid morphology. As the grade increased, tumor cells showed increased pleomorphism, angulated nuclei, and less frequent plasmacytoid cells. Histopathology (biopsy\/resected specimens) was available in 11 of the 32 cases. Comparison of grading on cytology and histology showed concordance in ten of the 11 cases (k value = 0.862).

We used the peptide nucleic acid clamping method for EFGR mutation test. Histologic diagnosis identified 137 cases of adenocarcinomas and 13 cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma, not otherwise specified. Each sample was assessed for adequacy and DNA content for EGFR mutation test. Among BB samples, 28 had exon 19 deletion, 21 had mutations in exon 21, 99 were wild type, and analysis of two failed. The EGFR mutation rate in BB samples was 33.1% (49\/148). Among bronchial biopsy samples, 26 had exon 19 deletion, 20 had mutations in exon 21, 92 were wild type, and analysis of 12 failed. The EGFR mutation rate using biopsy sample was 33.8% (46\/136). The mutation detection results were nearly identical in both groups of samples (131\/138, 94.9%). However, in two cases, an exon 21 mZutation was detected in biopsy samples but not in BB samples. In five cases, exon 19 deletion (two cases) and exon 21 mutation (three cases) were detected in BB but not in biopsy samples. The median DNA content was 58.83 ng for BB samples and 48.47 ng for biopsy samples. The failure rate for BB samples was lower than for biopsy samples. Overall, the BB samples were comparable to bronchial biopsy samples in terms of DNA quantity and mutation detection results. We conclude that in case of inadequate biopsy samples, BB samples can be used as a substitute material for EGFR mutation test.

Cases of 367 patients with breast cancer who underwent intraoperative valuation of SLNs (507 LNs) were evaluated. All FS and corresponding TIC slides of SLNs of each case were reviewed microscopically for the presence of metastases of any size. If present, the metastatic focus was measured on the FS. Of these 507 SLNs, 82 LNs (16.2%) from 69 women were found to have metastases in the FS and consisted of 5 LNs of isolated tumor cells, 15 of micrometastasis, and 62 of macrometastasis. TIC identified metastases in 69 of these 82 SLNs (sensitivity: 84.1%, specificity: 100%, and accuracy: 97.4%). All macrometastases could be detected by TIC, whereas TIC identified approximately 50% of micrometastases and none of isolated tumor cells. The size detection limit of metastatic foci, defined as the smallest dimension of metastasis detected without false negatives, was 2 mm. The smallest metastatic focus identified was 0.8 mm. TIC of SLNs is of great use given its negative predictive value of 100% for identification of macrometastasis in our study. For intraoperative evaluation of SLNs, based on our data, a practical two-step approach is proposed: SLN evaluation should be initially performed by TIC and then proceed to FS histological analysis only when cytologically positive to determine the size of metastatic focus.

We present a series of four cases with unknown primary site, in which ICC was done on SCB to suggest possible primary site. Three of them were liver space-occupying lesions (SOL) and one from the periportal lymph node. In all four cases, wet-fixed smear for hematoxylin and eosin stain was prepared as routine procedure. FNAC was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma in two and metastatic spindle cell neoplasm in one liver SOL. Periportal node was reported metastatic adenocarcinoma. Two hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from each case with higher cellularity were used to scrape off the material to prepare SCB. ICC was put which gave conclusive diagnosis in all the cases. On ICC, two cases of metastatic carcinoma in the liver were diagnosed as metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm from Gastrointestinal Tract and metastatic adenocarcinoma from the stomach. Spindle cell neoplasm of the liver was diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor from the stomach. Pancreatic head mass in metastatic periportal node was confirmed later by radiologic examination.

However, this has a number of challenges with nonrepresentative Ki-67 index due to interference by Ki-67 immunoreactive proliferating lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor and also some proliferating stromal cells including endothelial cells in the background. Our pilot project showed that dual-color immunostaining with inclusion of leukocyte common antigen (LCA) (Ki-67: nuclear brown; LCA: cytoplasmic red) can facilitate the weeding out of lymphocyte interference. We analyzed the results with 23 surgical cases of pancreatic NETs. This was followed by poststudy examination of 11 cases of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of the pancreatic NETs (PanNETs) to evaluate the findings of the study. Dual-color immunostaining for Ki-67 with LCA increased the precision of quantifying Ki-67 index, due to ability to exclude LCA immunoreactive lymphocytes. Other nontumor Ki-67 immunoreactive cells such as endothelial and stromal cells could be distinguished morphologically. Digital methods were also attempted, but this approach could not distinguish infiltrating lymphocytes and other cells in sections resulting in erroneous results. This study demonstrated that grading of PanNET can be performed with increased precision with dual-color Ki-67 immunostaining protocol standardized in this study.

A survey is conducted at the end of the study. One hundred urine samples were reviewed independently by six cytopathologists. The diagnosis was rendered according to TPS categories: negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (NHGUC), atypical urothelial cells (AUC), low-grade urothelial neoplasm (LGUN), suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (SHGUC), and high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC). The agreement was assessed using kappa. Disagreements were classified as high and low impacts. Statistical analysis was performed. Perfect consensus agreement was 31%, with an overall kappa of 0.362. Kappa by diagnostic category was 0.483, 0.178, 0.258, and 0.520 for NHGUC, AUC, SHGUC, and HGUC, respectively. Both TM and TPS showed 100% specificity and PPV. TPS showed 43% sensitivity (38% by TM) and 70% accuracy (66% by TM). Disagreements with high clinical impact were 27%. Of the 100 cases, 52 were concurrent biopsy-proven HGUC. The detection rate of biopsy-proven HGUC was 43% by TPS (57% by TM). The rate of NHGUC was 54% by TPS versus 26% by TM. AUC rate was 23% by TPS (44% by TM). The PPV of the AUC category by TPS was 61% versus 43% by TM. The survey showed 33% overall satisfaction. TPS shows adequate precision for NHGUC and HGUC, with low interobserver agreement for other categories. TPS significantly increased the clinical significance of AUC category. Refinement and widespread application of TPS diagnostic criteria may further improve interobserver agreement and the detection rate of HGUC.

The Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytolopathology standardized reporting thyroid nodules aspirations, but atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (Bethesda category III) was the most controversial category. The aim of our study is to review our institutional experience and analyze the clinical implications of making a diagnosis of AUS\/FLUS (Bethesda category III). This is a retrospective study of an 889 thyroid FNAs from 825 patients in Salmaniya Medical Complex, during (January 2013-December 2017). The most common cause for designating cases as AUS\/FLUS (Bethesda category III) was the presence of features suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but not quite fulfilling the criteria for such diagnosis. Ninety-six cases were diagnosed as AUS\/FLUS (10.7%), in which 26 (27%) patients underwent surgery without repeating the FNA, 25 (26%) underwent a second FNA and 43 (44.7%) patients were followed up by ultrasound. On repeating the FNA, 1 (4%) was unsatisfactory, 13 (52%) were benign, 10 (40%) were AUS\/FLUS, and only 1 (4%) was categorized as malignant. Thirty cases were surgically excised, in which 4 (13.3%) were diagnosed as follicular adenoma, 2 (6.6%) as Hurthle cell adenoma, 9 (30%) as multinodular goiter, 5 (16.6%) as multinodular goiter with Hashimoto thyroiditis, 1 (3.3%) as colloid nodule with Hashimoto thyroiditis, and 9 (30%) as papillary thyroid carcinoma. Among all the cases diagnosed initially as AUS\/FLUS (Bethesda category III), 9 (9.3%) cases were diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma. Diagnostically, we almost meet the international standards of designating cases with AUS\/FLUS (Bethesda category III) and approximate the risk of malignancy. However, the clinical management's guidelines should be followed to decrease the risk of unnecessary surgeries and their complications.

Almost 110 cases (38.6%) had surgical follow-up resections. The overall risk for malignancy (ROM) was 12.5% for AUS, 3.2% for benign neoplasm, 72.7% for NUMP, and 100% for the suspicious for malignancy and malignant. The ROM for nondiagnostic and nonneoplastic categories was not representative due to limited follow-up resections. The salivary cytology had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 93.0%, 100%, 100%, and 46.2% for neoplasm and 82.3%, 95.8%, 90.3%, and 92.0% for malignant.

The objective of the study is to (1) review clinically confirmed cases of malignancy with negative, atypical, and suspicious cytology reports and provide reasoning for discrepancies and (2) recalculate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values after review. Papanicolaou smears of ascitic fluid paracentesis samples received over one calendar year were reviewed retrospectively by an expert in cytopathology blinded to the final clinical and\/or histopathological diagnoses. Cases with discrepancies after review were noted. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated before and after review of slides. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Malignant etiology was identified in 49\/115 cases (42.6%) with female genital tract being the most common site of malignancy (22, 44.8%). The remaining 66 (57.4%) had a benign etiology with hepatic cirrhosis in 42 cases (63.6%). A review revealed discrepancies in five cases, three of which were earlier called negative for malignant cells (one case each of ovarian adenocarcinoma, cecal adenocarcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma). Two cases of ovarian adenocarcinoma that were reported as atypical\/reactive mesothelial hyperplasia showed malignant cells upon review. Sensitivity and specificity after review were 69.4% and 100%, respectively, with 100% positive predictive value. Being a minimally invasive procedure, abdominal paracentesis continues to be an important diagnostic tool in guiding patient management. A proper morphological assessment with adequate clinical information and correlation with other investigations can be used to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in most cases.

","103":"Cell-blocks are paraffin-embedded versions of cytology specimens comparable to the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from surgical pathology specimens. They allow various elective ancillary studies on a variety of specimens with enhanced cytopathologic interpretation, including opportunity to perform molecular tests. However, different dictionaries and internet search engines primarily project \"cellblock\" and \"cell block\" definition in relation to prisons. Most of the top searches lead to information related to \"prison cells\" followed by a few cytopathology-related searches. Due to this in the current review, it is recommended that the word for cytopathology purposes should be hyphenated and spelled as \"cell-block.\" Cell-blocks have been increasingly indicated on most cytology specimens. Its role is growing further with the ongoing addition of new immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers with technical advances including multicolor IHC and the SCIP (subtractive coordinate immunoreactivity pattern) approach. In addition, it is an important source of tissue for many ancillary studies even as archived material retrospectively at later stage of management if the cell-blocks are improved qualitatively and quantitatively. Because of this, the significance of cell-block is critical with the increasing number of molecular markers standardized predominantly on FFPE tissue. As compared to core biopsies, high-quality cell-blocks prepared with enhanced methodologies predominantly contain concentrated diagnostic tumor cells required for the molecular tests without significant stromal contamination. This review introduces the terminology of CellBlockistry as the science of studying chemistry and the art of achieving quantitatively and qualitatively improved cell-blocks from different types of specimens. The review addresses the cell-block making process as \"cell-blocking\" and discusses different historical limitations with emphasis on recent advances.","104":"","105":"The ovaries can be the site for various primary tumors and also the presenting site of metastatic disease. Quick and correct intraoperative diagnosis is crucial for the patient's further management.

From June 2016 to June 2017, we prospectively prepared additional two cytologic smears with Diff-Quik stain on ovarian frozen sections comprised of two hematoxylin and eosin sections. For quality assurance purposes, we compared the results of frozen section discrepancies and deferrals with those that of the previous year from June 2015 to June 2016. With the introduction of cytologic smears to ovarian frozen sections, the number of discrepancies and deferrals combined decreased from 13.75% to 7.85%.

We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of cytological sub-classification of non-small cell lung carcinoma, not otherwise specified group (NSCLC-NOS) into Adenocarcinoma (AC) and Squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) without using immunohistochemistry. Endobronchial ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies and cytology slides diagnosed as NSCLC-NOS between 2004- 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. The final diagnosis was reached by immunohistochemistry (TTF-1, p63) when necessary. One hundred-twenty nine cases were retrieved. The final diagnoses were as follows: SqCC: 30.3%; AC: 65.7%; combined tumor (3 adenosquamous and 1 small cell + SqCC): 4%. Cytological diagnoses rendered were as follow: Definitely SqCC: 10.1%; favor SqCC: 14.1%; definitely AC: 38.4%; favor AC: 35.4%; NSCLC-NOS: 2%. The sensitivity and specificity of cytology were 86.3 and 87.5% for AC diagnosis respectively. Positive and negative predictive value of cytology was 95.3% and it was even 100% for well to moderately differentiated tumors. There was a tendency to sub-classify poorly differentiated SqCC as AC. Papanicolaou stain increased the diagnostic accuracy of SqCC. The combined tumor rate was 4% and after recognizing a tumor component, the second component was missed if the slide examination was terminated prematurely.

This has translated into more cytologic specimens whereby the material is limited and best handled by cytology laboratory staff. While the diagnosis of the pathologic process is of utmost importance, there is increasing expectation that the diagnosis be specific and accurate as not to require additional biopsy for initiation of treatment. This expectation has driven demand in immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular studies conducted specifically on material processed as cytology specimens. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 requires laboratories in the United States of America to verify the performance of patient tests. Due to varying laboratory practices with respect to validation of IHC assays, the College of American Pathologists introduced guidelines for analytic validation of IHC tests. These guidelines address how to perform validation by recommending the number of cases in the validation set, comparator concordance, and when to revalidate. The main thrust of the guidelines is based on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue with only one expert consensus opinion referring to validation of IHC tests on cytology specimens which delegates to the medical director, the determination of number of positive and negative cases to be tested. This article will outline how an academic center approaches validation of IHC studies performed on cytology cell block specimens using the College of American Pathologists guidelines. A stepwise approach from selection of antibodies to validate followed by building the validation panel and evaluating the stain results for concordance against the gold standard of histology tissue specimen will be described.

Poor overall prognosis is mostly attributed to inadequate screening tools, and the majority of diagnoses occur at late stages of the disease. Due to genetic and biological underpinnings, ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) have etiologic evidence in the distal fallopian tube. Fallopian tube screening modalities are aggressively investigated, but few describe cytological characteristics of benign tubal specimens to help in the comparative detection of HGSC precursor cells. Here, we describe fimbrial cytomorphological and nuclear features of tubal specimens (n = 75) from patients clinically indicated for salpingectomy, bilateral or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and hysterectomies for any diagnosis other than ovarian or peritoneal cancer. Fallopian tube histology was used as the diagnostic reference. A total of 75 samples had benign diagnoses. The benign cytological characteristics of fimbrial tubal specimens included ciliated cells in clustered arrangements with mild nuclear membrane irregularity, mild anisonucleosis, round and\/or oval nuclei, hyperchromatic chromatin, and mild nuclear membrane irregularity. In contrast, none of the cytology samples had spindle-shaped nuclei, significantly marked anisonucleosis (n = 1), nor had hypochromasia as a characteristic feature. These cytological characteristics could be a potential area of distinction from HGSC precursor cells. Our study establishes cytomorphological characteristics of nonmalignant tubal cells which help underscore the importance of distinguishing malignant HGSC precursors through fimbrial brush sampling in minimally invasive approach.","118":"Mast cells are observed in peritoneal endometriosis which causes dysmenorrhea. However, there is no report about the relationship between endocervical mast cells and dysmenorrhea. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship using endocervical smears.

Patients underwent endocervical brushing and endocervical smears were obtained. The smears were stained with methylene blue to detect mast cells. The number of mast cells per slide was counted by microscopy and recorded. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in this study (dysmenorrhea group, 34; control group, 55). The median number of mast cells present in the endocervical one slides was 35 (interquartile range, 17-58) and 2 (interquartile range, 0-6) in the dysmenorrhea and control groups, respectively. There was a significant difference in the number of mast cells between the two groups (P &lt; 0.0001).

The findings were compared to their subsequent definite diagnoses on surgical specimens as well as to their follow-up repeat FNA results. A total of 499 thyroid FNAs were collected and reviewed against The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC). The percentage of each diagnostic category was calculated, and the implied risk of malignancy was determined by comparing the cytology results to their definite diagnoses obtained on the resection specimens. Analytical procedures were performed using Microsoft Excel. Out of 499 thyroid FNAs, a benign interpretation was found in 273 patients (54.7%), atypia of undetermined significance in 81 (16.2%), follicular neoplasm in 20 (4%), suspicious for malignancy in 36 (7.2%), malignant in 32 (6.4%) and were nondiagnostic in 57 patients (11.4%). Only 101 patients (20.2%) underwent surgical resection and 47 (9.4%) underwent a follow-up FNA.

Fifty-five cytologic specimens obtained by fine needle aspiration from the pulmonary nodules were independently reviewed by four board-certified cytopathologists and assigned to the diagnostic categories described by the PSC guidelines for respiratory specimens. Statistical analysis for diagnostic accuracy was performed for absolute agreement and chance-corrected agreement (kappa). Differences in frequency of distribution of diagnoses between raters were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. No significant differences in distribution of scores by raters were observed. On average, the absolute agreement was 49.5% and the chance-corrected agreement (kappa) was 20%. 34.5% of interrater comparisons were in full agreement, and total lack of agreement between the four categories was found in 3% of cases. Combining the \"suspicious for malignancy\" category with the \"malignant\" category did not significantly alter interrater agreement statistics. The PSC categories showed only fair reproducibility among four cytopathologists.

The present case of osteoblastoma is, therefore, being reported due to the unusual presentation in elderly male in the body of talus and showing extensive involvement on X-ray. The case was initially diagnosed on FNA cytology excluding the possibility of giant-cell tumor and osteosarcoma. The case also highlights the importance of vigilant observation of subtle cytological features of this rare tumor which may be helpful in avoiding diagnostic pitfalls, especially at an uncommon site and with unusual presentation.

Demonstration of Leishman-Donovan (LD) bodies in the bone marrow aspirates (BMA) is vital to diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In the present study, we studied the clinicohematological parameters encountered in VL and correlated them with parasite load on BMA. Retrospective analysis over 3 years was done; clinical details, biochemical profile, complete hemogram with peripheral smear findings, and BMA smears were reviewed and average parasite density (APD) calculated in each case. Multivariate analysis and tests of significance were applied. The study included 28 patients. Splenomegaly showed a positive trend with APD. rK39 antigen detection test was 100% positive in select cases. A strong negative correlation was observed between albumin to globulin ratio and grade of APD. BMA revealed hemophagocytosis (HPS) in 78.57% cases and it had a significant strong correlation with APD (P = 0.014). A significant correlation was also observed between APD and bone marrow plasma cell percentage (P = 0.01). LD bodies were noted in unusual locations such as within myelocytes (14.2%), plasma cells (7.1%), and megakaryocytes (10.7%). HPS and bone marrow plasmacytosis were two statistically significant findings, which showed positive correlation with parasite load. The presence of these two findings should prompt hematopathologists for more focused search of hemoparasites in BMA to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. This will avoid unnecessary workups and improve the prognosis.

The aim of this study is to highlight the cytological features of ELP. A search of cytopathology (CP) and surgical pathology (SP) diagnoses of ELP was conducted. The corresponding clinical and imaging features were obtained, and the morphology, particularly the presence and size of the intracytoplasmic vacuoles and background, was assessed. Nine cases of ELP were identified, including eight with corresponding CP and SP. A neoplasm was suspected in three based on imaging, but ELP was not in the differential clinically or radiographically in any. Among the cases, six patients had BALs and three FNAs. All of the samples showed multiple large vacuoles within macrophages with at least some equal to or larger than the size of the cell nucleus. Similar vacuoles were noted extracellularly on smears. ELP is typically described in case reports in the clinical or radiological literature. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest series of adult ELP in CP. When large vacuoles are present in macrophages in cytology specimens, at least a suspicion of ELP can be suggested to initiate appropriate therapy, identify\/remove the inciting agent, and preclude a more invasive procedure.

Twenty-four biopsy-proven HLN cases with malignant body cavity effusions and 8 cases suspicious for HLN on cytology but negative on biopsy are included in this study. Effusion cytology smears were reviewed for cytomorphological features: cellularity, cell size, nuclear features, accompanying cells, karyorrhexis, and mitoses. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (37%) was the most common lymphoma type presenting as effusion followed by peripheral T-cell lymphoma (25%). Pleural effusion (75%) was most frequent presentation followed by peritoneal effusion (20.8%). Pericardial effusion was rare (4.1%). The common cytologic features of HLNs in effusions: high cellularity, lymphoid looking cells with nuclear enlargement, dyscohesive nature, and accompanying small lymphocytes. Mitosis and karyorrhexis were higher in high-grade HLNs when compared to low-grade HLNs. Myelomatous effusion showed plasmacytoid cells. Very large, blastoid looking cells with folded nuclei, high N: C ratio, and prominent nucleoli were seen in leukemic effusion. HLNs have characteristic cytomorphology and an attempt to subclassify them should be made on effusion cytology. Reactive lymphocyte-rich effusions cannot be distinguished from low-grade lymphomas based on cytomorphology alone. Ancillary tests such as immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and\/or molecular techniques may prove more useful in this regard.

A total of four cases of EHE involving or arising from effusion fluids were found, and we reviewed cytospin, smears, cell block sections, and immunostained slides. DNA image analysis for ploidy and proliferation evaluation was performed on a destained, papanicolaou-stained slide from each case. The tumor cells were epithelioid with prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization and intracytoplasmic inclusions, which could resemble reactive mesothelial cells, mesothelioma, or adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for endothelial markers. DNA image analysis in three of the four cases revealed predominantly diploid and tetraploid subpopulations, with few aneuploid cells and fairly low proliferation indices, and these patients had fairly prolonged survival. DNA image analysis is useful for differentiating EHE from reactive mesothelial cells and high-grade carcinoma. For accurate diagnosis of EHE in effusion fluids, cytologic features should be considered together with clinical history and ancillary studies.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether certain cytomorphological features correlate with EGFR mutation in lung adenocarcinoma. A retrospective analysis of 48 lung adenocarcinoma cases diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology with known EGFR mutation status was conducted. All cytology smears with cellblock sections were reviewed. The cytomorphological features including tumor pattern, stromal features, nuclear and cytoplasmic features, and tumor grade were evaluated. Clinicoradiological features such as age, sex, smoking, tumor size, clinical stage, metastases, and presence of mass, nodule, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and clinical outcome were also assessed. Of 48 cases, 19 were EGFR-p and 29 were negative. EGFR-p cases showed a positive and significant correlation with flat monolayered sheets and acini, mild nuclear atypia, fine chromatin and smooth nuclear margins and these tumors were well differentiated. EGFR-negative tumors were moderate to poorly differentiated with predominance of solid clusters, moderate to marked nuclear atypia, with irregular nuclear margins and coarse chromatin. Clinically, female sex, nonsmoking status, smaller tumor size, and good clinical outcome correlated with EGFR-p status.

Categories were as follows: 10.1% were Category I (nondiagnostic), 68.8% Category II (benign), 12.4% were Category III (atypia of undetermined significance), 2.9% were Category IV (suspicious for follicular neoplasm), 2.6% were Category V (suspicious for malignancy), and 4.1% were Category VI (malignant). Surgery was done on 126 nodules from 119 patients with an overall rate of malignancy of 27.8% (35\/126 nodules). The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology proved to be an excellent reporting system. ","142":"Palpable thyroid nodules can be found in 4%-7% of the adult population; however, &lt;5% of thyroid nodules are malignant. Immunohistochemical markers, such as CD56, can be used to make a differential diagnosis between benign and malignant lesions. To increase the accuracy of the diagnosis and distinguish the malignant aspirates from the benign ones, chose to evaluate CD56, which is normally found in benign thyroid tissue. A total of 53 fine-needle aspirate samples from patients diagnosed with suspected papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were included prospectively. These aspirates were immunocytochemically stained for CD56. In histopathological examination, the fine-needle aspiration cytopathology specimens suspicious for PTC (after undergoing surgery) showed that 32 (60.4%) were benign and 21 (39.6%) were malignant. Thirty-one of the benign cases (96.87%) were CD56-positive, whereas the last case (3.13%) was CD56-negative. Staining was not seen in any of the malignant cases. We believe that CD56 is an important marker in the definitive diagnosis of suspected PTC cases, with CD56-positivity being interpreted in favor of benignity. ","143":"Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with distinct biology and clinical course when compared to their nodal counterparts. They usually present as violaceous, erythematous plaques, and nonulcerated nodules, which are confined to skin at the time of presentation. We present an unusual case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, clinically mimicking a sarcoma. This case highlights the uncommon aggressive behavior and ulcerated type of nodular lesions seen in PCBCL and also revisits the cytomorphological findings of the same.","144":"","145":"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a quick method to assess the tumor grade before its removal which will help clinicians to decide on the appropriate neo adjuvant therapy. This is essentially true in developing countries where core needle biopsy still is not used as a standard practice to sample breast carcinoma. Assessment of biological aggressiveness by cytological grading (CG) without removing the would be of immense value. The National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, sponsored conference had recommended that tumor grading on FNA material should be incorporated in cytology reports for prognostication. The present study was carried out to evaluate which among the two, five parametric Robinson or three parametric Scarf-BloomRichardson (SBR) cytology grading method corresponds better with the histological grading (HG) in breast carcinoma. FNAC of 150 cases of ductal carcinoma breast with subsequent histological confirmation was studied to assess the tumor grade on cytology by two distinct methods Robinson and Howell's modification of SBRmethod and then correlated with histologic grade. Comparative analysis revealed concordance of 76% by Robinson and 68% by SBR with Kappa value of 0.6683 and 0.4505 and diagnostic accuracy of 86.7% and 78.7%, respectively. We conclude that Robinson method showed a better correlation and higher kappa value of agreement in comparison with SBR method. Robinson method of CG is simpler, objective, and easily reproducible for grading breast carcinomas. ","146":"","147":"The authors describe the cytomorphologic features of two cases of tubular variant of adenomyoepithelioma of the breast that were first examined by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and diagnosed as fibroadenoma. On retrospective review of the cytology, subtle features such as less cohesive epithelial clusters, intimate association of clusters of stromal cells with epithelial elements, a dominant population of plump-epithelioid naked (myoepithelial) cells, and occasional cells with intranuclear inclusions, were noted. Thus, these lesions can be diagnostically challenging and cannot be conclusively differentiated from either fibroadenoma or tubular adenoma cytologically and the pathologist may only be able to give a differential on FNAC. Recognition of the biphasic nature and the characteristic overall architecture of the tumors in combination with immunohistochemistry are essential to establish the correct diagnosis on biopsy. Although most tumors have a benign clinical course, rare instances of local recurrence, malignant transformation, and distant metastases have been reported. A complete excision with adequate margins would lower the chance of local recurrence.","148":"Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of uterine cervix is a rare malignancy with aggressive behavior and poor clinical outcome even in its early stage. Few cytopathologic features of cervical LCNEC have been reported previously. A 57-year-old postmenopausal African American female, presented to the local health department with a chief complaint of heavy vaginal bleeding. A 45-year-old female presented with 20 months of vaginal pruritus and foul odor. Cervical malignancy was suspected by pelvis magnetic resonance imaging. Thinprep cytology test demonstrated ball-like tumor cell clusters in a necrotic background. Cytologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was rendered. However, the histologic and immunohistochemical examination of cervical biopsy revealed the LCNEC of the uterine cervix. Due to its rarity, LCNEC may pose a diagnostic challenge in cervical cytology. Cytopathologists should pay attention to the cytological features of cervical LCNEC, such as rosettoid pattern, nuclear molding, and thin nuclear membrane for differentiation from other mimics.","149":null,"150":"Epididymal lesions are uncommon in clinical practice. Few case series has been described in the literature documenting the role of cytology in the evaluation of epididymal nodules. This study was undertaken to analyze the cytomorphology of epididymal nodules and to evaluate role of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in early definitive diagnosis of epididymal nodules. A total of seventy cases of epididymal nodules were aspirated over a period of 6 years in the Department of Pathology. These cases were taken from the cytology record as a part of this study. The aspiration was performed using 22\/23-gauge needle. Smears were stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa and Papanicolaou stains. Special stains and immunocytochemistry were performed, wherever required. The cytological features were adequate to establish the diagnosis in sixty cases. The lesions diagnosed were tuberculosis 16 (22.85%), spermatoceles 12 (17.14%), benign cystic lesion 8 (11.42%), encysted hydrocele 8 (11.42%), acute suppurative lesion 6 (8.57%), filariasis 4 (5.71%), chronic epididymitis 3 (4.28%), nodular fasciitis 1 (1.42%), epidermal inclusion cyst 1 (1.42%), and cystic adenomatoid tumor 1 (1.42%). Ten cases were inadequate to establish the diagnosis. FNAB was useful in diagnosis of 86% of cases. Infectious lesions of the epididymis were more common than neoplastic lesions. Patients with infection responded well to medical treatment. FNAB is an easily available technique for palpable lesions of epididymis, and it helps in making an early, near definitive diagnosis of epididymal lesions. It also helps to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions and helps in timely management.

However, primary SS of the thyroid gland is an extremely rare tumor which has been reported only five times in previous English literatures. This report presents fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of primary monophasic SS of the thyroid gland. A 47-year- old woman incidentally detected thyroid nodule in the isthmus of right thyroid gland on an ultrasonography by regular health check-up. Because the possibility of malignancy could not be ruled out, FNA and surgical resection were performed. The cytological, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic study of SYT-SSX transcript were discussed. For the past 3 years of follow-up after surgery, no recurrence or metastasis has been identified.","153":"Spindle cell ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a recently recognized subtype of DCIS, which is associated with a very rare and unique morphology. Although the histologic features have been relatively well described in a few reports, the cytologic features have not. Even though the distinction of this lesion from usual DCIS is not crucial clinically, it should be noted that this lesion might simulate the features of metaplastic carcinoma on fine needle aspiration cytology. Here, we report a case of spindle cell DCIS in a 45-year-old female, with the detailed cytologic features, both on conventional and liquid-based preparations, along with some useful immunohistochemical staining markers for the differential diagnosis.","154":null,"155":"","156":"The Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Program recommends screening every 3 years for women between 25 and 69 years of age. There is a large difference in the percentage of unsatisfactory samples between laboratories that use different brands of liquid-based cytology. We wished to examine if inadequate ThinPrep samples could be satisfactory by processing them with the SurePath protocol. A total of 187 inadequate ThinPrep specimens from the Department of Clinical Pathology at University Hospital of North Norway were sent to Akershus University Hospital for conversion to SurePath medium. Ninety-one (48.7%) were processed through the automated \"gynecologic\" application for cervix cytology samples, and 96 (51.3%) were processed with the \"nongynecological\" automatic program. Out of 187 samples that had been unsatisfactory by ThinPrep, 93 (49.7%) were satisfactory after being converted to SurePath. The rate of satisfactory cytology was 36.6% and 62.5% for samples run through the \"gynecology\" program and \"nongynecology\" program, respectively. Of the 93 samples that became satisfactory after conversion from ThinPrep to SurePath, 80 (86.0%) were screened as normal while 13 samples (14.0%) were given an abnormal diagnosis, which included 5 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, 5 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, 2 atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified, and 1 atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. A total of 2.1% (4\/187) of the women got a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or higher at a later follow-up. Converting cytology samples from ThinPrep to SurePath processing can reduce the number of unsatisfactory samples. The samples should be run through the \"nongynecology\" program to ensure an adequate number of cells.

Very few reports of the cytologic features of ampullary adenomas are present in literature, particularly in bile duct brushing samples. A case report and review of the literature is presented. The typical cytologic features of ampullary adenomas on cytologic preparations include tall, thin columnar cells with mildly hyperchromatic elongated nuclei and nuclear pseudostratification, in a relatively clean background. The key differential diagnostic entities include invasive adenocarcinoma, thermal artifact, and reactive atypia.","158":"","159":"The Paris System for Reporting Urinary Cytology represents a significant improvement in classification of urinary specimens. The system acknowledges the difficulty in cytologically diagnosing low-grade urothelial carcinomas and has developed categories to deal with this issue. The system uses six categories: unsatisfactory, negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (NHGUC), atypical urothelial cells, suspicious for high-grade urothelial carcinoma, high-grade urothelial carcinoma, other malignancies and a seventh subcategory (low-grade urothelial neoplasm). Three hundred and fifty-seven urine specimens were independently reviewed by four cytopathologists unaware of the previous diagnoses. Each cytopathologist rendered a diagnosis according to the Paris System categories. Agreement was assessed using absolute agreement and weighted chance-corrected agreement (kappa). Disagreements were classified as low impact and high impact based on the potential impact of a misclassification on clinical management. The average absolute agreement was 65% with an average expected agreement of 44%. The average chance-corrected agreement (kappa) was 0.32. Nine hundred and ninety-nine of 1902 comparisons between rater pairs were in agreement, but 12% of comparisons differed by two or more categories for the category NHGUC. Approximately 15% of the disagreements were classified as high clinical impact. Our findings indicated that the scheme recommended by the Paris System shows adequate precision for the category NHGUC, but the other categories demonstrated unacceptable interobserver variability. This low level of diagnostic precision may negatively impact the applicability of the Paris System for widespread clinical application. ","160":"Although thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy (CNB) are commonly utilized modalities in the evaluation of thyroid nodules, metastatic tumors to the thyroid are only rarely encountered. We aspired to determine the incidence and primary origin of metastases to the thyroid at our institution and to examine their clinicopathologic and cytomorphologic features. A search of our database was undertaken to review all thyroid FNA and\/or CNB examined between January 2004 and December 2013. During our 10 year study period, 7497 patients underwent 13,182 FNA and\/or CNB. Four hundred sixty one (6%) patients were diagnosed with neoplasms. Only five (1.1%) were found to have metastatic tumors to the thyroid involving three females and two males. Two were diagnosed by FNA, one by CNB, and two by both FNA and CNB, with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) employed in all cases. The primary malignancies in the five cases were pulmonary and nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and olfactory neuroblastoma. The cytomorphologic features of these metastases to the thyroid aided in their distinction from primary thyroid carcinoma. Two of these metastases, a renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, were the first clinical manifestations of cancer. Metastases to the thyroid diagnosed by FNA and\/or CNB are exceedingly rare in our institution, comprising only 0.04% of total FNA\/CNB and only 1.1% of all thyroid neoplasms. We report the first known case of metastatic olfactory neuroblastoma to the thyroid diagnosed by aspiration cytology. In addition, an occult primary may present as a thyroid mass on FNA or CNB as occurred with two of our cases. FNA\/CNB proved to be highly effective in the diagnosis of metastases to the thyroid, with ROSE proving valuable in assuring specimen adequacy. Thyroid FNA and CNB demonstrated great utility in the setting of metastatic disease, obviating the need for more invasive procedures.

To characterize the cytological features of this malignancy in cervical smears, we report a case of a 52-year-old Japanese woman with cervical adenocarcinoma admixed with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC). Cytologically, there were two types of cells with different sizes. The smaller cells formed clusters, which showed a partially Indian file pattern, a high nuclear\/cytoplasmic ratio, and hyperchromatic nuclei. In contrast, the larger cells showed cytological features of adenocarcinoma, indicating a glandular-like pattern. Histological examination of biopsy specimens revealed that the tumors were composed of almost equal areas of SCNEC and adenocarcinoma. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and CD56. Thus, when adenocarcinoma cells are detected in smears, attempts to search for SCNEC cells should be made by combined cytological and histological analyses in order to reach an accurate diagnosis of the carcinoma in the uterine cervix.","165":"","166":null,"167":"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, is a life-threatening systemic disease caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan, Leishmania, and transmitted to humans by the female phlebotomine sand fly (Phlebotomus argentipes). The disease is fatal, if left untreated. We report a case of a patient clinically suspected of disseminated tuberculosis, but fine needle aspiration cytology of cervical and axillary lymph nodes yielded a diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Diagnosis of VL was challenging as the disease closely mimicked tuberculosis in the setting of extensive lymphadenopathy including conglomerate of mesenteric lymph nodes, on and off fever, and granulomatous lymphadenitis on aspiration. Bone marrow examination was further performed. A detailed workup revealed patient to be severely immunocompromised and newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Worldwide, India has the largest number of VL cases, accounting for 40%-50% of world's disease burden and the second largest HIV-infected population, accounting for approximately 10% of the global disease burden. HIV increases the risk of developing VL by 100-2320 times in endemic areas and concurrently VL promotes the clinical progression of HIV disease. Co-infection with HIV alters the body's immune response to leishmaniasis thus leading to unusual presentations. This case highlights the diagnostic problem in the aforesaid setting. Moreover, co-infection with HIV in VL can be a potential source of drug resistance. An early diagnosis and intensified treatment is the key to patient management.","168":"","169":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a multi-gene panel is now available for patients with lung adenocarcinoma, but the performance characteristics and clinical utility of this testing are not well-described. We present the results of an extended 467 gene panel in a series of advanced, highly selected nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using a range of specimens, including predominantly small biopsy and cytology specimens. A retrospective review of 22 NSCLC biopsies sent for NGS using an extended gene panel from January 2014 to July 2015. The customized NGS panel sequences 467 cancer-associated genes with exonic and intronic sequences obtained from purified tumor DNA. Genomic alterations, patient characteristics, and success of testing were determined. The majority of samples tested were metastatic lung adenocarcinoma on final pathology. Of the 22 specimens tested, 5 (22.7%) were surgical resections and 17 (77.3%) were small biopsy and cytology specimens. Twenty-one (95%) of the specimens were adequate for full sequencing and yielded a total of 204 genomic alterations (average 8.9 per tumor), of which 17 (average 0.81 per tumor) were actionable and\/or clinically relevant. Genomic alterations were found most commonly in the TP53, EGFR, EPHB1, MLL3, APC, SETD2, KRAS, DNMT3A, RB1, CDKN2A, ARID1A, EP300, KDM6B, RAD50, STK11, and BRCA2 genes. NGS using a comprehensive gene panel was performed successfully in 95% of all NSCLC cases in this series, including 94% small biopsy and cytology specimens and 100% surgical resections. This custom assay was performed on a range of tumor specimens and demonstrates that small specimens are able to provide a similar depth of information as larger ones. As many patients present at an advanced stage and only small specimens are obtained, the information these provide has the potential for guiding treatment in highly selected patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.

We report two cases of metastatic UC mimicking a primary pancreatic lesion. Two female patients, aged 48 and 83 years, presented with isolated pancreatic lesions causing obstructive jaundice suspicious for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). On cytopathology, the lesions were found to be UC, confirmed with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. UC rarely metastasizes to the pancreas, and diagnosis through EUS-FNA can be challenging. However, the utilization of ROSE, dedicated cell block passes, and IHC have proved to be effective in obtaining this unusual pancreatic diagnosis by EUS-FNA.","171":null,"172":"BRAF mutations using cellular DNA from fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens are commonly used to support the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The goal of this study was to preliminarily evaluate the diagnostic utility of detecting BRAF mutations in the routinely discarded FNA specimen supernatant fluid. Seventy-eight FNAs of thyroid lesions were evaluated for BRAF mutations using both cellular and supernatant DNA. BRAF mutation data were correlated with cytology and surgical pathology. Of the 78 samples evaluated, 68 (87%) had amplifiable DNA in the supernatant with 2 (3%) positive for BRAF mutations. These two samples showed no mutations in the cellular counterpart. Among the 11 samples showing morphologic findings (FNA\/surgical pathology) suspicious\/diagnostic of PTC, 6 (55%) samples (one supernatant and five cellulars) were positive for BRAF mutations. This suggests that testing supernatant DNA in FNA specimens may increase the diagnostic yield by 1\/11 (9%) in this setting. The vast majority of routinely discarded FNA supernatants contain amplifiable DNA. In addition, profiling the mutations of BRAF and other genes using supernatant DNA may provide valuable diagnostic information to assist the diagnosis of PTC in patients with clinical\/morphologic findings suspicious for malignancies and cellular DNA showing no mutations.

Among the benign entities, accessory liver lobes and ectopic liver are unusual and often incidentally discovered. Here, we report a patient with malignant melanoma who was clinically suspected to have a perigastric metastasis or a gastrointestinal stromal tumor but was ultimately diagnosed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) to have benign ectopic liver. A 47-year-old male was diagnosed with malignant melanoma of the scalp in May 2015 at a tertiary care hospital. He was found to have a 2.6 cm enhancing mass adjacent to the fundus of the stomach and below the diaphragm by computed tomography imaging. To exclude metastasis, the patient was referred to endoscopy, and an endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA was performed with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) by a cytopathologist. A relatively new FNA needle (Shark Core) was used, which produced useful core biopsy material. Cytopathology demonstrated flat sheets, single cells, and small clusters of polygonal cells. There was abundant granular cytoplasm, often containing pigment. Cells lacked pleomorphism. The smear findings appeared consistent with hepatocytes. The cell block demonstrated small core fragments of hepatic parenchyma with portal tracts. Immunohistochemistry for arginase-1 confirmed that this was hepatic tissue. ROSE was useful for communicating with the endoscopist that the mass was both far from, and not connected to, the liver. This is the first documented account of perigastric ectopic liver diagnosed by FNA. This entity should be considered in the differential of perigastric masses.","177":"The goal of this study was to calculate the sensitivity and false negative (FN) rate of ThinPrep Pap Test (TPPT) and carefully analyze missed cases for educational purposes. Patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS) or invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma (EAC) over a 17-year-period (1998-2015) were identified. The TPPT immediately preceding the histological diagnosis of AIS\/ECA was designated as index Pap (IP). Paps up to 122 months before histologic diagnosis of AIS\/ECA were considered for this study. All available negative and unsatisfactory TPPT were re-reviewed. There were 78 patients with histologically-proven AIS (56) or ECA (22) with 184 TPPTs, and 95 of these TPPTs were abnormal. Of the abnormal cases, 55.7% TPPTs were diagnosed as endocervical cell abnormality (atypical endocervical cells\/AIS\/ECA). Notably, 44.2% of abnormal TPPTs were diagnosed as squamous cell abnormality (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance\/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion\/high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). Including the diagnoses of squamous cell abnormality, the sensitivity of index TPPT for histologically-confirmed AIS\/ECA was 88%. Eighty-eight of 184 TPPT, including 10 IP, were negative = 87, or unsatisfactory = 1. Forty-two of these slides were available for re-review. Upon review, 21 TPPT (50%) were confirmed negative and 21 TPPT (50%) were reclassified as abnormal = 20, or unsatisfactory = 1. Of the FN cases, the main difficulty in correct diagnosis was the presence of few diagnostic cell clusters which had less feathering, and consisted of smaller, rounder cells in small and tighter clusters, with nuclear overlap. In particular, nuclear overlap in three-dimensional groups precluded the accurate diagnosis. Rare FN cases showed squamous cell abnormality on re-review, and rare cases showed obscuring blood or inflammation. A significant proportion of AIS\/EAC is discovered after Pap showing squamous cell abnormality. FN cases were most commonly related to nuclear overlap in tight three-dimensional clusters.

We searched the cytopathology database for RCC metastatic to the pancreas diagnosed by EUS-FNA from January 2005 to January 2015. Patient age, history of RCC, nephrectomy history, follow-up postnephrectomy, radiological impression, and EUS-FNA cytologic diagnosis were reviewed. Thirty-three patients were identified. The average age was 67.5 years (range, 49-84 years). Thirty-two patients had a previous documented history of RCC. One patient had the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis at the same time of the kidney biopsy. Thirty-one patients had been treated with nephrectomy. Twenty-seven patients were being monitored annually by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-five patients had multiple masses by imaging, but 8 patients had a single mass in the pancreas at the time of EUS-FNA. EUS-FNA of 20 cases showed classic morphology of RCC. Thirteen cases had either \"atypical\" clinical-radiologic features or morphologic overlaps with primary pancreatic neoplasms or other neoplasms.

Histologically, pancreatic endocrine tumors are divided into well, intermediate, and poorly differentiated examples based on mitotic count and Ki-67 proliferation index (PI). PI has been used in the evaluation of cytologic specimens utilizing cell block material. Unfortunately, cell block material may not always be available for analysis, and little data exists as to cytomorphologic features in smear preparations which might distinguish between low- and intermediate-grade endocrine neoplasms and predict metastases. We studied 36 cases of Diff-Quik stained smear preparations for 20 morphologic features to determine which best-classified cases into poor and not poor outcome categories. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between the morphologic features and outcomes. Absolute agreement between raters ranged from 51% to 97% across the 20 morphologic features. About 12 of the 20 morphologic features showed statistically significant associations with poor outcome. Mitoses, irregular nuclear membranes, and 3-fold variation in nuclear size are the best discriminators between poor and not poor outcomes. A scoring system was developed utilizing mitoses, irregular nuclear membranes, and 3-fold variation in nuclear size to divide smears of pancreatic endocrine tumors into poor and not poor outcome groups.

Herein, we present a case of multiorgan metastatic malignancy with a dominant hilar and mediastinal mass in a current smoker; clinically, highly suggestive of widespread primary lung cancer. This case was eventually classified as malignant melanoma, despite a significant diagnostic challenge due to lack of prior history, unusual cytomorphology, and S-100 protein negativity. A battery of immunostains was performed and the addition of other melanocytic-associated markers confirmed the melanocytic lineage of the neoplasm. This case highlights the pitfalls in the differential diagnosis of a metastatic tumor of unknown origin by fine needle aspiration cytology due to the significant morphologic overlap of poorly differentiated malignancies. We emphasize that, albeit rare, malignant melanomas can be completely negative for S-100 protein and the use of additional melanocytic-associated markers in the differential workup maybe critical in arriving promptly at a proper diagnosis.

Type 1b consisted of dense strands\/bands. Type 2 was similar to Type 1a but with shorter (&lt;2 mm) and looser stromal strands. Types 1a and b showed straight\/curved\/circular branching patterns suggestive of incomplete frameworks of nodular\/papillary architectures or fragments of capsule. Type 1b stroma likely represented thick\/collagenized fibrous septae. Incomplete or complete rings of small encapsulated tumor were occasionally identified. These frameworks of stroma were frequently associated with multinodular goiters (MNGs) which are often hypocellular and follicular neoplasms\/papillary thyroid carcinoma with increased cellularity. Type 2 was associated with microfollicles in encapsulated neoplasms or with macrofollicles in MNG. Follicular lesions of unknown significance (n = 41) either negative (n = 26) or positive (n = 15) for carcinoma in subsequent follow-up were frequently associated with stroma characteristic of MNG and carcinoma, respectively.

Acid-fast Bacilli detection was attempted by ZN staining on smears as well as culture on Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Percentage positivity of both smears and culture was calculated. Of the 56 cases, 46 showed cytomorphological features consistent with tuberculosis (TB). The most common pattern was only necrosis in 37 cases followed by necrotizing granulomas in 13 cases. ZN-stained smears were positive in 40 cases while culture was positive in only 27 cases. The highest smear and culture positivity was noted in cases with only necrosis. In six cases, diagnosis of TB was made on culture alone since smear was negative in these cases. FNA is a reliable technique for early and accurate diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis in many cases. Mycobacterial culture by newer rapid techniques can assist in bacillary detection in smear-negative cases and also allows for drug sensitivity testing. Hence, culture should be resorted to in such cases. ","189":"Serous borderline tumor (SBT) involving a cervical lymph node is extremely rare. In addition, fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of the involved cervical lymph node shares tremendous morphologic similarity with other low-grade papillary carcinomas. Thus, it can be easily misdiagnosed as metastatic carcinoma. A 42-year-old female had a history of bilateral SBT and postbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She presented with left cervical lymphadenopathy 6 months later. FNA cytology showed a low-grade papillary neoplasm with psammoma bodies. Needle core biopsy along with immunostains was diagnostic of cervical lymph node involvement (LNI) of SBT. although extremely rare, cervical LNI can be found in patients with SBTs. FNA cytology, sometimes, is indistinguishable from metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma. Cell block or needle core biopsy is essential to make the correct diagnosis.

This study was carried out to evaluate effect on the rate of U\/S samples after introduction of LBC in our laboratory. An audit of U\/S cervical samples was performed, which included split samples (n = 1000), only conventional Pap smear (CPS) smears (n = 1000), and only LBC samples (n = 1000). The smears were reviewed by two observers independently, and adequacy for the samples was assessed as per The Bethesda System 2001. The reasons for U\/S rate in split samples were categorized into various cytologic and\/or technical reasons. U\/S rate was far less in only LBC samples (1.2%) as compared to only CPS (10.5%) cases. Cases in the satisfactory but limited category were also less in only LBC (0.4%) as compared to only CPS (3.2%) samples. The main reasons for U\/S smears in split samples were low cell count (37.2% in CPS; 58.8% in LBC). The second main reason was low cellularity with excess blood and only excess blood in CPS samples. There was a significant reduction of U\/S rate in LBC samples as compared to CPS samples, and the difference was statistically significant. The main cause of U\/S samples in LBC was low cellularity indicating a technical fault in sample collection. The main cause of U\/S rate in CPS was low cellularity followed by low cellularity with excess blood. Adequate training of sample takers and cytologists for the precise cell count to determine adequacy in smears can be of great help in reducing U\/S rate.

The tumor occurs mainly in the parotid gland followed by minor salivary glands and other body sites. As a result of their morphologic heterogeneity, they can be confused easily with many tumors. Awareness of their unique cytoarchitectural patterns and immunohistochemical profile is crucial for accurate identification. Herein, we report a rare case of a 51-year-old female patient with MECA of the maxillary sinus that metastasized to the pleural fluid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pleural fluid involvement by MECA reported in the literature.

Thus we present cytomorphological features and discuss its differential diagnosis with neoplasms having prominent papillary architecture with review of literature. ","194":"To assess the adequacy of intraoperative scrape cytology during percutaneous vertebroplasty by correlating results with corresponding histopathology. Vertebroplasty is a procedure increasingly used to treat painful vertebral compression fractures. The history and presentation of osteoporotic fractures are straightforward, but difficulty arises in differentiating infective from neoplastic lesions, especially in cases where the magnetic resonance imaging is equivocal. The procedure involves injection of polymethyl methacrylate (bone cement) into the pathological vertebral body and gives dramatic pain relief. It is indicated in osteoporotic and neoplastic lesions but contraindicated in infections. Hence, intraoperative evaluation of a specimen is essential to aid in the decision of performing vertebroplasty. A total of 128 patients with vertebral lesions underwent core biopsy and scrape cytology from June 2006 to June 2015. Based on the findings of cytological examination, malignant lesions were subjected to vertebroplasty. In lesions with infective etiology, vertebroplasty was abandoned and antibiotic or antituberculous therapy started. The overall diagnostic accuracy of scrape cytology was excellent with 97.58% cases correlating with the final histopathological diagnosis. Specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100% and negative predictive value was 33.33%. Scrape cytology is a simple, rapid, accurate cytodiagnostic technique and should be routinely utilized in vertebral lesions for intraoperative consultation and decision making during vertebroplasty.

Lesions can make the mucosa friable and prone to bleeding and discharge. Women with FGS may have an increased risk of HIV acquisition, and FGS may act as a cofactor in the development of cervical cancer. To explore cytology as a method for diagnosing FGS and to discuss the diagnostic challenges in low-resource rural areas. The correlation between FGS and squamous cell atypia (SCA) is also explored and discussed. Cytology results are compared to Schistosoma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vaginal lavage and urine and in urine microscopy. In a clinical study, 394 women aged between 16 and 23 years from rural high schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, underwent structured interviews and the following laboratory tests: Cytology Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for S. haematobium ova and cervical SCA, real-time PCR for Schistosoma-specific DNA in vaginal lavage and urine samples, and urine microscopy for the presence of S. haematobium ova. In Pap smears, S. haematobium ova were detected in 8\/394 (2.0%). SCA was found in 107\/394 (27.1%), seven of these had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Schistosoma specific DNA was detected in 38\/394 (9.6%) of vaginal lavages and in 91\/394 (23.0%) of urines. Ova were found microscopically in 78\/394 (19.7%) of urines. Schistosoma PCR on lavage was a better way to diagnose FGS compared to cytology. There was a significant association between S. haematobium ova in Pap smears and the other diagnostic methods. In low-resource Schistosoma-endemic areas, it is important that cytology screeners are aware of diagnostic challenges in the identification of schistosomiasis in addition to the cytological diagnosis of SCA. Importantly, in this study, three of eight urines were negative but showed Schistosoma ova in their Pap smear, and one of them was also negative for Schistosoma DNA in urine. In this study, SCA was not significantly associated with schistosomiasis. HSIL detected in this young population might need future consideration.

It has a polymorphic histomorphology characterized by a biphasic cell population of \"surface cells\" and \"round cells\" arranged in four general patterns: Papillary, solid, angiomatous, and sclerotic. This variability in histomorphology makes it difficult to diagnose sclerosing hemangioma by fine needle aspiration (FNA).

We report one such case in a young woman diagnosed on endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration. The tumor cells showed positive staining with synaptophysin, chromogranin, and also with inhibin. ","199":"Iron overload is a medical condition that occurs when too much of the mineral iron builds up inside the body and produces a toxic reaction. Thalassemia is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin synthesis, which requires regular blood transfusion therapy, and the lack of specific excretory pathways for iron in humans leads to iron overload in the body tissues. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The estimation of iron levels in exfoliated buccal mucosal cells may provide a simple, noninvasive, and a safe procedure for estimating the iron overload by using the Perls' Prussian blue stain. Smears were obtained from buccal mucosa of 40 randomly selected beta-thalassemia major patients and 40 healthy subjects as controls. Smears were stained with Perls' Prussian blue method. Blood samples were taken for estimation of serum ferritin levels. Images of smears were analyzed using the software image J software version 1.47v and correlated with serum ferritin. Perls' positivity was observed in 87.5% of thalassemic patients with a positive correlation to serum ferritin levels.

We conducted this study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for uterine glandular lesions and to compare the diagnostic utility of conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) smears for glandular lesions. Archived histopathology records of all cases reported as endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma in the study period were identified and the available corresponding Pap smears (in preceding 1 year) were retrieved. In addition, the Pap smears reported as glandular cell abnormalities (GCA) during the same study period were retrieved. The overall prevalence of GCA, sensitivity, and specificity of Pap smears for the detection of GCA was calculated. The diagnostic accuracy of conventional and LBC smears for the diagnosis of GCA was also compared. The prevalence of GCA in our study was 0.32%. The overall specificity of Pap smears for the diagnosis of GCA was 60.8%, this was not significantly different between conventional and LBC smears (P = 0.4). The overall sensitivity of Pap smears for the detection of GCA was 41.8%; LBC smears had significantly better sensitivity as compared to conventional smears for the detection of endometrial as compared to endocervical adenocarcinoma (P &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of GCA in Pap smears is low. The specificity of Pap smears, for diagnosis of GCA, was found to be moderate. However, the overall sensitivity of Pap smears for the detection of GCA was low, though better for LBC as compared to conventional smears.

One of the patients was a 40 years old female who presented with abdominal distension and lump. She was found to have bilateral adnexal masses on ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan. A USG guided fine needle aspiration of the ovarian masses was performed, following which a diagnosis of primary ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was established. The second patient was a 14 years old female who presented with pelvic lump, which was lobulated and mildly enhancing on contrast enhanced CT. A diagnosis of high grade NHL of ovaries was made on cytology. Subsequently, the lymphoma was characterized as Burkitt's on histopathological examination. Both the patients were started on R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen. FNAC serves as an extremely useful minimally invasive procedure for the diagnosis of ovarian lymphomas and early institution of appropriate chemotherapeutic regimens.

Recognition of this uncommon occurrence may help render an accurate diagnosis and avoid diagnostic pitfalls during endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). In this study, we review our experience in diagnosing secondary tumors involving the pancreas. The electronic database of cytopathology archives was searched for cases of secondary tumors involving the pancreas at our institution and a total of 31 cases were identified. The corresponding clinical presentations, imaging study findings, cytological diagnoses, the results of ancillary studies, and surgical follow-up, if available, were reviewed. Nineteen of the patients were male and 12 female, with a mean age of 66 years. Twenty-three patients (74%) had a prior history of malignancy, with the latency ranging from 6 months to 19 years. The secondary tumors involving the pancreas included metastatic carcinoma (24 cases), metastatic sarcoma (3 cases), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (2 cases), and plasma cell neoplasm (2 cases). The most common metastatic tumors were renal cell carcinoma (8 cases) and lung carcinoma (7 cases). Correct diagnoses were rendered in 29 cases (94%). The remaining two cases were misclassified as primary pancreatic carcinoma. In both cases, the patients had no known history of malignancy, and no ancillary studies were performed. Secondary tumors involving the pancreas can be accurately diagnosed by EUS-FNA.

To the best of our knowledge, there are 5 case reports with a total of 6 patients describing its diagnosis by fine needle aspiration (FNA). All of these cases were diagnosed as conventional RCC on FNA. Subsequent excisions proved them to be MTSCC. We herein report a case in a 67-year-old male. He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have a new colon adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver and lungs. The extent of disease made the patient ineligible for surgical excision, and he received chemotherapy. Work-up also revealed a kidney mass which was later biopsied by FNA and core biopsy. The tumor was composed of epithelial and spindled cell components embedded in a myxoid background. It was positive for CK7, AMCAR, vimentin, and epithelial membrane antigen. The tumor was diagnosed as MTSCC. One year later the kidney mass remained stable. However, the patient developed new metastasis to the liver from colonic primary. The kidney mass was not resected. Although rarely encountered in FNA cytology of the kidney, we believe the cytologic features of this tumor are distinctive and are different from conventional and other subtypes of RCC.

Additional contributions have been obtained from cytopathologists and scientists, who could not attend these meetings, with final discussions and input during the IMIG 2014 conference in cape town. During the previous IMIG biennial meetings, thorough discussions have resulted in published guidelines for the pathologic diagnosis of MM. However, previous recommendations have stated that the diagnosis of MM should be based on histological material only.[12] Accumulating evidence now indicates that the cytological diagnosis of MM supported by ancillary techniques is as reliable as that based on histopathology, although the sensitivity with cytology may be somewhat lower.[345] Recognizing that noninvasive diagnostic modalities benefit both the patient and the health system, future recommendations should include cytology as an accepted method for the diagnosis of this malignancy.[67] The article describes the consensus of opinions of the authors on how cytology together with ancillary testing can be used to establish a reliable diagnosis of MM.

The central hyaline spherule has been found to be basement membrane material histochemically and immunohistochemically. The importance of recognizing CS of breast lies in the fact that similar hyaline globules can occur in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (ACCB).

Out of 114 unsatisfactory specimens associated with atrophic cellular changes (ACC), 48 were resubmitted by provider and reevaluated. Lubricant and lubricant-like debris\/contamination (LUBE) was the most common cause of unsatisfactory specimens (68%; 681\/1000) followed by blood (7.5%); ACC only (without other interfering factors) (2.4%); inflammation (3.0%); and combinations thereof (1.9%). 11.5% showed scant cellularity without an identifiable cause. 3.3% were virtually acellular. Wash protocol improved cellularity in 48% (256\/531) of cases. However, only 29% (73\/256) of those were satisfactory (with more than 5000 cells). Quantitative reduction in LUBE after wash protocol varied with different morphological subtypes. Interpretation patterns on satisfactory specimens after wash protocol were comparable to the results on selected cohort of specimens during the same study period. Out of 114 ACC, wash protocol was performed on 68 ACC specimens leading to satisfactory TP in 24% (16\/68).

The study was conducted over a 6 years period and covered the different socioeconomic levels to have a representative sample for women living in Alexandria. All women included did not have any cervical disorder related complaints. Conventional Pap smears were obtained and diagnosed using the Bethesda system. Women with abnormal Pap smears were managed according to the 2006 consensus guidelines within the available facilities. Persistent abnormal cytological results were referred for colposcopic biopsy. Histological results were grouped into: Reactive changes, CIN 1, CIN 2\/CIN 3 and adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS). Out of the 6173 smears included in the study 6072 (98.36%) were normal and only 101 (1.63%) were abnormal. After colposcopic biopsies, 0.08% had CIN 1, 0.03% had CIN 2, 3 and 0.01% had AIS. We concluded that cervical cancer screening programs, although life-saving for a number of women, are not a sufficiently high priority in our community. Money for national health screening programs should preferably be directed more towards recruiting women for breast cancer screening, since breast cancer accounts for about 33% of all female cancers in Egypt ranking number one, while cervical cancer ranks number 13.

Although the diagnosis is generally made clinically, imaging methods and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may provide assistance, particularly in atypical cases. The objective of this study is to reveal the ultrasonographic (USG) and cytological characteristics of SGT. The clinical, USG and cytological findings of 21 cases diagnosed with SGT were reviewed. Ultrasonographic data was available in 20 cases. A hypoechoic thyroid nodule with irregular margins was detected in 12 of the 20 total cases. Of these, 9 cases complained about pain in the thyroid lodge and generally had unilateral lesions, heterogeneous and hypoechoic areas with indistinct margins, rather than nodular lesions, which were seen in 7 cases. Cytologically, the multinuclear giant cells (MNGCs) found in all cases were accompanied by a dirty background containing varying numbers of granulomatous structures, including isolated epithelioid histiocytes, proliferated\/regenerated follicle epithelium cells and inflammatory cells and colloid. Though hypoechoic and heterogeneous areas with irregular margins are strongly associated with thyroiditis, SGT may also appear as painful or painless hypoechoic, solid nodules and generate challenges in differential diagnosis. Although the most remarkable characteristic observed in FNA cytology was the presence of multiple MNGCs with cytoplasm, a dirty background accompanied by mild-moderate cellularity, degenerated-proliferated follicular epithelium cells, rare epithelioid granulomas and mixed type inflammatory cells are characteristic for SGT. The assessment of these radiological and cytological findings in conjunction with clinical findings will assist in the achievement of an accurate diagnosis. ","226":"The sensitivity of Papanicolaou smears for detecting endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is very low. A comprehensive cytological analysis of endocervical AIS is necessary to increase diagnostic accuracy. The subjects were 74 patients with pathologically-diagnosed AIS. A total of 140 Papanicolaou smears were reviewed to calculate the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou smears for detecting AIS and the incidence of sampling\/screening\/diagnostic errors. The cytological review was performed by 6 cytotechnologists, and the final cytological diagnosis was obtained at the consensus meeting. We classified the cases into three differentiation types; typical type (well-differentiated AIS), polymorphic type (poorly differentiated AIS), and mixed typical and polymorphic type. Three cytological subtypes (endocervical, endometrioid and intestinal subtypes) of AIS were also analyzed. The sensitivity of the original Papanicolaou smears for the detection of AIS was 44.6%, while that for the detection of AIS and adenocarcinoma was 63.5%. The diagnostic accuracy of AIS increased to 78.5% in the final diagnosis. The common characteristic features were microbiopsies\/hyperchromatic crowded groups (HCG) (82.0%) and mitotic figures (72.2%). The appearance of single cells (2.8%) was rare, and all the cervical cytology smears showed no evidence of necrotic tumor diathesis. The most common AIS was the typical type (41 cases, 67.2%) among all cytologically-diagnosed AIS or adenocarcinoma cases (61 cases). Although mixed typical and polymorphic AIS existed in 17 cases (27.9%), pure polymorphic AIS was very rare (3 cases, 4.9%). The endocervical subtype was the most predominant subtype (67.2%), followed by a few mixed subtypes. The important diagnostic keys for AIS cytology are as follows: (1) The appearance of microbiopsies\/HCG (single-cell pattern is rare), (2) mitotic figures in the microbiopsies\/HCG, (3) a lack of necrotic tumor diathesis in cases with polymorphic AIS, and (4) recognition of typical cytological subtypes. The relatively low diagnostic accuracy AIS was caused by the underestimation of microbiopsies\/HCG and the overestimation of polymorphic components. The typical cytological features of AIS are the presence of microbiopsies\/HCG with mitotic figures in the absence of necrotic tumor diathesis in specimens containing endocervical samples. The recognition of infrequent AIS subtypes (endometrioid and intestinal subtypes) is also important. ","227":"Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA) is a rare epithelial malignancy that arises from a primary or recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (PA). It may be noninvasive (NI) or invasive. NI CXPA is extremely rare. Preoperative diagnosis on fine needle aspiration (FNA) of CXPA may be difficult and poses a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and pathologists. Herein, we describe the FNA findings of a case of NI-CXPA. A 69-year-old woman presented with rapid enlargement of a stable parotid mass of 25 years. Cytologically, malignant cells were focally associated with metachromatic fibromyxoid matrix that was homogeneous and dense with a vague fibrillary quality. There were cell groups, papillary-like clusters and single malignant cells. The nuclei were pleomorphic with irregularly dispersed chromatin, and the cytoplasm was ill-defined and granular. Nucleoli were small to inconspicuous. Mitoses and necrosis were not seen. Cytological features were not specific for any type of salivary gland carcinoma. The FNA diagnosis was primary high-grade adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland, not otherwise specified. Facial nerve-sparing total parotidectomy was performed, which histologically showed PA interspersed with ducts and nests composed of pleomorphic atypical nuclei surrounded by extensive hyalinization. Single cells were also noted. No capsular infiltration was seen in the entirely sampled tumor. Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 showed a higher proliferation rate in the malignant ducts and p63 positive cells focally surrounded some of the malignant ducts. Histological diagnosis was NI-CXPA. Accurate diagnosis is important for proper surgical management; however, the preoperative diagnosis of NI-CXPA is difficult to make on FNA. ","228":"Akt is a serine\/threonine protein kinase and has emerged as a crucial regulator of widely divergent cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. Activation of Akt\/protein kinase B has been positively associated with human epidermal growth-factor receptor 2 (HER2)\/neu overexpression in breast carcinoma and a worse outcome among endocrine treated patients. The Akt signaling pathway currently attracts considerable attention as a new target for effective therapeutic strategies. We therefore investigated the relationship between activation of Akt and clinicopathologic variables including hormone receptor and HER2\/neu status. Archival tumor tissues from 100 patients with invasive breast carcinoma were analyzed by immunocytochemistry. This study describes the results of immunocytochemical pAkt expression in breast carcinoma imprints, prepared from cut surfaces of freshly removed tumors. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic expressions were evaluated for pAkt. Nuclear and cytoplasmic positive scores of 72% (72\/100) and 42% (42\/100), respectively, were found. Coexistence of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was observed in 32 cases (32\/100). Nuclear positive staining correlated with HER2\/neu overexpression (P = 0.043) and was significantly associated with positive involvement of axillary lymph nodes (P = 0.013). No correlation was found between cytoplasmic pAkt rate and clinicopathological parameters, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or HER2\/neu expression. pAkt expression can be evaluated in cytological material and may add valuable information to current prognostic models for breast cancer. pAkt overexpression appears to be linked with potentially aggressive tumor phenotype in invasive breast carcinoma. ","229":"Adrenal oncocytic pheochromocytoma is an extremely rare type of pheochromocytoma. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first cytological diagnosis of this variant via fine-needle aspiration in an 81-year-old male patient who was found to have an adrenal mass while undergoing workup of the recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma. We describe the cytomorphologic findings in our case and provide a review of the reported cases of adrenal oncocytic pheochromocytoma - all of which appear to be benign, nonfunctional, occur in adults, and have similar morphologic features. The pathologist should be aware of this uncommon diagnostic entity and its potential diagnostic pitfalls. ","230":"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is frequently used to sample intra-abdominal lesions and lymph nodes. Celiac ganglia normally located near the celiac artery may be sampled during these procedures. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of detection and cytologic findings of celiac ganglia diagnosed on FNA. A 14-year retrospective review of radiologic and endoscopic FNA cases involving the celiac region was performed. Cases in which ganglia were reported were further analyzed and slides reviewed. A total of 354 patients underwent FNA of a suspected celiac lymph node (334 patients) or celiac mass (20 cases). In 9 of these patients (2.5%), ganglion cells were identified. These were identified in cases only after 2008 via EUS-guided FNA. Aspirates were hypocellular and bloody. Large ganglion cells were either sparsely dispersed or present in clusters. Ganglion cells had a low N: C ratio, granular cytoplasm with neuromelanin, and eccentric small round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. One specimen had concomitant pancreatic adenocarcinoma. None of these cases had a false positive on-site adequacy assessment or final misdiagnosis. These data show that celiac ganglia may be infrequently encountered, especially with intra-abdominal EUS-guided FNA targeting nodes or masses near the celiac region. Therefore, cytologists should be aware of the possibility of finding ganglionic cells in EUS-guided FNA samples. ","231":"Intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is a rare intraluminal malignant neoplasm that has an aggressive biological behavior, and early diagnosis may improve patient outcome. We describe a case of pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma diagnosed on cytologic material obtained by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) biopsy with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). The aspirate showed loosely cohesive clusters of pleomorphic malignant spindled and epithelioid cells. An immunostain panel did not demonstrate any definitive mesenchymal or epithelial differentiation. The tumor's intraluminal origin was supported by radiographic imaging studies. Subsequently, the patient received preoperative chemotherapy and underwent tumor resection with reconstruction. This report describes the cytomorphologic features of this rare intravascular tumor and demonstrates how EBUS-TBNA with ROSE was instrumental in obtaining optimal cytologic sampling for ancillary studies, thus expediting the management. ","232":"Detection of urothelial carcinoma (UC) by urine cytology can be challenging. Recently, ProEx C has been studied as a marker to improve detection of UC. ProEx C is an assay targeting expression of topoisomerase IIa and minichromosome maintenance protein-2 and is currently utilized to assist in diagnoses of the gynecological specimens. In this study, we compared the utility of ProEx C and UroVysion in urine specimens. Twenty-seven urine specimens with UroVysion assay analysis and surgical biopsy follow-up were selected. The smears were stained with ProEx C. ProEx C and UroVysion assay results were separated into two categories based on surgical biopsy follow-up (benign or neoplastic). Surgical biopsy diagnoses were used as the gold standard for comparative evaluation of the two assays. The surgical follow-up was 9 benign, 2 low grade, and 16 high grade UCs. The sensitivity was 88.9% for ProEx C and 55.6% for UroVysion, while the specificity was 77.8% for ProEx C and 44.4% for UroVysion. Positive predictive value was 88.9% for ProEx C and 66.7% for UroVysion. Negative predictive value was 77.8% and 33.3% for ProEx C and UroVysion, respectively. Using the two-tailed paired t-test, P value of 0.033 was obtained when ProEx C stain was compared with the UroVysion assay. ProEx C immunocytochemistry has a more favorable performance than fluorescent in-situ hybridization with a significant difference between the two assays using paired two-tail t-test (P = 0.0033). ","233":"Breast augmentation with implantation represents a challenge for subsequent radiographic imaging and pathological sampling. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is an excellent technique to sample suspicious lesions that are adjacent to fragile implants. We report a case of a 51-year-old woman with breast implants presenting with an initial diagnosis of fibroadenoma by imaging studies. A definite diagnosis of mammary carcinoma with plasmacytoid cells was made on ultrasound (US)-guided FNAB of the breast mass with rapid on-site evaluation which initiated core needle biopsy of the mass and subsequent mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Our case exemplifies the role of US-guided FNAB for the initial investigation of breast masses in patients with implants. In addition, the case illustrates the cytomorphological features of the tumor cells in primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast. ","234":"Bronchial brush (BB) cytology carries low sensitivity for detecting neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), including typical carcinoid (TC) tumors of the lung. We aimed to investigate the detection of neuroendocrine tumors including TC through BB routine cytology cell block (CB), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A SNOMED search showed 187 lung biopsy or resection specimens from 2008 through 2011 containing neuroendocrine or carcinoid in the diagnosis. Residual BB specimens retained in PreservCyt were used to prepare a ThinPrep slide for FISH analysis. CBs were stained with H and E and IHC for chromogranin and synaptophysin. Of the 187 cases, 16 had residual BB material available within 1 year of diagnosis and were used in CB preparation for IHC and FISH slides. Cytologic evaluation determined 1 case positive for malignancy (small cell lung carcinoma [SCLC]), 1 suspicious for adenocarcinoma, and 14 negative for malignancy. On the basis of histologic diagnosis, FISH was performed. SCLC showed polysomy (86% abnormal cells); 2 TC tumors showed a gain of 7p12 (15% abnormal cells) and a gain of 5q15 (72% abnormal cells), respectively. Two cases had CBs with positive immunoreactivity for chromogranin and synaptophysin. The sensitivity for detection of NEC was 18.8%, 15.4%, and 25% for cytologic evaluation, CB, and FISH, respectively. Neuroendocrine tumors, including TC are difficult to detect with BB cytologic evaluation, most likely because tumor cells lack in the specimen. Assessment of further studies is needed to explore the role of cytology and ancillary methods for detection of these tumors. ","235":"Endoscopic ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (EBUS-TFNA) is a minimally invasive technique for diagnosis of mediastinal masses\/lesions. Although most studies have reported the utility of EBUS-TFNA in malignancy, its use has been extended to the benign conditions as well. The present study focused on utility of EBUS in contributing to reach the final diagnosis of sarcoidosis. From May 2010 to December 2013, 19 of 80 patients who underwent EBUS-TFNA at one center for radiologically suspicious lesions for sarcoidosis, and with no definite histological diagnosis, were included in this retrospective study. When the histological diagnosis was taken as the gold standard, the sensitivity of EBUS-TFNA was 84.2% and specificity 100% with the positive predictive value of 100. The combined diagnostic sensitivity of EBUS-TFNA and transbronchial lung biopsy was 100%. EBUS is a valuable, minimally invasive diagnostic modality to support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in appropriate clinical setting, after conventional work-up - particularly if patients have suspicious radiological findings. This minimally invasive procedure helps in providing a final diagnosis without exposing the patient to the risk of complications from more invasive procedures. ","236":"Pilomatrixoma (PMX) (pilomatricoma, calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe) is a benign tumor with differentiation toward the hair matrix cells and is common in head and neck region. It is most commonly seen in the first two decades of life and presents as a subcutaneous, small, asymptomatic firm solitary nodule. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has been described as an important preoperative diagnostic investigation though on cytology the diagnosis of PMX is sometimes difficult and misdiagnosed. We describe two patients with gradually increasing asymptomatic swelling on pinna and middle finger. FNAC was done and a diagnosis of PMX was given, further confirmed by histopathological examination. The present cases highlight the importance of FNAC in considering PMX as differential diagnosis of dermal or subcutaneous nodules in locations other than head and neck. Cytopathologists who play an important role in the preliminary diagnosis should keep in mind the variability of the cellular composition of these types of lesions to avoid misdiagnosis. ","237":"The 2001 Bethesda system recommends further classifying atypical glandular cells (AGCs) as either endocervical or endometrial origin. Numerous studies have investigated the clinical significance of AGC. In this study, we investigated the incidence of clinically significant lesions among women with liquid-based Papanicolaou cervicovaginal (Pap) interpretations of atypical endometrial cells (AEMs) or AGC favor endometrial origin (AGC-EM). More importantly, we correlated patients of AEM or AGC-EM with their clinical presentations to determine if AEM\/AGC-EM combined with abnormal vaginal bleeding is associated with a higher incidence of significant endometrial pathology. All liquid-based Pap tests with an interpretation of AEM and AGC-EM from July, 2004 through June, 2009 were retrieved from the database. Women with an interpretation of atypical endocervical cells, AGC, favor endocervical origin or AGC, favor neoplastic were not included in the study. The most severe subsequent histologic diagnoses were recorded for each patient. During this 5-year period, we accessioned 332,470 Pap tests of which 169 (0.05%) were interpreted as either AEM or AGC-EM. Of the 169 patients, 133 had histologic follow-up within the health care system. The patients ranged in age from 21 to 71 years old (mean 49.7). On follow-up histology, 27 (20.3%) had neoplastic\/preneoplastic uterine lesions. Among them, 20 patients were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma (18 endometrial, 1 endocervical, and 1 metastatic colorectal), 3 with atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and 4 with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. All patients with significant endometrial pathology, except one, were over 40 years old, and 22 of 25 patients reported abnormal vaginal bleeding at the time of endometrial biopsy or curettage. This study represents a large series of women with liquid-based Pap test interpretations of AEM and AGC-EM with clinical follow-up. Significant preneoplastic or neoplastic endometrial lesions were identified in 20.3% of patients. Patients with Pap test interpretations of AEM or AGC-EM and the clinical presentation of abnormal vaginal bleeding should be followed closely. ","238":"Granular cell tumors (GCT) formerly known as Abrikossoff tumor or granular cell myoblastoma, are rare neoplasms encountered in the fine needle aspiration (FNA) service. Named because of their highly granular cytoplasm which is invariably positive for the S-100 antibody, the classic GCT is thought to be of neural origin. The cytomorphological features range from highly cellular to scanty cellular smears with dispersed polygonal tumor cells. The cells have abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, eccentric round to oval vesicular nuclei with small inconspicuous nucleoli. The fragility of the cells can result in many stripped nuclei in a granular background. The differential diagnosis occasionally can range from a benign or reactive process to features that are suspicious for malignancy. Some of the concerning cytologic features include necrosis, mitoses and nuclear pleomorphism. We identified 6 cases of suspected GCT on cytology within the last 10 years and compared them to their final histologic diagnoses. Four had histologic correlation of GCT including one case that was suspicious for GCT on cytology and called atypical with features concerning for a malignant neoplasm. Of the other two cases where GCT was suspected, one showed breast tissue with fibrocystic changes, and the other was a Hurthle cell adenoma of the thyroid. These results imply that FNA has utility in the diagnosis of GCT, and should be included in the differential diagnoses when cells with abundant granular cytoplasm are seen on cytology. Careful attention to cytologic atypia, signs of reactive changes, use of immunohistochemistry, and clinical correlation are helpful in arriving at a definite diagnosis on FNA cytology. ","239":"A 58 years old lady reported with history of progressively increasing lump in the neck. Patient had earlier undergone sub-total thyroidectomy (details not available) in a private institute one year back. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the present lump revealed features of papillary carcinoma thyroid. Patient subsequently underwent total thyroidectomy along with excision of a tumor nodule in the larynx. Gross examination of the specimen revealed a tumor nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid. Microscopic examination of the tumor nodule in the thyroid and larynx revealed a columnar cell variant of papillary carcinoma thyroid. Very few reports describing the cytomorphologic features of this variant of papillary carcinoma are available in the published literature. These reports highlight the absence or paucity of nuclear grooves and intranuclear inclusions in this variant. We describe a case of columnar cell variant of papillary carcinoma where nuclear grooves were prominently seen. In addition, we report the occurrence of rosette-like structures which were brought out better on FNA smears. These rosette-like structures have not been emphasized earlier in the published literature. The cytomorphologic features of this rare variant are also reviewed in this report. ","240":"Preoperative ultrasound (US) and eventually US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of suspicious axillary lymph nodes (ALN) is a standard procedure in the work-up of suspicious breast lesions. Preoperative US FNAC may prevent sentinel node biopsy (SNB) procedure in 24-30% of patients with early stage breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the institutional results of this preoperative diagnostic procedure. A total of 182 cases of preoperative FNAC of suspicious ALN where retrieved from the pathology files. The results were compared with the final histology and staging. False negative (FN) FNAC cases were reviewed and possibly missed metastatic cases (2) were immunostained with the epithelial marker AE1\/AE3. There were no false positives, whereas 16 cases were FN. In all but one case the FN's represented sampling error. Half of the 16 FN cases in this series were macrometastases. About 83% of the preoperatively aspirated cases were N+, indicating that a radiologically suspicious ALN has a very high risk of being metastatic. Preoperative US guided FNAC from radiologically suspicious ALN is highly efficient in detecting metastases. Depending on national guidelines, a preoperative, positive ALN FNAC might help to stratify the patients as to SNB and\/or ALN dissection. ","241":"Sebaceous lymphadenoma (SLA) is a rare benign tumor of the salivary gland that commonly arises in the parotid gland in adults. It is rarely diagnosed correctly preoperatively. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, SLA has not been described yet in the literature in association with Cowden's syndrome (CS). We present an extremely rare case of parotid SLA that was diagnosed preoperatively by fine needle aspiration in a patient with CS. ","242":"Mammary Analogue Secretory Carcinoma (MASC) is a newly recognized neoplasm of the salivary gland, first described in 2010. This tumor harbors a unique translocation, t(12;15)(p13;q25) that results in the fusion of ETV6 with NTRK3 which produces a transformative chimeric tyrosine kinase. To date, few cases of MASC sampled by fine needle aspiration have been reported. Cytologically, MASC can be confused with other oncocytic salivary gland tumors, including Warthin-tumor, acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. It is characterized by a monomorphic population of lesional cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant, eosinophilic foamy cytoplasm; forming papillary groups with transgressing vessels. Though, based on cytomorphology alone, the definite diagnosis can be challenging, in conjunction with available clinical clues (i.e. male patient, extra-parotid site) MASC should be included in the differential diagnosis of FNA specimens diagnosed as oncocytic salivary gland neoplasms or suspicious for AciCC. Here we present a case of MASC with FNA sampling at our institution. ","243":"The overall malignancy rate for the thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance\/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS\/FLUS) ranges from 5% to 30%. In this study, we present our institutional experience with thyroid nodules diagnosed as AUS\/FLUS and further stratified into subcategories. In addition, we also assessed the significance of various clinicopathologic factors that may influence AUS\/FLUS diagnoses and their outcomes. A search of our laboratory information system was performed to identify all in-house thyroid FNA cases diagnosed as AUS\/FLUS from 2008 to 2012. The data were collected and characterized by patient demographic information, cytopathology diagnosis with sub-classifiers and follow-up. The case cohort included 457 cases diagnosed as AUS\/FLUS. These were further sub-classified into one of six subcategories depending on the cytomorphologic findings and suspicion for or against a neoplastic process. Of the 457 cases, repeat FNA and\/or surgical follow-up was available in 363 cases. There were 182 (39.8%) cases with cytologic follow-up only; 18 (9.9%) remained as AUS\/FLUS, while 158 (86.8%) were re-classified with the majority being benign (142 cases). Histologic follow-up was available in 181 (39.6%) cases. There were 60 malignant cases confirmed by surgical excision, with an overall malignancy rate of 33.1%. The malignancy rate was 38.8% for cases with a repeat FNA versus 25.6% for cases that went directly to surgery without a repeat FNA. Papillary thyroid carcinoma accounted for 93.3% (56 cases) of the malignant cases. Based on our study, even though the malignancy rate of AUS\/FLUS cases is similar to those reported for cases diagnosed as follicular neoplasm\/suspicious for follicular neoplasm, we are of the belief that these comparable malignancy rates are a product of better clinical management and selection of patients diagnosed as AUS\/FLUS for surgery after a repeat FNA.

Currently, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) appears to be the most clinically relevant ancillary technique for cytology of bile duct strictures. The addition of FISH analysis to routine cytologic evaluation appears to yield the highest sensitivity without loss in specificity. Loss of immunohistochemical staining for the protein product of the SMAD4 gene and positive staining for mesothelin support a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical markers for endocrine and exocrine differentiation are sufficient for a diagnosis of endocrine and acinar tumors. Nuclear staining for beta-catenin supports a diagnosis of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm. Cyst fluid analysis for amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen aids in the pre-operative classification of pancreatic cysts. A number of gene mutations (KRAS, GNAS, von Hippel-Lindau, RNF43 and CTNNB1) may be of aid in the diagnosis of cystic neoplasms.

The proposed terminology scheme recommends a six-tiered system: Non-diagnostic, negative, atypical, neoplastic [benign or other], suspicious and positive. Unique to this scheme is the \"neoplastic\" category separated into \"benign\" (serous cystadenoma) or \"other\" (premalignant mucinous cysts, neuroendocrine tumors and solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs)). The positive or malignant category is reserved for high-grade, aggressive malignancies including ductal adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, pancreatoblastoma, lymphoma and metastases. Interpretation categories do not have to be used. Some pathology laboratory information systems require an interpretation category, which places the cytological diagnosis into a general category. This proposed scheme provides terminology that standardizes the category of the various diseases of the pancreas, some of which are difficult to diagnose specifically by cytology.

","256":"Computed tomography (CT) guided core needle biopsy (CT-guided CNB) is a minimally invasive, safe and effective manner of tissue sampling in many organs. The aim of our study is to determine the impact of on-site evaluation of touch imprint cytology (TIC) to minimize the number of passes required to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis. A retrospective review of all CT-guided CNBs performed during 4 year period, where pathologists were present for on-site TIC evaluation. Each case was evaluated for the number of passes required before TIC was interpreted as adequate for diagnosis. A total of 140 CT-guided CNBs were included in the study (liver, lung, kidney, sacral, paraspinal, omental, splenic and adrenal masses). Of the 140 cases, 109 were diagnosed as malignant, 28 as benign and three insufficient. In 106 cases (75.7%), the biopsies were determined adequate by TIC on the first pass, 19 cases (13%) on the second pass and 7 cases (5%) on the third pass. Only in 5 cases (3.6%), more than three passes were required before diagnostic material was obtained. Three cases (2.14%) were interpreted as inadequate both on TIC and on the final diagnosis. Of the biopsies deemed adequate on the first pass, 71% resulted in either termination of the procedure, or only one additional pass was obtained. In five cases, based on the TIC evaluation, a portion of the sample was sent for either flow cytometric analysis or cytogenetic studies. In the majority of cases, adequate material was obtained in the first pass of CT-guided CNB and once this was obtained, either no additional passes, or one additional pass was performed. This study demonstrates the utility of on-site evaluation in minimizing the number of passes required for obtaining adequate diagnostic material and for proper specimen triage for ancillary studies, which in turn decreases the risk to the patient and costs. However, tumor exhaustion in the tissue as a result of TIC is an important pitfall of the procedure, which occurred in 9 (8.2%) of our malignant cases. ","257":"Recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a Roche cobas human papillomavirus (HPV) test application as a first line primary cervical screening tool in women 25 and older introduces a new era of complex cervical screening choices. Perhaps the most surprising findings in Roche's supporting ATHENA trial data were the unexpectedly low verification bias-adjusted CIN3+ sensitivities documented by the FDA for both the proposed cobas HPV testing algorithm (58.26%) and Pap testing algorithm (42.63%). These unexpectedly low sensitivity estimates suggest intuitively that there is still considerable room for improvement in cervical screening, and available data from large systems point to routine cytology and HPV co-testing as offering the greatest protection against development of cervical cancer. Observational studies of large populations screened over time remain essential to document actual protection from development of cervical cancer with any new cervical screening options, as natural history studies and available data from large systems indicate that most CIN2\/3 cases detected in short term clinical trials would not progress to invasive cervical cancer. Interpretation of ATHENA trial data and its application to routine clinical practice is further limited by published studies which document that a significant proportion of CIN2\/3 biopsy diagnoses in the ATHENA trial could not be confirmed as accurate when evaluated with p16 immunohistochemistry and that cytology laboratory performance in the trial was notably suboptimal. ","258":"","259":"Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality, and patients often present at a late stage. More recently, advances in screening, diagnosing, and treating lung cancer have been made. For instance, greater numbers of minimally invasive procedures are being performed, and identification of lung adenocarcinoma driver mutations has led to the implementation of targeted therapies. Advances in molecular techniques enable use of scant tissue, including cytology specimens. In addition, per recently published consensus guidelines, cytology-derived cell blocks (CBs) are preferred over direct smears. Yet, limited comparison of molecular testing of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) CBs and corresponding histology specimens has been performed. This study aimed to establish concordance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) virus homolog testing between FNA CBs and histology samples from the same patients. Patients for whom molecular testing for EGFR or KRAS was performed on both FNA CBs and histology samples containing lung adenocarcinoma were identified retrospectively. Following microdissection, when necessary, concordance of EGFR and KRAS molecular testing results between FNA CBs and histology samples was evaluated. EGFR and\/or KRAS testing was performed on samples obtained from 26 patients. Concordant results were obtained for all EGFR (22\/22) and KRAS (17\/17) mutation analyses performed. Identification of mutations in lung adenocarcinomas affects clinical decision-making, and it is important that results from small samples be accurate. This study demonstrates that molecular testing on cytology CBs is as sensitive and specific as that on histology. ","260":null,"261":"The era of Open Access (OA) publication, a platform which serves to better disseminate scientific knowledge, is upon us, as more OA journals are in existence than ever before. The idea that peer-reviewed OA publication leads to higher rates of citation has been put forth and shown to be true in several publications. This is a significant benefit to authors and is in addition to another relatively less obvious but highly critical component of the OA charter, i.e. retention of the copyright by the authors in the public domain. In this study, we analyzed the citation rates of OA and traditional non-OA publications specifically for authors in the field of cytopathology. We compared the citation patterns for authors who had published in both OA and traditional non-OA peer-reviewed, scientific, cytopathology journals. Citations in an OA publication (CytoJournal) were analyzed comparatively with traditional non-OA cytopathology journals (Acta Cytologica, Cancer Cytopathology, Cytopathology, and Diagnostic Cytopathology) using the data from web of science citation analysis site (based on which the impact factors (IF) are calculated). After comparing citations per publication, as well as a time adjusted citation quotient (which takes into account the time since publication), we also analyzed the statistics after excluding the data for meeting abstracts. Total 28 authors published 314 publications as articles and meeting abstracts (25 authors after excluding the abstracts). The rate of citation and time adjusted citation quotient were higher for OA in the group where abstracts were included (P &lt; 0.05 for both). The rates were also slightly higher for OA than non-OA when the meeting abstracts were excluded, but the difference was statistically insignificant (P = 0.57 and P = 0.45). We observed that for the same author, the publications in the OA journal attained a higher rate of citation than the publications in the traditional non-OA journals in the field of cytopathology over a 5 year period (2007-2011). However, this increase was statistically insignificant if the meeting abstracts were excluded from the analysis. Overall, the rates of citation for OA and non-OA were slightly higher to comparable. ","262":"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune disease and it is more prevalent in Asians. The incidence of HT seems to be increasing in the recent times. It is one of the most common cause of hypothyroidism. The purpose of this study is to review the cytomorphologic spectrum of HT and correlate it with clinical findings including thyroid function and antibody profile. We retrospectively analyzed the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) features of 52 HT patients. Based on cytomorphologic features patients were categorized into three groups. Clinical findings including thyroid function and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody profile were correlated with cytomorphologic features in all three groups. Majority of the patients were females and in 2(nd), 3(rd) and 4(th) decades. Diffuse goiter and thyroid hypofunction were the common findings. Significant number of patients had thyroid hyperfunction. Increased lymphocytes on the background and lymphocytic infiltration of thyroid follicular cell clusters in cytology smears were diagnostic of HT. The 32 patients showed elevated titers of TPO antibodies. In the early stages and mild form of the disease, results of thyroid function and anti TPO antibodies are quite variable. HT is a disease of young and middle age and mostly occur in females. Clinical findings alone may not be adequate for definitive diagnosis. FNA is the gold standard for diagnosis. In the presence of abundant colloid, follicular hyperplasia or co-existing neoplasm, careful interpretation of cytology smears should be done. Aspiration from more than one site minimizes the diagnostic pitfalls. ","263":"","264":"In the recent past, algorithms and recommendations to standardize the morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular classification of lung cancers on cytology specimens have been proposed, and several organizations have recommended cell blocks (CBs) as the preferred modality for molecular testing. Based on the literature, there are several different techniques available for CB preparation-suggesting that there is no standard. The aim of this study was to conduct a survey of CB preparation techniques utilized in various practice settings and analyze current issues, if any. A single E-mail with a link to an electronic survey was distributed to members of the American Society of Cytopathology and other pathologists. Questions pertaining to the participants' practice setting and CBs-volume, method, quality and satisfaction-were included. Of 95 respondents, 90\/95 (94%) completed the survey and comprise the study group. Most participants practice in a community hospital\/private practice (44%) or academic center (41%). On average, 14 CBs (range 0-50; median 10) are prepared by a laboratory daily. Over 10 methods are utilized: Plasma thrombin (33%), HistoGel (27%), Cellient automated cell block system (8%) and others (31%) respectively. Forty of 90 (44%) respondents are either unsatisfied or sometimes satisfied with their CB quality, with low-cellular yield being the leading cause of dissatisfaction. There was no statistical significance between the three most common CB preparation methods and satisfaction with quality. Many are dissatisfied with their current method of CB preparation, and there is no consistent method to prepare CBs. In today's era of personalized medicine with an increasing array of molecular tests being applied to cytological specimens, there is a need for a standardized protocol for CB optimization to enhance cellularity.

Although frequent references are made to pulmonary dissemination, metastases in the pleural fluid have not been described. In this article, we report the cytologic features of metastatic SDC in the pleural fluid. The clinical history, cytomorphology and immunohistochemical features used for diagnosis are described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pleural fluid involvement by salivary duct carcinoma reported in the literature. ","267":"Tumors are distinguished from normal tissues partly by their pronounced variability of cellular and nuclear dimensions. Therefore, such factors may be an indicator to assess whether the cells are malignant or not. Exfoliative cytology is a reliable tool in assessing such changes in the uterine cervix and has been used in the oral cavity also with success. The aims and objectives of the following study were to evaluate the malignant changes by assessing the quantitative parameters such as cytoplasmic diameter, cytoplasmic perimeter and cytoplasmic area (CD, CP, CA) and nuclear diameter, nuclear perimeter and nuclear area (ND, NP, NA) and cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio in the exfoliated cells of various subtypes of oral lichen planus (OLP) using cytomorphometry. Oral exfoliated cells from nineteen cases of histologically proven OLP (1 atrophic, 13 reticular, 4 erosive and 1 plaque) and ten controls with healthy mucosa were taken and stained by Feulgen-Rossenback reaction and cytomorphometric analysis was performed using an image analysis software. The parameters taken into account were CD, CP, CA and ND, NP, NA. Furthermore CA\/NA was calculated. The parameters were statistically analyzed using the t-test. Cytomorphometric analysis of all the parameters showed no significant difference between the control group and the reticular\/plaque subtypes, whereas statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences was obtained between the control group and the atrophic\/erosive subtypes group when compared using t-test. The cytomorphometric analysis of OLP shows that erosive\/atrophic subtypes of OLP are at more risk and exfoliative cytology and cytomorphometry can be used as a tool to assess the malignant changes. ","268":"Fine-needle aspirations (FNAs) and core biopsies (CBs), with or without touch preparations (TPs), are performed to characterize pulmonary lesions. Although a positive (P) or suspicious report is sufficient for further management, the significance of unsatisfactory (U), negative (N) and atypical (A) cytological diagnoses remains uncertain. The aims of the study were to correlate U, N and A cytological diagnoses with histological and\/or clinical\/radiological follow-up and evaluate the utility of FNAs, TPs and CBs. We performed a retrospective search and examined 30 consecutive computed tomography-guided transthoracic U, N and A lung FNAs (n = 23) and TPs (n = 7) with surgical pathology (SP) (n = 17) and\/or clinical\/radiological follow-up (n = 13) and compared them to 10 SP-confirmed P FNAs, which served as controls. The 30 FNAs and TPs were from 29 patients. All 6 U specimens were scantly cellular. Granulomas, the most common specific benign cytological diagnosis, were evident in 8 (of 13) and 7 (of 11) N and A cytology cases, respectively. Histology corroborated the presence of granulomas identified on cytology. Organizing pneumonia was the second leading benign specific diagnosis (5\/17), but it was rendered on histology (n = 5) and not FNAs or TPs. Evaluation of the A cases revealed that type II pneumocytes were the source of \"atypical\", diagnoses often associated with granulomas or organizing pneumonia and lacked 3-D clusters evident in all P cases. U, N and A FNAs and TPs lacked 3-D clusters seen in carcinomas and were negative on follow-up. Granulomas and organizing pneumonia were the most common specific benign diagnoses, but the latter was recognized on histology only. In the absence of a definitive FNA result at the time of on-site assessment, a CB with a TP containing type II pneumocytes increases the likelihood of a specific benign diagnosis.

Several immunostains are being investigated to improve cancer detection; however, cytology material is limited and restricts the use of multiple immunostains. This study was designed to determine the utility of a cocktail of three stains, cytokeratin (CK20), p53 and CD44 in urine cytology samples for improving the detection of urothelial carcinoma. Urine cytology specimens with cell blocks containing adequate cytologic material between 2005 and 2010 and subsequent follow-up biopsy and\/or Urovysion test (102 cases including 29 negative, 56 atypical and 17 malignant) were included in the study and evaluated with the triple stain. Results were first validated on the positive and negative cases and then applied to the atypical cases to determine the utility in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. Based on the validation and published literature, two distinct immunoprofiles were defined - malignant, characterized by at least five CK20 and\/or p53 positive atypical cells and reactive, all other staining patterns. The malignant immunoprofile showed 88% sensitivity, 78% specificity, 74% positive predictive value (PPV) and 90% negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting urothelial carcinoma. These values improved to 95% sensitivity and 96% NPV when low-grade urothelial carcinoma cases were excluded. Our results indicate that the triple stain is an inexpensive, easy to perform test most useful for differentiating high-grade urothelial carcinoma from its mimics. However Inclusion of CD44 in the cocktail did not provide additional value and is best excluded. ","272":"Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) represents a valid alternative to biopsy in a variety of clinical settings mainly based on its simplicity and less invasive clinical approach. In some cases, morphology evaluation alone is not sufficient to manage the patients, so that the application of ancillary techniques can contribute to diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of tumor behavior. These techniques include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), in situ PCR, direct Sequencing, microarrays and proteomic methodologies. Although several recent experiences underline the superior value of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) quality mainly for advanced genomic high throughput platforms, very scant literature studied the role of the pre-analytical or analytical phases. Despite the high specificity of molecular techniques as a support for diagnosis, there is a need for an increased standardization of pre-analytical\/analytical steps such as providing appropriate clinical history, proper collection of laboratory specimens and proper preparation of samples, adequate fixative\/reagent concentrations and technical equipments. All these requirements are crucial according to the results from 42 American laboratories, which reported 0.33% of significant molecular errors with 60% of them in the pre-analytical phase. The most common error is to forget that cytological preparation requires specific molecular variables, which are different from histological specimens. Cytological samples offer the advantage of a well preserved DNA, readily extractable and reasonably stable (from 6 months to 5 years) avoiding pitfalls due to formalin-fixation. Freshly prepared, unstained direct, alcohol-fixed papanicolaou, air-dried diff-quick smears are all suitable for DNA extraction and preservation. In the specific field of thyroid FNAC, molecular analysis has been supported by the growing evidence that papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most common thyroid cancer, frequently is a diploid lesion and can display non-overlapping mutations of the v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) in 46% to 70%, cases, ret proto-oncogene (RET) in 3 to 85% and Rat Sarcoma oncogene (RAS) in 0-21% cases. Recently, several cytological papers demonstrated that the combination of morphology and molecular analysis can increase the diagnostic accuracy allowing more precise prediction of malignancy regardless of the diagnostic categories. In conclusion, the correct use of the pre-analytical-analytical steps might lead to optimal results on cytology and empower the prognostic value of molecular techniques as strong indicators of cancer for their high specificity and positive predictive value.

Positive HPV status has been associated with increased response to treatment and improved prognosis in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival. In certain instances, diagnosis is performed through fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma, often demonstrating extensive tumor necrosis. We evaluated the effect of tumor necrosis on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adequacy for HPV molecular testing. Retrospective review of the pathology files at our institution identified cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) on which HPV DNA molecular testing was performed. The cases were classified according to percent tumor necrosis into three categories (&lt;10% necrosis, 10-70% necrosis and &gt;70% necrosis) and the percentage of cases with adequate HPV DNA for molecular testing in each of the categories was compared. When available, p16 immunohistochemistry performed on the cases was compared with HPV status by molecular testing. A total of 70 cases from 67 patients were included in the study. Adequate DNA for molecular HPV testing was obtained from samples of 47 cases (67%) while samples from 23 cases (33%) were inadequate for molecular testing. Of the adequate samples, 36 (77%) were positive and 11 (23%) were negative for high-risk HPV. Adequate DNA for testing was obtained in 22 out of 33 cases showing no necrosis (67%), 10 out of 16 cases showing partial necrosis (63%) and in 13 out of 17 cases showing extensive necrosis (76%). Our study found that HPV molecular testing is not influenced by percent tumor necrosis or method by which FNA was performed. We believe that a portion of the FNA specimen obtained from head and neck lesions diagnosed as SCC during the rapid on-site evaluation should be sent for HPV DNA testing, independent of the amount of tumor necrosis, thus guaranteeing availability of specimen for HPV testing. ","275":"Digital images are increasingly being used in cytopathology. Whole-slide imaging (WSI) is a digital imaging modality that uses computerized technology to scan and convert entire cytology glass slides into digital images that can be viewed on a digital display using the image viewer software. Digital image acquisition of cytology glass slides has improved significantly over the years due to the use of liquid-based preparations and advances in WSI scanning technology such as automatic multipoint pre-scan focus technology or z-stack scanning technology. Screening cytotechnologists are responsible for every cell that is present on an imaged slide. One of the challenges users have to overcome is to establish a technique to review systematically the entire imaged slide and to dot selected abnormal or significant findings. The scope of this article is to review the current user interface technology available for virtual slide navigation when screening digital slides in cytology. WSI scanner vendors provide tools, built into the image viewer software that allow for a more systematic navigation of the virtual slides, such as auto-panning, keyboard-controlled slide navigation and track map. Annotation tools can improve communication between the screener and the final reviewer or can be used for education. The tracking functionality allows recording of the WSI navigation process and provides a mechanism for confirmation of slide coverage by the screening cytotechnologist as well as a useful tool for quality assurance. As the WSI technology matures, additional features and tools to support navigation of a cytology virtual slide are anticipated.

Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration smears of 49 consecutive patients with a final cytologic diagnosis of granulomatous lymphadenitis were reviewed. Based on cytologic features two cytologic categories were enunciated and the results were correlated with microbiologic studies and\/follow-up of minimum of 6 months. The cytologic categories did not correlate with the final clinical outcome of patients. Different patterns of granulomas observed in cytology smears do not help distinguish TB from sarcoidosis.

The first case showed abundant thin colloid with moderate amount of follicular cells arranged in a honeycombed and syncytial pattern. Some but not all the follicular cells showed enlarged round to ovoid nuclei, overlapping nuclei, few nuclear grooves and rare intranuclear inclusions. The second case showed abundant thin colloid and predominantly benign appearing follicular cells with few overlapping nuclei, enlarged round to ovoid nuclei and rare nuclear grooves. No intranuclear inclusions were identified. A review of the literature was done and the cytologic findings of MFVPTC including our two cases were tabulated. The cytologic findings showed moderate to abundant thin with focally thick colloid in 75% of cases and sheet like arrangement of follicular cells in 76%. Although nuclear features such as chromatin clearing, overlapping and grooves were present in majority of cases, the quantity varied from rare to focal. Small to prominent nucleoli were present in all of the evaluable cases. Intranuclear inclusions were seen only in 45% of patients. Hence, the cytologic features of macrofollicular variant of papillary carcinoma though present can be subtle and intranuclear inclusions may not be present always.

This study investigates the current indications for renal FNAB. Having knowledge of the specific clinico-radiologic scenario that led to the FNAB, cytopathologists are better equipped to expand or narrow down their differential diagnosis. All renal FNABs performed during a 6 year interval were retrieved. Indication for the procedure was determined from the clinical notes and radiology reports. Forty six renal FNABs were retrieved from 43 patients (14 females and 29 males with a mean age of 52 years [range, 4-81 years]). Twenty one cases (45.6%) were performed under CT-guidance and 25 cases (54.4%) under US-guidance. There were four distinct indications for renal FNAB: (1) solid renal masses with atypical radiological features or poorly characterized on imaging studies due to lack of intravenous contrast or body habitus (30.2%); (2) confirmation of radiologically suspected renal cell carcinoma in inoperable patients (advanced stage disease or poor surgical candidate status) (27.9%); (3) kidney mass in a patient with a prior history of other malignancy (27.9%); and (4) miscellaneous (drainage of abscess, indeterminate cystic lesion, urothelial carcinoma) (14.0%). 36 patients (83.7%) received a specific diagnosis based on renal FNAB cytology.

Sixty six cases of NM were identified of which 36 already had an established diagnosis of malignancy while in 30 patients, there was no previously known tumor. The most common known primary in the former group was breast followed by ovary. Single cell pattern, cellular cannibalism, moderate cytoplasm and rounded nuclei were seen in breast and lung tumors. Papillary architecture and cytoplasmic vacuolation were seen in the ovarian primaries. Melanin pigment was seen in malignant melanoma. CSF cytology is an important tool for diagnosis of NM.

Retrospective cytomorphologic analysis was performed in all cases of CaGB diagnosed by ultrasound (US) guided FNAC over a period of 2 years. A specific subtype was assigned according to WHO classification based on characteristic cytologic features. These included papillary or acinar arrangement, intra and extracellular mucin, keratin, rosettes and columnar, signet ring, atypical squamous, small, clear, spindle and giant cells. Correlation with histopathology was performed when available. A total of 541 aspirations with clinical or radiological suspicion of primary CaGB were studied. Of these, 54 aspirates were unsatisfactory. Fifty cases were negative for malignancy. Remaining 437 aspirates were positive for carcinoma. Histopathologic diagnosis was available in 32 cases. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent diagnosis in 86.7% of cases. Mucinous, signet ring, adenosquamous, squamous, small cell, mixed adenoneuroendocrine and undifferentiated carcinoma including spindle and giant cell subtypes were diagnosed identifying specific features on FNAC. Correlation with histopathology was present in all, but one case giving rise to sensitivity of 96.8%. No post-FNA complications were recorded.

The clinical features, cytological diagnoses, and surgical follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnostic performance of EUS-FNA was analyzed as compared to the diagnosis in the follow-up. The cases with discrepancies between cytological diagnosis and surgical follow-up were analyzed and diagnostic pitfalls in discrepant cases were discussed. The patients were 20 male and 28 female with ages ranging from 15 years to 81 years (mean 57 years). The tumors were solid and cystic in 41 and 7 cases, respectively, with sizes ranging from 0.5 cm to 11 cm (mean 2.7 cm). Based on cytomorphologic features and adjunct immunocytochemistry results, when performed, 38 patients (79%) were diagnosed with PNET, while a diagnosis of suspicious for PNET or a diagnosis of neoplasm with differential diagnosis including PNET was rendered in the 3 patients (6%). One case was diagnosed as mucinous cystic neoplasm (2%). The remaining 6 patients (13%) had non-diagnostic, negative or atypical diagnosis. Our data demonstrated that EUS-FNA has a relatively high sensitivity for diagnosing PNETs. Lack of additional materials for immunocytochemical studies could lead to a less definite diagnosis.

We describe a case of an 81-year-old female with esophageal perforation who presented with a left sided pleural effusion. The correct diagnosis was established in this case by observing gastrointestinal-like fluid characteristics of the thoracic drainage upon cytological and chemical analyses and the rupture was confirmed by esophagography. The cytological examination of pleural fluid revealed benign reactive squamous cells, fungal organisms, bacterial colonies, and vegetable material consistent with a ruptured esophagus.

Therefore, washings in patients with abdominopelvic tumors represent important specimens for cytologic examination. They are primarily utilized for staging ovarian cancers, although their role has decreased in staging of endometrial and cervical carcinoma. Abdominopelvic washings can be positive in a variety of pathologic conditions, including benign conditions, borderline neoplastic tumors, locally invasive tumors, or distant metastases. In a subset of cases, washings can be diagnostically challenging due to the presence of co-existing benign cells (e.g., mesothelial hyperplasia, endosalpingiosis, or endometriosis), lesions in which there is only minimal atypia (e.g., serous borderline tumors) or scant atypical cells, and the rarity of specific tumor types (e.g., mesothelioma). Ancillary studies including immunocytochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization may be required in difficult cases to resolve the diagnosis.

Various studies in the existing literature have shown a wide range of sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of cytologic diagnosis. This study was aimed at evaluating salivary gland FNAC for sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy at a tertiary care center. This study included 80 patients who underwent pre-operative FNAC followed by surgical procedure and histologic examination. The histologic diagnosis was considered as the gold standard. FNAC diagnosis was compared with the final histologic impression and concordance assessed. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of FNAC for malignant lesions were calculated. Of the 80 cases, majority (67.5%) involved the parotid gland. Eight cases (10%) were non-neoplastic lesions, comprised of sialadenitis, retention cyst and sialadenosis. Of a total of 72 neoplasms, 58 were benign and 14 were malignant salivary gland tumors. A cyto-histologic concordance of benign diagnosis was achieved in 85.7% of cases and for malignant lesions in 92.8% of the malignant tumors. FNAC showed a sensitivity of 92.8%, specificity of 93.9%, a positive predictive value of 81.2% and negative predictive value of 98.4% for malignant salivary gland tumors. There was one false-negative diagnosis and four false-positive cases diagnosed on FNAC. FNAC continues to be a reliable diagnostic technique in hands of an experienced cytopathologist. The sensitivity of diagnosis of malignant lesions is high, though the rate of tumor type-specific characterization is lower, due to variable cytomorphology.

Definitive surgery may represent optimal management of low stage tumors. Urine cytology is indispensable in the screening and follow-up of urinary tract cancer. However, cytopathological criteria for diagnosis of uPC and its differentiation from conventional urothelial carcinoma (CUC) are not well-defined. Twenty-five cases of histologically confirmed micropapillary uPC from 21 patients were compared to 25 cases of histologically confirmed high-grade CUC. In uPC cases, cell clusters were identified in 13 of 25 specimens from 10 patients. Six of the 13 specimens containing cell clusters corresponded to surgical pathology specimens in which micropapillary carcinoma accounted for at least 50% of total carcinoma. In contrast, only 1 of the 12 urine specimens devoid of cell clusters corresponded to surgical specimens in which micropapillary carcinoma accounted for at least 50% of total carcinoma. Cytomorphologic features of urinary specimens from patients with histologically confirmed micropapillary carcinoma were generally similar to those from patients with high-grade CUC, making it difficult to distinguish these entities in exfoliative urine specimens. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY: Further investigation of the core cytopathological characteristics of uPC is warranted to refine its diagnostic criteria by exfoliative urine cytology. ","293":"Constructing or renovating a laboratory can be both challenging and rewarding. UAB Cytology (UAB CY) recently undertook a project to relocate from a building constructed in 1928 to new space. UAB CY is part of an academic center that provides service to a large set of patients, support training of one cytotechnology program and one cytopathology fellowship training program and involve actively in research and scholarly activity. Our objectives were to provide a safe, aesthetically pleasing space and gain efficiencies through lean processes. The phases of any laboratory design project are Planning, Schematic Design (SD), Design Development (DD), Construction Documents (CD) and Construction. Lab personnel are most critical in the Planning phase. During this time stakeholders, relationships, budget, square footage and equipment were identified. Equipment lists, including what would be relocated, purchased new and projected for future growth ensure that utilities were matched to expected need. A chemical inventory was prepared and adequate storage space was planned. Regulatory and safety requirements were discussed. Tours and high level process flow diagrams helped architects and engineers understand the laboratory daily work. Future needs were addressed through a questionnaire which identified potential areas of growth and technological change. Throughout the project, decisions were driven by data from the planning phase. During the SD phase, objective information from the first phase was used by architects and planners to create a general floor plan. This was the basis of a series of meetings to brainstorm and suggest modifications. DD brings more detail to the plans with engineering, casework, equipment specifics, finishes. Design changes should be completed at this phase. The next phase, CD took the project from the lab purview into purely technical mode. Construction documents were used by the contractor for the bidding process and ultimately the Construction phase. The project fitted out a total of 9,000 square feet; 4,000 laboratory and 5,000 office\/support. Lab space includes areas for Prep, CT screening, sign out and Imaging. Adjacent space houses faculty offices and conferencing facilities. Transportation time was reduced (waste removal) by a Pneumatic Tube System, specimen drop window to Prep Lab and a pass thru window to the screening area. Open screening and prep areas allow visual management control. Efficiencies were gained by ergonomically placing CT Manual and Imaging microscopes and computers in close proximity, also facilitating a paperless workflow for additional savings. Logistically, closer proximity to Surgical Pathology maximized the natural synergies between the areas. Lab construction should be a systematic process based on sound principles for safety, high quality testing, and finance. Our detailed planning and design process can be a model for others undertaking similar projects. ","294":null,"295":"Urachal carcinoma is rare comprising less than 1% of all bladder carcinomas. Metastases of urachal carcinoma have been reported to meninges, brain, ovary, lung, and maxilla. Cytologic features of metastatic urachal carcinoma have not been previously reported. We present a case of metastatic urachal adenocarcinoma in bronchial brushings and review the use of immunohistochemistry in its diagnosis. A 47-year-old female was seen initially in 2007 with adenocarcinoma of the bladder dome for which she underwent partial cystectomy. She presented in 2011 with a left lung mass and mediastinal adenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed an endobronchial lesion from which brushings were obtained. These showed numerous groups of columnar cells with medium sized nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. The cells were positive for CK20 and CDX2 and negative for CK7. The cytomorphological findings were similar to those in the previous resection specimen and concurrent biopsy. This is the first case report of bronchial brushings containing metastatic urachal carcinoma. No specific immunohistochemical profile is available for its diagnosis. The consideration of a second primary was a distinct possibility in this case due to the lapse of time from primary resection, absence of local disease, and lack of regional metastases.","296":"Paragangliomas (PGLs) are uncommon tumors. Although PGLs are known to occur in the head and neck region, especially the carotid body, middle ear, and larynx, involvement of the parotid glands has not been reported. In this article, we report the fine needle aspiration features of tumor in an unusual location, presenting as a parotid gland mass, submitted to pathology for initial diagnosis. The clinical presentation, cytomorphology, and the immunohistochemical features for the diagnosis are described. To our knowledge, this is the first case of paraganglioma of the parotid gland reported in the literature.","297":"","298":"Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is now widely used as a primary tool in the evaluation of lymphadenopathy in both the mediastinum and abdomen. A sympathetic ganglion may be mistaken for an enlarged lymph node on endoscopic ultrasound and are rarely sampled as such. A 51-year-old female presented with a history of weight loss, vomiting for several months, and right upper quadrant discomfort. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed a dilated common bile duct (CBD) with a possible periampullary mass, paraaortic, and pericelial lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic disease. Endosonography revealed a 17 mm oval hypoechoic structure with distinct margins in the para-aortic, celiac axis region suggestive of an enlarged lymph node. An EUS-FNA was done. Cytology revealed ganglion cells with large oval epithelial-like cells with round nuclei and prominent nucleoli consistent with a benign sympathetic ganglion. It is crucial for the cytopathologist to be aware of the fact that the endoscopist might have sampled a celiac ganglion instead of a celiac lymph node and be able to distinguish the cytological features of a benign sympathetic ganglion from a malignant process.","299":"","300":"","301":"","302":"","303":"Previous studies demonstrated the etiological role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis. Assessing the distribution of HPV may elucidate these observations. In total, we examined 3839 specimens, of which 187 abnormally classified cervical smears were immunostained using the p16(INK4A) assay. DNA was extracted from 182 specimens, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed. Participants' socio-demographics, sexual and reproductive history, HIV status, contraceptive use, and Pap smear history were recorded. Subject ages, number of sexual partners, and age at first sexual encounter ranged from 15 to 49 years, from 1 to 37 partners, and from 13 to 34 years, respectively. P16 immunoreactivity was detected in 60.4% of cases. The distribution of epithelial lesions and P16 overexpression (bracketed) was: 28 (5) atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), 96 (50) lower grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 9 (7) atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), and 54 (51) higher grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). Ninety-four percent of HSIL expressed P16. Fifty-two percent of LSIL expressed P16. P16 expression declined from 61% (25-34 year age group) to 5% (45-49 year age group) for different age groups. HPV-DNA by PCR was detected in 94.5% of P16-positive samples. Type-specific PCR (HPV 16 and 18) was found in 12.2% and 14.5% of abnormal lesions, respectively. Younger age at first sexual encounter and HIV infection predominated in HPV type(s) 16 and\/or 18 positive subjects. This study reinforced the value of the p16(INK4A) surrogate marker in identifying women with progressive cervical disease. ","304":"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Its incidence has been increasing worldwide. Cytological examination of an effusion is often the first opportunity to diagnose MM. However, the cytological diagnosis of MM can be difficult. We have noticed that parakeratotic-like cells, with orange cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei, are present in many cases of mesothelioma on Papanicolaou-stained cytology slides. Although this cytological finding has been described previously, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic study of this finding. Our study is to determine whether the presence of small parakeratotic \/ orangeophilic cells (PK-like cells) is specific for the cytodiagnosis of mesothelioma. A total of 90 body fluid cases were selected from our archived specimens in the Cytology Section at the University of Chicago Hospital accessioned between January 2000 to November 2011. They included 30 cases of mesothelioma, 30 cases of adenocarcinoma, and 30 cases of reactive mesothelial cells. PK-like cells were present in 83% of the mesothelioma cases, 13% of the adenocarcinoma cases, and 7% of the reactive cases. Our data showed that the presence of PK-like cells has a specificity of 90%, sensitivity of 83%, positive predictive value of 81%, and negative predictive value of 84% for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma in body cavity fluids. The presence of PK-like cells in the effusion specimen, especially in pleural effusions, is a highly specific and moderately sensitive cytological feature for diagnosis of mesothelioma. ","305":"","306":"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an unusual, human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8)-associated type of lymphoma, presenting as lymphomatous effusion in body cavities, without a detectable tumor mass. It primarily affects human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, but has also been described in other immunocompromised individuals. Although PEL is a B-cell lymphoma, the neoplastic cells are usually of the 'null' phenotype by immunocytochemistry. This report describes a case of PEL with T-cell phenotype in a HIV-negative patient and reviews all the relevant cases published until now. Our patient suffered from cirrhosis associated with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and presented with a large ascitic effusion, in the absence of peripheral lymphadenopathy or solid mass within either the abdomen or the thorax. Paracentesis disclosed large lymphoma cells with anaplastic features consisting of moderate cytoplasm and single or occasionally multiple irregular nuclei with single or multiple prominent nucleoli. Immunocytochemically, these cells were negative for both CD3 and CD20, but showed a positive reaction for T-cell markers CD43 and CD45RO (VCHL-1). Furthermore, the neoplastic cells revealed strong positivity for EMA and CD30, but they lacked expression of ALK-1, TIA-1, and Perforin. The immune status for both HHV-8 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was evaluated and showed positive immunostaining only for the former. The combination of the immunohistochemistry results with the existence of a clonal rearrangement in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (identified by PCR), were compatible with the diagnosis of PEL. The presence of T-cell markers was consistent with the diagnosis of PEL with an aberrant T-cell phenotype.","307":"Rare entities in the Pap test, including neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, pose challenges due to their infrequent occurrence in the daily practice of cytology. Furthermore, these conditions give rise to important diagnostic pitfalls. Infections such as tuberculosis cervicitis may be erroneously diagnosed as carcinoma, whereas others, such as schistosomiasis, are associated with squamous cell carcinoma. These cases include granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and molluscum contagiosum diagnosed in Pap tests. Granuloma inguinale shows histiocytes that contain intracytoplasmic bacteria (Donovan bodies). Tuberculosis is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with Langhans-multinucleated giant cells. Coccidioidomycosis may show large intact or ruptured fungal spherules associated with endospores. Schistosoma haematobium is diagnosed by finding characteristic ova with a terminal spine. Molluscum contagiosum is characterized by the appearance of squamous cells with molluscum bodies. This article reviews the cytomorphology of selected rare infections and focuses on their cytomorphology, differential diagnosis, and role of ancillary diagnostic studies.","308":"Virtual microscopy (VM) is a technology in which the glass slides are converted into digital images. The main objective of this study is to determine if cellular morphology, learned through virtual microscopy, can be applied to glass slide screening. A total of 142 glass slides (61 teaching and 81 practice) of breast, thyroid, and lymph node fine needle aspiration body sites were scanned with a single focal plane (at 40X) using iScanCoreo Au (Ventana, Tuscan, AZ, USA, formerly known as BioImagene, California, USA). Six students including one distant student used these digital images to learn cellular morphology and conduct daily screening. Subsequently, all the students were tested on 10 glass slides using light microscopy (LM). At the end of the study, the students were asked to respond to an online survey on their virtual microscopy experience. The glass slide screening test scores of the participating students who were taught through VM and tested on glass slides (VMLM group) were compared with the last three classes of students who were taught through LM and tested on glass slides (LMLM group). A non-parametric statistical analysis indicated no difference (P = 0.20) in the glass screening test scores between VMLM (median = 93.5) and LMLM groups (median = 87). The survey indicated that the annotated teaching slides and access to the VM, off campus, were well appreciated by the students. Although the students preferred LM, they were able to apply the cytological criteria learned through VM to glass slide screening. Overall, VM was considered a great teaching tool. ","309":"We retrospectively studied 1338 samples of lymph nodes obtained by endoscopic and endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS and EBUS-FNAB) with an objective of characterizing the utility of this diagnostic modality in the assessment of deep-seated lymphadenopathy. The secondary aims were to establish the utility in the diagnosis of lymphoma and to determine the number of passes required to obtain adequate cellularity for flow cytometric analysis. On-site assessment was performed by a cytopathologist using Diff-Quik (American Scientific Products, McGraw Park, IL) stain. In addition, Papanicolaou and immunohistochemical stains were performed and additional samples were sent for flow cytometric analyses (n = 145). The final cytologic diagnosis was correlated with surgical pathology diagnosis and\/or clinical follow-up. In select cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with specific probes was performed on Diff-Quik smears. Both morphology as well as ancillary studies (flow cytometry or immunohistochemical stain and\/or fluorescence in situ hybridization) show that EUS and EBUS-FNA are effective techniques to detect and stage intrathoracic and intra-abdominal tumors. Operating characteristics show that these are highly sensitive (89%) and specific (100%) techniques for the diagnosis of lymphoma. At least two passes provided an average of 5.66 million cells (range, 0.12-62.32 million) for lymphoma cases. EUS and EBUS-FNA are powerful modalities to stage malignancies and at least two passes can provide adequate cells for flow cytometric analysis. We also demonstrate that fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis can be performed on Diff-Quik-stained and mounted smears.

A 42-year-old woman complained of bloody discharge and lower back pain. Imaging studies showed a tumor involving the region surrounding the urethra and cystourethroscopy showed papillary and villous tumors in the urethral diverticula. Cytology of the urine sediment showed papillary or spherical clusters of atypical cells, some of which had clear abundant cytoplasm and formed mirror ball-like clusters, suggesting adenocarcinoma. Although histological diagnosis was indeterminate by biopsy and transurethral resection (TUR) because of absence of stromal invasion, surgically resected specimen via cysturethrectomy revealed that the tumor was clear cell carcinoma. Urinary cytological findings and immunohistochemical analysis for CD15, Ki-67, and p53 might be useful for accurate diagnosis of clear cell adenocarcinoma that arises from the urethral diverticulum when sufficient materials are not available by biopsy and TUR.","312":"The distinction of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has important therapeutic implications. Napsin A is a recently developed marker, which has shown high specificity for lung tissue in the surgical pathology specimens. In this study, we have evaluated whether the use of a panel of novel multiplex cocktails of TTF-1 + Napsin A and p63 + CK5 for dual color immunostaining will improve the diagnostic accuracy of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens, usually with relatively scant microfragments of diagnostic material. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, adequately cellular FNA cell blocks with a confirmed diagnosis of either ADC (n = 22), SCC (n = 20) or poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC; n = 7), from a total of 49 consecutive cases, were studied. All these cases had subsequently confirmed diagnosis in biopsies or resection specimens. The sections were immunostained with two color methods of TTF-1 + Napsin A and p63 + CK5 multiplex cocktails. The presence of one or more unequivocal individual tumor cells with convincing brown nuclear TTF-1 and red cytoplasmic Napsin A staining, and cells with brown nuclear p63 and membranous \/ cytoplasmic CK5 staining were interpreted as 'positive'. All 20 FNA cell blocks from SCC cases were positive for dual stain p63 + CK5 and negative for dual stain TTF-1 + Napsin A. The sensitivity and specificity of the dual immunoexpressions of p63 + CK5 for SCC of lung FNAs were both 100%. All 22 ADC cases were positive with dual stain of TTF-1 + Napsin A and negative for dual stain of p63 + CK5. On follow-up of the surgical pathology specimens, 22 cases were confirmed as ADC. The sensitivity of the dual immunoexpression of TTF-1 + Napsin A for ADC of lung FNAs was 100% and the specificity was also 100%. Of the seven PDC cases, five cases that were positive for dual stain p63 + CK5 and negative for dual stain TTF-1 + Napsin A could be categorized as SCC. Two of the seven (2 \/ 7) PDC cases were positive for dual stain TTF-1 + Napsin A and negative for dual stain p63 + CK5, consistent with ADC. Simultaneous coordinate or individual immunostaining for Napsin A \/ TTF-1 in ADC and p63 \/ CK5 in SCC demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity. The panel with multiplex Napsin A \/ TTF-1 and p63 \/ CK5 dual color immunostains could specifically subcategorize PDC into ADC and SCC in lung FNA specimens. Multiplex dual color Napsin A \/ TTF-1 and p63 \/ CK5 immunostaining is especially recommended for evaluation of FNA specimens with relatively scant cellularity. ","313":"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an uncommon tumor affecting adolescents and young adults that is only rarely encountered in body fluid cytology. We report the cytological features of metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in the ascitic fluid of a 17-year-old female patient, who had presented with abdominal distention, 21 months after being diagnosed with perirectal alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The rare single neoplastic cells that were admixed with abundant reactive mesothelial cells were initially misinterpreted as reactive mesothelial cells. However, their neoplastic nature was established after a careful review of their cytological features and the performance of immunoperoxidase stains. Compared to the reactive mesothelial cells that were present in the sample, the malignant cells were smaller, with less ample and more homogenous cytoplasm. They had slightly larger, more hyperchromatic, and more frequently eccentric nuclei, with larger nucleoli. This case highlights the potential pitfall of the misinterpretation of metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells for reactive mesothelial cells. Awareness of this potential diagnostic problem and recognition of the cytomorphological features of this neoplasm in the body fluids allows the identification of malignant cells, even when they are rare and intimately associated with mesothelial cells.","314":null,"315":"It has been reported that African-Americans (AA) have a higher prevalence of overall malignancy compared to Caucasians, in the United States, yet the incidence of thyroid malignancy is half. The aim of this study is to assess the rate of malignant versus benign thyroid disease in AA from an urban-based hospital with an academic setting. Our study analyzed the AA population with respect to fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid lesions, in correlation with final surgical pathology. This is the first study of its kind to our knowledge. We retrospectively reviewed thyroid FNA cytology between January 2005 and February 2011. Consecutive FNA specimens with corresponding follow-up surgical pathology were included. The patients were categorized as African- American (AA) and Non-African-American (NAA), which included Caucasians (C), Hispanics (H), and Others (O). The FNA results were classified using the latest edition of The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBS-Thy) and the follow-up surgical pathology was used for the final categorization. We studied 258 cases: 144 AA (56%) and 114 NAA [43 C (17%), 3 H (1%), and 68 O (28%)]. The average age for AA was 51 years (range 20 - 88) and for NAA was 53 years (range 25 - 86). There were more females than males in the AA versus the NAA group (85 vs. 75%). The incidence of thyroid lesions in the FNA specimens was similar between these two populations. The distribution of benign versus malignant diagnosis on follow-up surgical pathology was examined across TBS-Thy class. Our data suggest that distribution of benign versus malignant lesions in the thyroid FNA of AA versus NAA, with follow-up surgical pathology, is comparable for TBS-Thy classes, non-diagnostic (I), benign (II), suspicious for malignancy (V), and malignant (VI) in AA versus NAA.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mediastinal lymph node revealed synchronous SLL \/ CLL and small cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine needle aspiration of the mediastinal lymph node (4R). The sample was submitted for cytopathology, immunohistochemical stains, and flow cytometry evaluation. Fine needle aspiration of the mediastinal lymph node revealed neoplastic cells, in clusters and singly, with cytological features suggestive of small cell carcinoma. The immunohistochemistry results confirmed this diagnosis. Small-to-medium, mature-appearing lymphocytes were also present in the background. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that these lymphocytes possessed an immunophenotype consistent with CLL \/ SLL. This case illustrates the importance of a pathologist's awareness of the possibility of concurrent lymphoma and metastatic carcinoma in a lymph node. When evaluating lymph nodes, pathologists must strive to identify both foreign cells and subtle lymphoid changes. As demonstrated by our case, ancillary techniques (such as immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry) can be critical to making a complete and accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis of small cell carcinoma in the enlarged lymph node, primarily harboring CLL \/ SLL, is of critical importance for decision-making and treatment purposes, in addition to having a significant adverse impact on the overall survival.

Touch preparations (TP) of these biopsies have been infrequently used. The aim of this study is to report our experience with using testicular biopsy TP for the evaluation of male infertility. A retrospective search was performed for cases of testes biopsies with concurrent TP. These cases were evaluated for clinical information, specimen adequacy, and cytological-histological correlation. A total of 39 cases were identified from men with a mean age of 34 years (range 23 to 50 years). TP slides were satisfactory for evaluation in 31 (89%) cases, and less than optimal in four due to low cellularity, obscuring blood or air drying artifact. Cytopathology showed concordance with the biopsy in almost all cases. In one discordant case where the biopsies showed no active spermatogenesis, a rare sperm were identified on the TP. TP of the testis is a helpful adjunct to biopsy because of its ability to clearly evaluate all stages of spermatogenesis. These data demonstrate that TP cytopathology of the testes in our experience has an excellent correlation with both normal testicular biopsies and those showing pathological spermatogenesis, and in rare cases may provide added benefit in evaluating the presence of spermatogenesis for male infertility. Albeit uncommon, cytopathologists may be required to identify and evaluate spermatogenic elements in cytology specimens being submitted from men with infertility.

A 54-year-old woman with proptosis and diabetes insipidus was found on imaging studies to have multiple intracranial lesions, sclerosis of both femurs and a retroperitoneal soft tissue mass. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) and a concomitant core biopsy of this abnormal retroperitoneal soft tissue revealed foamy, epithelioid and multinucleated histiocytes associated with fibrosis. The histiocytes were immunoreactive for CD68, CD163, Factor XIIIa and fascin, and negative for S100, confirming the diagnosis of ECD. ECD requires a morphologic diagnosis that fits with the appropriate clinical context.

Although sensitive, asymptomatic cysts, nonspecific symptoms, and a high threshold for positive cytology limit the specificity of the guidelines. We have assessed the value of cytology relative to symptom for predicting malignancy in IPMNs without high-risk imaging features. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical, radiological, and cytological data of 31 small branch-duct IPMNs without a MN. The cytological presence of high-grade atypical epithelial cells (HGA) was considered true positive, with a corresponding histology of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma. The performance of cytology versus symptoms was evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy. The sensitivity (0.80), specificity (0.85), and accuracy (0.84) of HGA were higher than the corresponding performance characteristics of symptoms (0.60, 0.45, and 0.48, respectively). The NPV of no HGA on cytology was &gt; 95%. Cytology is a better predictor of malignancy than symptoms, for the conservative management of small branch-duct IPMNs.

","326":"Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is an integral tool in the diagnosis and staging of malignant tumors of the lung. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples has been advocated for as a guide for assessing the accuracy and adequacy of biopsy samples. Although ROSE has proven useful for numerous sites and procedures, few studies have specifically investigated its utility in the assessment of EBUS-TBNA specimens. The intention of this study was to explore the utility of ROSE for EBUS-TBNA specimens. The pathology files at our institution were searched for all EBUS-TBNA cases performed between January 2010 and June 2010. The data points included number of sites sampled per patient, location of site(s) sampled, on-site evaluation performed, preliminary on-site diagnosis rendered, final cytologic diagnosis, surgical pathology follow-up, cell blocks, and ancillary studies performed. A total of 294 EBUS-TBNA specimens were reviewed and included in the study; 264 of 294 (90%) were lymph nodes and 30 of 294 (10%) were lung mass lesions. ROSE was performed for 140 of 294 (48%) specimens. The on-site and final diagnoses were concordant in 104 (74%) and discordant in 36 (26%) cases. Diagnostic specimens were obtained in 132 of 140 (94%) cases with on-site evaluation and 138 of 154 (90%) without on-site evaluation. The final cytologic diagnosis was malignant in 60 of 132 (45%) cases with ROSE and 46 of 138 (33%) cases without ROSE, and the final diagnosis was benign in 57 of 132 (47%) with ROSE and 82 of 138 (59%) without ROSE. A cell block was obtained in 129 of 140 (92%) cases with ROSE and 136 of 154 (88%) cases without ROSE. The data demonstrate no remarkable difference in diagnostic yield, the number of sites sampled per patient, or clinical decision making between specimens collected via EBUS-TBNA with or without ROSE.

The purpose of the present study was to analyze the utility of FNAC for multiple thyroid nodules in patients with MNG and to determine the rate of malignancy in teh nondominant nodules. Our private practice performed ultrasound-guided FNAC on 1,606 patients between February 2001 and February 1, 2010. In the MNG cases, samples were taken from the dominant nodule and from trhee suspicious \/ nonsuspicious nodules larger than 1 cm on ultrasound. Ninety-four cases were diagnosed as 'suspiciously malignant'(SUS) or 'malignant' (POS) based on FNAC. The rate of an SUS \/ POS diagnosis was 5.7% in the dominant nodules; 2.3% of the nondominant nodules had a SUS \/ POS diagnosis in FNAC (p = 0.0003). Follow-up revealed malignancy in 15 (35.7%) nondominant nodules and in 27 (64.2%) dominant nodules, with 42 MNG cases undergoing surgery. X test showed a 'p-level of 0.0003' between the percentages of SUS \/ POS diagnosis in dominanat and nondominanat nodules. It was less than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the result was regarded to be statistically significant. Nondominant nodules could harbor malignancy. The risk of malignancy in nondominant nodules in MNG should not be underestimated. We have shown that the dominant nodule in patients with MNG was in fact about 2.5 times more likely to be malignant than a nondominant nodule. The use of FNAC for nondominant nodules could enhance the likelihood of detecting malignancy in an MNG.

The purpose of this study is to examine the cytomorphological spectrum of SCC and LCNEC in body cavity serous fluids. We have 68 cases from 53 patients who had metastatic SCC or LCNEC diagnoses. All cytology slides and the available clinical data, histological follow-up, and ancillary studies were reviewed. A total of 68 cases (60 pleural, 5 peritoneal, and 3 pericardial effusions) from 53 patients with an average age of 73 years (age range 43-92 years) were reported as diagnostic or suspicious of SCC (52 cases) or LCNEC (16 cases). The primary site was lung in 56 cases, pancreas in 6 cases, and 2 cases each from cervix, colon, and the head and neck region. Of the 68 cases, 48 cases had no history of malignancy of the same type. Ancillary studies were used in 46 cases (68%) including flow cytometric studies in 5 cases. There were three predominant cytomorphological patterns observed including small-cell clusters with prominent nuclear molding (33 cases, 49%), large-cell clusters mimicking non-small-cell carcinoma (18 cases, 26%), and single-cell pattern mimicking lymphoma (17 cases, 25%). Significant apoptosis was seen in 22 cases (33%) and marked tumor cell cannibalism was seen in 11 cases (16%). Nucleoli were prominent in 16 cases (24%). The most frequent neuroendocrine markers performed were synaptophysin and chromogranin. The most common cytomorphologic patterns seen in body cavity effusions of SCC and LCNEC were small-cell clusters with nuclear molding. However, in 51% of the cases either a predominant single-cell pattern mimicking lymphoma or large-cell clusters mimicking non-small carcinoma were noted. In our experience, effusions were the first manifestation of disease in the majority of patients diagnosed with neuroendocrine carcinoma. Therefore, familiarity with the cytomorphological spectrum of neuroendocrine carcinomas in fluid cytology may help in rapidly establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing appropriate management. ","329":"Extramedullary deposits may be the presenting feature of acute myeloid leukemia. An early and accurate diagnosis on cytology will aid in correct patient management. This is especially true for patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AML M7), where bone marrow aspiration may yield only a dry tap. While cytomorphological features of myeloid sarcoma of other types are well recognized due to its rarity, there are only two case reports discussing the morphological details of megakaryoblastic differentiation on aspiration cytology. We present the case of a 25-year-old patient with extramedullary involvement of lymph node and cerebrospinal fluid by AML M7, describing in detail, the morphological features on aspiration as well as exfoliative cytology.","330":"Differentiation between reactive, but morphologically atypical, mesothelial cells and adenocarcinoma in effusions can be problematic. Elaborate immunohistochemical panels have been devised. Techniques like DNA analysis, flow\/image cytometry, and K-ras mutation analysis are research oriented and difficult to perform in routine, especially in resource-poor centers. We evaluated the efficacy of a limited two-antibody panel comprising calretinin and Ber-EP4 on cytospin and cell block preparations, in 100 effusion samples. Fifty cases of reactive mesothelial hyperplasia and 50 cases of adenocarcinoma diagnosed by cytomorphology in ascitic\/pleural fluid specimens over a 2-year period were assessed. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical\/histopathologic correlation. Cytospin smears were made in all. Cell blocks were prepared, wherever adequate fluid was available. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) for calretinin and Ber-EP4 was performed. Forty-five of the reactive effusion cases (90%) were calretinin reactive and Ber-EP4 negative. Among the adenocarcinoma cases, 49 (98%) were calretinin negative but Ber-EP4 positive. Thus, both calretinin and Ber-EP4 had a high sensitivity (90% and 98%, respectively), as well as a high specificity (100% and 86%, respectively). In the 21 reactive mesothelial cases, whose cell blocks were made, results were comparable to those on cytospin. However, of the 19 adenocarcinoma cases in which cell blocks were prepared, all were Ber-EP4 immunopositive except for three, which were positive on cytospin, implying false-negative results on cell blocks. A limited panel of two monoclonal antibodies, calretinin and Ber-EP4, may be useful in cytology, as a \"primary antibody panel\", for accurate diagnosis and patient management. Additionally, ICC can be performed easily on cytospin preparations, which gave results comparable to cell blocks in our study. ","331":"After pneumonia, cancer involving the pleura is the leading cause of exudative pleural effusion. Cytologic examination of pleural effusions is an important initial step in management of malignant effusions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the spectrum of uncommon malignant pleural effusions in a chest disease center in Turkey. A retrospective study of samples of pleural effusions submitted to Ataturk Chest Diseases and Chest Surgery Education and Research Hospital Department of Pathology between March 2005 and November 2008 was performed. Out of a total of 4684 samples reviewed 364 (7.8%) were positive for cancer cells. Of the malignant pleural effusions 295 (81%) were classified as adenocarcinoma or carcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS). Pleural effusion specimens revealing a diagnosis other than adenocarcinoma\/carcinoma NOS were: 32 (8.8%) malignant mesotheliomas, 14 (3.8%) small cell carcinomas, 13 (3.5%) hematolymphoid malignancies and 10 (2.7%) squamous cell carcinoma. Hematolymphoid malignancies included non- Hodgkin lymphoma (diffuse B large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma), multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. Despite that adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of malignant pleural effusions, there is a significant number of hematological and non-hematological uncommon causes of such effusions. Cytopathologists and clinicians must keep in mind these uncommon entities in routine practice for an accurate diagnosis. ","332":"Research and publications are critical to advancements in the quality of healthcare delivery. This article attempts to highlight the prospects and challenges of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology as a tool for research in Nigeria. Data available in local and international bibliographic databases for the period 1986-2005 (20 years) were collated and analyzed. The theme of Nigerian FNA-focused studies correlated with the recognized disease patterns in the country which are tuberculous lymphadenitis, breast tumors and Burkitt's lymphoma. The accuracy of FNA in these situations was high and comparable to the experience in developed countries. It was found that the total number of articles published during two contiguous periods (1986-1995 and 1996-2005) had increased from 5 to 18. Also, in majority of cases, the articles were not published in specialized pathology journals. The utilization of FNA is apparently lagging in Nigeria. Given its potential in resource-constrained settings, we are of the opinion that it should be used more often in clinical and translational research. ","333":"Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) of the abdominal fat pad is a minimally invasive procedure to demonstrate tissue deposits of amyloid. However, protocols to evaluate amyloid in fat pad aspirates are not standardized, especially for detecting scant amyloid in early disease. We studied abdominal fat pad aspirates from 33 randomly selected patients in whom subsequent tissue biopsy, autopsy, and\/or medical history for confirmation of amyloidosis (AL) were also available. All these cases were suspected to have early AL, but had negative results on abdominal fat pad aspirates evaluated by polarizing microscopy of Congo Red stained sections (CRPM). The results with CRPM between four reviewers were compared in 12 cases for studying inter observer reproducibility. 24 cases were also evaluated by ultrastructural study with electron microscopy (EM). Nine of thirty-three (27%) cases reported negative by polarizing microscopy had amyloidosis. Reanalysis of 12 mixed positive-negative cases, showed considerable inter-observer variability with frequent lack of agreement between four observers by CRPM alone (Cohen's Kappa index of 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.36). EM showed amyloid in the walls of small blood vessels in fibroadipose tissue in four out of nine cases (44%) with amyloidosis. In addition to poor inter-observer reproducibility, CRPM alone in cases with scant amyloid led to frequent false negative results (9 out of 9, 100%). For improved detection of AL, routine ultrastructural evaluation with EM of fat pad aspirates by evaluating at least 15 small blood vessels in the aspirated fibroadipose tissue is recommended. Given the high false negative rate for CRPM alone in early disease, routine reflex evaluation with EM is highly recommended to avert the invasive option of biopsying various organs in cases with high clinical suspicion for AL. ","334":"Metastases to the pancreas are an uncommon cause of pancreatic masses seen on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review the cytomorphology, clinical findings, and results of ancillary studies in a large series of these unusual cases. We searched our institution's pathology database for EUS-guided FNAs of the pancreas that were diagnostic of metastatic tumor over a 5-year period. The final cytologic diagnosis, results of ancillary studies, corresponding histological material, and clinical follow-up data were reviewed in these cases. A total of 1172 pancreatic EUS-guided FNAs were identified, of which 25 cases (2.1%) had a confirmed diagnosis of a pancreatic metastasis. This included 12 (48%) cases of renal cell carcinoma, 3 (12%) melanomas, 3 (12%) small cell carcinomas, and 7 (28%) other malignancies. In these metastatic tumors involving the pancreas, 20 (80%) of the lesions were solitary. Four (16%) cases had no prior history of malignancy. The average time to diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis was 5.3 years. Immunohistochemistry and special stains were performed in 22 (88%) and 9 (36%) cases, respectively. Our data shows that although metastases to the pancreas are rare, they can present as a solitary mass many years after the primary malignancy is diagnosed and can even be the first manifestation of an extrapancreatic primary in a small number of cases. It is important to consider the possibility of a metastatic lesion in the pancreas because this may require a different management than a primary pancreatic tumor.

In this retrospective study, the authors determined the utility of EBUS-TBNA biopsy in the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy at a high-volume cancer center. The pathology database was searched for all patients who had undergone EBUS-TBNA biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes over a one-year period. Cytologic diagnoses were correlated with clinical histories, subsequent resection, and clinical follow-up data. Of 928 lymph node samples, 226 (24%) were diagnosed as malignant, 4 (0.4%) were suspicious for malignancy, 9 (1%) were atypical, 640 (69%) were benign, and 47 (5%) were insufficient for evaluation. In 89 (9.6%) cases, the patients had surgical resection. There was one false positive, in which the primary tumor contained infiltrating lymphocytes, had been sampled. There were five false-negative cases, which resulted from sampling errors, including two with micrometastases. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value rates for EBUS-TBNA biopsy in the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes were 68.7% and 98.6% and 91.6% and 93.5%, respectively on a per lymph node basis. The overall clinical sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value rates after one year clinical\/radiological and histologic follow-up were 97%, 99.3%, 96.7% and 99.4%, respectively. EBUS-TBNA biopsy is a sensitive and specific method for evaluating mediastinal lymphadenopathy in patients with lung and other primary tumors. ","338":null,"339":"Solitary tracheobronchial papilloma (STBP) is a rare benign tumor that primarily involves the tracheobronchial tree. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is associated with dysplasia and a high risk of carcinoma in these lesions. The cytomorphology of STBP is not well established in the literature. Our aim is to characterize the cytomorphologic features of STBP, with histologic correlation in a series of 6 patients - 4 males and 2 females - with a mean age of 67 years (range, 53-88 years). There were 5 biopsy-proven squamous papillomas and 1 glandular papilloma. On surgical biopsy, squamous papillomas exhibited cytological atypia (4 graded mild and 1 graded moderate with focal severe dysplasia), surface erosion, and inflammation. Cytology specimens available for review included a combination of 4 fine-needle aspirations (FNAs), 2 bronchoalveolar lavages and 2 (of 3) bronchial brushings. Cytologic findings associated with squamous papillomas included atypical squamous cells and rare squamous cell resembling koilocyte in 1 bronchial brushing. Sheets of squamous cells were identified in another specimen. Several cases had a prominent background of acute inflammation, and candida was present in 1 specimen. HPV in-situ hybridization was positive in 1 case and negative in 2 cases. A p16 immunocytochemical stain performed on 1 cell block was negative. In conclusion, although STBP is a rare neoplasm, these cases may be encountered in respiratory cytology samples. FNA of papillomas yields fewer lesional cells compared to exfoliative samples. These lesions may be mistaken in cytology specimens for squamous cell carcinoma, squamous-lined cavitary lesions, an infectious (fungal) process, reactive squamous metaplasia, or oral contamination.","340":"","341":"Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), a rare, benign, self-limiting histiocytic proliferative disorder, can be encountered in both nodal and extranodal locations, and fine needle aspiration (FNA), a simple, accurate and economic tool, has been widely used for the diagnosis of superficial and deep-seated lesions. Familiarity with the cytomorphologic features of RDD is important as prognosis and treatment are quite different from other benign or malignant diseases for which it may clinically masquerade. Although large numbers of RDD cases have been reported, review of the literature has revealed 49 reported cases of RDD diagnosed by FNA. Here, we report a case of RDD with nasal and sinus involvement. The patient was seen at our institution, carrying a diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor rendered by an outside institution, based on material obtained by nasal and sinus surgical biopsies. Cervical lymph node FNA performed at our institution revealed typical features of RDD. The case, as well as a brief review of the literature and 49 RDD cases with FNA cytology, will be discussed.","342":"The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is distinguished from other hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) by its unique clinical and pathologic features. Cytological features for this tumor on fine needle aspiration (FNA) of primary tumors have been described earlier. We present here a unique case of metastatic FL-HCC diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of mediastinal adenopathy. A 32-year-old woman with a history of oral contraceptive use presented with nausea and severe abdominal pain but no ascites or stigmata of cirrhosis. She had a past history of resection of a liver lesion. Serial computed tomography scans revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and the patient was referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). A transesophageal EUS-FNA was performed and tissue was collected for cytological evaluation by an on-site pathologist with no knowledge of prior history. Based on morphology correlated with prior history received later, a final diagnosis of metastatic FL-HCC in the retrocardiac lymph node was rendered on the EUS-FNA samples. There are very few reports in the literature where a diagnosis of FL-HCC is rendered at unusual sites. This case highlights that EUS-FNA is a relatively non-invasive, rapid, accurate and effective modality in obtaining tissue from otherwise hard-to-reach areas. It also suggests that metastasis of FL-HCC can be observed in mediastinal nodes and that diagnosis based on cytological features can be rendered even when the tumor is identified at unusual locations.","343":"p16 (INK4a) (p16) is a well-recognized surrogate molecular marker for human papilloma virus (HPV) related squamous dysplasia. Our hypothesis is that the invasive interventions and related morbidities could be avoided by objective stratification of positive cytologic interpretations by p16 immunostaining of cell block sections of cytology specimens. Nuclear immunoreactivity for p16 was evaluated in cell block sections in 133 adequate cases [20 negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, 28 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 50 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 21 atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), and 14 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)] and analyzed with cervical biopsy results. (a) HSIL cytology (28): 21 (75%) were p16 positive (11 biopsies available - 92% were positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and above) and 7 (25%) were p16 negative (3 biopsies available - all showed only HPV with small atypical parakeratotic cells). (b) LSIL cytology (50): 13 (26%) cases were p16 positive (12 biopsies available - all were CIN1 or above) and 37 (74%) were p16 negative (12 biopsies available - all negative for dysplasia. However, 9 (75%) of these biopsies showed HPV). (c) ASC-H cytology (21): 14 (67%) were p16 positive (6 biopsies available - 5 showed CIN 3\/Carcinoma in situ\/Ca and 1 showed CIN 1 with possibility of under-sampling. Cytomorphologic re-review favored HSIL) and 7 (33%) were p16 negative (5 biopsies available - 3 negative for dysplasia. Remaining 2 cases - 1 positive for CIN 3 and 1 showed CIN 1 with scant ASC-H cells on cytomorphologic re-review with possibility under-sampling in cytology specimen). (d) ASCUS cytology (14): All (100%) were p16 negative on cell block sections of cervical cytology specimen. HPV testing performed in last 6 months in 7 cases was positive in 3 (43%) cases. p16 immunostaining on cell block sections of cervical cytology specimens showed distinct correlation patterns with biopsy results. Reflex p16 immunostaining of cell blocks based on the algorithmic approach to be evaluated by a multiinstitutional comprehensive prospective study is proposed. ","344":"Primary cervicovaginal melanoma is a rare malignancy associated with a high risk of recurrence. Prior studies discussing the cytomorphology of cervicovaginal melanoma have been based primarily on review of conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. The aim of this study was to evaluate cervicovaginal melanomas identified in liquid-based Pap tests, in comparison with features seen on conventional Pap smear preparation. Cases of cervicovaginal melanoma identified on Pap tests with concurrent or subsequent histopathologic confirmation were collected from the Baystate Medical Center cytopathology files and personal archives of the authors over a total period of 34 years. All cytopathology (n = 6) and the available histology slides (n = 5) were reviewed. Cases were analyzed regarding clinical, histopathologic and cytomorphological findings. A total of six cases with invasive cervicovaginal melanoma diagnosed on Pap tests were identified. Most patients were postmenopausal with contact bleeding, correlating with surface ulceration (identified in biopsy\/excision material in 5\/5 cases). Most cases had deeply invasive tumors (5\/5: modified Breslow's thickness &gt; 5 mm and Chung's level of invasion IV\/V). Pap tests included four ThinPrep and two conventional smears. Overall, ThinPrep Pap tests exhibited a higher ratio of tumor cells to background squamous cells. While all Pap tests were bloodstained, tumor diathesis was prominent only within conventional smears. Melanoma cells were present both as clusters and scattered single cells in each Pap test type. Both the preparations contained epithelioid tumor cells, whereas spindled tumor cells were seen in only two ThinPrep cases. Prominent nucleoli and binucleation of tumor cells were seen in both the preparations. Melanin pigment was identified in only ThinPrep (3\/4) cases and nuclear pseudo-inclusions in one conventional Pap smear. Cell blocks were made in three ThinPrep cases and immunocytochemistry (S-100, HMB45, Melan-A) performed on additional vial material (one ThinPrep slide and one cell block) was immunoreactive in melanoma cells. Primary cervicovaginal melanoma, a rare malignancy seen predominantly in postmenopausal women, may be successfully diagnosed in either ThinPrep Pap tests or conventional Pap smears. While ThinPrep Pap tests did not demonstrate morphological advantage over conventional smears, liquid-based cytology specimens did provide additional material for cellblock preparation and immunocytochemical evaluation in a subset of cases.

There are only a few reports of other processes identified with SLL\/CLL. The aim of this study was to review the fine needle aspiration (FNA) and touch prep (TP) diagnoses of SLL\/CLL in order to identify any coincident entities. We retrospectively reviewed all FNA and TP cytology cases between January 2005 and May 2009 with a diagnosis of SLL\/CLL to determine the presence of any coincident process. We identified 29 cases, including 23 FNAs and six TPs, from 23 patients. Ancillary studies were utilized in 97% of the cases, including flow cytometry (FC, 79%), immunohistochemistry (IHC, 55%), fluorescent in situ hybridization studies (24%) and special stains (7%). Coincident entities were identified in nine cases (31%) and included seven (28%) neoplastic entities (Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, seminoma) and two (7%) non-neoplastic entities (infection and immunoglobulin containing cells). Six cases (21%) suspicious for large cell transformation were also identified. In our review of SLL\/CLL, coincident entities were present in 31% of the cases and included a spectrum of non-neoplastic and neoplastic processes. FC was the most frequently utilized ancillary test, but IHC provided important information by excluding a mantle cell lymphoma or confirming a coincident process. Thus, cytomorphologic evaluation in these patients is important due to the high risk of a coincident process that may not be apparent by FC alone and may require clinical management.

Isolated peritoneal fluid submitted for cytologic evaluation revealed that 65% eosinophils were present in a bloody background. The patient responded to corticosteroids, with complete resolution of his ascites. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis with subserosal involvement should be added to the list of causes for eosinophils in peritoneal fluid. The finding of eosinophilic ascites, with appropriate clinical and laboratory findings, may warrant the need to perform laparoscopic intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. ","350":"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is commonly being used with increasing frequency for the pre-operative evaluation of salivary gland lesions. However, it has areas of considerable interpretational difficulties. The most frequent problems involve variations in the expected cytology of pleomorphic adenoma (PA). Salivary gland FNACs performed at Pt. JNM Medical College, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, during July 2006 to June 2007 were reviewed, and we report four cases of interesting diagnostic dilemma. As PA is the most common salivary gland neoplasm, it should always be considered and ruled out as the first differential in the diagnosis of salivary gland FNACs. In order to avoid diagnostic pitfalls, we emphasize a diagnostic approach based on the mandatory presence of all three elements of PA, i.e. 3-dimensional cohesive clusters of ductal cells, background of singly lying plasmacytoid myoepithelial cells and dense fibrillary brightly metachromatic stroma with partially obscured entrapped myoepithelial cells. To document the same, we advocate liberal use of repeat aspirations with multiple sampling performed from different parts of the tumor. Some differential diagnostic problems, e.g. carcinoma ex PA, may still however remain insolvable by cytologic means.","351":"Osteoclast-rich undifferentiated carcinoma of urinary bladder (ORUCUB) is a very rare and an unusual variant of high-grade urothelial carcinoma.

To date, only three cases of PC have been reportedly diagnosed on fine needle aspiration (FNA). Two of the reported cases were diagnosed on FNA of the cervical lymph nodes and one on FNA of the vertebral bone lesion. Herein, we present a case of PC, diagnosed on FNA of the liver lesion.

The cervical screening algorithm for benign cellular changes on the Pap smear recommends treatment of infection if indicated and a repeat Pap smear in 4 to 6 months time. If the inflammatory changes still persist, subject the patient to colposcopy. However, in practice, this is not followed, especially in developing countries like ours where proper screening protocols are not available. Hence, a good number of patients in the premalignant stage are being missed. This study was undertaken to evaluate patients with persistent inflammatory Pap smears without atypia using colposcopy. A prospective analytical study of 150 gynecologial patients with persistent inflammatory Pap smear between 2006 and 2008 in an out-patient setting. All of them were subjected to colposcopy and biopsy from the abnormal areas. The incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)\/invasive carcinoma was calculated by proportions\/percentages. The incidence of invasive carcinoma was &lt;1%. But, the incidence of pre-malignant lesions (CIN) was high (20.9%). CIN 2\/3 and carcinoma in situ were present in 6.9% of the cases. Patients with persistent inflammatory Pap smears can harbour a high proportion of CIN and hence these patients will need further evaluation. ","355":"The Bethesda system (TBS) 2001 has subdivided the category of atypical squamous cells (ASC) into: ASC-US (undetermined significance) and ASC-H (cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)). The present study is an analysis of ASC-US and ASC-H cases diagnosed in a screening program practiced in limited resource settings. During the period January 2005 to December 2008, a total of 9190 smears were received, of which 568 were unsatisfactory. Cases initially diagnosed as ASC-US (n=74) and ASC-H (n=29) on conventional cytology smears were reviewed. Biopsy and human papilloma virus (HPV) results were available in limited cases. On review, diagnosis of ASC-US was retained in 49 (66.2%) of the 74 initially diagnosed ASC-US cases. Remaining 12 cases were re-labeled as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), nine as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), three as ASC-H and one case as squamous carcinoma (SCC). Similarly, on review, diagnosis of ASC-H cases was retained in 17 of the 29 initially diagnosed ASC-H cases. Seven cases were re-labeled as NILM, three as HSIL and one case each as ASC-US and SCC. Overall, 8622 cases (96.6%) were diagnosed as NILM, 72 (0.83%) as LSIL, 121 (1.40%) as HSIL, 23 (0.26%) as SCC, 50 (0.57%) as ASC-US cases, 20 (0.23%) as ASC-H, five (0.05%) as atypical glandular cells (AGC) and two cases as adenocarcinomas. Out of 50 ASC-US cases, biopsy in 23 cases showed presence of CIN 1 in 16 cases (69.5%) and CIN 2 in one case (4.34%), while the remaining six cases were negative for CIN\/malignancy. The remaining 20 cases with unavailable biopsy results were HPV-positive. Out of 20 ASC-H cases, biopsy in 15 revealed CIN 2 and above in 11 cases (73.3%). Three cases (20%) revealed CIN 1. Critical review is helpful in further reducing the number of ASC cases. The percentage of cases with CIN 2 and above is higher with ASC-H cases. The reason for relative increase in HSILs in the present study included referral bias in the screening program. ","356":"Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia, described in 1992 by the Centers for Disease Control, is characterized by persistent CD4+ lymphocytopenia (less than 300 cells per micro-liter) in nonimmunosuppressed, HIV negative individuals, who present with atypical infections. This rare though likely undiagnosed entity is associated with chronic disseminated forms of either fungal or bacterial infections in otherwise healthy adults. We report a case of a 59-year-old male with ring-enhancing brain lesions, bilateral adrenal masses, lung and vocal cord nodules, where the diagnosis of exclusion was metastatic malignancy. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the adrenal mass and a subsequent vocal cord biopsy confirmed chronic widely disseminated blastomycosis. Flow cytometric evaluation of peripheral blood documented persistent selective CD4+ lymphocytopenia with T8 (suppressor) T-Lymphocyte count within normal range. We believe that idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia is an important etiologic factor to be considered for patients who present with mass lesions and are diagnosed by FNA with atypical fungal infections. We relate the diagnostic criteria for idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia and the importance of providing on-site triage for FNA samples for fungal studies and correlation for flow cytometry.","357":"Liquid-based cytology (LBC) cervical samples are increasingly being used to test for pathogens, including: HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Several reports have shown the accuracy of such testing on ThinPrep (TP) LBC samples. Fewer studies have evaluated SurePath (SP) LBC samples, which utilize a different specimen preservative. This study was undertaken to assess the performance of the Aptima Combo 2 Assay (AC2) for CT and GC on SP versus endocervical swab samples in our laboratory. The live pathology database of Montefiore Medical Center was searched for patients with AC2 endocervical swab specimens and SP Paps taken the same day. SP samples from CT-and\/or GC-positive endocervical swab patients and randomly selected negative patients were studied. In each case, 1.5 ml of the residual SP vial sample, which was in SP preservative and stored at room temperature, was transferred within seven days of collection to APTIMA specimen transfer tubes without any sample or patient identifiers. Blind testing with the AC2 assay was performed on the Tigris DTS System (Gen-probe, San Diego, CA). Finalized SP results were compared with the previously reported endocervical swab results for the entire group and separately for patients 25 years and younger and patients over 25 years. SP specimens from 300 patients were tested. This included 181 swab CT-positive, 12 swab GC-positive, 7 CT and GC positive and 100 randomly selected swab CT and GC negative patients. Using the endocervical swab results as the patient's infection status, AC2 assay of the SP samples showed: CT sensitivity 89.3%, CT specificity 100.0%; GC sensitivity and specificity 100.0%. CT sensitivity for patients 25 years or younger was 93.1%, versus 80.7% for patients over 25 years, a statistically significant difference (P = 0.02). Our results show that AC2 assay of 1.5 ml SP samples transferred to APTIMA specimen transfer medium within seven days is sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used to screen for CT and GC. CT sensitivity may be somewhat reduced in samples from patients over 25 years. SP specimens retained in the original SP fixative for longer time intervals also may have decreased sensitivity, due to deterioration of RNA, but this was not assessed in this study. The ability to tap the live pathology database is a valuable tool that can useful to conduct clinical studies without a costly prospective clinical trial. ","358":"Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML) or Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is an uncommon but well-defined benign self-limited clinicopathological entity. It mainly involves lymph nodes. Extranodal involvement is seen in up to 43% of cases, with the most common location in the head and neck region. Primary RDD occurring in the bone is rare with only twelve cases reported in the literature to date, all diagnosed on histology except one by fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. We report a case of RDD diagnosed by FNA cytology in a 28 year-old female presented as an osteolytic lesion of superior pubic ramus where the differential diagnosis included a sarcoma and lymphoma. Based on the cytologic findings, a diagnosis of a RDD was considered during the rapid FNA on site with no clinical history provided. The diagnosis of RDD was further confirmed by immunohistochemical stains and histology diagnosis. Our findings show that even in the absence of a clinical history, FNA is a less invasive and a very reliable tool for the diagnosis of SHML (RDD).","359":"Metastatic tumors in the breast require treatment according to origin and type of tumor. It is important to recognize these lesions in fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in order to avoid unnecessary mastectomy or non-relevant chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytological features of metastatic tumors and possible criteria that could alert us as to the possibility of a metastasis from an extra mammary malignancy. The material included 36 confirmed or suspected metastases in the breast registered in the pathology files at Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval, during 1990-2007. There were a total of 6,325 cases of malignant breast FNAC, representing 30 men and 6,295 women. Smears were evaluated for the amount of material, presence or absence of myoepithelial cells, microcalcifications, mitoses and necrotic material. All carcinomas were graded. There were seven men (7\/30 = 23.3%) and 29 women (29\/6,295 = 0.46%). The primary tumor was known in 22 cases (22\/36 = 61.1%). No other primary tumor was known and metastatic lesion was not initially suspected in 14 cases (14\/36 = 38.9%). The most common origin was lung (15\/36 = 41.7%). In five cases (5\/36 = 13.9%), the origin remained uncertain. Metastases from extra mammary sites are (relatively) common in males (23.3%). In women, metastatic lesions are rare (0.46%). A large proportion of them (88%) are high-grade adenocarcinomas and poorly differentiated carcinomas that may resemble grade 3 ductal carcinomas. Unusual clinical and\/or radiological presentation in combination with high-grade malignant cells should alert us to consider the possibility of a metastasis. ","360":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at an increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, reactive conditions and neoplasms. As a result, a broad range of conditions are frequently included in the differential diagnosis of HIV-related lesions. The clinical history of HIV infection may, however, be misleading in some cases. Illustrative cases are presented in which knowledge of a patient's HIV status proved to be misleading and increased the degree of complexity of the cytologic evaluation. Case 1 involved the fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a painful 3 cm unilateral neck mass in a 38-year-old female with generalized lymphadenopathy. Her aspirate revealed a spindle cell proliferation devoid of mycobacteria that was immunoreactive for S-100 and macrophage markers (KP-1, PGM1). Multiple noncontributory repeat procedures were performed until a final excision revealed a schwannoma. Case 2 was a CT-guided FNA of a positron emission tomography positive lung mass in a 53-year-old man. The acellular aspirate in this case contained structures resembling fungal spore forms that were negative for mucicarmine and GMS stains, as well as cryptococcal antigen immunocytochemistry. A Von Kossa stain confirmed that these pseudo-fungal structures were calcified debris. Follow up revealed multiple calcified lung and hilar node based granulomata. Case 3 involved the cytologic evaluation of pleural fluid from a 47-year-old man with Kaposi sarcoma and recurrent chylous pleural effusions. Large atypical cells identified in his effusion were concerning for primary effusion lymphoma. Subsequent pleural biopsy revealed extramedullary hematopoiesis, documenting these atypical cells as megakaryocytes. These cases demonstrate that knowledge of a patient's HIV status can be misleading in the evaluation of cytology specimens, with potential for misdiagnosis and\/or multiple procedures. To avoid this pitfall in the setting of HIV infection, common entities unrelated to HIV infection and artifacts should always be included in the differential diagnosis.","361":"South Africa has very high rates of both HIV infection and cervical pathology. The management of ASC-H is colposcopy and directed biopsy, but with so many women diagnosed with HSIL and a dearth of colposcopy centres in South Africa, women with cytologic diagnosis of ASC-H may not be prioritized for colposcopy. The aim of this study was to determine if HIV-positive women with a cytologic diagnosis of ASC-H should undergo immediate colposcopy or whether colposcopy can be delayed, within the context of an underfunded health care setting with so many competing health needs. A computer database search was performed from the archives of an NGO-administered clinic that offers comprehensive HIV care. All women with a cytologic diagnosis of ASC-H on cervical smears from September 2005 until August 2009 were identified. Histologic follow up was sought in all patients. A total of 2111 cervical smears were performed and 41 diagnosed as ASC-H (1.94%). No histologic follow up data was available in 15 cases. Follow up histologic results were as follows: three negative (11.5%), five koilocytosis and\/ or CIN1 (19.2%), ten CIN2 (38.5%) and eight CIN3 (30.8%). There were no cases of invasive carcinoma on follow up. The current appropriate management of HIV-positive women in low-resource settings with a diagnosis of ASC-H on cervical smear is colposcopy, despite the costs involved. In the future and if cost-effective in developing nations, use of novel markers may help select which HIV-positive women can be managed conservatively and which ones referred for more active treatment. More research in this regard is warranted. ","362":"One of the novel techniques utilizing fine needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis of mediastinal and lung lesions is the endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided FNA. In this study, we describe five cases which had a discrepancy between on-site evaluation and final diagnosis, or a diagnostic dilemma when rendering the preliminary diagnosis, in order to illustrate some of the diagnostic difficulties and pitfalls that can occur in EBUS FNA. A total of five EBUS FNA cases from five patients were identified in our records with a discrepancy between the rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) and final diagnosis, or that addressed a diagnostic dilemma. All of the cases had histological confirmation or follow-up. The cytomorphology in the direct smears, cell block, and immunohistochemical stains were reviewed, along with the clinical history and other available information. Two cases were identified with a nondefinitive diagnosis at ROSE that were later diagnosed as malignant (metastatic signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC)) on the final cytological diagnosis. Three additional cases were identified with a ROSE and final diagnosis of malignant (large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and two squamous cell carcinomas), but raised important diagnostic dilemmas. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing discohesive malignant cells and bland neoplasms on EBUS FNA, which may lead to a negative or a nondefinitive preliminary diagnosis. Neuroendocrine tumors can also be difficult due to the wide range of entities in the differential diagnosis, including benign lymphocytes, lymphomas, small and nonsmall cell carcinomas, and the lack of immunohistochemical stains at the time of ROSE. Finally, the background material in EBUS FNAs may be misleading and unrelated to the cells of interest. This study illustrates the cytomorphology of five EBUS FNA cases that address some of the diagnostic challenges witnessed while examining these specimens during ROSE. Many of the difficulties faced can be attributed to the baseline cellularity of the aspirates, the bronchial contamination, the difficulty identifying neoplasms with bland cytology, the wide spectrum of diseases that can occur in the mediastinum with overlapping cytomorphologic features, the mismatch between the background material and the cell populations present, and the overall unfamiliarity with these types of specimens. ","363":"Standard-of-care requires the availability of an efficient, economical and accurate on-site fine needle aspiration (FNA) service. Presence of a trained individual during the procedure ensures an improved patient care. Appropriate selection of the equipment, interaction with the clinicians and compliance with the various regulations during the procedure is essential. This is often done by an on-site FNA service. Organization and implementation of such a system in a large academic center is challenging. we reviewed the ambulatory care needs in the new Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine (PeCAM). Multiple (9) FNA sites have been established keeping in view the patient's convenience, clinic demands, various regulatory requirements and laboratory staff. Each location has dedicated FNA station with microscopes and supplies. In addition, state- ofthe -art technologies including a mobile FNA cart (Penn-A- Cart), remote specimen evaluation (TeleCyP) have been incorporated. The new set up is extremely efficient and much valued by the patients and the clinicians. It has improved patient care. With necessary investments and resources a point-of-care FNA service has been created which has improved patient care. This, albeit with certain modifications may serve as a model for FNA service. ","364":"We have implemented an interactive imaging system for the interpretation of UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to improve throughput, productivity, quality control and diagnostic accuracy. We describe the Duet imaging system, our experiences with implementation, and outline the financial investment, space requirements, information technology needs, validation, and training of cytotechnologists needed to integrate such a system into a cytology laboratory. Before purchasing the imaging system, we evaluated and validated the instrument at our facility. Implementation required slide preparation changes, IT modifications, development of training programs, and revision of job descriptions for cytotechnologists. A darkened room was built to house the automated scanning station and microscope, as well as two imaging stations. IT changes included generation of storage for archival images on the LAN, addition of external hard drives for back-up, and changes to cable connections for communication between remote locations. Training programs for cytotechnologists, and pathologists\/fellows\/residents were developed, and cytotechnologists were integrated into multiple steps of the process. The imaging system has resulted in increased productivity for pathologists, concomitant with an expanded role of cytotechnologists in multiple critical steps, including FISH, scan setup, reclassification, and initial interpretation.","365":"Lipomatous mesenchymal tumors constitute the most common type of soft tissue tumors. Well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLS) can undergo dedifferentiation to a nonlipogenic sarcoma of variable histologic grade. In the recent literature, amplification of the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene, which has a role in cell cycle control, has been successful in distinguishing WDLS from benign lesions. We present a case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), using cytomorphology and ancillary studies (immunocytochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridization). An 85-year old female presented to our institution with a firm soft tissue mass of the right buttock. The FNA showed atypical spindle cells, osteoclast-like giant cells and extracellular dense matrix material. The cell block showed cellular groups of highly atypical spindle cells with osteoid and adipose tissue. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies performed on the cell block demonstrated amplification of the MDM2 gene. In addition, the findings were morphologically compatible with the previously resected retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma with areas of osteosarcoma. This rare case illustrates the usefulness of FNA and ancillary studies in the diagnosis and subclassification of soft tissue tumors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of MDM2 FISH positivity in a liposarcoma diagnosed by FNA.","366":"Effusions, especially peritoneal, are seen in less than 2% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Since the tumor cells in RCC are bland and nondescript, the involvement of serous effusions is difficult to diagnose. An accurate recognition of malignant effusion and differentiation from reactive mesothelial cells is imperative. A 55-year-old male presented with gradually progressive ascites. Cytospin preparations from ascitic fluid showed reactive mesothelial cells admixed with few smooth-contoured clusters of cells with moderate cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleolus. He had undergone nephrectomy for papillary RCC two years earlier. Another 36-year-old man underwent left nephrectomy for suspected RCC. Intra-operative ascitic fluid was sent for cytologic examination and showed numerous reactive mesothelial cells along with few clusters of cells with scant to moderate amount of cytoplasm, vesicular nucleus and a small nucleolus. Considering the histomorphology of the primary renal tumor in both cases, a cytologic diagnosis of malignant peritoneal effusion, morphologically compatible with RCC was rendered. RCC, due to its bland cytologic features, is easily overlooked in effusions. In a known patient, the cytopathologist must be extra vigilant to pick up the few cell clusters present in the fluid preparations and differentiate them from reactive mesothelial cells. A close inspection of the cytologic features and comparison with the histopathology of the primary tumor helps in making an accurate diagnosis.","367":"Studies for liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests reveal that liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a safe and effective alternative to the conventional Pap smear. Although there is research on ThinPrep and SurePath systems, information is lacking to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of systems based on cytocentrifugation. This study is designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Shandon PapSpin (ThermoShandon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) liquid-based gynecological system. We used split-sample and direct-to-vial study design. 2,945 women referred to prophylactic check-up were enrolled in this study. Split sample design was used in 1,500 women and residual cervical cytology specimen from all these cases was placed in fluid for PapSpin preparation after performing conventional smear. The direct-to-vial study was carried out in another cohort of 1,445 women in whom the entire cervical material was investigated using only the PapSpin technique. Follow up histological diagnoses for 141 women were obtained from both study arms following 189 abnormal cytology cases. 80 LBC cases from the split sample group and 61 LBC cases in the direct-to-vial group were correlated with the histology results. The sensitivity and secificity of the conventional smear and PapSpin tests in both study arms were compared. In the split sample group, conventional smears showed a higher proportion of ASC-US (atypical cells undetermined significance): 31 (2.1%) vs 10 (0.7%) in PapSpin (P = 0.001). A higher proportion of unsatisfactory samples was found in the conventional smear group: 25 (1.7%) vs 6 (0.4%) cases (P = 0.001). In the split sample group, the sensitivity of the conventional and PapSpin tests was 68.7% vs 78.1%, and the specificity 93.8% vs 91.8%, respectively. In the direct to vial group PapSpin sensitivity was 75.9% and specificity 96.5%. The differences in sensitivity and specificity were not significant. The positive predictive values for the conventional and PapSpin methods were not different in the split sample group: 88.0% vs 86.2% and 95.7% in the direct-to-vial group. Also, no differences were found for negative predictive value (82.1, 86.8% and 80.0% respectively). PapSpin showed good qualitative results in both study arms, even after the material splitting in the first study arm, and is a good alternative to the conventional Pap smear. Additionally, the PapSpin method offers several advantages such as the opportunity to prepare duplicate slides, option for HPV DNA testing and cell block preparations from residual material. Microscopic evaluation of thinner cell preparations is less time consuming than the conventional Pap smears. ","368":"The evaluation of serous fluids by conventional one color immunocytochemistry is complex and challenging. We selected and studied 37 serous fluid cytology specimens (23 pleural, 13 peritoneal, 1 pericardial), collected over a 4-year period. They were unequivocally positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma based on clinical correlation, cytomorphology, and one color immunocytochemistry on cell block sections. 3 mum serial sections of cell blocks were immunostained by a two chromogen method (peroxidase with brown chromogen followed by alkaline phosphatase with red chromogen). Combinations evaluated were: A- vimentin followed by cytokeratin (CK) 7; B- calretinin followed by BerEP4, C- calretinin followed by CK 20. Additionally, difficulty of interpretation was evaluated on a scale of 1(easy) to 5 (difficult). Cases demonstrating decreased or complete loss of immunoreactivity with alkaline phosphatase red chromogen system were also evaluated with routine one color immunostaining by alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase individually. The pretreatments for antigen retrieval and antibody dilutions were identical to those used for conventional one color immunostaining with respective immunomarker. Combination 'A' showed correlation with the immunoreactivity pattern observed with one color immunostaining. However, the immunoreactivity of the second immunomarker was compromised in combinations B and C. In the latter group, the sections immunostained with one color alkaline phosphatase indicator system also showed weak immunoreactivity or complete loss of immunoreactivity for the corresponding second immunomarker. However, the peroxidase system showed proper immunoreactivity for those immunomarkers. Average difficulty of interpretation for the two color method was 1.06 (range- 1 to 2) as compared to 2.95 (range: 1 to 5) with the one color method. This difference was statistically significant (two-tailed P&lt;.0001, paired t test). The higher scores of difficulty were observed in cases with a paucity of tumor cells and cases with predominance of isolated tumor cells. Dual immunostaining facilitated identification of the foreign population of malignant cells in effusion fluids with objective, reproducible precision. However, due to relatively lower sensitivity of alkaline phosphatase as a second indicator system, immunoreactivity was diminished for BerEP4 and lost for CK 20. ","369":"Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a rare vascular neoplasm. An accurate radiologic diagnosis is usually difficult due to the presence of multiple nodules, simulating metastatic carcinoma. Though histologic features of this tumor are well described, cytologic reports of hepatic EH are very few in the available literature. We describe a case of a young healthy adult male who was found to have multiple hepatic masses on radiologic investigations. A guided fine needle aspiration demonstrated a poorly differentiated neoplasm. The diagnosis was made on core biopsy assisted by immunohistochemistry, which showed characteristic features of EH. He is doing well 14 months after diagnosis, without surgical excision or chemotherapy. An accurate diagnosis of hepatic EH on aspiration cytology requires an adequate specimen and awareness of its cytologic features, including discohesive atypical cells with intracytoplasmic lumina and intranuclear inclusions. Since this tumor is usually unresectable but has a favorable prognosis as compared to hepatocellular carcinoma, a correct diagnosis is essential for appropriate management and prognostication.","370":"Systemic amyloidosis (SA) has a broad nonspecific clinical presentation. Its diagnosis depends on identifying amyloid in tissues. Abdominal fat pad fine needle aspiration (FPFNA) has been suggested as a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing SA. Thirty-nine FPFNA from 38 patients (16 women and 20 men, age range 40-88 years) during a 15-year period were reviewed. Smears and cell blocks were stained with Congo red (CR). A panel of antibodies (serum amyloid protein, serum amyloid A, albumin, transthyretin, kappa light chain and lambda light chain) was used on six cell blocks from five patients. The FNA findings were correlated with clinical and histological follow-up. FPFNAs were positive, confirmed by CR in 5\/39 (13%), suspicious in 1\/39 (3%), negative in 28\/39 (72%), and insufficient for diagnosis in 5\/39 (13%) of cases. In all the positive cases, SA was confirmed within 2-16 weeks. Among the 28 negative cases, SA was diagnosed in 21, the rest were lost to follow-up. Among the insufficient cases, SA was diagnosed in four and one was lost to follow-up. Specificity was 100%, whereas sensitivity was 19%. SA typing using cell block sections was successful in three, un-interpretable in one, and negative in two cases. FPFNA for SA is not as good as previously reported. This may be due to different practice setting, level of experience, diagnostic technique, or absence of abdominal soft tissue involvement. A negative result of FPFNA does not exclude SA. Immune phenotyping of amyloid is possible on cell block. ","371":"","372":"A 51-year-old male presented with a 4-month history of abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and postprandial bloating. A CT scan showed a solitary, 5.3 x 4.4 cm, cystic lesion in the body\/tail of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography did not show communication between the pancreatic duct and the cystic lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examination revealed a 6.9 x 2.4 cm cystic lesion in the body\/tail region of the pancreas without septae or solid components. The pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic duct, and common bile duct were unremarkable. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed using a 22-gauge EchotipTM needle. Only a few drops of viscous fluid could be aspirated. Papanicolaou-stained direct smears and SurePath (Autocyte) preparations were evaluated. The direct smears were hypocellular; however, the concentration method producing liquid-based cytology preparation showed detached ciliary tufts (degenerated debris with ciliated cellular fragments of cell tops without nuclei) and occasional intact ciliated cells consistent with a ciliated foregut cyst. Although benign, the cyst was resected to alleviate the symptoms. The surgical pathology confirmed the benign preoperative interpretation of the ciliated foregut cyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pancreatic ciliated foregut cyst reported to be diagnosed preoperatively by EUS-FNA. For a proper preoperative cytologic diagnosis, the needle rinses should be processed adequately. Otherwise, these hypocellular specimens with mucin may be misinterpreted as mucinous cystic lesions.","373":"Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a human herpes virus-8 (HHV8)-associated large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma localized in body cavities and presenting as pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial lymphomatous effusions. It typically affects immunocompromised patients and usually involves only one body site. We describe herein a case of PEL affecting three body cavity sites in an immunocompetent patient. A 69-year-old HIV-negative man presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and ascites. An examination of the fluid by cytology showed large atypical lymphocytes with abundant basophilic cytoplasm, either central or eccentric nuclei having irregular outlines, and multiple prominent nucleoli. The neoplastic cells showed positive staining for CD45, CD3, HHV8 latent nuclear antigen (LNA), and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. A diagnosis of PEL was rendered. Despite chemotherapy and valganciclovir, the disease progressed to involve the pleural and pericardial cavities and the patient died 5 months following the initial diagnosis. Although PEL is a B-cell lymphoma, it is usually of null phenotype by immunohistochemistry, and can rarely aberrantly express T-cell markers, as seen in the current case. The key to the diagnosis of PEL rests on identifying HHV8 in the neoplastic cells. Therefore, restricting the term of PEL only to those cases that are HHV8 positive is important in order to differentiate PEL from other lymphomas that can present as serous effusions and that carry, in general, a more favorable prognosis than PEL.","374":"Measuring the sensitivity of screening in gynecologic cytology in real life is problematic. However, other quality measures may correlate with sensitivity, including the atypical squamous cells (ASC)\/squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) ratio. Whether these other measures can function as \"surrogate indicators\" for sensitivity and improve the assessment of sensitivity in the laboratory is not known. We compared multiple quality measures with true screening sensitivity in a variety of situations. The abnormal rate, ASC rate, and ASC\/SIL ratio were all highly correlated (r =.83 or greater) with sensitivity when the overall laboratory sensitivity was low (85%) but became less correlated (.64 or less) or uncorrelated when the screening sensitivity was higher (88% or 95%, respectively). Sensitivity was more highly correlated with the abnormal rate than the ASC\/SIL ratio at low screening sensitivity. While thresholds could be set that were highly sensitive and specific for suboptimal screening, these thresholds were often less than one standard deviation away from the mean. The correlation of the abnormal rate and the ASC\/SIL ratio with sensitivity depends on overall sensitivity. Standards to define minimum screening sensitivity can be defined, but these standards are relatively narrow. These features may limit the utility of these quality measures as surrogates for sensitivity. ","375":"","376":"Published reports have demonstrated that introduction of the ThinPrep Imaging System (Imager) to the cytology screening services has increased the detection rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). In accordance with recent clinical treatment guidelines, patients with atypical squamous or glandular cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US or AGUS) are often tested for high-risk HPV infection using the Hybrid Capture HPV DNA test. We took the opportunity to investigate whether the Imager had resulted in any significant differences in our diagnostic categories, as well as whether the Imager increased the detection of high-risk HPV-DNA-positive (HRHPV+) ASC-US or AGUS. Cytology cases with the diagnosis of ASC-US and AGUS were retrieved from the archival files of our institution during periods of 11 months prior to and 11 months after the introduction of the Imager. The total number of cases in each category was correlated with results of reflex high-risk HPV DNA testing when the latter were available. All AGUS diagnoses were correlated with subsequent biopsy follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-Square test with Yate's Correction and Fisher's Exact test. A total of 108,371 and 104,555 of ThinPrep Pap Test (TPPT) cases were reviewed during 11 months pre- and post-imager introduction. The ASC-US rate was 5.4% in the pre-Imager and 5.3% in the post-Imager period. The HPV reflex test was 38% and 34% positive respectively in the pre- and post-Imager period (P&gt;0.124). Similarly, 0.14% and 0.12% AGUS were found in the pre- and post-Imager period. The positive HPV reflex test was 14% versus 23% (P = 0.1690). The abnormal biopsy follow-up rate in the AGUS category was increased from 20.9% in the pre-Imager period to 31% in the post-Imager period (P = 0.1471). The ASCUS\/SIL ratios were 1.9 and 1.6 respectively. The ASC-US and AGUS rates did not change statistically before and after the introduction of the Imager in our cytology laboratory. Although use of the Imager did not increase detection of HPV+ ASC-US, it did appear to increase the detection rate of HPV+ AGUS and subsequent abnormal biopsy follow-up rates in all categories. However, the increase in the detection rate did not reach the point of statistical significance. ","377":"Cancer of the cervix is the most common cancer in women in Swaziland where most women never undergo cervical screening. The extremely high prevalence of HIV\/AIDS in Swaziland complicates the management of preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the current status of cervical cytology in Swaziland, its strengths and limitations. The study is a retrospective review of 12,188 conventional cervical smears received by the Central Public Health Laboratory in Swaziland from June 2004 to May 2006. Review of results showed very high rates of cytologic abnormalities with 43.2% of smears screened reported as abnormal. The percentages of abnormalities were as follows: atypical squamous cells of undermined significance (ASC-US), 19.8%; atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSILs (ASC-H), 8.8%; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 9.0%; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), 4.6%; squamous cell carcinomas, 0.5%; atypical endocervical cells, 0.6%; and atypical endometrial cells, 0.4%. Just over 5% of smears were inadequate. The highest rates of HSILs and invasive squamous carcinoma occurred in women aged 50-59 years. This study underscores the need to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions in Swaziland women. Based on studies of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in other Southern African countries, current HPV vaccines would reduce the incidence and mortality from cervical cancer in the future, but cervical screening would still be required, both for women already infected with the HPV and for HPV subtypes not covered by current vaccines. The most cost-effective combination of screening modalities such as visual inspection, HPV DNA testing, and cytology should be investigated. Cervical cancer reduction needs to be managed within the greater framework of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. ","378":"","379":"Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a common and excellent procedure for the evaluation of thyroid lesions that require surgical resection. At times, the FNAB diagnosis can be difficult, particularly of follicular-patterned lesions. Previous studies have shown that some immunohistochemical (IHC) markers may be helpful in establishing more accurate diagnosis. In this study, our goal was to evaluate four of the recently investigated markers in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid nodules on FNABs. We performed IHC staining of galectin-3, Ret oncoprotein (Ret), HBME-1, and cytokeratin 19 (CK19), on cell block sections of thyroid FNAB cases that had corresponding surgical resections. They included 44 benign lesions (37 hyperplastic or cellular nodules, HN; and 7 follicular adenomas, FA) and 27 malignant tumors (6 follicular carcinoma, FC; 19 classic papillary carcinoma, PTC; and 2 follicular variant of papillary carcinoma, FVPC). The stains were done according to the standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Statistical analysis showed that immunoexpression was significantly higher in the malignant group for all four markers. The sensitivity for positive expression for all benign lesions versus malignant tumors was as follows: 10\/44 (22.7%) versus 25\/27 (92.6%) for galectin-3; 14\/44 (31.8%) versus 23\/27 (85%) for Ret; 12\/44 (27.3%) versus 24\/27 (88.8%) for HBME-1; and 13\/44 (29.5%) versus 23\/27 (85%) for CK19. The sensitivity and specificity was highest for galectin-3 (92.6% and 77.3%, respectively) followed by HMBE-1 (88.9% and 72.7%, respectively). When combining the markers' expressions, the panel of galectin-3 + HBME-1 showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (90.7% and 75%, respectively), but this was, however, lower than galectin-3 alone (92.3% and 77.3%, respectively). We conclude that galectin-3 is the best single marker in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid lesions with the highest sensitivity and specificity. The galectin-3 + HBME-1 was the best combination for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Because they were the best two independent and combined markers, we recommend the use of the galectin-3 + HBME-1 panel to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of follicular-patterned thyroid lesions on FNABs. ","380":"Patients with cirrhosis develop ascites for physiologic reasons that are unrelated to malignant progression. However, physicians performing paracentesis in these patients, often send fluid to the cytology laboratory, sometimes specifically looking for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have investigated the diagnostic yield of these specimens. A computerized pathology database search for all ascites fluid cases submitted to the cytology laboratory at a major liver transplant center between November 2004 and April 2008 was performed. Clinical history was obtained for each case. Patients with cirrhosis, with or without HCC, were included in the study. Cytologic diagnoses were compiled and follow-up information was obtained for cases with non-negative findings. A total of 167 specimens from 133 patients ranging from 29 to 85 years of age (mean 56 years) were submitted over the said time period. The causes of cirrhosis included: alcohol - 44; Hepatitis C - 30; Hepatitis B - 6; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis - 7; cryptogenic - 18; other single causes - 6; and multifactorial (alcohol and hepatitis viruses) - 22. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was present or strongly suspected in 17 patients and had been previously resected in two others. The status of fifteen patients was post liver transplant, with recurrent liver failure. Human immunodeficiency virus was present in seven patients and eight patients had a history of non hepatic malignancies. Among the specimens, 162 were negative, two had atypical lymphocytes worked up for lymphoma, and three had atypical epithelioid cells; none was positive for HCC. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a mesothelial origin for the atypical epithelioid cells in two cases; in the third case, the patient died shortly after the specimen was collected, with no radiological evidence of HCC. Ascites fluid cytology specimens in patients with cirrhosis, even those known or suspected to have HCC, are almost always negative. Atypical cells seen in such specimens should be treated with skepticism since the likelihood that they represent peritoneal spread of HCC is low.. ","381":"The objectives were to correlate the modified fluorescent method with the conventional Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method for the detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and, also to study the efficacy and advantages of using the auramine-rhodamine stain on lymph node aspirates under fluorescent microscopy. In 108 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) presenting with lymphadenopathy, fine needle aspirations were performed. Smears from the aspirates were processed for routine cytology, the conventional ZN method, and the modified fluorescent method. The significance of the modified fluorescent method over the conventional ZN method was analyzed using the chi-square test. Out of 108 aspirates, 102 were studied and remaining 6 were excluded from the study due to diagnosis of malignancy in 4.04% (4\/6) and inadequate aspiration in 2.02% (2\/6). Among the 102 aspirates, 44.11% (45\/102) were positive for AFB on the conventional ZN method, 58.9% (60\/102) were indicative of TB on cytology, while the smear positive increased to 81.37% (83\/102) on the modified fluorescent method. Fluorescent microscopy has the advantage of speed and ease of screening, and reduces observer fatigue. The modified fluorescent method was found to be more advantageous than routine cytology and conventional ZN method, particularly in paucibacillary cases. The bacillary positivity rates were higher in the modified fluorescent method than in the ZN method. Hence, the modified fluorescent method can be an adjuvant when used with routine cytology for the identification of AFB. ","382":"","383":"The reliability of patient history and clinical information on Pap test requisitions has been questioned but not previously objectively determined. The effect of incomplete\/inaccurate information on quality of patient care has not been previously quantified. Our objectives were (1) to find out how clinicians and their assistants viewed the requisition slip, and whether they understood the reasons for supplying the information requested, (2) to measure the completeness and accuracy of information on the requisition slips, and (3) to determine whether the clinical information and patient history provided on Pap test requisitions could be relied upon to accurately assign a Pap test to the laboratory's \"high-risk rescreen\" pool. Clinicians and their assistants were surveyed. A total of 899 consecutive Pap test requisition slips were reviewed. Patient history and clinical information from the slips were compared to data from our laboratory information system and\/or electronic patient medical records. Most survey respondents felt that proper completion of requisitions was important, but only 17% of clinicians and less staff realized that negative high-risk Pap tests underwent a quality assurance rescreen. Clinicians and\/or staff recorded the last menstrual period, specimen source, and clinical information on the requisition slips 96%, 97%, and 88% of the time, respectively. Of 695 Pap tests with applicable computerized records, 171 (25%) qualified for high-risk rescreen based upon information provided on the requisition slip alone. An additional 52 Pap tests (7%), or 23% of the total high-risk Pap tests were discovered to be of high risk only after review of the electronic records. Clinicians and staff were receptive to discussions concerning the completion of requisition slips, but laboratory expectations could be better communicated. Requisition slips were properly completed with a high frequency, but the check boxes did not elicit all the information expected, so revision was necessary. The high accuracy of the completion of requisition slips permitted 77% of high-risk Pap tests to be identified via the requisition slip alone. Our findings challenge the conventional anecdotal impressions of \"notoriously unreliable\" information on Pap test requisition slips, but our experience may not be applicable to other settings. ","384":"Penile neoplasms are rare and can be primary or represent metastasis or local recurrence. The most common primary cancer of the penis is squamous cell carcinoma, accounting for 95% of all cancers. In spite of the rich vascularity of the organ, penile metastases are uncommon. Cutaneous metastasis of urothelial carcinoma (UC) is extremely rare and generally accepted as the late manifestation of a systemic spread. By 1998, approximately 500 cases of penile metastasis had been reported worldwide. However, only few case reports and series of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of penile tumors have been documented. We report a case of penile metastasis from UC diagnosed by FNAC and describe the cytomorphological findings with an emphasis on cercariform cells. Although not commonly used, FNA of penile nodules can be effective in diagnosing recurrence or metastasis and avoiding surgical procedures, thus being an excellent initial procedure in the diagnostic approach.","385":"Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a simple, sensitive, quick and inexpensive method in which operator experience is essential for obtaining the best results. A descriptive study in which the aspiration biopsy cases of the Pathology and Cytopathology Service of the University Hospital of the UANL (2003-2005) were analyzed. These were divided into three study groups: Group 1, FNAB performed by a pathologist; Group 2, FNAB performed by specialists who are not pathologists, Group 3, FNAB guided by an imaging study with immediate evaluation by a pathologist. The samples were classified as adequate and inadequate for diagnosis, the organ, the size and characteristics of the lesions were taken into consideration. A total of 1905 FNAB were included. In Group 1: 1347 were performed of which 1242 (92.2%) were adequate and 105 (7.7%) were inadequate. Of the 237 from Group 2, 178 were adequate (75.1%) and 59 inadequate (24.8%); in Group 3 there were 321 of which 283 (88.1%) were adequate and 38 (11.8%) inadequate. A statistically significant difference was found between FNAB performed by Group 1 (p&lt; 0.001) and the other groups. A multivariate analysis was done where the organ punctured, the study groups, the size and characteristics of the lesion by study group were compared, finding that the most important variable was the person who performed the procedure. The experience and training of the person performing the aspiration biopsy, as well as immediate evaluation of the material when it is guided, substantially reduces the number of inadequate samples, improving the sensitivity of the method as well as reducing the need for open biopsies to reach a diagnosis. ","386":"Death from cancer is high in Sudan, with low survival rates, as most of the patients present with advanced disease. Most patients receive high and repeated doses of radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using cytological evaluation to detect oral epithelial atypia amongst these patients. As a part of the continuous development in cancer therapy, this case control study was conducted in Khartoum, Sudan. Papanicolaou stained oral mucosal cells were obtained from 100 cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy (ascertained as cases), 50 cancer patients not exposed to either therapy (control 1), and 50 apparently healthy individuals (control 2). The data was analyzed by using a computer SPSS program, to obtain the Chi-square test. Without prior knowledge of the subjects' group, oral epithelial atypia was detected in 7% of the cases. Inconclusive features of cytological atypia were observed in 13% of the cases. Atypia was not observed in both the control groups. Inflammatory infiltrate and viral cytopathic effects were identified in 32% and 8% of the cases respectively. Cytological atypia, viral infections, and inflammatory infiltrates were detected after exposure to radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to assess whether or not there were benefits associated with a change from wooden spatulae to broom style samplers for those countries where conversion to LBC might not be readily available or is not fully supported. A longitudinal study was designed to compare the performance of Cervex brushes and extended-tip wooden spatulae as sampling devices for conventionally prepared cervical smears. General Practices serving the population of Hull and East Yorkshire (UK) were provided with Cervex brushes for a period of nine months to routinely collect cervical smears. The results of 66,931 cervical smear tests were compared between those practices that were using extended-tip wooden spatulae before the trial and then returned to their use afterwards, and those who were previously using Cervex samplers and continued to use them throughout. Analyses comparing both specimen inadequacy, as recorded on the standard cervical screening request form (HMR101), and also the presence of identified transformation zone (TZ) elements in smears, both indicated significant advantages associated with the Cervex brush. Inadequate smears decreased from 5.96% with extended-tip spatulae to 4.77% with Cervex brushes (p&lt;0.001) and increased back to 7.34% when practices reverted to extended-tip spatulae after nine months. Under the same conditions, the proportion of smears containing identified TZ elements increased from 50.52% to 54.75% (p&lt;0.001), before reverting to 45.47% (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, for a control group of practices using the Cervex brush throughout, inadequate smears decreased in all phases of the study, with no significant variation in TZ sampling rates. Using the Cervex brush with conventional cytology significantly decreases inadequate smears and increases TZ sampling when compared to the extended-tip spatula and can offer improved cervical screening in countries unable or unwilling to convert to LBC. ","391":"Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a popular, reliable and cost effective technique for the diagnosis of thyroid lesions. The aim of our study was to review cases of misclassified primary malignant neoplasms of the thyroid by FNA, and assess the causes of cytologic misdiagnosis and their impact on clinical management. Clinical data, FNA smears and follow-up surgical specimens of cases diagnosed with primary thyroid carcinoma were reviewed. Of the 365 cases with a malignant diagnosis by FNA over a period of 11 years, nine (2.4 %) were identified with discrepant histologic diagnosis with regard to the type of primary thyroid malignancy. In addition, four cases were added from the consultation files of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Areas of difficulty contributing to misclassification included overlapping cytologic features (n = 6), rarity of tumors (n = 3), and sampling limitations (n = 4). Of the 13 cases, 12 underwent total or near total thyroidectomy and one patient had concurrent surgical biopsy. Measurement of serum calcitonin levels in one case, with an initial cytologic diagnosis of medullary carcinoma, prevented unnecessary lymph node dissection. Misclassification of medullary carcinoma as papillary carcinoma precluded lymph node dissection in one case. Further management decisions were based on the final histologic diagnosis and did not require additional surgery. Two cases of undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinoma were misdiagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both patients received total thyroidectomies, which may not otherwise have been performed. A small subset of primary malignant neoplasms of the thyroid may be misclassified with regard to the type of malignancy on FNA. The majority of primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed on FNA require thyroidectomy. However, initial cytologic misclassification of medullary carcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma as other malignant neoplasms or vice versa may have an impact on clinical management. ","392":"Histological diversity is the hallmark of pleomorphic adenoma, the most common salivary gland tumor. It may cause difficulty in cytological interpretation, due to limited and selective sampling. A 16-year-old female patient presented with right cheek swelling. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed squamous cells, basaloid cells, and foamy cells, along with extracellular keratin and foreign body giant cells. Characteristic metachromatic fibrillary chondromyxoid stroma, which is usually seen in pleomorphic adenoma, was not seen in the aspirate. A diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma was given on cytology. Subsequent resection revealed an encapsulated pleomorphic adenoma, with extensive squamous metaplasia and appendageal differentiation on histology. This case illustrates that pleomorphic adenoma with squamous metaplasia presents a potential for misinterpretation as mucoepidermoid carcinoma on cytology. We discuss the various pitfalls and the features that are helpful in distinguishing these two lesions. ","393":"Here we examine the diagnostic utility of the US Food And Drug Administration (FDA) approved Spatula + endocervical brush combination for the BD SurePath Pap Test (SPPT) and compare it to SPPT collection with the broom alone or to an off-label combination of broom + EC brush. This question is important due to lingering concerns over the value of EC detection to a satisfactory Pap test. 20,125 SPPT vials were examined for the collection devices contained. The SPPT collection device combinations allowed were: Rovers Cervex-Brush (broom, FDA approved), Medscand Pap Perfect Spatula + Medscand CytoBrush Plus GT (spatula + GT brush, FDA approved) or Rovers Cervex-Brush + Surgipath C-E Brush (broom + CE brush, off label). Examination of SPPT vials revealed 11,130 collected with the broom, 4,687 collected with the spatula + GT brush and 2,921 collected with the broom + CE brush. Absence of an endocervical\/transformation zone was seen in 22.86% of broom cases, 13.10% of spatula + GT brush cases (p= 0.00005 vs broom) and 10.17% of broom + CE brush cases (p= 0.00005 vs broom, p= 0.00005 vs spatula + GT brush). Importantly, LSIL detection was: broom 2.99%; spatula + GT brush 2.45% (p= 0.053 vs broom); broom + CE brush 4.18% (p= 0.034 vs broom, p= 0.0001 vs spatula + GT brush). When broom + brush combination is compared to broom alone or to spatula + GT brush, the broom + CE brush combination better sampled the endocervical\/transformation zone and increased LSIL detection. ","394":"Automated screening of Papanicolaou tests (Pap tests) improves the productivity of cytopathology laboratories. The ThinPrep Imaging System (TIS) has been widely adopted primarily for this reason for use on ThinPrep Pap tests (TPPT). However, TIS may also influence the interpretation of Pap tests, leading to changes in the frequency of various interpretive categories. The effect of the TIS on rates of TPPT interpretation as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is of concern because any shift in the frequency of ASC-US will alter the sensitivity and specificity of the Pap test. We have sought to determine whether automated screening of TPPT has altered ASC-US rates in our institution when compared with manual screening (MS) of TPPT. A computerized search for all ASC-US with reflex Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing over a one-year-period (7\/1\/06 to 6\/30\/07) was conducted. Cases included both TPPT screened utilizing TIS and screened manually. HPV test results for both groups were recorded. Pertinent follow-up cervical cytology and histology results were retrieved for the period extending to 11\/30\/07. Automated screening was in clinical use for 10 months prior to the start of the study. Automated screening was performed on 23,103 TPPT, of which 977 (4.23%) were interpreted as ASC-US. Over the same period, MS was performed on 45,789 TPPT, of which 1924 (4.20%) were interpreted as ASC-US. Reflex HPV testing was positive for high risk (HR) types in 47.4% of the TIS cases and 50.2% of MS cases. Follow-up cervical dysplasia found by colposcopy was also distributed proportionally between the two groups. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was found on follow-up biopsy of 20.1% of the TIS cases (5.2% CIN 2\/3) and 21.2% of MS cases (5.1% CIN 2\/3). None of these differences were statistically significant. Use of the ThinPrep Imaging System did not appreciably change ASC-US rates or follow-up reflex HPV test results in our laboratory. This demonstrates that the benefits of automated screening may be obtained without increasing the rate of referral to colposcopy for ASC-US follow-up. ","395":"To study the role of myoepithelial (ME) cells in distinguishing benign, proliferative breast diseases (PBD) and frank malignant breast lesions. In this study, histology proven 71 cases of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of palpable breast lesions were selected. There were 30 invasive carcinomas (24 infiltrating duct carcinoma and 6 infiltrating lobular carcinoma), 25 cases of benign lesion (21 fibroadenomas and 4 fibrocystic lesions) and 11 proliferative breast diseases (other than carcinoma in situ) and five cases of carcinoma in situ. The number of ME cells were estimated in respect to 1000 ductal cells. In every case at least 20 high power fields (x 40) were studied. Quantitative estimation of ME cell was correlated with the final diagnosis. Corresponding histopathology cases were also evaluated for diagnostic confirmation along with the pattern of distribution of ME cells. The ME cells were also quantitated on histopathology sections on smooth muscle actin (SMA) immunostained sections. The mean number of ME cells per 1000 ductal cells on cytology smears was 5.1 +\/- 5.5, 30.8 +\/- 25, 28.3 +\/- 20.2, and 38.4 +\/- 38.8 in malignant, carcinoma in situ, PBD and benign breast lesions respectively. The non parametric Mann Whitney test showed significant difference in number of the ME cells between benign and malignant groups (p &lt; .000), PBD and malignant groups (p &lt; .000) and carcinoma in situ and malignant group (p &lt; .001). However, it was insignificant between benign and PBD group, and PBD and carcinoma in situ (p &gt; .01). In SMA stained histopathology sections, ME cell in benign, PBD, carcinoma in situ and malignant cases were 741.12 +\/- 248, 238 +\/- 172, 121.6 +\/- 115 and 15.6 +\/- 25.1 respectively. Statistical analysis showed significantly different number of ME cell between benign versus PBD group, carcinoma in situ and malignant group. It was also significant between PBD versus malignant, and carcinoma in situ versus malignant (p &lt; .001, Mann Whitney test). However number of ME cell was not significant between PBD versus carcinoma in situ. The number of ME cell in breast lesions may be helpful in distinguishing PBD versus invasive malignant tumors on FNAC smears. However it is not helpful to distinguish benign lesions versus PBD.

The follow-up period was set from the time of cytological diagnosis to May 31st, 2007. Clinical information was obtained from retrospective review of women's medical records. The source of PBs was identified with adequate diagnostic procedures. PBs were found in six of the 201,231 Papanicolaou screening smears (0.0029%). Benign conditions (intrauterine device, inclusion ovarian cysts and ovarian cystoadenofibroma with PBs) were found in four patients. In two cases, PBs were associated with malignant cells; a bilateral ovarian malignancy was diagnosed in both cases, a serous adenocarcinoma and a psammocarcinoma. PBs in the cervicovaginal smears are a rare finding, associated more often with benign conditions than with malignancies. Moreover, to our knowledge, our case of primary ovarian psammocarcinoma is the first report in which the presence of malignant cells and PBs in the cervicovaginal and endometrial smears represents the first manifestation of disease.

The most affected anatomical sites are the posterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, adrenal gland and head and neck soft tissue. In the current literature, reports of ganglioneuroma diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration and its cytological appearance are scarce. A 5-year-old girl presented with a mass in the cervical region since birth. Laboratory routine tests were within normal limits, ultrasonography demonstrated a solid and well-circumscribed lesion in the soft tissues of the cervical region. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was carried out, and the obtained smears showed a mixture of mature ganglion cells and groups of spindle cells suggestive of schwann cell origin. A diagnosis of ganglioneuroma was suggested. Core biopsy and surgical resection confirmed this diagnosis. Congenital ganglioneuroma of the cervical region is an uncommon soft tissue benign neoplasm of neuroblastic origin, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of head and neck pediatric soft tissue tumors. Fine needle aspiration biopsy technique is a reliable method that can be used with confidence when dealing with pediatric soft tissue tumors. ","400":"Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has been rarely used in oral and oropharyngeal lesions. The goal of this study was to assess the value and accuracy of FNA biopsy in the diagnosis of oral and oropharyngeal lesions particularly in regards to discriminating benign from malignant tumors. Sixteen cases of FNA biopsies obtained of various intraoral and oropharyngeal masses or lesions performed at our institution during the eight-year period from 1998 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. The aspiration cytologic diagnoses were correlated with the histologic examination of the corresponding resected lesions. Sixteen cases of intraoral lesions evaluated by FNA biopsies during the period of 1998-2006 were reviewed. The sites of involvement were: lip 1, maxillary sinus 3, pharynx\/oropharynx 5, floor of mouth 4, buccal mucosa 2 and peritonsillar area 1. Patients' age ranged from 30 to 87 with an average of 54 years. Male to female ratio was 1:3. Cytologically, 7 cases were diagnosed as suspicious\/malignant, and 9 cases as benign (including 6 benign neoplasm, 1 atypical, and 2 reactive or \"descriptive\"). Fifteen cases had corresponding surgical resection for histologic examination, of these, 9 cases were interpreted as malignant, and 6 as benign. There were no false positive diagnoses of malignancy on FNA. Two cases were interpreted as benign or atypical cytologically, but were found to be malignant on histologic examination. FNA biopsy of intraoral and oropharyngeal masses is a valuable procedure for the initial evaluation of various lesions. It provides helpful information about these lesions and avoids hasty or unnecessary surgical biopsy. It is a rapid and relatively noninvasive procedure. Furthermore, aspiration biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis and management of these lesions, both neoplastic and non-neoplastic, and can be sometimes complemented by ancillary studies for more accurate interpretation. However, its sensitivity in the diagnosis of malignancy is lower than that of histologic samples. This is probably due to the superficial nature and small size of these lesions, the limited space for maneuvering the needle and difficulty in immobilizing the lesion to obtain adequate samples, rather than to interpretation or inherent limitations of the technique itself. ","401":"The objective of this study was to compare the utility of Thin-Prep (TP) cytologic preparation with that of Cell Block (CB) preparation in the diagnosis of thyroid lesions, mainly follicular epithelial lesions, by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Feasibility of using the TP slides for immunocytochemical stains is also discussed. A total of 126 consecutive cases of thyroid FNAB with TP slides and 128 consecutive cases of thyroid FNAB with CB slides were reviewed blindly by two cytopathologists. The presence of colloid, follicular cells, macrophages and lymphocytes\/plasma cells were recorded and scored 0-4 on each case based on TP or CB slide review. The cytologic diagnoses were grouped as follows: cyst, colloid nodule, colloid nodule with cystic change, chronic thyroiditis, atypical\/neoplastic and non-diagnostic. The TP slides had higher diagnostic rate than CB slides. The diagnostic yield was 68% of the TP slides whereas only 24% of the CB slides were diagnostic. Also, only 4 atypical\/neoplastic lesions were diagnosed on the TP slides and the corresponding direct smears, while 5 cases of atypical\/neoplastic lesions were diagnosed on the smears but could not be diagnosed on the corresponding CB slides. Additionally, the TP slides revealed cytologic features that were not observed on the direct traditional smears of the same case. In thyroid FNAB cases, TP slide preparation is superior to CB slide preparation and is more likely to have greater cellularity for diagnosis and detect atypical\/neoplastic thyroid lesions, particularly those of follicular cell origin. Furthermore, TP slides appear to detect helpful diagnostic cytologic features and should be considered complementary to, rather than replacing, direct smears. ","402":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) composed by predominant solid areas is diagnosed as a distinct variant on histological samples. Here we present a case of PTC recognized preoperatively by fine needle cytology as a solid variant. This diagnosis was made by combining cytology with the detection of the BRAFVK600-1E mutation, the molecular hallmark of the solid variant of PTC. Histological and molecular evaluation of the surgical specimen confirmed this pre-operative diagnosis. Thus combining cytology to BRAF molecular analysis is useful to refine the cytological diagnosis of this variant also on FNC specimens.","403":"The most common site for the metastasis of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid (PTC) is regional lymph nodes. Ultrasound (US) imaging may identify abnormal appearing lymph nodes, suspicious for PTC recurrence. Although fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of abnormal lymph nodes is often diagnostic of recurrence, small or cystic lymph nodes may be non-diagnostic due to lack of tumor cells. The measurement of thyroglobulin (TG) levels in FNAB specimens from lymph nodes suspicious for recurrent PTC can serve as an adjunct to the cytologic diagnosis. 115 abnormal appearing lymph nodes were aspirated under ultrasound guidance in 89 patients with history of thyroid carcinoma. In addition to obtaining material for cytologic interpretation, an additional aspirate was obtained by FNAB and rinsed in 1 ml of normal saline for TG level measurements. The cytologic diagnoses included: 35 (30%) reactive lymph node, no tumor seen (NTS), 39 (34%) PTC, 23 (20%) inadequate for evaluation due to lack of lymphoid or epithelial cells (NDX) 15 (13%) atypical\/suspicious for PTC, and 3 (3%) other (e.g. paraganglioma, poorly differentiated carcinoma and carcinoma not otherwise specified). TG levels were markedly elevated (median 312 ng\/ml; normal &lt; 10 ng\/ml) in 28 (72%) cases of PTC lymph node recurrence identified on cytology. TG measurements were also elevated in 5 lymph nodes classified as NTS and 4 NDX on cytology which resulted in 5 and 3 carcinoma diagnoses respectively on histological follow-up. Of the 9 atypical\/suspicious cases with elevated TG levels all resulted in carcinoma diagnoses on follow-up. The measurement of TG in FNAB specimens from lymph node in patients with history of PTC is useful in detecting recurrent disease, especially in cases when the specimen is known to be or likely to be inadequate for cytologic evaluation.

Its role in diagnosing soft tissue tumors (STT) has been fairly documented, as well as debated. Present study was aimed at evaluating its scope in diagnosing 127 cases of soft tissue tumors. Conventional Pap and MGG staining was available in all the cases. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed in 15 cases. Histopathological details were available in 115 cases. 50% cases were referred for a primary diagnosis, while 26.8% &amp; 22.8% cases were evaluated for recurrent and metastatic lesions, respectively. Extremities were the commonest sites. On FNAC, 101 cases (79.5%) were labeled as malignant, whereas 10 cases (7.9%) were labeled as benign. The remaining 16 cases (11%) were not categorized and were labeled as 'unsure\/not specified'. Histopathological confirmation in 115 cases, gave a diagnostic accuracy of 98%, with a positive predictive value of 98% in malignant cases and a negative predictive value of 100% in benign cases. Two cases were false positive. Among the various cytological categories, 60 cases (47.2%) were of spindle cell type, followed by 32 (25.2%) of round cell type and 14 cases (11%) of lipomatous type. Other 12 cases (9.4%) were of pleomorphic type; 7 (5.5%) cases of epithelioid type and remaining 2 cases were of myxoid type. All the round cell, pleomorphic and myxoid type of tumors were sarcomas, whereas 73.3% cases of spindle cell type were labeled as 'malignant'. Exact cytological sub typing was offered in 58 cases, with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) as the most frequently sub typed tumor. The two false positive malignant cases were of fibromatosis and a pigmented schwannoma, on biopsy. Out of 28 metastatic lesions, lymph nodes were the commonest site for metastasis, with epithelioid tumors that formed highest percentage of metastatic cases. FNAC is fairly specific and sensitive in STT diagnoses for primary, recurrent and metastatic lesions. The cytological types, especially round cell and pleomorphic sarcomas, can be quickly identified. Clinicopathological correlation with ICC as an adjunct, are valuable in exact sub typing. ","409":"The adherence to the principles of the Universal Protocol for preventing wrong site, wrong procedure and wrong person surgical or invasive procedures is a requirement for all Joint Commission accredited organizations. Fine needle aspirations are considered invasive procedures, and cytopathologists performing this procedure need to be cognizant and compliant with the requirements of this Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Protocol. This article gives background perspective on the development of the Universal Protocol. It also elaborates the JCAHO National Patients Safety Goals regarding the performance of fine needle aspirations. The compliance with the Universal Protocol for performance of fine needle aspirations is now mandated for all cytopathologists who perform fine needle aspirations and this present paper provides a guideline for fulfilling the requirements of the Universal Protocol for practicing cytopathologists.","410":"Desmoplastic melanoma is a variant of malignant melanoma that can range in appearance from sarcomatoid to scar-like. Cytomorphology of desmoplastic melanoma has been previously described on conventional smears; however, to our knowledge, detailed cytomorphology on ThinPrep has so far not been described. Herein, we describe the cytomorphology of two cases of desmoplastic melanoma on fine needle aspiration processed as ThinPrep slides and compare it to that seen on conventional smears. Pertinent immunocytochemical stains, performed on ThinPrep slides are also discussed. The first case is a woman with a history of desmoplastic melanoma of the scalp with previous local recurrences and lymph node metastasis with a new submandibular mass. The second case is a man with a previously resected desmoplastic melanoma with his first local recurrence. Conventional smears, including air-dried Diff-Quik-stained and alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained smears, demonstrated aggregates of pleomorphic spindle cells admixed with fibrous stroma and single spindle cells. In both cases, nuclei were elongated and plump with irregular nuclear contours, deep grooves, and folds. Chromatin was dark and coarse with either inconspicuous or multiple prominent nucleoli. Cytoplasm was located at the nuclear poles and was fine, wispy, and delicate. The background was clean with no evidence of necrosis or melanin pigment. Papanicolaou-stained ThinPrep slides were prepared from needle rinses and demonstrated excellent correlation of nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of single spindle cells to that seen on conventional smears with the exception of only slight decrease in nuclear size; however, nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of spindle cells embedded in stroma was markedly attenuated. Confirmatory immunostain for S-100 protein in both cases was performed on ThinPrep slides demonstrating crisp cytoplasmic staining in the spindle cells. The cytomorphology of desmoplastic melanoma shows excellent correlation between cytomorphology of single spindle cells on conventional smears and on ThinPrep slides. The major difference noted on ThinPrep slides was attenuated nuclear and cytoplasmic detail of spindle cells embedded in fibrous stoma. ","411":"Multiple Myeloma presenting as a pleural effusion is extremely rare. It is usually a late complication and is associated with a poor prognosis. A 40-year-old male presented with dyspnea and fever of six months duration. Clinical diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was considered. X-ray chest showed bilateral pleural effusion. Pleural cytology revealed numerous plasma cells, some of which were binucleated and atypical. Cytological differential diagnosis included: Myelomatous effusion and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma deposit (Immunoblastic type). Bone marrow biopsy, serum protein electrophoresis and bone scan confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma (Plasmablastic type). Myelomatous pleural effusion as an initial presentation although extremely rare, should always be considered in presence of atypical plasma cells irrespective of age. ","412":"The Pap smear is one of the modern success stories in the field of preventive medicine. Since its introduction as a screening test, there has been a dramatic reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, the search for a better screening test continues. The new technologies, including liquid-based cytology (LBC), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) testing and automated or machine-assisted screening have been introduced. However, there is continuous debate about whether society's limited resources are better spent on reaching the underserved rather than on these technologies. Another question is whether these technologies create yet another kind of disparity in delivering preventive care. For example, despite the wide use of LBC (99% of tests submitted to our laboratory are LBC), conventional Pap smears are still used to screen\/follow up some women. It is not clear why some providers continue to prefer conventional smear over LBC and what are the barriers for adopting LBC in cervical cancer screening. We hypothesize the lower cost of conventional compared to LBC Pap testing, patient's lower socio-economic indices, a patient's medical history and provider's subspecialty\/training all appear to play a role in the choice of using conventional Pap testing rather than LBC. Unintentionally, this choice results in repeat testing, delayed treatment and potentially higher costs than intended. The ultimate goal of this review article is to understand and explore possible barriers and disparities to adopting new technology in cancer screening.","413":"Clear cell sarcoma of soft parts is most commonly found associated with the tendons and aponeuroses of distal extremities in young adults with a peak incidence in the third decade. Location in the abdominal wall and in a child is very rare. A nine-year-old female child presented with a swelling in the anterior abdominal wall in the suprapubic region. Fine needle aspiration revealed predominantly discrete cells with loose clustering at places. The cytoplasm was abundant, finely granular, and eosinophilic with some cells exhibiting clear vacuolated zones. No pigment was seen. The nuclei were rounded and eccentrically placed with a striking single eosinophilic macro nucleolus present in all the cells. Taking into consideration, the history, age of the patient, location of the tumor and absence of melanin pigment, a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma was made, the differential including Clear cell sarcoma. This was subsequently confirmed on histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry The atypical presentation of the case made the cytological diagnosis rather challenging. Clear cell sarcoma should be considered when cytology of a soft-tissue tumor shows uncharacteristically high cellularity and relatively uniform cells with macronucleoli. ","414":"Primary melanoma of the vagina is an extremely rare neoplasm with approximately 250 reported cases in the world literature 1234. In its amelanotic variant this lesion may raise several differential diagnostic problems in cytological specimens 5. In this setting, the usage of thin layer cytopathological techniques (Liquid Based Preparations = LBP) may enhance the diagnostic sensitivity by permitting immunocytochemical study without having to repeat the sampling procedure. The aim of this paper is to describe the cytomorphological presentation of primary vaginal melanoma on LBP since it has not previously been reported up to now, to our knowledge. a 79-y-o female complaining of vulvar itching and yellowish vaginal discharge underwent a complete gynaecological evaluation during which a LBP cytological sample was taken from a suspicious whitish mass protruding into the vaginal lumen. A cytopathological diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma was rendered. The mass was radically excised and the patient was treated with alpha-Interferon. amelanotic melanoma may be successfully diagnosed on LBP cytological preparations. Thin layer preparations may enhance the diagnostic cytomorphological clues to its diagnosis and may permit an adequate immunocytochemical characterization of the neoplasm. ","415":"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma comprises 85% of all cases of pancreatic malignancies. From a diagnostic standpoint, these tumors are readily diagnosed by fine needle aspiration, with an accuracy of greater than 90%; however it is often difficult to ascertain whether these are primary or metastatic in nature. This study was undertaken to see the usefulness of CK19, CA19-9 and a newly described marker, SMAD4 in confirming the pancreatic origin of these tumors. Briefly, SMAD4 (DPC4) is a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 18q which has been shown to mediate the downstream effects of TGF-beta superfamily signaling, resulting in growth inhibition. The loss of SMAD4, which as been reported to occur in 55% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas may lead to up regulation of cell cycle proteins and hence increase cellular proliferation. In addition, SMAD4 has been suggested to possibly have prognostic potential, with the presence of SMAD4, indicating shorter survival after resection. Clinical data was reviewed to identify patients with proven, primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A total of 25 patients with diagnostic material from fine needle aspiration cell blocks, were retrieved from our files at Emory University Hospital. In addition cell blocks from clinically diagnosed non-pancreatic adenocarcinomas were also selected as controls for this study (10 cases of colonic adenocarcinoma, 10 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, 10 cases of breast ductal carcinoma and 10 cases of ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma). Formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from these were stained with SMAD4, CK19, and CA19-9, using pressure cooker antigen retrieval, labeled polymer HRP (DAKO), and the DAKO autostainer. Immunohistochemical staining was reviewed based on intensity (negative, low-positive, and high-positive) and percentage of cells. In primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, CK 19 showed diffuse cytoplasmic positivity in 23 of 25 cases, CA 19-9 showed apical cytoplasmic staining in all 25 cases, and SMAD4 showed nuclear staining in 20 of 25 cases. In the control group comprising of non-pancreatic adenocarcinoma SMAD4 was negative (100%) in all 10 cases of colonic and pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However 1 of 10 cases (10%) of breast and ovarian adenocarcinoma did show low positivity nuclear staining. However the expression of CA19-9 and CK19 was more variable in these different non-pancreatic malignancies. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed positive immunohistochemical staining for SMAD4 in 80%, CK19 in 100% and CA19-9 in 100% of the selected cases. These markers, when used as a panel, may confirm the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in fine needle aspiration samples, and help in differentiating from metastatic adenocarcinoma. This may help in determination of appropriate surgical and chemotherapeutic options. ","416":"This year CytoJournal celebrates the second full year of publication with its Best of CytoJournal: 2006.

We studied whether bronchial aspirates performed before biopsies (BA) and washings performed after biopsies (BW) could increase the diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. A series of 334 consecutive samples taken in patients with suspicious fiberoptic bronchoscopy findings was studied. Two hundred primary tumours were included in the study. The actual diagnosis was based on surgical tissue specimen analysis and\/or imaging techniques. The typing used was that of the 1999 WHO\/IASLC classification. The diagnosis of malignancy and tumour typing were analyzed according to the sequential (combined) or single use of tests. Malignancy was assessed by cytology in 144\/164 (87.8%) positive biopsy cases and in 174\/200 tumour cases (87.0%). BA before biopsies allowed 84.0% of cancers to be diagnosed, whereas BW after biopsies allowed 79.0% of cancers to be found (p = ns). However, combining biopsies with BW allowed 94.0% of cancers to be diagnosed, whereas 82.0% were diagnosed by biopsies alone (p &lt; 0.001). The highest diagnostic yield was obtained with the combination of BA, biopsies and BW, with 97.0% sensitivity. Exact concordance in typing was obtained in 83.8% of cases. The six surgically resected cases (3.0%) with negative cytology and biopsy results included four squamous cell carcinomas with necrotizing or fibrous surface and two adenocarcinomas, pT1 stage. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy may reach a yield of close to 100% in the diagnosis and typing of centrally located, primary lung cancers by combining bronchial aspirates, biopsies and washings. ","418":"Clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic, radionuclide and cytomorphological observations in Lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT), to define the cytological grading criteria on smears and correlation of grades with above parameters. This prospective study was conducted on 76 patients attending the Fine needle aspiration cytology clinic of a tertiary care institute in North India. The various parameters like patients' clinical presentation, thyroid antimicrosomal antibodies, hormonal profiles, radionuclide thyroid scan and thyroid ultrasound were studied. Fine needle aspiration of thyroid gland and grading of thyroiditis was done on smears. The grades were correlated with above parameters and the correlation indices were evaluated statistically. Most of the patients were females (70, 92.11%) who presented with a diffuse goiter (68, 89.47%). Hypothyroid features (56, 73.68%) and elevated TSH (75, 98.68%) were common, but radioiodide uptake was low or normal in majority of patients. Thyroid antimicrosomal antibody was elevated in 46\/70 (65.71%) patients. Cytomorphology in fine needle aspirates was diagnostic of lymphocytic thyroiditis in 75 (98.68%) patients. Most of them had grade I\/II disease by cytology. No correlation was observed between grades of cytomorphology and clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and radionuclide parameters. Despite the availability of several tests for diagnosis of LT, FNAC remains the gold standard. The grades of thyroiditis at cytology however do not correlate with clinical, biochemical, radionuclide and ultrasonographic parameters. ","419":null,"420":"Cervical smears exhibiting unequivocal features of 'low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion' (LSIL) are occasionally also admixed with some cells suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, 'high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion' (HSIL). Only a few studies, mostly reported as abstracts, have evaluated this concurrence. In this study, we evaluate the current evidence that favors a distinct category for \"LSIL, cannot exclude HSIL\" (LSIL-H), and suggest a management algorithm based on combinations of current ASCCP guidelines for related interpretations. We studied SurePath preparations of cervical specimens from various institutions during one year period. Cytohisto correlation was performed in cases with cervical biopsies submitted to our institution. The status of HPV DNA testing was also noted in some LSIL-H cases with biopsy results. Out of 77,979 cases 1,970 interpreted as LSIL (1,523), LSIL-H (146), 'atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL' (ASC-H) (109), and HSIL (192) were selected. Concurrent biopsy results were available in 40% (Total 792 cases: 557 LSIL, 88 LSIL-H, 38 ASCH, and 109 HSIL). Biopsy results were grouped into A. negative for dysplasia (ND), B. low grade (HPV, CIN1, CIN1 with HPV), and C. high grade (CIN 2 and above). The positive predictive values for various biopsy results in relation to initial cytopathologic interpretation were: a. LSIL: (557 cases): ND 32% (179), low grade 58% (323), high grade 10% (55); b. LSIL-H: (88 cases): ND 24% (21), low grade 43% (38), high grade 33% (29); c. ASCH: (38 cases): ND 32% (12), low grade- 37% (14), high grade- 31% (12); d. HSIL (109 cases): ND 5% (6), low grade 26% (28), high grade 69% (75). The patterns of cervical biopsy results in cases reported as LSIL-H were compared with that observed in cases with LSIL, ASC-H, and HSIL. 94% (32 of 34) of LSIL-H were positive for high risk (HR) HPV, 1 was negative for HR HPV but positive for low risk (LR), and 1 LSIL-H was negative for HR and LR both. LSIL-H overlapped with LSIL and ASC-H, but was distinct from HSIL. A management algorithm comparable to ASC-H and HSIL appears to be appropriate in LSIL-H cases. ","421":"Since the introduction of the liquid-based ThinPrep testing in 1996, most cytology laboratories across the country have adopted the liquid-based cytology (LBC) for Pap test screening. Subsequent to wide-spread adoption of the ThinPrep Pap test, the ThinPrep Imaging System (TIS) Cytyc Corp, Marlborough, MA was introduced to improve the accuracy and efficiency of screening interpretation. We report our initial experience with the TIS at Magee Women's Hospital. We introduced the TIS in December 2004. The imager assisted Pap test results over the first 12 months (December 2004 to December 2005) of implementation were reviewed and analyzed. Our implementation protocol included each cytotechnologist manually prescreening 200 negative slides to gain experience with the imager slides and serve as a quality check for the TIS. We re-screened 3400 slides (200 slides each for 17 cytotechnologists) manually which were initially determined to be negative using the TIS. 104,457 Pap tests were imaged on the TIS. 95,899 manually screened Pap tests, 12 months prior to the introduction of the TIS (December 2003-November 2004) are taken as the historic control group for our study. The mean ASC-US rate employing the automated imager was 8.70% [9088\/104,457]. The mean LSIL detection rate was 4.22% [4409\/104,457]. The imager did not miss any detectable high-grade lesions during these months, with a HSIL (+) detection rate of 0.68% in comparison to 0.60% by manual screening confirmed by follow-up biopsies. The difference is statistically significant with a p value of 0.022. The definition of false negative rate for purposes of this study is calculated as the number of false negative cases identified out of number of negatives re-screened. The TIS false negative rate was estimated at 0.012% [4\/3400]. The overall performance of the TIS in our lab appears to be highly satisfactory in terms of improving sensitivity in screening cervical precursor lesions. The increased accuracy of detection of HSIL indicates a positive impact of the TIS in our laboratory. ","422":"Three men and 2 women with ages ranging from 37 to 70 years, clinically and histologically confirmed solitary, palpable metastatic cancers to the thyroid (SMCT) and preoperative cytologic investigation of their thyroid lesions by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), were reviewed. Four patients were known to have a solid cancer treated by radical surgery 1 to 4 years prior [1 bronchogenic squamous cell carcinoma, 1 parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma, 1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 1 cutaneous melanoma], and 1 patient had no past history of cancer. Direct smears prepared from the patients' thyroid FNAs were fixed in 95% ethanol and stained with the Papanicolaou method. In 3 cases, immunostaining of the aspirated tumor cells with thyroglobulin antibody was performed, and in 1 case an aspiration smear was stained with commercial HMB-45 antibody. A correct cytodiagnosis of metastatic cancer to the thyroid was made in all 5 cases. In 1 patient the thyroid FNA revealed a metastatic RCC that led to the discovery of a clinically occult RCC. All 5 patients died of metastatic disease 27 to 40 months after surgical resection of their SMCTs.","423":"Myoepithelioma of the breast is a rare tumor and the cytologic features have only been described in one previous report. The present case comprises a 70 year old woman with a mammographic equivocal and ultrasonographic suspicious lesion. The aspirates were cellular and consisted mainly of single spindle or polymorphic, polygonal cells. The nuclei were generally large, ranging from 2 - &gt; 5 x RBC. Most nuclei had a distinct medium-sized nucleolus. The nuclear outlines were irregular with buds and folds. The chromatin was granular. In the background there was abundant granular metachromatic ground substance and some metachromatic stromal fragments. A few mitotic figures were found. The cytologic diagnosis was suspicious for malignancy and a metaplastic carcinoma where only the non-epithelial component had been aspirated, or a non-epithelial lesion, was suggested.Macroscopically the tumor was round, seemingly well circumscribed, firm and with a white cut surface. The lesion consisted of spindled and polygonal cells with distinct pleomorphism. There were 6-9 mitoses per high power field (HPF). The tumor infiltrated in the surrounding fatty tissue. On immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were positive for smooth muscle actin, keratin MNF 116 and vimentin. Desmin and S-100 were negative.Ultrastructurally, there were abundant tonofilaments, including globular filamentous bodies and granulated endocytoplasmic reticulum with many dilated cisterns. The histologic diagnosis was malignant myoepithelioma. The case mirrors completely the WHO definition and the previous cytological and histological descriptions of malignant myoepitheliomas in the literature which describe a spindle cell population with unequivocal nuclear atypia, metachromatic background substance and mitoses. ","424":"Hyperchromatic crowded groups (HCG), a term first introduced into the cytology literature by DeMay in 1995, are commonly observed in Pap tests and may rarely be associated with serious but difficult to interpret lesions. In this study, we specifically defined HCG as dark crowded cell groups with more than 15 cells which can be identified at 10x screening magnification. We evaluated consecutive liquid-based (Surepath) Pap tests from 601 women (age 17-74 years, mean age 29.4 yrs) and observed HCG in 477 cases. In all 477 HCG cases, Pap tests were found to be satisfactory and to contain an endocervical sample. HCG were easily detectable at 10x screening magnification (size up to 400 um, mean 239.5 um) and ranged from 1 to 50 (mean 19.5) per Pap slide. HCG predominantly represented 3-Dimensional groups of endocervical cells with some nuclear overlap (379\/477--79%), reactive endocervical cells with relatively prominent nucleoli and some nuclear crowding (29\/477--6%), clusters of inflammatory cells (25\/477--5.2%), parabasal cells (22\/477--4.6%), endometrial cells (1\/477--0.2%). Epithelial cell abnormalities (ECA) were present in only 21 of 477 cases (4.6%). 18 of 21 women with HCG-associated ECA were less than 40 years old; only 3 were = or &gt; 40 years. HCG-associated final abnormal Pap test interpretations were as follows: ASCUS (6\/21--28%), LSIL (12\/21--57%), ASC-H (2\/21--9.5%), and HSIL\/CIN2-3 (3\/21--14%). The association of HCG with ECA was statistically significant (p = 0.0174. chi-square test). In patients with ECA, biopsy results were available in 10 cases, and 4 cases of biopsy-proven CIN2\/3 were detected. Among these four cases, HCG in the Pap tests, in retrospect represented the lesional high grade cells in three cases (one HSIL case and two ASC-H cases). Interestingly, none of the 124 cases without HCG were found to have an epithelial cell abnormality. We conclude: a. HCG are observed in a high proportion of cervical smears. b. In the vast majority of cases, HCG are benign. c. ECA were only observed in cases with HCG. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of HCG in Pap tests most often represents adequate sampling of the transformation zone, thus increasing the chances of detecting an epithelial cell abnormality. d. Only a few cases with HCG were associated with a serious ECA, but careful scrutiny of all HCG appears warranted to avoid the potential diagnostic pitfall of a significant false negative interpretation. ","425":"Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a fashionable and an extremely hot topic for clinicians, patients and the health service planners. Evidence-based cytology (EBC) is an offshoot of EBM. The EBC is concerned with generating a reproducible, high quality and clinically relevant test result in the field of cytology. This is a rapidly evolving area with high practical importance. EBC is based entirely on research data. The various professional bodies on cytology design and recommend guidelines on the basis of evidences. Once the guideline is implemented and practiced then the experiences of the practicing cytopathologists may be used as a feed back to alter the existing guideline. The various facets of EBC are sampling and specimen adequacy, morphological identification and computer based expert system, integrated reporting, identification of the controversial areas and high quality researches for evidences. It is the duty of the individuals and institutions to practice EBC for better diagnosis and management of the patients.

Although this tumor has been well characterized histologically, the morphological patterns in Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology have not been well defined. Unlike ductal adenocarcinomas, endocrine tumors, and solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas with their characteristic FNA cytological features, acinar cell carcinomas pose a particular diagnostic challenge by sharing many cytomorphologic features with endocrine tumors of the pancreas. A 37-year-old man presented with lower chest and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a 7.8 x 7.3 cm irregular, partially cystic mass in the body and tail of the pancreas, and two lesions in the liver compatible with metastases. Subsequently, the patient underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration on one of the two metastatic liver masses. FNA cytology revealed abundant, loosely cohesive clusters of malignant epithelial cells with vaguely acinar and trabecular formations. The pleomorphic nuclei had fine granular chromatin and occasionally small nucleoli. There were scant to moderate amounts of cytoplasm. Scattered, strikingly large tumor cells with giant nuclei, prominent mitoses and associated necrosis were evident. A pancreatic endocrine tumor was suspected initially, but acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, cytochemical and ultrastructural studies. We describe a case of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma with unusual cytomorphologic features mimicking an endocrine tumor of pancreas, encountered in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a metastatic liver mass and discuss the diagnostic approach for this unusual pancreatic tumor in fine needle aspiration cytology. ","427":"The aim of this study was to find out the characteristic morphology of malignant atypical cells which were missed on routine cytology of urine. In this retrospective study, we examined detailed cytomorphology of 18 cases of atypical urinary cytology which were missed on routine examination and were further proved on histopathology as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of bladder. The cytological features of these cases were compared with 10 cases of benign urine samples. There were 11 cases of high grade TCC and 7 cases of low grade TCC on histopathology of the atypical urine samples. Necrosis in the background and necrosed papillae were mostly seen in malignant atypical cells. The comet cells and cells with India ink nuclei (single cells with deep black structure-less nuclei) were only observed in malignant atypical cells. The most consistent features in malignant atypical cells were: i) high nuclear and cytoplasmic (N\/C) ratio ii) nuclear pleomorphism iii) nuclear margin irregularity iv) hyperchromasia and v) chromatin abnormalities The present study emphasizes that nuclear features such as high N\/C ratio, hyperchromasia and chromatin abnormalities are particularly useful for assessing the malignant atypical cells. Other cytological features such as comet cells and cells with India ink nuclei are also helpful for diagnosis but have limited value because they are less frequently seen. ","428":"Diagnosis of pancreatic lesions can be accurately performed by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with onsite cytopathologists to assess specimen adequacy and to determine a preliminary diagnosis. Considerable time is needed to perform on-site assessments. This takes away work time of cytopathologists and prohibits them from serving remote locations. It is therefore logical to ask if real-time telecytopathology could be used to assess specimen adequacy and if telecytopathology diagnosis has the same level of agreement to the final diagnosis as that of onsite evaluation. In this study, we compare agreement between cytodiagnoses rendered using telecytopathology with onsite and final interpretations. 40 Diff-Quik-stained EUS-FNA were re-evaluated retrospectively (patient ages 31-62, 19:21 male:female, 15 non-malignant lesions, 25 malignant lesions as classified by final diagnosis). Each previously assessed by a cytopathologist and finally reviewed by the same or different cytopathologist. Blinded to the final diagnosis, a resident pathologist re-screened all slides for each case, selected a slide and marked the diagnostic cells most representative of the lesion. Blinded to the diagnosis, one cytopathologist assessed the marked cells through a real time remotely operated telecytopathology system (MedMicroscopy). Diagnosis and time spent were recorded. Kappa statistic was used to compare agreements between telecytopathology vs. original onsite vs. final diagnoses. Time spent for prescreening ranged from 1 to 5 minutes (mean 2.6 +\/- 1.3 minutes) and time spent for telecytopathology diagnosis ranged from 2-20 minutes (mean 7.5 +\/- 4.5 minutes). Kappa statistics, K, was as follows: telecytopathology versus onsite diagnosis K, 95% CI = 0.65, 0.41-0.88, for telecytopathology versus final K, 95% CI = 0.61, 0.37-0.85 and for onsite diagnosis versus final K, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.61-0.98. There is no significant difference in agreement between onsite and telecytopathology diagnoses. Kappa values for telecytopathology were less than onsite evaluation when compared to the final diagnosis; however, the difference was not statistically significant. This retrospective study demonstrates the potential use of telecytopathology as a valid substitute for onsite evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma by EUS-FNA. ","429":"On-site rapid interpretation (RI) of fine needle aspiration (FNA) has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield of FNA and decrease the need for repeat diagnostic procedures. Because the pathologist interprets only a fraction of the sample and has limited resources available at such times, an occasional RI diagnosis will be changed at the time of the final diagnosis. We investigated how often these changes in diagnoses occur and the possible reasons for the changes. All cytology reports from 1\/1\/02 to 12\/31\/03 from a single institution were reviewed. Cases with RI with discrepant final diagnoses were noted. The discrepant diagnoses were categorized depending on how they were changed. Possible sources for changed diagnoses were noted. Between 1\/1\/02 and 12\/31\/03 there were 1368 RIs of FNAs. Of these 80 (5.8%) had discrepancies between the RIs and final diagnoses. Seventy-eight cases had additional slides and\/or cell block at time of final diagnosis. 16 cases had ancillary studies available at final diagnosis. Consultant pathologists were used in 7 cases. Different pathologists interpreted the RI and final diagnosis in 31 cases. Although uncommon, discrepancies between RIs and final diagnoses occur 5.8% of the time at our institution. Most commonly, this involves a change of diagnosis from either \"non-diagnostic\" or \"benign\" to \"malignancy\". Although much of this is likely due to the presence of additional material and information at the time of final diagnosis, the number of cases that had different pathologists involved in the RI and final diagnosis suggests that inter-observer variability may also play some role. ","430":"In this present study we have evaluated the feasibility of sub-classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cases according to World Health Organization's (WHO) classification on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) material along with flow cytometric immunotyping (FCI) as an adjunct. In this five years study, only cases suggested or confirmed as NHL by FNAC were selected and FCI was performed with a complete panel of antibodies (CD3, CD2, CD 4, CD5, CD8, CD7, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD45, kappa and lambda) by dual color flow cytometry. Both cytologic findings and FCI data were interpreted together to diagnose and sub-classify NHL according to WHO classification. Wherever possible the diagnoses were compared with cytology. There were total 48 cases included in this study. The cases were classified on FNAC as predominant small cells (12), mixed small and large cells (5) and large cells (26). In five cases a suggestion of NHL was offered on FNAC material and these cases were labeled as NHL not otherwise specified (NHL-NOS). Flow cytometry could be performed in 45 cases (93.8%) and in rest of the three cases the material was inadequate because of scanty blood mixed aspirate. Light chain restriction was demonstrated in 30 cases out of 40 cases of B-NHL (75%). There were 15 cases each of kappa and lambda light chain restriction in these 30 cases. With the help of combined FCI and FNAC, it was possible to sub-classify 38 cases of NHL (79%) according to WHO classification. Combined FNAC and FCI data helped to diagnose 9 cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), 2 cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 4 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL), 17 cases of diffuse large B lymphoma (DLBL) and 6 cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma. Histopathology diagnosis was available in 31 cases of NHL out of which there were 14 recurrent and 17 cases of primary NHL. Out of 15 DLBL cases diagnosed on FCI and FNAC, histology confirmed 14 cases and one of these cases was diagnosed as Burkitt's lymphoma on histology. Cases of FL (4), SLL (3) and MCL (2) were well correlated with histopathology. Out of the five cases suggestive of NHL on cytology, histopathology was available in four cases. Histology diagnosis was given as DLBL (1), SLL (1), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (1) and FL transformed into large cell NHL (1). Considering histopathology as gold standard, diagnostic specificity of combined FNAC and FCI was 100% (31\/31) and sensitivity in sub-classification was 83.8% (26\/31). FNAC combined with FCI may be helpful in accurately sub-classifying NHL according to WHO classification. Many of the subtypes of NHL such as FL and MCL which were previously recognized as a pure morphologic entity can be diagnosed by combined use of FNAC and FCI. Other ancillary investigations such as chromosomal changes, cell proliferation markers etc. may be helpful in this aspect. ","431":"Both thyroid lymphoma and anaplastic carcinoma of thyroid present with rapidly growing mass in eldery patients. Anaplastic carcinoma has high mortality rate and combination of surgery, radiation therapy and multidrug chemotherapy are the best chance for cure. Prognosis of thyroid lymphoma is excellent and chemotherapy for widespred lymphoms and radiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy for tumors localized to the gland, are the treatment of choice. This article reports a 70 year old man presenting with diffuse neck swelling and hoarseness of few weeks duration. Fine needle aspiration was done and reported as anaplastic carcinoma of thyroid which thyroidectomy was planned. The slides were sent for second opinion. After review, with initial diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma versus lymphoma, immunocytochemical study was performed. Smears were positive for B cell markers and negative for cytokeratin, so with the impression of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the patient received two courses of chemotherapy by which the tumor disappeared during two weaks. Despite previous reports, stating easy diagnosis of high-grade thyroid lymphoma on the grounds of cytomorphological features we like to emphasize, overlapping cytologic features of the curable high grade thyroid lymphoma form noncurable anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and usefulness of immunocytochemistry to differentiate these two disease. ","432":"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare lung disorder, which was first reported as idiopathic condition in 1958. The prevalence of acquired pulmonary alveolar proteinosis has been estimated to be 0.37 per 100,000 population. The cause of this condition is not entirely clear. We present alveolar proteinosis in a case recently treated for pulmonary Pneumocystis carinii infection. A 25-year-old Caucasian female presented with shortness of breath during management of acute pancreatitis. She had a heart-transplant six years ago, a distal pancreatectomy secondary to pancreatitis two years ago, chronic renal failure secondary to Prograft taken for six years to suppress transplant rejection, and a more recent history of Pneumocystis carinii infection treated in the preceding 21 days with augmented doses of Bactrim (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole). She had bilateral pleural effusions with radiological and clinical features suspicious for interstitial lung disease. Cytopathologic evaluation of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) showed hyaline alveolar casts admixed with amorphous debris and scant chronic inflammatory cells, consistent with alveolar proteinosis. GMS and PAS stains were negative for P. carinii. Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) test for P. carinii performed on the BAL specimen in our Microbiology Lab had been repeatedly negative. Cytopathological findings in bronchoalveolar lavage, with clinical differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, were diagnostic. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis after recent treatment for P. carinii infection suggests a relationship of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with P. carinii infection in the immunocompromised patient. ","433":"Synovial sarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma in the head and neck region and parapharyngeal space. There is no previous cytologic report of synovial sarcoma of parapharynx. The cytologic and immunocytochemical findings of a parapharyngeal biphasic synovial sarcoma together with diagnostic pitfalls are described. A 21-year-old girl presented with a 6-month history of progressive right arm pain, neck mass and upper aerodigestive tract obstruction. On physical examination there was a large painless mass arising from the right-sided parapharyngeal space causing airway obstruction. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large tumor in the right-sided parapharyngeal space. Fine needle aspiration through cervical region was performed and was reported as benign spindle cell tumor. Smears were cellular and composed mostly of tight and loose clusters of spindle cells. Epitheloid cells could also be identified intermingled with them. She underwent near total resection of the tumor. Pathologic report disclosed the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. She then received postoperative adjuvant external radiotherapy. Due to rarity of this tumor in this region and nonspecific cytologic features, we could not differentiate this tumor from the other more common spindle cell neoplasms. Considering synovial sarcoma in this region and immunocytochemistry can be helpful in rendering a correct initial diagnosis of this tumor. ","434":"Plasma cell neoplasms represent autonomous proliferations of plasma cells and can manifest as diffuse myeloma with systemic involvement (plasma cell myeloma or multiple myeloma), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), or as variants of plasma cell myeloma such as indolent myeloma, smoldering myeloma, osteosclerotic myeloma, plasma cell leukaemia and non-secretory myeloma. Localized neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells presents as solitary plasmacytoma of bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma. Involvement of orbit can occur as a solitary plasmacytoma, or as part of systemic involvement in multiple myeloma, the clinical outcome being significantly worse in the latter setting. Orbital involvement in multiple myeloma is very rare with less than 50 cases reported in the literature. Early cytological diagnosis of such lesions is vital for timely institution of appropriate therapy. As far as we are aware only six previous cases of cytological diagnosis of multiple myeloma involving the orbit are on record. A 37 year old male presented with low grade fever showing evening rise, headache, diplopia and swelling in the right periorbital and temporal region. Imaging studies revealed destructive lesion of sphenoid, frontal bone and zygomatic arch with soft tissue component extending to infratemporal fossa and orbit. A fine needle aspirate from the temporal region swelling showed features of a plasmacytoma, and subsequent workup confirmed the presence of systemic disease. A final diagnosis of multiple myeloma with orbital involvement at presentation was made. Present case describes the extremely rare presentation of multiple myeloma with orbital involvement and highlights the utility of cytology in such lesions. Fine needle aspiration diagnosis of plasmacytoma at extramedullary sites offers an opportunity for non-invasive verification of systemic involvement, and thus plays a major role in early diagnosis and management of these patients. ","435":"Urine cytology has a critical role in evaluation for bladder carcinoma. Due to the low sensitivity of this technique, ancillary modalities such as the detection of markers of malignancy by immunochemistry are desirable. Promising factors in this context are components of the human telomerase enzyme complex. Telomerase repairs and extend telomeres, which when eroded beyond a critical limit trigger a senescence checkpoint. Accordingly, while absent in normal somatic cells, telomerase activity has been detected in the great majority of malignant tumor specimens tested, and so has potential value for the recognition of malignant cells in clinical specimens. In this study, we investigated whether the immunohistochemical detection of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) can aid cytology in the diagnosis of bladder lesions. Findings from the retrospective evaluation of over 100 cell blocks, including urine sediments from confirmed malignant and benign conditions, were compared with routine urine cytology data. The presence of hTERT protein was indicative of the transformation of urothelia to a malignant phenotype. Nucleolar hTERT was expressed in 27 (93%) of 29 samples obtained from patients with confirmed primary bladder cancer. Conversely, hTERT was detectable in only 3 (0.8%) of 39 samples from benign conditions. The hTERT assay showed higher diagnostic sensitivity (84.8%) than published urine cytology data (approximately 65%) for confirmed bladder carcinoma, however, the hTERT assay was less specific than cytology (65.2% vs. approximately 95% respectively). As a highly sensitive marker, immunohistochemical hTERT detection in urine sediments represents a reliable adjunct to cytology in the accurate diagnosis of urothelial neoplasms. ","436":"The hyalinizing trabecular neoplasm (HTN) of the thyroid is an unusual and controversial lesion. Some consider it a peculiar type of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) because of its nuclear features and presence of psammoma bodies. Others consider it an adenoma. Molecular studies have found RET\/PTC translocations in some examples, supporting HTN as a PTC; however mutations in BRAF (another marker for PTC) have not been found. We report two cases of classic HTN and a case of trabecular PTC and show BRAF mutations in the latter and not in HTN. Trabecular growth pattern is insufficient for a diagnosis of HTN and lesions with such a pattern and nuclear features of PTC are cancers. Morphologically classic HTN are not associated with metastatic potential and should be considered adenomas.","437":"Due to difficulty in confirming clinical suspicions of malignancy in patients presenting with bone tumours, the cost of surgical biopsies where hospital charges are borne almost entirely by patients, competition with bone setters and healing homes with high rate of loss to follow up; we set out to find if sufficient material could be obtained to arrive at reliable tissue diagnosis in patients with clinical and radiological evidence of bone tumours in our hospitals. After initial clinical and plain radiographic examinations, patients were sent for fine needle aspirations. Aspirations were carried out with size 23G needles of varying lengths with 10 ml syringes in a syringe holder (CAMECO, Sebre Medical, Vellinge, Sweden). The aspirates were air dried, stained by the MGG method and examined microscopically. Histology was performed on patients who had subsequent surgical biopsy. These were then correlated with the cytology reports. Out of 96 patients evaluated, [57 males, 39 females, Mean age 31.52 years, Age Range 4-76 years,] material sufficient for diagnosis was obtained in 90 patients. Cytological diagnosis of benign lesions was made in 40 patients and malignant in 47. Of these, 27 were metastases, osteogenic sarcoma 16, giant cell tumour 19, infection 11. Histology was obtained in 41 patients. Correct diagnosis of benignity was made in 17 out of 18 cases, malignancy in 21 out of 22 cases. One non-diagnostic case was malignant. The accuracy of specific cytological diagnosis was 36\/41 (87.8%) and incorrect in 5\/41 (12.2%). We conclude that FNAC can be useful in the pre-operative assessment of bone tumours especially where other diagnostic modalities are unavailable. ","438":"Cervical carcinoma remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and sexual behavior is regarded as the main contributing factor. We studied cervical cytology screening with surgical biopsy follow-up in women prisoners and compared the findings to those in the general population. We reviewed 1024 conventional cervical smears, 73 cervical biopsies and 2 loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) specimens referred to us from the Correctional Center in Columbus, Ohio during a 12-month period. The results were compared to 40,993 Pap smears from the general population for the same 12-month period. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL) was diagnosed in 1.3% of the cervical smears from the inmate population versus 0.6% in the general population (p &lt; 0.01). The unsatisfactory rate was 1.6% compared to 0.3% in the general population (p &lt; 0.01). Among the study population, follow-up tissue diagnosis was obtained in 24.3% of the abnormal cytology results (ASCUS, LGSIL, and HGSIL). Of the HGSIL Pap smears, 61.5% had a subsequent tissue diagnosis. Thirty-nine biopsies (52% of the all inmate biopsies and LEEP) showed CIN II\/III (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II\/III). Eight of these thirty-nine follow-up biopsies diagnosed as CIN II\/III had a previous cervical cytology diagnosis of ASCUS. The average age for HGSIL was 30.5 years (S.D. = 5.7) and for low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) was 27.2 years (S.D. = 6.1). A significantly higher prevalence of HGSIL cervical cytology and unsatisfactory smears was encountered in female inmates, with tissue follow-up performed in less than two thirds of the patients with HGSIL. These results are in keeping with data available in the literature suggesting that the inmate population is high-risk and may be subject to less screening and tissue follow-up than the general population. Clinicians should proceed with urgency to improve screening and follow-up with treatment. The inmate population should be targeted for HPV vaccination promptly after FDA approval. ","439":"The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines for management of ASC-H is colposcopic examination followed by biopsy. HPV testing (HPVT) is recommended after a negative biopsy result. More definitive interpretation of ASC-H could prevent discomfort and minimize the cost. The purpose of this study was to evaluate association of various cytomorphological patterns of ASC-H with various clinical scenarios. We reviewed SurePath (TriPath Imaging, Inc. Burlington, NC, USA) cervical smears interpreted as ASC-H in 161 women (mean age, 37 {15 to 78} years), over 24 months (2002 to 2003). HPVT (Digene, Hybrid Capture II HPV test, Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was performed in 20% of cases (33\/161) and biopsy results were available in 54 cases (19 with and 35 without HPVT). HPVT was positive in 64% (21\/33) cases, and negative in 36% (12\/33) cases. In the follow-up biopsies of 71% (15\/21) of cases with positive HPVT, 27% showed HPV changes or CIN1, 27% showed CIN2-3, and 46% were negative for epithelial abnormality. Follow-up biopsies from cases with negative HPVT (33%, 4\/12 cases), 8% showed CIN1 and 25% were negative for any epithelial abnormality. Six cytomorphological patterns of ASC-H correlated with different clinical categories in relation to HPVT and biopsy results. 35% (19 out of 54 ASC-H cases in which biopsy results were available) could be interpreted definitively as HSIL by cytopathology, 11% (6\/54) cases as LSIL with cyanophilic atypical parakeratotic pattern, and 31% (17\/54) cases as reactive, with HPV status. The interpretation had to be continued as ASC-H in 22% (12\/54) cases. ASC-H demonstrated a spectrum of cytomorphological patterns. Some of these patterns in liquid-based cervical smears may be more specifically interpreted as LSIL, HSIL, or benign if HPV status is known. ","440":"Cells with \"hand mirror\" morphology have not, to the best of our knowledge, been described in a primary effusion sample. This paper describes a case of T-cell lymphoma with eosinophilia in a patient with suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis. Rarely, a T-cell lymphoproliferative process may mimic primary peritoneal carcinomatosis, clinically suggested by a presentation in CT imaging of omental caking with bilateral massive loculated effusions in a patient without lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. A 60 year old caucasian male presented with vague abdominal discomfort and increasing abdominal girth. Computed tomography showed a two centimeter thick omental cake and a small loculated effusion. The clinical presentation and imaging findings were most consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Cytologic evaluation of the effusion was undertaken for diagnostic study. Rapid intraprocedural interpretation of the effusion sample showed a monomorphic population of cells with \"hand-mirror\" cell morphology exhibiting cytoplasmic extensions (uropodia) with 3-5 course dark cytoplasmic granules and a rim of vacuolated cytoplasm capping the opposing \"mirror head\" side. These cells were seen within a background of mature eosinophils. Flow cytometric evaluation of the ascites fluid demonstrated an atypical T-cell population with the following immunophenotype: CD2-, CD3+, CD4-, CD5-, CD7-, CD8+, CD56+. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement was positive for clonal TCR-gamma gene rearrangement, supporting the diagnosis of a T-lymphoproliferative disorder. A T-cell lymphoproliferative process may present with \"hand mirror\" morphology in an effusion sample. These cells may show polar cytoplasmic vacuolization and 3-5 course granules within the \"handle\" of these unique cells. Cytoplasm shows peripheral constriction around the nucleus. ","441":"To analyze the impact of using a hand held fan to speed the air-drying process during immediate adequacy evaluation of Fine Needle Aspirations. The effect on turn around time and staining quality is evaluated. Two mirror image air-dried smears for each pass were prepared. One was subjected to a small hand-held fan with a fan diameter of 7 cm held an average distance of 3 to 5 cm from the slide. The other smear was left to dry without a fan. A total of 93 consecutive pairs were evaluated over a 2-month duration. The average time needed for air-drying using the fan was 73 seconds (range 10-300 seconds, standard error 6.986), while it was 200 seconds (range 15-645 seconds, standard error 17.799) for those without fan. This difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). Smears were then evaluated for single cells, cell clusters and background material and no appreciable difference in stain quality was noted between the 2 groups. The use of a small hand-held fan for air-drying shortened the drying time for FNA adequacy by an average of 127 seconds (63% time reduction) for each pass. The quality of staining was comparable. Using a fan is highly recommended.","442":"The member organizations of the Cytology Education and Technology Consortium believe there are significant flaws in current cytology proficiency testing regulations. The most immediate needed modifications include lengthening the required testing interval, utilizing stringently validated and continuously monitored slides, changing the grading scheme, and changing the focus of the test from the individual to laboratory level testing. Integration of new computer-assisted and located-guided screening technologies into the testing protocols is necessary for the testing protocol to be compliant with the law.","443":"Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is widely utilized for evaluation of patients with thyroid nodules. However, approximately 30% are indeterminate for malignancy. Recently, a mutation in the BRAF gene has been reported to be the most common genetic event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In this retrospective study, we assessed the utility of BRAF V600E mutation detection for refining indeterminate preoperative cytologic diagnoses in patients with PTC. Archival indeterminate thyroid FNAs and corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical samples with PTC were identified in our patient files. DNA extracted from slide scape lysates and 5 mum FFPE sections were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation using LightCycler PCR and fluorescent melting curve analysis (LCPCR). Amplification products that showed deviation from the wild-type genomic DNA melting peak, discordant FNA and FFPE matched pairs, and all benign control samples, underwent direct DNA sequencing. A total of 19 indeterminate thyroid FNAs demonstrating PTC on FFPE surgical samples were included in the study. Using BRAF mutation analysis, the preoperative diagnosis of PTC was confirmed in 3\/19 (15.8%) FNA samples that could not be conclusively diagnosed on cytology alone. However, 9\/19 (47.4%) FFPE tissue samples were positive for the V600E mutation. Of the discordant pairs, 5\/6 FNAs contained less than 50% tumor cells. When used with indeterminate FNA samples, BRAF mutation analysis may be a useful adjunct technique for confirming the diagnosis of malignancy in an otherwise equivocal case. However, overall tumor cell content of some archival FNA smear slides is a limiting factor for mutation detection. ","444":"The differential diagnosis of a follicular lesion\/neoplasm in thyroid FNA specimens includes hyperplastic\/adenomatoid nodule, follicular adenoma and carcinoma, and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. In our laboratory we separate follicular lesions of thyroid into hyperplastic\/adenomatoid nodule (HN), follicular neoplasm (FON) and follicular derived neoplasm with focal nuclear features suspicious for papillary thyroid carcinoma (FDN). This study reports our experience with 339 cases diagnosed as FON and 120 as FDN. All cases were evaluated for histologic diagnosis, age, sex and size of the nodule. Histopathologic follow-up was available in all cases. The malignancy rate was 22% (74\/359) and 72% (86\/120) for cases diagnosed as FON and FDN, respectively. In the FON category almost half of the malignant cases were papillary carcinoma. The risk of malignancy was higher in patients younger than 40 yr (53% vs. 30%) than in patients 40 year or more years old and greater in males (41% vs. 33%) than females. No statistically significant relationship was noted between the sizes of the nodules and benign vs. malignant diagnosis. According to this study it is important to divide follicular patterned lesions of thyroid into FON and FDN in the cytology specimens due to significantly different risk of malignancy (22% vs. 72%). In addition, clinical features, including gender and age can be part of the decision analysis in selecting patients for surgery.","445":"Mammary sclerosing lobular hyperplasia is an uncommon benign lesion of adolescent and young women. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of mammary sclerosing lobular hyperplasia is said to show characteristic features that include an absence of stromal fragments. In this article, we describe a case of sclerosing lobular hyperplasia that occurred in the right breast of a 12-year-old girl. Fine-needle aspiration cytology showed some fibroadenoma-like features including the presence of stromal fragments, while branched tubular fragments were not seen. The diagnosis of sclerosing lobular hyperplasia was made on histologic examination that showed preserved acinar architecture with lobular hyperplasia and sclerosis of intralobular and interlobular stroma. Fine-needle aspiration cytology features of mammary sclerosing lobular hyperplasia are not diagnostic and overlap with those of fibroadenoma; however, a distinction between the two benign entities is of no clinical significance. The definitive diagnosis of sclerosing lobular hyperplasia requires histopathologic evaluation. ","446":"","447":"Parathyroid gland and their tumors comprise a small proportion of non-palpable neck masses that are investigated by ultrasound (US) guided fine needle aspiration biopsy. We reviewed our institution's cases of US guided FNAB of parathyroid gland and their lesions to determine the role of cytology for the preoperative diagnosis of parathyroid gland and their lesions. All cases of FNAB of parathyroid gland and lesions in the last 10 years were reviewed in detail with respect to clinical history and correlated with the histopathologic findings in available cases. The cytologic parameters that were evaluated included cellularity assessed semiquantitatively as scant, intermediate or abundant (&lt;50, 51-500 or &gt;500 cells), cellular distribution (loose clusters, single cells\/naked nuclei, rounded clusters, two- and three-dimensional clusters, and presence of prominent vascular proliferation), cellular characteristics (cell size, nuclear shape, presence\/absence of a nucleolus, degree of mitosis, amount of cytoplasm, and appearance of nuclear chromatin), and background (colloid-like material and macrophages). Immunostaining for parathyroid hormone (PTH) was performed on selected cases using either destained Pap smears or cell block sections. Twenty cases of US-guided FNAB of parathyroid glands and their lesions including 13 in the expected locations in the neck, 3 in intrathyroid region, 3 in thyroid bed, and 1 metastatic to liver were studied. Majority of the cases showed intermediate cellularity (51-500 cells) with round to oval cells that exhibited a stippled nuclear chromatin, without significant pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The cells were arranged in loose two dimensional groups with many single cells\/naked nuclei around the groups. Occasionally macrophages and colloid like material was also encountered. There was no significant difference in the cytomorphologic features between normal gland, hyperplasia adenoma, or carcinoma. Immunocytochemical analysis for PHT was performed for 14 cases (6 destained smears and 8 cell blocks) which showed distinct cytoplasmic positivity. US-guided FNAB is a useful test for confirming the diagnosis of not only clinically suspected parathyroid gland and lesions but also for detecting parathyroid glands in unexpected locations such as in thyroid bed or within the thyroid gland. Although there is significant overlap in the cytomorphologic features of cells derived from parathyroid and thyroid gland, the presence of stippled nuclear chromatin, prominent vascular proliferation with attached epithelial cells, and frequent occurrence of single cells\/naked nuclei are useful clues that favor parathyroid origin. Distinction of the different parathyroid lesions including hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma cannot be made solely on cytology. Immunostaining for PTH can be performed on destained Pap smears and cell block sections which can be valuable for confirming parathyroid origin of the cells.

The major topics discussed were open access, peer review, and impact factors. Representative participants volunteered to join the task force to prepare an instructional guide for peer-reviewing cytopathology manuscripts. Concern about the impact factor for CytoJournal was discussed. A feedback to its readers and authors was recommended. Impact factor calculation needs at least three years of journal statistics. It is only possible after two years from the time a journal is first accepted by Thomson-ISI for citation tracking. CytoJournal is still too new for an impact factor to be calculated. However, general progress of CytoJournal suggests an encouraging pattern for high impact factor.","449":"Self-collection of anorectal swab specimens could greatly facilitate the completion of prerequisite studies and future implementation of anal cancer screening among men who have sex with men (MSM). We therefore compared self- versus clinician- collection procedures with respect to specimen adequacy for cytological evaluation, concordance of paired cytological results, and concordance of cytological with biopsy results. Paired self- and clinician- collected anorectal Dacron swabs for liquid-based (Thin Prep) cytological evaluation were collected in random sequence from a mostly HIV-1 seronegative cohort of young MSM in Vancouver. Slides were reviewed by one cytopathologist. Presence of any cytological abnormality (atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance, ASCUS, or above) prompted referral for high-resolution anoscopy and possible biopsy. Among 222 patient-clinician specimen pairs, most were adequate for cytological evaluation, though self-collected specimens were less likely to be so (83% versus 92%, McNemar's test p &lt; 0.001). Cytological abnormalities, noted in 47 (21%) of self-collected and 47 (21%) of clinician-collected specimens (with fair agreement, kappa = 0.414) included, respectively: ASCUS (5%, 5%), and low-grade (13%, 13%) and high-grade (3%, 3%) squamous intraepithelial lesions. Among 12 men with biopsy-confirmed high-grade neoplasia, most had abnormal cytological results (including 6 patient and 9 clinician swabs) but few (2 patient and 1 clinician swab) were high-grade. Self-collection of anorectal swab specimens for cytologic screening in research and possibly clinical settings appears feasible, particularly if specimen adequacy can be further improved. The severity of biopsy-confirmed anorectal disease is seriously underestimated by cytological screening, regardless of collector. ","450":"Lymphoepitheloid lymphoma is a T-cell lymphoma with peculiar histologic picture with massive proliferation of epitheloid cell clusters intermingled with many, mostly small-sized lymphoid cells. The cytomorphologic features in imprint of a case of lymphoepitheloid T-cell lymphoma is described together with diagnostic pitfalls. A 74 years old man presented with weight loss, anemia and fever. Physical examination showed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with hepatosplenomegaly. With the clinical impression of hypersplenic syndrome vs lymphoma, excisional biopsy of a lymph node was performed and both imprints and histologic sections made. Cytologic findings showed uniform isolated small lympocytes with closely intermingled scattered and aggregates of epitheloid cells. Histologic sections were diagnosed as lymphoepitheloid lymphoma (Lennert's lymphoma). Cytologic findings of this variant of lymphoma is distinctive enough for a correct initial suggestive diagnosis. However the presence of high content of epitheloid cell clusters can cause cytologic misinterpretation with other benign and malignant conditions. ","451":"Endosonography (EUS) guided FNA is a relatively new imaging modality which is increasingly used for sampling deep-seated lymph nodes in the diagnosis and staging of various malignancies, both primary as well as metastatic. It is also useful for staging of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as diagnosing recurrence. The diagnosis of leukemia on FNA samples from deep-seated lymphadenopathy poses an even greater challenge. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon, but distinct, lympho-proliferative disorder of B cell origin. It usually affects the spleen and bone marrow and uncommonly involves lymph nodes. There are only a few cases reported where HCL was diagnosed on FNA specimens. We report the first case of HCL accurately rendered on EUS-FNA samples. This report underscores the concept that the presence of a cytopathologist in the endoscopy suite plays an important role in providing accurate diagnoses of lymphoid lesions biopsied with EUS-FNA.

We report here ten cases of PTL diagnosed over a period of about 7 years in our institute. Out of these ten cases, nine were diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and one case was misdiagnosed as lymphocytic thyroiditis. This case was diagnosed as Non- Hodgkin's lymphoma on surgical specimen. Five patients are disease free and doing well, while two died of disease and the other two were lost to follow-up. One patient is currently on chemotherapy. The salient clinical, biochemical, radiological features, FNA findings along with diagnostic difficulties are discussed.","454":"Hitherto uncommon, the incidence of extracranial metastases of primary brain malignancies may increase, with improved treatment methods and longer patient survival. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is a simple, safe and reliable method to diagnose metastatic malignancy. It has definite advantages over tissue biopsy, which is more invasive and is of higher risk to the patient. Ours is a case of glioblastoma multiforme, which metastasized to the scalp and was diagnosed on fine needle aspiration biopsy. Only a few articles document the cytological features of extracranial glioblastoma multiforme, diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy. We report the case of an elderly female who presented with focal neurological symptoms. She was diagnosed radiologically with an intracranial lesion in the left temporal region, which was subsequently resected. Histology revealed a glioblastoma multiforme confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The tumor recurred subsequently and the patient was treated with chemotherapy, intraoperatively. At a later stage, she presented with a scalp mass on which fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. The cytomorphological features aided by immunohistochemistry supported a diagnosis of metastatic glioblastoma multiforme. The mass was later resected and histology confirmed the fine needle aspiration diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Reports of extracranial metastases of primary brain tumors are few. When they do occur, the primary cause is implantation during surgery or biopsy. However, spontaneous metastases to other organs do occur rarely. We believe fine needle aspiration biopsy to be very useful in the diagnosis of metastatic glioblastoma multiforme. The ability to use a cellblock for immunohistochemical studies is greatly advantageous and helpful in differentiating this tumor, from other malignancies that can occur in the scalp. A detailed discussion of the material obtained from fine needle aspiration biopsy of metastatic glioblastoma multiforme is presented, as well as a review of previous accounts in the literature.

In this report, the clinical, cytological, histological, and immunohistochemical features of this case are described, and a review of the literature about this neoplasm is presented. The differential diagnoses of small cell tumor in urinary bladder washing specimens are discussed.","456":"Metastases to the breast are unusual lesions that make up approximately 2% of all malignant mammary neoplasms and may mimic both benign and malignant primary neoplasms from a clinical point of view, as well as in imaging studies. Arriving at a correct diagnosis is therefore essential in order to establish appropriate management. We present three cases of metastatic neoplasms diagnosed through fine needle aspiration biopsy and immunocytochemistry. The cytological diagnoses were: medulloblastoma in an 18-year-old woman, melanoma in a 26-year-old man, and an exceptional case of ovarian sarcoma originating from a granulosa cell tumor with metastases to both breasts. A metastatic disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a palpable mass in the breast, especially if there is a history of an extramammary malignant neoplasm. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is the method of choice for the management of these cases. Whenever possible the exam of the material obtained should be compared to the previous biopsy, which is usually enough to arrive at a correct diagnosis, thus preventing unnecessary surgical procedures.","457":"Primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis is a rare neoplasm confined to the meninges without evidence of primary tumor in the brain or spinal cord parenchyma.

A 19-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of severe headaches. He had bilateral papilledema on physical exam. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was negative. Four months later a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Shortly thereafter, he was diagnosed with primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis based on the biopsy of an intradural extramedullary lesion adjacent to the lumbar spinal cord at a referral cancer center. The histology featured an infiltrating growth pattern of pleomorphic astrocytes with diffuse positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein. A couple of months later he presented at our institution with ascites and an anterior peritoneal mass. Repeat cerebrospinal fluid cytology and fine needle aspiration of the mass confirmed disseminated gliomatosis. Cytologic characteristics included clusters of anaplastic cells of variable size, high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio and scant to moderate cytoplasm. Occasional single bizarre multinucleated cells were seen with eccentric \"partial wreath-like\" nuclei, clumped chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Patient expired 13 months after initial presentation. Disseminated primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic aseptic meningitis and in the presence of a peritoneal tumor in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Immunocytochemistry may be of diagnostic value. ","458":"Although liquid-based cytology (LBC) is now recommended for cervical cancer screening, it requires expensive automated devices and materials. To evaluate the efficiency of inexpensive LBC methods relying on an inexpensive fixative liquid, Easyfix, we compared the results obtained by the liquid-based cytology (LBC) diagnoses performed by cytocentrifugations (Papspin and Turbitec) with those obtained by histology. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficiency of the fixative liquid, Easyfix, to preserve HPV DNA in the collected samples. 266 LBC were compared with 174 colposcopies and 91 Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP). Among the LBC, 51 were performed using the Papspin system and 215 were performed using the Turbitec system. To control the quality of the preservation liquid, Easyfix, we correlated the results of HCII assays with those of HPV PCR. For Papspin and Turbitec systems, the sensitivities were respectively 82.6% (95% CI: 61.2-95.0%, p &lt; 0.001) and 75.0% (95% CI: 64.4-89.8%, p &lt; 0.001) and the specificities were 92.6% (95%CI: 76.5-99.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and 96.2% (95% CI: 91.3-98.7%, p &lt; 0.001). We find no statistical difference between the results of the both systems (p = ns). The sensitivity of the HCII was 86.4% (95% IC: 77.4-92.8%, p &lt; 0.001) and the specificity was 39.4% (95% CI: 31.2-48.1%, p &lt; 0.001). The comparison between HCII and HPV-PCR shows a good correlation: the kappa was 0.89. LBC performed by cytocentrifugations are inexpensive, reduce inadequate smears, show excellent efficiency and allow HPV detection by molecular biology. ","459":"An elevated CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio on flow cytometry (FCM) analysis has been reported in the literature to be associated with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic significance of an elevated CD4\/CD8 ratio in lymph node fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. Between 1996 and 2002, out of 837 lymph node FNAs submitted for flow cytometry analysis, 85 cases showed an elevated CD4\/CD8 ratio, defined as greater than or equal to 4, without definitive evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The cytologic diagnoses of these 85 cases were grouped into four categories: reactive, atypical, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Histologic follow-up was available in 17\/85 (20%) of the cases. 5 of the 64 cases in which FCM and cytology did not reveal evidence of a lymphoproliferative disease had tissue follow-up because of persistent lymphadenopathy and high clinical suspicion. 3\/5 (60%) confirmed the diagnosis of reactive lymphadenopathy. The two remaining cases (40%) were positive for lymphoma (1HL, 1NHL). 8\/15 cases called atypical on cytology had histologic follow-up. 7\/8 (87.5%) cases were positive for lymphoma (3HL, 4NHL). 3\/4 cases called HL on cytology had tissue follow-up and all 3 (100%) confirmed the diagnosis of HL. One case diagnosed as NHL on cytology was found to be a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In summary, out of 17 cases with histologic follow-up 4\/17 (24%) were reactive with CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio of 4.1-29, 7\/17 (41%) were HLs with CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio of 5.3-11, and 6\/17 (35%) were NHLs with CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio of 4.2-14. An elevated CD4\/CD8 ratio on FCM is a nonspecific finding which may be seen in both reactive and lymphoproliferative disorders. The cytomorphologic features of the smear are more relevant than the sole flow cytometric finding of an elevated CD4\/CD8 ratio. ","460":"Combining fine needle aspirate cytology with flow cytometry immunophenotyping for the rapid diagnosis of lymphoproliferative lesions is commonplace practice in many institutions. Yet, a definitive diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma in many cases remains elusive, requiring subsequent tissue biopsy confirmation. In this issue of CytoJournal, Hernandez et al explore the potential role of using the increased CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio in lymph node fine needle aspiration specimens as a specific feature in diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma. CD4\/CD8 T-cell ratio comparisons are made with cytomorphologic diagnoses of reactive, atypical, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma cases.","461":"Thyroid nodules (TN) are a common clinical problem. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the thyroid now is practiced worldwide and proves to be the most economical and reliable diagnostic procedure to identify TNs that need surgical excision and TNs that can be managed conservatively. The key for the success of thyroid FNA consists of an adequate or representative cell sample and the expertise in thyroid cytology. The FNA cytologic manifestations of TNs may be classified into seven working cytodiagnostic groups consisting of a few heterogenous lesions each to facilitate the differential diagnosis. Recent application of diagnostic molecular techniques to aspirated thyroid cells proved to be useful in separating benign from malignant TNs in several cases of indeterminate lesions.","462":"We present a case in which p16 immunocytochemistry helped establish the diagnosis of Trichomonas in urine from a male patient. Based on this finding, we recommend p16 immunocytochemistry as a diagnostic tool for unexpected patients or specimen types in which potential trichomonads are identified following routine cytologic evaluation.","463":"As extra-cranial metastasis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare, it may create a diagnostic dilemma especially during interpretation of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytology. We present transbronchial FNAB findings in a 62-year-old smoker with lung mass clinically suspicious for a lung primary. The smears of transbronchial FNAB showed groups of cells with ill-defined cell margins and cytological features overlapping with poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor cells demonstrated lack of immunoreactivity for cytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and usual neuroendocrine markers, synaptophysin and chromogranin in formalin-fixed cellblock sections. However, they were immunoreactive for the other neuroendocrine immunomarker, CD56, suggesting neural nature of the cells. Further scrutiny of clinical details revealed a history of GBM, 13 months status-post surgical excision with radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. The tumor recurred 7 months earlier and was debulked surgically and with intra-cranial chemotherapy. Additional evaluation of tumor cells for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity with clinical details resulted in final interpretation of metastatic GBM. Lack of clinical history and immunophenotyping may lead to a diagnostic pitfall with possible misinterpretation of metastatic GBM as poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of lung in a smoker. ","464":"We report the first case of a posterior mediastinal granular cell tumor initially diagnosed on cytologic material obtained via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in a 51-year-old male with a prior history of colon cancer. Aspirates obtained were cellular and composed of polygonal cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and small, round dark nuclei. An immunoperoxidase stain performed on the cell block for antibodies to S-100 protein showed strong, diffuse staining of the cytoplasmic granules. Electron microscopy performed on the cell block revealed numerous cytoplasmic lysosomes. This is the first case report in the English literature of a definitive preoperative diagnosis of a mediastinal granular cell tumor utilizing material obtained via EUS-FNA.","465":"The role of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in the evaluation of focal liver lesions has evolved. Guided FNAB is still useful to procure a tissue diagnosis if clinical, biochemical and radiologic findings are inconclusive. Major diagnostic issues include: (i) Distinction of benign hepatocellular nodular lesions from reactive hepatocytes, (ii) Distinction of well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (WD-HCC) from benign hepatocellular nodular lesions, (iii) Distinction of poorly differentiated HCC from cholangiocarcinoma and metastatic carcinomas, (iv) Determination of histogenesis of malignant tumor, and (v) Determination of primary site of origin of malignant tumor. This review gives a general overview of hepatic FNAB; outlines an algorithmic approach to cytodiagnosis with emphasis on HCC, its variants and their mimics; and addresses current diagnostic issues. Close radiologic surveillance of high-risk cirrhotic patients has resulted in the increasing detection of smaller lesions with many subjected to biopsy for tissue characterization. The need for tissue confirmation in clinically obvious HCC is questioned due to risk of malignant seeding. When a biopsy is indicated, core needle biopsy is favored over FNAB. The inherent difficulty of distinguishing small\/early HCC from benign hepatocellular nodular lesions has resulted in indeterminate reports. Changing concepts in the understanding of the biological behavior and morphologic evolution of HCC and its precursors; and the current lack of agreement on the morphologic criteria for distinguishing high-grade dysplastic lesions (with small cell change) from WD-HCC, have profound impact on nomenclature, cytohistologic interpretation and management. Optimization of hepatic FNAB to enhance the yield and accuracy of diagnoses requires close clinicopathologic correlation; combined cytohistologic approach; judicious use of ancillary tests; and skilled healthcare teams.","466":"BACKGROUND: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare and highly aggressive neoplasm. The cytological diagnosis of these tumors can be difficult because they show morphological features quite similar to other small round blue cells tumors. We described four cases of DSRCT with cytological sampling: one obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and three from serous effusions. The corresponding immunocytochemical panel was also reviewed. METHODS: Papanicolaou stained samples from FNAB and effusions were morphologically described. Immunoreaction with WT1 antibody was performed in all cytological samples. An immunohistochemical panel including the following antibodies was performed in the corresponding biopsies: 34BE12, AE1\/AE3, Chromogranin A, CK20, CK7, CK8, Desmin, EMA, NSE, Vimentin and WT1. RESULTS: The smears showed high cellularity with minor size alteration. Nuclei were round to oval, some of them with inconspicuous nucleoli. Tumor cells are clustered, showing rosette-like feature. Tumor cells in effusions and FNA were positive to WT1 in 3 of 4 cytology specimens (2 out 3 effusions and one FNA). Immunohistochemical reactions for vimentin, NSE, AE1\/AE3 and WT1 were positive in all cases in tissue sections. CONCLUSION: The use of an adjunct immunocytochemical panel coupled with the cytomorphological characteristics allows the diagnosis of DSRCT in cytological specimens.","467":"This issue of CytoJournal contains an article on screening for anal intraepithelial neoplasia in high-risk male patients. This accompanying Editorial focuses on current understanding of this relatively new disease entity, with insights as to the potential role of screening cytopathology in the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical management of this HIV and HPV related anal lesion, which predominates in male patients living long-term with AIDS. Mention is made of techniques of obtaining samples, methods of preparation, and morphologic classification. Issues of anoscopic confirmation, as well as topical and surgical management are emphasized. The similarity of initial experiences in anal screening to problems encountered early in cervical cancer screening programs several decades ago, are highlighted.","468":"BACKGROUND: Anal smears are increasingly being used as a screening test for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASILs). This study was undertaken to assess the usefulness and limitations of anal smears in screening for ASILs. METHODS: The cytomorphological features of 200 consecutive anal smears collected in liquid medium from 198 patients were studied and findings were correlated with results of surgical biopsies and\/or repeat smears that became available for 71 patients within six months. RESULTS: Adequate cellularity was defined as an average of 6 or more nucleated squamous cells\/hpf. A glandular\/transitional component was not required for adequacy. Dysplastic cells, atypical parakeratotic cells and bi\/multinucleated cells were frequent findings in ASIL while koilocytes were infrequent. Smears from LSIL cases most frequently showed mildly dysplastic and bi\/multinucleate squamous cells followed by parakeratotic cells (PK), atypical parakeratotic cells (APK), and koilocytes. HSIL smears contained squamous cells with features of moderate\/severe dysplasia and many APKs. Features of LSIL were also found in most HSIL smears. CONCLUSIONS: In this study liquid based anal smears had a high sensitivity (98%) for detection of ASIL but a low specificity (50%) for predicting the severity of the abnormality in subsequent biopsy. Patients with cytologic diagnoses of ASC-US and LSIL had a significant risk (46-56%) of HSIL at biopsy. We suggest that all patients with a diagnosis of ASC-US and above be recommended for high resolution anoscopy with biopsy.","469":"CytoJournal is published by an independent publisher BioMed Central, which is committed to ensuring that the peer-reviewed biomedical research is Open Access.

Wied, M.D., a founder of the medical subspecialty, cytopathology, who died July 25, 2004.","471":"BACKGROUND: Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (DIG) is a rare WHO Grade I tumor of infancy that is characterized by large volume, superficial location, invariable supratentoriality, fronto-parietal lobe predilection and morphologically, by an admixture of astroglial and neuroepithelial elements in a desmoplastic milieu. With over 50 cases described, the histologic and radiographic spectrum of DIG has been well-characterized. The superficial location of DIGs may render them greatly amenable to preoperative assessment utilizing aspiration cytology; however, the cytologic features of this rare tumor have only been reported once previously. CASE PRESENTATION: We present herein cytomorphologic findings from the intraoperative aspiration of a typical case of DIG diagnosed in a 1-year-old male. As evaluated on a single liquid-based preparation, the specimen showed low cellularity and was comprised predominantly of a population of dispersed (occasionally clustered) large neuronal cells with eccentrically located hyperchromatic nuclei (which were occasionally binucleated) and abundant unipolar cytoplasm. Rare smaller astroglial cells were intermixed. Despite the tumor's characteristic desmoplastic histologic appearance, no stromal fragments were identified on the aspiration material. CONCLUSIONS: A differential diagnosis is presented and analyzed in detail and it is concluded that when these large neuronal cells are encountered in an aspirate of a brain mass in a child, a combination of clinical, radiologic and immunohistochemical parameters can eliminate most of the differential possibilities.","472":"Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) lymphadenitis is a well known entity. Disseminated BCG infection usually presents as generalized lymphadenopathy, skin rash and hepatosplenomegaly and at times, can pose a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. There are only a few published studies on the cytological findings of BCG lymphadenitis. In this letter we report the fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of BCG lymphadenitis clinically masquerading as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). FNA smears showed sheets of foamy macrophages and many polymorphs in a dirty necrotic background with many macrophages as well as polymorphs showing negatively stained rod like structures within their cytoplasm. Zeihl Neelson stain revealed that these cells were heavily loaded with acid fast bacilli (AFB). In the index case, AFB were also seen within the cytoplasm of polymorphs, which has not been documented earlier in the literature.","473":"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma is a small round blue cell malignant neoplasm that primarily presents in the skin. The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma in a pleural fluid is challenging because of the morphological similarity to many other malignant neoplasms. Immunohistochemical stains can be essential to establish the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77 year-old woman presented with a mass in her right buttock thought clinically to be a boil or sebaceous cyst. Upon histopathologic review including immunohistochemical analysis, a diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma was rendered. Wide-excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy revealed negative margins and no evidence of metastasis. Ten months later she complained of bone pain and a bone scan revealed multiple lesions. An abdominal CT scan revealed a T4 vertebral mass and local radiotherapy was administered. Two months later the patient presented with shortness of breath. A chest radiograph showed an effusion and thoracentesis was performed. The fluid was confirmed to contain metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by cytology and immunohistochemical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm that can, despite careful surgical management, occasionally present as a malignant pleural effusion in a relatively short time period. Immunohistochemical analysis can aid in confirming this rare outcome.","474":"A joint task force of the American Society of Cytopathology (ASC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recently completed a 2-year effort to revise the Bethesda System \"blue book\" atlas and develop a complementary web-based collection of cervical cytology images.

Unlike surgical pathology cases, where additional paraffin sections can be cut, cytology slides often cannot be duplicated because there are only a few direct smears or the diagnostic material is present on a single slide. Cytology slides are often \"sent out\" to other physicians, laboratories or hospitals, typically so that the pathologist at the institution where the patient will receive treatment can review the slides. Less often, a cytology lab sends out the slides for a second opinion or as part of the discovery process in a lawsuit, where they may or may not be defendants. Rarely, unique and irreplaceable cytology slides are lost. This article presents a hypothetical scenario that is based on reported state appellate court decisions. The article discusses some of the legal issues that will affect the defendant cytologist\/cytology lab and the \"expert cytologist,\" and suggests some steps a cytologist\/cytology lab can take to minimize the risk of repercussions from a lost unique and irreplaceable cytology slide.","476":"BACKGROUND: In the management of cutaneous melanoma, it is desirable to complete the regional lymphadenectomy during the initial surgical procedure for wide excision of biopsy site and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. In this study, we optimized and evaluated a rapid 17 minutes immunostaining protocol. The discriminatory immunostaining pattern associated with the 'MCW Melanoma Cocktail' (mixture of Melan- A, MART- 1, and tyrosinase) facilitated the feasibility of intraoperative evaluation of imprint smears of SLNs for melanoma metastases. METHODS: Imprint smears of 51 lymph nodes from 25 cases (48 SLNs and 3 non-SLNs, 1 to 4 SLNs\/case) of cutaneous melanoma were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixteen percent, 8\/51 lymph nodes (28%, 7\/25 cases) were positive for melanoma metastases in immunostained permanent sections with the 'MCW melanoma cocktail'. All of these melanoma metastases, except 1 SLN from 1 case, were also detected in rapidly immunostained wet-fixed and air-dried smears (rehydrated in saline and postfixed in alcoholic formalin). The cytomorphology was superior in air-dried smears, which were rehydrated in saline and postfixed in alcoholic formalin. Wet-fixed smears frequently showed air-drying artifacts, which lead to the focal loss of immunostaining. None of the 5 SLNs from 5 cases exhibiting capsular nevi showed a false positive result with immunostained imprint smears. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma metastases can be detected intraoperatively in both air-dried smears and wet-fixed smears immunostained with the MCW Melanoma cocktail. Air-dried smears rehydrated in saline and postfixed in alcoholic formalin provide superior results and many practical benefits.","477":"Welcome to CytoJournal!
