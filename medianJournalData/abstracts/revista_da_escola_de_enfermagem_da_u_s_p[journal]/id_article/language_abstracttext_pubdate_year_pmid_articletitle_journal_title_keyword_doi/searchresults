analyze the retention of knowledge and skills of nursing professionals following training and retraining on cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This is an intervention, prospective, and analytical study in which 56 nursing professionals received theoretical and practical training in in-service cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Nine months after the first training (T1), these professionals participated in a retraining (T2). They were followed up for 18 months. The linear trend of knowledge and skills in the period following training was calculated and the Wilcoxon test was applied. Interventions increased the knowledge and skills of professionals significantly; however, in the subsequent period, skills decreased. Despite this, after a period of nine months, they were still higher than those identified before the study. There was a reduction of 18.2% in knowledge in the theoretical test after T1 vs 13.0% after T2 (p &lt; 0.01) and a reduction of 7.6% in skills on the practical test after T1 vs 5.3% after T2 (p &lt; 0.01). Nurses were able to retain more knowledge and skills on cardiopulmonary resuscitation after retraining, which stresses the importance of regular training and continuing education in health.

This is a research of qualitative approach, which used the Arc of Maguerez. Ten community health agents from a Primary Health Care Unit participated in the study. The following steps were addressed: observation of reality; identification of key points, and theorization. The speeches were recorded, transcribed, and their textual content was processed in the IRAMUTEQ software, using the Descending Hierarchical Classification. Five classes were formed, which composed three thematic blocks named as follows: child's social vulnerability in the territory; handling the child's health record, and vaccination schedule. Unveiling situations that influence the work of community health agents is essential for continuing education, as this favors assumptions applicable to daily work with resoluteness in child health. ","4":"Teaching with a multisensory approach helps students link new information to prior knowledge and understand relationships between concepts. This study aimed to reflect on convergences between the Multisensory Integration Approach Model with the Learning Assimilation Theory and Meaningful Retention with Bloom's Cognitive Process Domain, and to propose a taxonomic table of lesson planning for teaching Acute Coronary Syndrome, considering the confluence of these references. The three frameworks consider the importance of students' prior knowledge, the process of abstraction and generalization of knowledge, and the relationship between working and long-term memory. By observing such convergences and the taxonomic table produced, it is observed that teaching topics of interest to nursing undergraduate students, adopting the Multisensory Integration Approach Model as a taxonomic table component (pre-organizing or recall activities to arouse different sensory perceptions aligned with instructional objectives and forms of assessment), in the light of the Learning Assimilation Theory and Meaningful Retention, has the potential to favor the reception and processing of instructional content.","5":"to investigate health literacy level, quality of life and related factors in semi-urban and urban areas. this cross-sectional study was carried out between December 2018 and February 2019 with 595 participants. The variables found significant in the bivariate regression analysis were included in the multivariate regression analysis. according to the scores obtained from the Health Literacy Scale, participants' health literacy 76.5% levels were adequate. The factors affecting the Health Literacy Scale score in semi-urban areas were educational status, income status, presence of a chronic disease, perceived health, and understanding the health information provided. The factors affecting the Health Literacy Scale score in urban areas were age, marital status, reading habits, presence of a chronic disease, and understanding the health information provided (p &lt; .05). There was a statistically significant difference between participants living in semi-urban and urban areas in terms of their health literacy and quality of life levels (p &lt; .001). the health literacy level was inadequate in three out of ten participants, and it was even lower in semi-urban areas. ","6":"to assess the effectiveness of using an educational video in comparison with verbal nursing guidelines in increasing older adults' perception of falling risks. this is a randomized clinical trial in a cluster, with 138 community older adults, randomized into an intervention group, which watched an educational video, and a control group, which received verbal instructions. The perception of falling risks was assessed by FRAQ-Brazil in the pre-test and after a 30-day follow-up. Student's t-test was used for dependent samples to compare intragroup means and for independent samples to compare intergroup means. The effect size was determined by Cohen's d. in the intragroup analysis, intervention and control groups had an increase in perception, with a statistically significant difference between pre-and post-tests. In the intergroup analysis, the control group showed a greater increase in the perception of falling risks in relation to the intervention group (p = 0.013), with Cohen's d of small effect. the use of an educational video and verbal instructions increased older adults' perception of falling risks, with better results in the control group. However, the effect size was small. RBR-8nfggd. ","7":"To analyze which factors may be associated with the quality-of-care transition of children with chronic diseases from the hospital to their home. A cross-sectional, quantitative study, carried out in two hospitals in Southern Brazil, from February to September 2019. Participants included 167 family members of children with chronic disease. Data collection took place through a demographic questionnaire, and the use of the Brazilian version of the Care Transitions Measure (CTM-15). The average score for the quality of care transition was 90.1 (sd = 19.5) (0-100). Factor 1, \"Health management preparation\", was the one with the highest self-perceived average, 92.3 (sd = 11.6), while Factor 4, \"Care plan\", had the lowest average, 86.3 (sd = 21.3). The quality of care transition was higher for patients living in municipalities belonging to health regions other than the hospital's. The quality of care transition for children with chronic diseases, perceived by the children's family members, in the discharge process from the hospital to home, was considered high. Living in a health region other than the hospital's region was associated with better perception of the quality of care transition. ","8":"To analyze the microbiological and microstructural part of indwelling urinary catheters and their association with urinary tract infection prevention. This is a cross-sectional study, from June to December 2020, in which 42 indwelling urinary catheter tips and sterile urine samples were collected for analysis of crystals in optical microscopy and biofilms in scanning electron microscopy. Culture analysis and specification of the type of bacteria were performed. It was found that 35.71% of the samples had mature biofilm adhered to the catheter tip. Biofilms of Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterobacter cloacae stood out. The presence of magnesium-ammonium-phosphate crystal was associated with the presence of urinary tract infection and with Proteus mirabilis. There was a significant association (p = 0.001) between the use of prophylactic antibiotics versus urine culture &gt;105 CFU\/mL. The analyzes contributed to clinical practice, as it reinforces the development of effective and monitored strategies on cultures and urinary tract infection prevention associated with indwelling urinary catheters.

Applied, pedagogical intervention study conducted with twenty-three students of a secondary technical nursing course; questionnaires, focal group, and thematic content analysis were employed. Intervention, collectively built by manager, nursing teachers, and researchers, is assessed to have led to a problematization of the concepts of education and continuing and permanent education. The following thematic categories emerged from the analysis: Prior knowledge of students and understandings of the classroom intervention; Relation between permanent education and educational welcome in health units; Ethics concerns and the articulation of care practice and theory; and Work process and approximations to permanent health education. The pedagogical intervention is assessed to have favored the critical reflection of the aspiring nursing technicians on permanent health education and the need for a collaborative pedagogical planning for aligning the health team's work process. ","11":"To examine the effect of breastfeeding educational intervention given in the antenatal period on LATCH and breastfeeding self-efficacy scores. A total of 80 pregnant who met the research criteria were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 40) or control (n = 40) groups. Pregnant women received to the control group received only standard care while breastfeeding education was accepted to the intervention group along with standard care. Both groups were visited at their home, and the personal data form, the LATCH Breastfeeding Assessment Tool, and Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) were applied in the postpartum 1st week. End of the study, brochures prepared by the researcher were given to both groups. The mean breastfeeding self-efficacy and LATCH scores were higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. Breastfeeding success was found to increase as the maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy perception increased. Breastfeeding education given in the antenatal period increased maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy perception and breastfeeding success in the postpartum 1st week period.Study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04757324. ","12":"The objective of this study was to elaborate theoretical propositions to help understanding the Systematization of Nursing Care as a distinct phenomenon of the Nursing Process. It is a reflective, theoretical study that presented two categories: \"Systematization of Nursing Care: seeking differentiating contours\" and \"Systematization of Nursing Care: seeking defining contours\". It was identified that the systematization is not concerned with guiding the professional nursing care itself, since this issue, together with the guidelines regarding the elaboration of clinical documentation resulting from the implemented nursing care, is related to the process. Despite what the Systematization of Nursing Care is, the idea is that it is a field of knowledge that, through its three pillars and constituent elements, supports the structuring of nursing services and, consequently, the organization or reorganization of professional work in nursing. It is concluded that systematization, in the light of the theoretical propositions presented here, is an area of knowledge that represents a particular way of carrying out the management of nursing services when the three pillars that compose it are considered.","13":"To develop and validate an instrument for nursing consultation with pediatric patients in the preoperative period. This is a methodological study, consisting of five steps: identification of nursing diagnoses, discussion and evaluation of diagnoses with nurses from the institution, instrument development, instrument content validation with experts through the Delphi Technique, and instrument restructuring. The Nursing Minimum Data Set, Wanda Horta's human needs, and the NANDA-NOC-NIC connections were used as theoretical framework. In its final version, the instrument includes an assessment of psychobiological, psychosocial, and psychospiritual human needs, 38 nursing diagnoses, 65 nursing interventions, 113 nursing activities, and 62 nursing outcomes. The instrument obtained a content validity index between 0.90 and 1.0 in the first round, and suggestions, validated in the second round, obtained agreement from 70 to 100%. The instrument developed can be a tool for use in nursing consultations in the preoperative period for children, providing greater assertiveness to nursing actions for this clientele.

This is a participatory action qualitative study, based on the methodological theoretical precepts by Paulo Freire, which consists of three interconnected phases: Thematic Research, Coding and Decoding, and Critical Unveiling. Three virtual Culture Circles were held between February and March 2021, with 11 nurses from Primary Health Care, residing in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Nurses defined two themes for discussion in the Culture Circle: 1. Matches in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, representing the potentialities; 2. Mismatches in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, in which the weaknesses were revealed. Nurses indicated potentialities such as teamwork, with hope, motivation, and joy in the vaccination campaign operationalization, through innovative and old actions. They also highlighted weaknesses such as lack of specific training and communication, difficulties with recording and application of the immunobiological, mentioning the anti-vaccine movement and the intense work, which requires adjustments to improve assistance to the population.

Twelve (12) nursing professionals participated in the study. Nursing practices are portrayed from two thematic categories: \"Embracement: emotional and informational support\" and \"Assessing and monitoring gestational risk\". The findings revealed intentions to embrace women, providing informal and emotional support, but under weaknesses in intersubjective relationships. There is an emphasis on \"technical success\", not always sufficiently articulated with \"practical success\" in care actions, with harm to achieving comprehensiveness. The findings revealed that an emphasis on the biomedical management of obstetric risk and structural and organizational limitations of work end up hindering incorporating into daily care the concerns and knowledge necessary for constructing its comprehensiveness.

This is an observational analytical study performed using a digital stopwatch. It was conducted in a teaching hospital between 2015\/2016. The interventions performed and their interruptions were mapped and classified according to the Nursing Interventions Classifications (NIC) taxonomy. There were 492 interruptions recorded in the 107 hours observed, especially in indirect care interventions. They were mainly caused by nursing professionals (n = 289; 57.3%) to supply materials (n = 65; 12.8%) and exchange care information (n = 65; 12.8%). The duration of interruptions ranged from 0:08 to 9:09 (average 1:15; SD 1:03) minutes. On average, interventions took 2:16 (SD 0:27) minutes to complete without interruption; however, the average was 5:59 (SD 3:01) minutes when interrupted. The interruptions were constant during the nursing work in the chemotherapy unit, including during the preparation and administration of medications, and increased the time to complete the interventions by an average of 163.9%.

Prospective study carried out at a mental health outpatient clinic and two Psychosocial Care Centers, with patients and relatives responding to the Family Questionnaire - Brazilian Portuguese Version, a form containing socio-demographic and clinical variables and a structured script to assess relapses. A logistic regression model was used for the analysis. A total of 89 dyads participated in the study. Of the patients investigated, 31% presented relapses and, among the relatives, 68% presented elevated levels of expressed emotion. The relationship between expressed emotion and the relapses was not significant. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that when there were a higher number of hospital admissions in the two years preceding the study, the chance of the patient relapsing in the 24-month period is 1.34.

METHOD A qualitative study incorporating the theoretical-methodological reference of institutional analysis. The data were produced through focus groups and organized from transcription, transposition and reconstitution. Seventeen (17) focus group sessions were conducted involving six municipalities and health professionals from various backgrounds. RESULTS 137 professionals participated in this study. User embracement has been carried out with the aim to organize spontaneous demand. Doctors have not been directly involved, although they have the final say. Intermediate nursing deals with the users and nurses perform important negotiation work among the network sectors. The receptionists and the community agents develop the first approach to the users, forwarding them to nursing to negotiate the service. Managers hope to avoid complaints by attending everyone. Users take advantage of party politics and of the media for services when there is no access. CONCLUSION User embracement is an analyzer, since it produces visibility and readability of the relations being produced in health services, and when analyzed can lead to denaturalizing these actions.","655":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of instrumental sacred music and sacred music with vocals on the spiritual well-being of bereaved relatives.

After decades of fragmentation and depersonalisation of care, associated with the shift of birth to a hospital setting, pressure by midwives and mothers prompted government review and a relatively radical turnaround in policy. However, the emergent model of care has been profoundly influenced by concepts and technologies of monitoring. The use of such technologies as ultrasound scans, electronic foetal monitoring and oxytocic augmentation of labour, generally supported by epidural anaesthesia for pain relief, have accompanied the development of a particular ecological model of birth - often called active management -, which is oriented towards the idea of an obstetric norm. Drawing on analysis of women's narrative accounts of labour and birth, this article discusses the impact on women's embodiment in birth, and the sources of information they use about the status of their own bodies, their labour and that of the child.

Currently there are several recommendations for its prevention, however, when approaching the kind of solute used in the urinary meatus prior to catheterization doubts continue to persist. Thus this study aimed at determining the effectiveness of cleaning the urinary meatus with water or saline comparing to its sterilization through a systematic review and meta-analysis. In order to do so, the principles proposed by the Cochrane Handbook were followed, a critical analysis was conducted by two researchers and the statistical analysis was performed with the use of STATA 11.1. We concluded that the cleaning or disinfection of the urinary canal prior to bladder catheterization is not statistically significant (OR=1.07, CI 95%=0.68-1.68, p=0.779) and that there is some evidence that the use of water\/saline reduces rates of UTI (urinary tract infection).

The study objectives are to review the assumptions of dialectical and historical materialism (DHM) and discuss the implications of dialectics for a literature review and the synthesis of evidence. DHM is a powerful framework for knowledge generation and transformation of policies and practices in healthcare. It assumes that social contradictions underlie the health-disease process, the fundamental theoretical construction in the field of collective health. Currently, we observe a considerable influence of the critical paradigm, of Marxist origin, in the construction of knowledge in health. Studies based on this critical paradigm incorporate complex methods, which are inherent to the guidelines of dialect, to identify the object and arrive at results that constitute evidence in healthcare. Systematic reviews should address the methodological difficulties associated with entirely integrating these results to healthcare.

It proposes that the vulnerability of children is analyzed by means of the following dimensions: individual , which is related to ongoing nurturing relationships, physical protection and security; social , which concerns the social insertion of family and access to rights of social protection and promotion; and programmatic , which involves the political-programmatic scenario and the guidelines and political-programmatic implementation. The practical application of this matrix allows apprehending the health-disease process beyond the individual dimension, enabling the articulation of public policies and actions of professionals to achieve effectiveness in meeting the needs of children. The use of this conceptual matrix can provide to health teams a specific understanding of the adverse situations to child development as well as subsidizing intervention plans based on the analytical dimensions of vulnerability.

The following instruments were used to interview 110 caregivers: a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Social Network Index, the Medical Outcomes Study, and the Barthel Index. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare dimensions of social support and the qualitative variables as well as to determine the Spearman correlation for the quantitative variables. Caregivers who could not read or had never studied showed better perception of social support in all dimensions except the affective. In the positive interaction dimension, groups who had a partner and denied being overloaded showed a higher average than others. In addition, the number of family members and friends correlated with all dimensions of social support.

Eighteen workers participated in semi-structured interviews, analyzed after transcription. In the content analysis, we identified two themes: The slowing and quickening of service and The (un) preparedness to learn and teach. The results point to a process of teaching-service partnership still under construction, in which workers feel as though they are learning, but also feel devalued. The presence of the students changes the work dynamics, slowing it. At the same time, the presence of the students questions the hegemonic ways of rapid assistance. An expectation of collaboration in actions is evidenced, there being a preference for students in the last years of undergraduate courses, who perform procedures and do not require constant accompanying. We conclude that the approach between university and primary healthcare services exposes tensions which, collectively analyzed, can engender new ways of caring, teaching and learning.","1287":"This study evaluated individual factors relating to work and the organization, related to adherence to standard precautions for nurses working in intensive care.

The insecurity translates into dilemmas that referred to employability and the precariousness of the working conditions. In this context, employment in the family health strategy emerges as a mirage. One glimpses the need for a political agenda with the purpose of discussion about education, the labor market and the determinants of these processes. ","1314":"This research aimed to identify political-ethical skills developed in a training process compatible with the expected profile set by the National Curriculum Guidelines for the Undergraduate Nursing Degree. A case study was conducted with units represented by 32 former students from a particular religious teaching institution who already were in the job market. The content of the interviews was analyzed using the thematic analysis technique, which resulted in the following categories: \"Political-ethical skills in the formative process\" and \"Political-ethical skills as a product of the educational process.\" From the former students' perspective, these categories reinforced the social role of the nurse and the need for students to be reflective, understanding and participative in the transformation of society.

Three types of training are identified: uniprofessional, multiprofessional and interprofessional, with predominance of the first type. The first occurs among students of the same profession, in isolation; the second occurs among students of two or more professions, in parallel without interaction; and the third involves shared learning, with interaction between students and\/or professionals from different fields. The distinction between interprofessionalism and interdisciplinarity is highlighted: these refer to integration, respectively, of professional practices and disciplines or fields of knowledge. Through the analysis presented, it is concluded that in the Brazilian context, IPE (the basis for collaborative teamwork) is still limited to some recent initiatives, which deserve to be investigated.

The initial aim was to assess the target problem from a conceptual perspective and then to report the results of prevalence studies that formed the basis for investigations of the disease's economic impact. The purpose of the present article is to discuss the economic costs associated with PUs from both the global point of view (appraising their financial repercussion) and the individual point of view (addressing the intangible costs). Regarding the economic impact of the costs associated with PUs, the total cost of treatment per healthcare setting was estimated relative to the Autonomous Community of Azores. The total cost of all the PU categories was EUR 7,086,415 in the homecare setting, EUR 1,723,509 in the hospital setting, and EUR 1,002,562 in older people's homes. Therefore, the estimated total treatment cost of all the PU categories was approximately EUR 9,812,486 in Azores. However, the emotional impact of this disease imposes high costs on patients and their relatives as a function of the resultant suffering. Indeed, PUs impose high costs not only related to the treatment but also related to the intangible costs of the suffering caused to patients and their caregivers.

The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of disability and factors associated with disability outcome in 177 CLBP adults. Respondents were recruited from three health care service centers and answered questions from: Demographic Identification Form, Oswestry Disability Index, Chronic Pain Self-efficacy Scale, Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia, Beck Depression Inventory, and the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale. The prevalence of disability among the respondents was 65% (95% CI: 57.5 - 72.0), and disability was moderate to severe in 80.7% of them. The multiple regression model identified three factors as independently associated with disability: work situation, low self-efficacy and depression. The factors identified to be associated with disability are modifiable. Interventions such as work relocation, depression treatment and re-conceptualization of self-efficacy may have an important impact in preventing and reducing disability in chronic low back pain patients.","1456":"A randomized comparative study was performed to evaluate the control of hypertension with use of home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) and casual blood pressure measurement, and analyze the white coat effect. Hypertensive patients in primary health care units were randomly divided into two groups: group I, participating of the educational activities and group II that followed the routine treatment. The hypertensive patients from group I realized HBPM at the beginning and the end of the study. White-coat effect was evaluated by the difference between the casual blood pressure measurement and HBPM. The study included 290 hypertensive patients, but realized HBPM 82 hypertensive patients. There was increase in blood pressure control from the beginning to end of study in hypertensive patients from group I (p &lt; 0.05) measured by HBP (60% to 68.3%) and casual measurement (62% to 71%) and in group II, HMBP hypertension control was higher than the casual blood pressure measurement (63% vs 50%).

The aim of this manuscript is to examine some of the key strands of the extensive body of dignity scholarship and research literature as it relates to nursing ethics and practice. The method is a critical appraisal of selected articles published in Nursing Ethics and other key manuscripts and texts identified by researchers in the UK and Brazil as influential. The results suggest a wide and rather confusing range of perspectives and findings albeit with some overall themes relating to objective and subjective features of dignity. In conclusion, the authors point to the need for more sustained philosophical engagement contextualising human dignity within a plurality of professional values. Future empirical work should explore what matters to patients, families, professionals and citizens in different cultural contexts rather than foregrounding qualitative research with such a contested concept.","1459":"The objective of this reflection was to understand epidemiology as the theoretical-methodological framework for collective health nursing practice. This study is a bibliographic investigation which analyzed articles and books that point out the strengths and weaknesses of classic, social and critical epidemiology, with the purpose to examine their concepts in regards to nursing practice. The connections between the knowledge obtained from the above mentioned views of epidemiology which allow the creation of nursing interventions to change health realities are discussed. Critical epidemiology is supported by the recognition of the protecting processes and wearing determinants of the health-disease process experienced by different social classes. Hence, nurses should plan health interventions aiming beyond the identified illness, proposing interventions committed to changing historical and social processes, taking into account the unique, particular or structural dimensions that eventually determine the health-disease process in individuals or groups.","1460":null,"1461":"The peripherally inserted central catheter is a common technology employed in the intravenous therapy of neonates.

This study was performed at the emergency rooms of two hospitals in Curitiba. Interviews were performed with 261 elderly individuals, 56.7% of whom were women, and 43.3% men. Their ages ranged between 60 and 103 years, with most being younger than 70 years (44.8%). The most frequent trauma mechanisms were: falls (75.9%), being run over (9.6%), direct trauma (5.4%) and motor vehicle accident (3.8%). The multivariate analysis permitted the authors to affirm that the female gender, the presence of a caregiver, the utilization of continuous-use medication, and the presence of hearing impairment significantly increased the risk of trauma due to falls. Individuals having vision problems (without the use of glasses) and aged individuals with a monthly income of less than three minimum salaries tend to have a higher risk of suffering trauma due to falls. If the factors that greatly influence trauma among the elderly are evaluated during nursing appointments, it is possible to promote health interventions that favor their prevention.","1475":"The objectives of this study were to characterize the elderly living in a long-term care facility in terms of their medication use and verify the existence of polypharmacy. This descriptive quantitative study was performed using a database from the research: The profile of the elderly living in a long-term care institution for the aged: a proposal for nursing\/health action.

The idea of leadership is highlighted as inducing a movement in the division of the team as it is associated with the process of choosing leaders for an environment of communication, suitable for integrating the team and recognizing potential leaders.","1508":null,"1509":"The objectives of this study were to characterize the caregivers of elderly individuals with cognitive impairment living in different contexts of social vulnerability, and assess the family functionality of the elderly as perceived by the caregivers. Family functionality was evaluated using the Family APGAR instrument, assessed during home interviews with 72 caretakers. All the ethical aspects were observed. Spearman's correlation and the Mann-Whitney test were used, with 5% significance level (p&lt;0.05). Results show that 82% of caregivers reported a good family functionality, 14% reported moderate family dysfunction, and 4% reported high family dysfunction. A statistically significant correlation was found between Family APGAR and the number of people living in the house (p=0.048). Further studies could verify the relationship between family functionality and the caretaker's overload in the context of elderly persons with dementia.","1510":null,"1511":"The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors and associated complications present in clients with hypertension\/diabetes, enrolled in the HIPERDIA of the Executive Regional Health Department VI in Fortaleza, CE. This analytical documental study included 2,691 people. Of this total, 73.6% were women; 44.6% were between 60-79 years of age (mean age of 60.8 years); 87.4% were Caucasian, Asian or Pardo; 63.7% had eight or fewer years of education; 79.7% were non-smokers; 56.6% were considered sedentary; 59.6% were overweight\/obese; and 48.4% had a family history of cardiovascular disease. An association was observed between having a sedentary lifestyle and being overweight\/obese among patients with diabetes, and those with both diabetes and hypertension; family history of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension and those with both diabetes and hypertension; stroke, coronary artery disease and chronic renal failure in patients with hypertension and those with both diabetes and hypertension; and infarction and stroke in patients with diabetes. A family history of cardiovascular disease was associated with coronary artery disease and infarction. A relevant presence of risk factors and complications was found, highlighting the need for health education among clients.","1512":"This cross-sectional study examines a counseling program on healthy lifestyles run by health care professionals to establish the adoption of healthy dietary practices by patients attending a primary health care unit. Participants in the study included 417 clients of the unit, the majority of whom were women (78.9%), with an average age of 39 years, a high incidence of excessive weight, (59.1%), important dietary inadequacies, and with a contrastingly low frequency of receiving counseling (40.8%). Clients receiving counseling displayed more appropriate consumption of candy\/gum (p=0.031), soft drinks (p=0.036), salty foods (p=0.037), artificial flavorings (p=0.005) and eggs (p=0.010). Adoption of healthy dietary practices was more common among older individuals and women (p &lt;0.05). Despite the importance of nutritional counseling in dealing with such health problems, this was not prevalent, suggesting the need for greater intervention by health care professionals aimed at preventing and controlling disease and promoting good health.","1513":"The aim of this qualitative study was to analyze the experience of an incubation team in a supportive undertaking regarding mental healthcare clients. Interviews were conducted with seven team members, and the data were analyzed using content data analysis. The analysis revealed four categories: considering incubation as a process - learning and finding the meanings of support; pointing out the easy and difficult aspects in the process of constructing the undertaking; seeing results of the inclusion through work - noticing the clients' improvement; and pointing out the need for changes in the process, expecting greater autonomy of clients and formalization of the undertaking. The experience revealed itself as a new and fulfilling job for the team, allowing for learning, exchanging knowledge and attachment. We identified that the technician plays the role of educator\/facilitator of the process. In addition to the simple aspects and the recognition of the relevance of the work in terms of the clients' lives, the team faces challenges in generating satisfactory revenue.","1514":"This descriptive study was performed to identify the nursing diagnoses in the records of the inpatients of an adult intensive care unit, and map the most frequent diagnosis according to the Fundamental Human Needs. The sample consisted of 44 patient records. A total of 1,087 nursing diagnoses were identified. After excluding the repetitions, 28 different diagnoses were identified. Twenty-five diagnoses were related to psychobiological needs, and three to psychosocial needs. Further studies should identify, among the formulated nursing diagnoses and the affected human needs, which problems were solved and for what needs the care is predominantly developed. The present study results are important for the organization of teaching content for students and nurses, preparing them to consider human beings as a whole when providing care, considering their biological, emotional, and spiritual aspects.","1515":"This prospective study was performed in patients aged 65 years or older who underwent hip fracture surgery. The objective was to determine the functional evolution in a group of patients three months after hospital discharge, to identify the variables related to this functional recovery and to describe the associated mortality and institutionalization process. We analyzed demographic variables such as age, sex, and living situation. Other aspects considered included: comorbidity, cognitive impairment, walking ability, dependency level according to Barthel's Index, institutionalization, and mortality. The information was collected on admission and three months after discharge. Considering the entire sample, 89.6% was female and the average age was 83.56 years; 40% of patients regained their prior independence and a 16.7% mortality rate was registered, together with a slight progression toward institutionalization. The functional capacity and cognitive impairment of patients before the fracture are determinants of functional recovery and subsequent recovery of independence.","1516":"The present article refers to a qualitative study that was performed with the objective to identify and analyze the practice of healthcare professionals regarding rural women victims of violence, under the perspective of comprehensive care, in cities located in southern Rio Grande do Sul state. Participants were healthcare professionals and workers from health services who work in rural areas. The information was generated through interviews and analyzed using the thematic mode. In regards to care elements provided to rural women who are victims of violence, the study pointed out not only the relational strategies - welcoming, attachment and dialogue - but also the construction of collective actions through group activities, recognized as supporting health promotion, as well as individual and collective empowerment in the dimension of violent events. It was found that the professionals' care practices are aimed at focusing care on the rural women, establishing a relationship between the worker and client to produce comprehensiveness of care.","1517":"This study is founded on the phenomenology of Martin Heidegger, with the objective to understand the care needs of women infected with the human papilloma virus. Participants were fourteen women who had been diagnosed with this infection. The guiding questions were: What is it like to have this diagnosis? Tell me your experience, from when you received your diagnosis until today. What has your health care been like? The questions revealed the theme - seeking care as solitude - which showed the importance of the support of family and friends. The presence of the infection as the cause of marital conflicts and separation was another highlighted aspect. The statements showed that there was a sense of resignation after an unsuccessful attempt to find accurate and clear information in order to make assertive decisions. Health interventions for infected women must overcome the traditional models of care, including interventions for health promotion and prevention, with trained professionals who are sensitive to the subjective dimension.","1518":"Descriptive survey of daily practical experiences of pediatric nurses in the assessment and intervention to pain relief in children, during nursing care provided in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units, and the influence of the infrastructure of care and system organization. The sample was made up of 109 nurses. The principal results indicated that the majority of the nurses considered the academic training obtained as insufficient to support this aspect of nursing care; that they had not received local training in evaluating pain or in relief interventions; that the staff ratio is inadequate and as well as the availability of institutional guidelines to improve the quality of analgesia. It was concluded that nurses value the assessment and intervention to pain relief in children, but describe aspects which compromise practice: lack of collaborative practice, lack of processes definition, lack of formal and continuing education and lack of infrastructure. These aspects compromise the implementation of scientific evidences capable of improving practical aspects of analgesia in children under intensive care.","1519":"The objective of this study is to understand the maternal experience of caring for a technology-dependent child. We used the ethnographic case study approach, as well as the genogram, ecomap, open interview and observation methods as data collection instruments. The data were organized into three meaning units: the search for causes and culprits; hospital discharge and the demand for care; and the support networks. The study allowed for an understanding of the mother's experience of searching for explanations, as well as feelings of distrust, insecurity and dissatisfaction towards the health service provided. In addition, the mother's organization regarding the child's care and in terms of readying the home environment to receive the child, the use of support networks, and particularly the need for attachment with family and neighbors and the formal and informal search to assure the subsistence of her ill child as well as her other children were explored.","1520":"This qualitative study was performed using an ethnographic approach, with the objective to understand how children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease experience their disease and treatment, and describe the educational-therapeutic care from the perspective of transcultural nursing. Participants were eleven subjects undergoing dialysis treatment. The study phases followed the observation-participation-reflection model, complemented by interviews. The analysis was guided by the four phases of the ethnonursing guide, revealing the following categories: living with kidney failure and changes in everyday life; and the hospital environment and educational-therapeutic activities, which show the discomforts and difficulties that impact several dimensions of life, somewhat compensated by the therapeutic environment and the opportunity for leisure. Culturally consistent care was understood as an intentional intervention constructed by the interaction between scientific knowledge and the valorization of the cultural knowledge of children and adolescents and their families.","1521":"The objective of this study was to assess the difficulties experienced by Family Health Strategy nurses in implementing an educational intervention regarding developmental surveillance. A qualitative approach was used with the assistance of eleven nurses, who participated in developmental surveillance workshops in the context of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness. Data were collected from May to June 2009 and were analyzed on the basis of content analysis methodology, using the theme modality. Four thematic nuclei were identified: evaluation of the training course regarding developmental surveillance; difficult areas which hinder the application of the acquired knowledge; facilitating points provided by the course, and practice transformation based on the knowledge acquired during the training course. The study highlighted the urgency of incorporating contents that give priority to questions concerning the infants' developmental surveillance in undergraduate nursing education, as well as in the family health internship.","1522":null,"1523":"","1524":"The objective of this study is to describe the evolution of palliative care in order to reflect on the possibility of its origin in primitive cultures and their relationship with the beginnings of the cult of the dead. It describes the change in the symbolic structures and social interactions involved in palliative care during prehistory: functional unit, functional framework and functional element. The theoretical framework is based on cultural history, the dialectical structural model and symbolic interactionism. Categorization techniques, cultural history and dialectic structuralism analyses were performed. Palliative care existed in primitive societies, mostly associated with the rites of passage with a high symbolic content. The social structures - functional unit, functional framework and functional element - are the pillars that supported palliative care in prehistory societies.","1525":"Male urinary incontinence has been related to several factors, among which benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer treatment are highlighted. Urinary incontinence has negative effects on patients as well as on their relatives and caregivers. In the present study, an integrative review was performed with the purpose to identify the impact that urinary incontinence has on the lives of the patients' partners. The article survey was performed on the following databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and PubMed. Articles were included if they were written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, and excluded if they did not mention the patients' wives. The final sample was comprised of 15 articles from seven countries. The articles were distributed into the following categories: Psychological Distress, Fatigue, Change in Sex Life, and Limitations on Social Life. The category Psychological Distress was present in all articles and was rated as having the most impact on these women's lives.","1526":"The objective of this integrative review is to analyze the scientific production addressing the sexuality of women with breast cancer following mastectomy, focused on the effects that the physical discomfort due to cancer treatments have on their sex life. The search included articles published in the period between 2000 and 2009 on the MEDLINE, LILACS and PsycINFO databases, using the following descriptors: mastectomy, breast neoplasms, sexuality, sexual behavior, amputation, psychosexual development, and marital relations. Nine articles were selected, which addressed the effects of the physical discomfort from cancer treatments on the patients' sexuality. The findings revealed that, even when the patient's sex life is intense and fulfilling before the disease, factors such as stress, pain, fatigue, insult to body image, and low self-esteem due to the treatments may alter the sexual functioning of the affected woman. Healthcare professionals must be sensitized in order to welcome and include the topic in policies as well as in preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies.","1527":"The use of Bayesian statistical techniques is an approach that is well accepted and established in fields outside of nursing as a paradigm to reduce the uncertainty present in a given clinical situation. The purpose of this article is to provide guidance regarding the specific use of the Bayesian paradigm in the analysis of nursing diagnoses. The steps and interpretations of Bayesian analysis are discussed. One theoretical and one practical example of Bayesian analysis of nursing diagnoses are presented. It describes how the Bayesian approach can be used to summarize the available knowledge and make point and interval estimates of the true probability of a nursing diagnosis. It was concluded that the application of Bayesian statistical methods is an important tool for more accurate definition of probabilities related to nursing diagnoses.","1528":null,"1529":"This descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed in Santiago de Chile, with the objective to evaluate the scientific reasoning and the oral and written communication of nursing graduates. The sample consisted of 37 nursing graduates who participated in the three stages of the study: I) creation and validation of the instrument; II) training the faculty participating in the study to apply the instrument uniformly; and III) application of the instrument and data analysis. The data show different percentages regarding this competency, with the predominance of scientific reasoning (83.16%), followed by oral and written communication (78.37%). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the value for nursing schools to implement a formal evaluation that allows for determining the profile of nursing graduates, guaranteeing the quality of their training and education.","1530":"Bolivian nurses have not yet incorporated the scientific method and taxonomies into nursing care. This qualitative study aims at understanding the meaning that faculty and nursing professionals from the Department of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia) attribute to the nursing process. Data collection was performed through interviews and participant observation. The analysis was performed using the theoretical and methodological framework of Symbolic Interactionism and Grounded Theory, utilizing ATLAS.ti.6.0. The following topics emerged from the data: difficulties in implementing the nursing process due to a lack of preparation and training in leadership, dominance by physicians, lack of records, and poor support from the institution. Advantages were that it combines criteria and language and facilitates the autonomous role of nursing. In conclusion, nurses should establish their professional expectations regarding the implementation of the nursing process and care plans, which is a cultural change that involves faculty, management and clinical nurses.","1531":null,"1532":null,"1533":null,"1534":null,"1535":"The objective of this study was to explore the family planning demands that occur at the Psychosocial Care Center (Centro de Atendimento Psicossocial - CAPS) and investigate the contributions of this service to women with mental disorders.

No significant correlation was observed between network characteristics and the functional capacity of the elderly.","1540":null,"1541":null,"1542":null,"1543":"The objectives of this study were to describe a population of sex workers considering their sociodemographic characteristics, gyneco-obstetric history and behavioral factors, and to verify the association of these characteristics with the presence of sexually transmitted diseases. This epidemiological cross-sectional study was performed with 102 female sex workers. Data were collected using structured interviews and gold-standard exams for diagnosis of the diseases of interest. The women's mean age was 26.1 years. Most of them had attended school for nine years or more, were single and reported becoming sexually active before 15 years of age. Performing oral sex on partners was cited by 90.2% of women, and 99% reported the use of condoms at work; only 26.3% used condoms with permanent partners, and 42.2% used illicit drugs. No association was observed between sociodemographic factors, gyneco-obstetric history or behavioral factors and sexually transmitted diseases, which may have been due to their educational status and the fact that the population had very similar characteristics, thus making it difficult to determine such associations.","1544":null,"1545":"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of post-operative mediastinitis with the purpose to contribute to nursing care knowledge. To do this, an analysis was performed on 896 medical records of patients who underwent heart surgery involving sternotomy at the Cardiology Emergency Room of Recife-PE, in the period between June 2007 and June 2009. The following variables were considered: gender, age, type of surgery, personal history, length of stay, use of antibiotics, and culture of the surgical wound. A high death rate from mediastinitis was observed (33.3%). Several risk factors were identified, including: systemic arterial hypertension (80.9%); smoking (61.9%); diabetes mellitus (42.8%); and obesity (33.3%), most of which (76.2%) were identified in patients who underwent surgery for myocardial revascularization. It is concluded that mediastinitis is a serious infection that needs continuous nursing supervision and preventive measures to assure an early diagnosis and, thus, reduce mortality.","1546":"The objective of this paper was to identify critically ill patients at risk for pressure ulcer (PU) using the Braden scale and digital photographs. A sample of 42 subjects was evaluated for 15 days, between March and June 2009, in Fortaleza, Brazil. A total of 47 lesions were identified, 23 (48.9%) as stage I and 24 (51.1%) as stage II.

This cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed at the Family Health Strategy units of Uberaba, Minas Gerais with 85 nursing professionals, using two questionnaires. Data analysis was performed using frequency distribution and Spearman's correlation analysis. Most professionals said that they often addressed breastfeeding in the investigated practices. However, a poor correlation was observed between the frequency of this approach and the mean score on knowledge test. The nursing professionals' statements indicate that breastfeeding recommendations were provided regardless of their knowledge on the topic.","1554":"This documental study analyzed the Brazilian production of stricto sensu nursing graduate programs related to gestational hypertension. The data source used was the Brazilian Nursing Association Theses and Dissertations Database. The survey located 14 studies produced between 1979-2008, produced mainly in the Southeast region between 1996 and2008. The analytical process revealed a concern with the subjectivity of pregnant women and with aspects regarding nursing care. Furthermore, it showed that most studies used a qualitative methodology supported by nursing theories. The experience lived by pregnant women with hypertension is marked by negative feelings and socioeconomic problems, and is also affected by how the family is organized. The culture of pregnant women with hypertension is disregarded and they receive care in a context in which the disease is the priority. In conclusion, despite some scientific advancements, this topic has not raised the interest it deserves among nurses attending graduate study programs.","1555":"The present study investigated the effects of infertility on the spouses' relationship, with the objectives to describe the profile of the studied population, and analyze the effects of infertility on their emotional, sexual and marital life. To do this, a cross-sectional and prospective study was performed in a specialist institution. The sample consisted of 50 infertile couples with a mean of six years of infertility. The women manifested negative feelings in view of the infertility, while the men assumed an attitude of support. The effects on the couples' sexual life were more pronounced in women, and the infertility treatment resulted in positive changes for both spouses. No differences were found regarding the effects of infertility between the women who had undergone more than one treatment and those undergoing treatment for the first time; between the men there were differences in the emotional aspect (frustration and relief) and in the marital relationship (strengthening and maturing).","1556":"","1557":"This descriptive-reflexive study was performed with the objective to present the characteristics of researchers who use the Grounded Theory method, and outline the development of aptitudes for the researcher to become a Grounded Theoretician. The theoretical discussion was based on the frameworks of this methodology and supported by the literature. The article presents the main demands of qualitative studies using Grounded Theory, and important behaviors, attitudes and characteristics developed by the researchers. It is concluded that learning about Grounded Theory involves more than operationalizing a group of procedures and techniques. It also involves facing challenges to change one's attitude as a researcher and develop new ways of thinking and researching, gathering knowledge based on data to form a theory.","1558":null,"1559":"This article reports, in a systemized and analytical way, the experience of an Outreach Program in the period between 2010 and 2011. The study focused on health education interventions as strategies to improve the adherence of individuals with insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), clients of a blood glucose self-Monitoring program. In addition, we intended to contribute to the reorganization of the program's working processes in the unit. Health education strategies were used in both educational groups and home visits, thus permitting the provision of care that was more individualized. Data regarding the clients were organized on a spreadsheet and in files for the Family Health teams, which made it easier to identify the patients, including those who were absent, helping to decentralize the care. By using health education strategies, we intended to contribute to a more comprehensive and emancipatory care of the clients, aimed at a continuous reflection of the workers regarding their practices.","1560":"The objective of this study was to characterize the Brazilian scientific production on the topical use of fatty acids in wound care, and to describe the effects of its administration in this process. This integrative literature review included articles indexed in Lilacs and BEDENF databases. Data collection was carried out in December 2010 using controlled descriptors and without publication date limitations. The sample consisted of nine articles, mostly concerning animal models and the use of different fatty acids mixtures. Due to the lack of randomized clinical trials in human beings and the limitations of this review, it is not possible to generalize that essential fatty acids have a positive effect on the healing process or have antimicrobial effects on wound healing. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct studies of higher methodological rigor, comparing the different formulas available with fatty acids and their effects on the healing process.","1561":"The objective of this study is to reflect on the knowledge, competencies and skill that must be promoted during the academic education of nurses for an effective professional practice in view of a multiple-victim incident (MVI). This is an integrative literature review regarding academic nursing education. The literature survey was performed on the BDENF, LILACS, SciELO, MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge and HighWire Press databases, using the following descriptors: higher education; nursing education; emergency nursing; and mass casualty incidents. The publications permitted considerations regarding the following themes: particularities; competencies and skills essential in nursing practice in view of multiple-victim incidents; and the professors' strategies to promote those competencies and skills. The literature analysis demonstrated that nursing education should be configured as a space to develop critical thinking skills, which requires professors to have an eclectic educational background.","1562":"The objective of this study was to build and present a theoretical definition of the concept of nursing care management in hospital settings, based on specific literature. We chose to use Concept Analysis strategies for building concepts, the rules of Archeological Analysis for forming concepts, and Lexical Analysis as the theoretical-methodological framework. The operationalization of the strategies and rules for forming the concept permitted the construction of the concept of nursing care in hospital settings. The constructed concept presented, by its nature, the capacity to form a dialectic integration of the aspects relative to the knowing-doing of care and management. The theoretical definition of the concept of Nursing Care Management in Hospital Settings assigned meaning to the term, in the initial context of the construction of a theory of Nursing Care Management in Health Services.","1563":null,"1564":null,"1565":null,"1566":null,"1567":"The objective of this study was to identify vulnerability to tuberculosis (TB) related to knowledge about the disease among 76 nursing students and professionals.

Using a self-administered questionnaire and factorial analysis, four constructs were identified and validated. The final results were obtained through three different analyses: 1) descriptive statistical analysis; 2) analysis of variance; and 3) multiple regression. The construct that showed the highest intensity of perception regarding moral distress was the lack of competency in the work team (4.55), followed by the nurse's denial of their role as patient advocate (4.30), therapeutic obstinacy (3.60) and disrespecting the patient's autonomy (3.57). Regarding the perception of the frequency of moral distress, once again, the highlighted construct was the lack of competency within the work team (2.42), followed by therapeutic obstinacy (2.26), the nurse's denial of their role as patient advocate (1.71) and disrespecting the patient's autonomy (1.42).","1570":"The daily practice of Community Health Agents (CHAs) is permeated with educational interventions aimed at preventive care and health promotion. The sociocultural universe of these professionals can affect the dynamics of their practice within the community, particularly in rural areas, where there is evidence that the population expects to obtain information relative to their health and\/or disease by means of cultural rites. Based on a case study, we sought to analyze the influence of the cultural practices of the agents working in a rural area in the interior of the state of Minas Gerais. The analysis revealed the presence of a strong connection between the culture and their activities. Religious beliefs and knowledge developed from the fusion of biomedical information and values based on family tradition regarding the health-disease process have a direct effect on their practices. It is emphasized that they have an important role as facilitators in the practice of health care, with a positive effect stemming from the similarity of their life experiences and inherited cultures with those of the clients, thus making it possible to develop effective interventions.","1571":null,"1572":"The objective of this intervention study was to map instituted and instituting movements present in the work of the Family Health Strategy in the development of their care practices.

The strata point to the intersection of education and legal institutions and the social and technical division of labor. Collective thinking in groups appeared to be effective in denaturalizing established processes and interrogating places, knowledge and practices.","1573":"The objective of this study was to understand the strengths and limitations of the process of nursing work at a health center in terms of recognizing the health needs of the population. The methodological framework used was social research in the qualitative perspective, with discourse analysis based on hermeneutics-dialectics and founded on the Theory of Praxis Interpretation of Community Health Nursing. The data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews, and the working processes of the teams were examined according to the Analyzing Flowchart of the Model of a Health Care Service. In conclusion, there are limitations in the daily working process of the nursing team regarding the recognition of the health needs of the population. Coping with these needs consisted of the identification of complications, relegating the social determinants of the poor life conditions associated with the health-disease process to a secondary concern.","1574":null,"1575":"The objective of this study was to identify the situations that cause pleasure or distress at work among the Community Health Agents (CHA) in a city in Rio Grande do Sul state\/Brazil. A qualitative study was performed with 24 agents as the participants. Data collection took place in 2009 through the use of focal groups, using the thematic analysis technique. The situations causing pleasure at work were: being recognized, solving problems, working with peers and being creative. Situations causing distress were: deficiencies in the health service; lack of knowledge regarding their roles; lack of recognition; the stress of teamwork; the obligation of living and working in the same area; daily living and becoming involved with the social problems of the community; and being exposed to violence, which resulted in fear. It was verified that there is a need for adopting interventions with a view to promoting better working conditions, professional satisfaction and the health of community agents.","1576":"The objective of this study is to verify the relevance and utilization of communication strategies in palliative care. This is a multicenter qualitative study using a questionnaire, performed from August of 2008 to July of 2009 with 303 health care professionals who worked with patients receiving palliative care. Data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. Most participants (57.7%) were unable to state at least one verbal communication strategy, and only 15.2% were able to describe five signs or non-verbal communication strategies. The verbal strategies most commonly mentioned were those related to answering questions about the disease\/treatment. Among the non-verbal strategies used, the most common were affective touch, looking, smiling, physical proximity, and careful listening. Though professionals have assigned a high degree of importance to communication in palliative care, they showed poor knowledge regarding communication strategies. Final considerations include the necessity of training professionals to communicate effectively in palliative care.","1577":"The objective was to identify, among parents of schizophrenics, elements of their daily life in coping with the disorder and the care offered and received through the health system. This is a field research, using thematic oral history. The parents of four patients with schizophrenia took part in this study. Interviews were conducted, recorded and transcribed, based on three instruments (two specific questionnaires and a field diary). Three categories were identified that reflect difficulties experienced in daily life: limitations in knowledge about schizophrenia; fatigue and burden with impairment of quality of life; and uncertainly about the future and resilience strengthened by faith in God. The concept of care was associated with technical procedures, revealing general satisfaction with the care received. The suffering related to living with schizophrenic relatives is intense, and professionals must be prepared to deal with these experiences of pain and suffering from patients with mental disorder and their relatives.","1578":"This qualitative study was developed with 117 healthcare professionals and undergraduate students who were participants of a non-verbal communication training program in gerontology, with the objective to identify the perception and understanding of healthcare undergraduates and graduates regarding aging and the elderly. The results allowed the construction of the following categories: an evolution of life that brings a variety of experiences; natural, mysterious and with accumulated experiences; a decrease in overall happiness due to an increase in isolation; a time of valuing affection and respect; an inevitable stage including distress, prejudice, and limitations worthy of attention; a natural consequence of life; and the presence of disease and the global physiological process. Regarding perceptions of the elderly, the answers were classified as positive, negative, mixed and neutral. We considered that the understanding regarding the elderly and aging was limited and pessimist, indicating a need to become aware that one's views affect the way we relate to others.","1579":null,"1580":null,"1581":"The objective of this study was to identify the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms by verifying the association between anxiety traits, current depression and anxiety symptoms in fibromyalgia patients.

This exploratory and qualitative study was performed at two municipal shelters in Rio de Janeiro. The data were collected through focal groups performed with 10 sheltered adolescents. The content analysis of the data revealed two categories: Motherhood in adolescence: the perspective of the sheltered adolescent and Being a mother at the shelter: positive and negative experiences. Being a mother during adolescence is an ambivalent experience for the sheltered adolescents. The shelter is described as a supportive environment, but difficulties still exist in helping them to construct a healthy image of motherhood. There is a need to sensitize the social actors involved in terms of creating intersectoral interventions regarding the context and lifestyles of these youths, which could prevent vulnerability\/disaffiliation of mother and child.","1588":"The objective of this cross-sectional and quantitative study was to identify the prevalence and determinants of exclusive breastfeeding among infants less than six months of age in the city of Serrana, Sao Paulo, Brazil in 2009. A validated semi-structured questionnaire was administered to the guardians of the children less than six months of age who attended the second phase of a Brazilian vaccination campaign against polio. Univariate and multivariate analysis presented in odds ratios and confidence intervals was accomplished. Of the total of 275 infant participants, only 29.8% were exclusively breastfed. Univariate analysis revealed that mothers who work outside the home without maternity leave, mothers who did not work outside the home, adolescent mothers, and the use of pacifiers have a greater chance of interrupting exclusive breastfeeding. In the multivariate analysis, mothers who work outside the home without maternity leave are three times more likely to wean their children early. Results provide suggestions for the redirection and planning of interventions targeting breastfeeding.","1589":"","1590":null,"1591":"The hospitalization of a newborn separates mother and child at a time when their contact is essential for developing the mother's role.

The literature presents techniques for treating engorgement, but there is no agreement as to which is the best treatment. The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the evidence found in the literature regarding non-pharmacological treatments to relieve breast engorgement symptoms during breastfeeding. We performed an integrative literature review of studies published since 1990, on MEDLINE and LILACS, using the keywords: breastfeeding, lactation disorder and therapy. We found ten studies: two systematic literature reviews, seven randomized controlled trials and one quasi-experimental study. The analyzed studies show conflicting results and there is not enough evidence to recommend the implementation of the evaluated treatments. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine effective therapies for treating breast engorgement.","1596":"This theoretical study proposes a reflection on the intrinsic resistance of the subclass Coccidia, particularly the genus Cryptosporidium, considered to be potential pathogens for immunocompromised patients, and the implications for nursing practice. Currently, the international and national guidelines support the chemical disinfection of digestive system endoscopes after their cleansing as a safe and effective procedure. However, studies show that microorganisms of the subclass Coccidia, namely Cryptosporidium, responsible for enteric infection, are more resistant than mycobacteria and are not inactivated by high-level disinfectants, except for hydrogen peroxide 6% and 7.5%, which are not currently available in Brazil. We conclude that the legislation should include this agent among test microorganisms for approving high-level disinfectants. Health authorities should make efforts to ensure that healthcare institutions have access to effective disinfectants against Cryptosporidium.","1597":null,"1598":"The objective of this study is to analyze the process of producing reflexive narratives on nursing students' portfolios.

Data were obtained through the free association of words, and consisted of an excerpt of a study founded on the Social Representations Theory developed with HIV-negative women living in the state capital and cities in the interior of Bahia. The correspondence factor analysis showed significance for the variables: origin, education level and time spent in common-law marriage. Their acceptance of marital affairs emerged as a vulnerability factor for respondents with one to five years spent in common-law marriage, living in cities in the interior. Women from the capital, with 6-10 years spent in common-law marriage, reported monogamy as a form of prevention. Women with a longer common-law marriage who had completed only a primary education reported feeling invulnerable, which was the opposite of those with one to five years in common-law marriage with a secondary education. Results show there is a need for more interventions aiming to denaturalize the socio-cultural coercions that generate representations and make women in common-law marriages more vulnerable to AIDS.","1612":"Tuberculosis remains a pubic health challenge.

The study promoted the development of an acceptability percentage scale for the interval, which indicates the extent to which the nursing service meets the clients' expectations.","1634":"The professional history of nursing graduates allows for understanding and reflecting on higher education and the characteristics inherent in the job market. The objectives of the present study were to analyze the perceptions that nursing graduates of a private university have regarding their development process, focusing on the conditions of entering the job market and the demands they deal with in their professional life. The Collective Subject Discourse was the method of choice used in this study. Participants included 104 graduates who were divided into three groups according to their position after graduation. Discourse analysis allowed for deep reflection regarding their preparation, indicating the need to review the pedagogical project, particularly in terms of developing competencies in the four dimensions of care: management, healthcare, education, and research.","1635":null,"1636":null,"1637":null,"1638":"This study was performed with the objective to identify the prevalence of colonization by Staphylococcus aureus in nursing professionals from a teaching hospital in Pernambuco, and evaluate the resistance profile of these isolates. To do this, we performed a cross-sectional study where biological samples were collected from the hands and nasal cavities of the subjects. S. aureus was identified using agar (blood agar and mannitol salt) via catalase and coagulase tests. The sensitivity profile was determined by Kirby Bauer technique and determination of methicillin resistance was performed with oxacillin screening with sodium chloride (NaCl) addition. Of the 151 professionals evaluated, 39 were colonized which showed a prevalence of 25.8%. Among the variables studied, age and use of PPE were associated with colonization by the organism. Of all the isolates, only five were resistant to methicillin.","1639":null,"1640":"The objective of this study was to present a panoramic view of the scientific production regarding Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS). This literature review was performed using the LILACS, MEDLINE, and SciELO databases. Sixty-eight references were selected, most of which were journal articles (88.24%) and studies related to final graduate study essays (10.29%); 75% of the references found dating from 2003 were included. The following are highlighted among the most frequent objectives: the analysis and evaluation of the new proposal for mental health care, represented by Psychiatric Reform and by CAPS, and the analysis of mental health professionals and their expectations towards the services.

Data analysis was performed according to the hermeneutic-dialectical perspective and resulted in three nuclei of meaning: recognizing the possibility of having access to basic health care together with the desire to consume services of greater complexity and understanding the shortcomings of the State; attachment and welcoming as fundamental elements in the feelings of support and security and autonomy permeated by the tranquility to deal with the disease and the difficulties imposed by conditions inherent to the subjects' life style. Therefore, it is understood that the Family Health Strategy has been complying with its role in terms of the access to the healthcare system and regarding the professional-user attachment. However, health care continues to be centered on the disease rather than the individual.","1643":null,"1644":"This clinical randomized trial was performed with the objective to evaluate the stress levels of the nursing staff of a hospital and analyze the effectiveness of auriculotherapy with needles and seeds. The 75 participants with mean (44\/58.7%) and high (31\/41.3%) scores according to the Stress Symptoms List were divided into groups (control, needles, and seeds), who received eight sessions on the Shenmen, Kidney and Brainstem points and were evaluated at the baseline, fourth and eighth sessions and on the 15-day follow-up session. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences among the groups at the third assessment (F=3.963\/P=0.023) and follow-up (F=6.136\/P=0.003). These differences occurred between the control and needle groups. The 'seeds' and needles groups both showed differences (p&lt;0.05) at the second assessment when compared within the same group. In conclusion, auriculotherapy reduced the stress in the nursing staff, with needles showing better results than seeds for high scores, maintaining the effects for 15 days.","1645":"The objective of this study was to verify the effect of acupuncture on the sleep quality of obese workers in a teaching hospital. Data were collected from July to October 2009, focusing on 37 workers who attended eight weekly acupuncture sessions. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess their sleep quality before and after the intervention. Results show that before the intervention, five (13.5%) people experienced good quality of sleep whereas at the end of the study 14 (37.8%) showed this condition. Statistic significance (p=0.0001) was found in comparing the mean scores obtained before and after acupuncture. Acupuncture had effects on the quality of sleep in the studied sample, presenting itself as a complementary technique for treating sleep disorders and consequently improving the quality of life in this population.","1646":"This qualitative study was performed at the adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a public hospital in Southern Brazil with the objective to evaluate the implemented welcoming strategies. Participants included 13 patients and 23 relatives. Data collection was performed from July to October 2008, utilizing semi-structured interviews. All interviews were recorded. Data analysis was performed using the Collective Subject Discourse. The collected information yielded two discourses: the family recognized the welcoming strategies and the patients found the ICU team to be considerate. By including the family as a client of nursing care, relatives felt safe and confident. Results show that by committing to the responsibility of making changes in heath care practices, nurses experience a novel outlook towards ICU care, focused on human beings and associating the welcoming to the health care model that promotes the objectivity of care.","1647":null,"1648":null,"1649":"The objective of this study was to learn about the everyday eating behaviors and the social status of the families of malnourished children. This qualitative study involved eight families. Data were collected by participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis revealed the following themes: family eating; the family's social status and eating during childhood; and the presence of social programs and equipment. The family did not gather for meals and their food consisted basically of different sources of carbohydrates. Fruits and vegetables were very limited and considered to be food choices that did not provide sustenance. Differences were observed between the family's' and the children's' eating habits. Social programs and equipment provided important support, especially regarding the positive attachment with institutions and professionals and following the children's health. The family's social status does not allow the offering of appropriate quantities and quality of food throughout the month, thus compromising the nutritional status of the children, who are deprived of appropriate foods of adequate nutritional value.","1650":"The objective of this study was to understand the meaning of being a nurse and providing care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of a general hospital in Southern Brazil, developing an explanatory theoretical model. The Grounded Theory and the Complexity Paradigm were used to develop the Theoretical Model: Caring for newborns in the NICU: Dealing with the fragility of living\/surviving in the light of complexity. Data was collected from 11 subjects through an open interview, and organized using NVIVO software. A central category was identified: Dealing with the fragility of living\/surviving: a care that is highly complex, sensitive, unique and shared. Care in the NICU, valuing the everyday interrelationships, aims to address all domains of complex health care, integrating and applying scientific knowledge. It is necessary to practice the strengths already inherent to nursing professionals, in addition to pursuing new strengths, an invitation to new models of care for newborns, their family, and the members of this complex system.","1651":"The objective of this study was to assess the hope in the lives of HIV-positive women, using the Herth Hope Scale (HHS). Participants were 111 HIV-positive women who attended a referral outpatient clinic in Fortaleza-CE. From January to May 2009, interviews were held to collect biopsychosocial variables, and the HHS was applied. Data were analyzed using SPSS-8.0 and revealed an average hope index of 34.86, indicating that these women have little hope in life in view of their diagnosis of HIV. The scale item with the highest score was faith. This probably derives from the fact that Aids is incurable, transmissible and generates negative stigma, in addition to its relation with the idea of imminent death. In conclusion, measuring hope among HIV patients through the use of an instrument permits intervention assessment and planning, promoting assistance and motivation to live better and maintain a hopeful attitude.","1652":"This study was performed with the objective of understanding the reasons why workers of a birthing center in southern Brazil use natural birth practices considered harmful by the World Health Organization. This exploratory study was performed in July 2009 through interviews with 23 workers. The analysis revealed three themes: Actions and behaviors dependent on health workers; Routine practices as facilitators of work; and Restricting the parturients' participation in the decision-making process. Some justifications for using the practices were: perpetuation of inappropriate models, facilitation of the care provided during delivery and authoritarianism that some workers impose over parturients in the erroneous belief that workers have all the knowledge.","1653":"The objective of this study was to describe the reproductive profile of women with diabetes mellitus (DM) and to identify their knowledge regarding maternal and fetal risks and preconception care. This exploratory study was performed at the Integrated Center for Hypertension and Diabetes, from March to July 2009, on a sample consisting of 106 women. The variables were: number of pregnancies, births and abortions, and planning the pregnancy. The data were collected through interviews that followed a preconceived form. The reproductive profile of women with DM proved to be permeated with risks and showed negative repercussions to maternal and fetal health. Of the 106 (100%) women studied, 44 (41.5%) demonstrated adequate knowledge regarding preconception care, while 58 (54.7%) had limited knowledge regarding maternal and fetal risks. It is necessary to provide information to women with diabetes to promote knowledge of maternal and fetal risks and preconceptional care.","1654":"The objective of the present study was to compare perinatal outcomes in women aged 35 or older with women aged 20 to 34 years. This retrospective study was performed by reviewing the obstetric records of 1255 mothers who gave birth at the only hospital in Sarandi-PR, from January 2007 to December 2008. The analyzed variables were: marital status, education, gestational age at birth, type of delivery, newborn birth weight, Apgar score at one and five minutes and stillbirths. Logistic regression showed that advanced maternal age was significantly associated with adverse outcomes such as cesareans (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.19-0.44) and 5-minute Apgar scores below 7 (OR 5.78 95% CI 0.74-0.76). These results are important to show the risk of complications in pregnant women aged 35 years or older, and the need to provide guidance to women who wish to postpone pregnancy.","1655":"","1656":"The objective of this study is to report on the experience of constructing and using an instrument to collect and analyze theoretical-methodological references of studies, in systematic literature reviews. The goal is for researchers to have available an instrument that is appropriate for evaluating the studies that present their theoretical foundations, and for health professionals to have access to the theoretical explanations for study results and their applications in the practice of health care. The dissociation of theory from practice may lead to a lack of motivation at the work site and practices of repeating procedures without any awareness of the underlying concepts that base the interpretation of a health-disease phenomenon. Therefore we call on researchers to conduct reviews on the theoretical foundations of certain health-disease phenomena and we propose questions related to the inclusion criteria, critical appreciation and data extraction to be addressed in instruments.","1657":null,"1658":"The objective of this study was to analyze the knowledge on nursing interventions for hospitalized stroke patients. An integrative literature review was performed by accessing five online databases, in September 2009. The descriptors used in the search were nursing care and stoke, in Portuguese, English and Spanish. A total 223 articles were found, and 12 were selected. It was found in the articles that there was a greater number of clinical nursing interventions, followed by educational, managerial and research interventions. Clinical interventions are more related to the biological aspects of patients. As to the educational interventions, the articles point at the fundamental role of nurses, as well as that of relatives and caregivers. The main managerial intervention was the coordination of health care. As for research interventions, only one was identified and described as the development and improvement of health care practice through clinical evidence.","1659":"This systematic review on C-reactive protein (CRP) was performed with the purpose to identify its predictive value in the prognosis\/diagnosis of infection in surgical patients.

All studies found increased CRP levels after surgery in cases of postoperative infection (PO), in eight studies a CRP peak between the second and third PO was reported as normal aspect of the CRP curve, reducing in patients without postoperative complications and increasing in patients with complications. The meta-analysis revealed an average of 85% (sensitivity), 86% (specificity), the area under the SROC curve was 0.9060, and the Odds Ratio was 23.56. Along with other clinical interventions, CRP is considerably valuable in the prognosis\/diagnosis of postoperative infections.","1660":"The description of the supply and use of psychotropic drugs at the Centers for Psychosocial Care (CAPS) is relevant for the effectiveness of assistance from mental health services. The objective was to describe the use and supply of these drugs in CAPS types I and II, in Southern Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study, in which surveys were conducted, in May and June 2006, on the structural aspects of the referred service using charts of 1162 users, and self-applied questionnaires answered by 30 engineers working at CAPS where these users were being monitored. Users were identified as mostly female, adult, middle-aged, low economic status, mainly with a diagnosis of major depression and using antidepressants. It was also found that there might be a lack of distribution and supply of psychotropic drugs in the public health system (SUS) network, which affects the drug therapy of this specialized mental health service, given the socioeconomic conditions of the users.","1661":"The development of distance education is associated with the popularization and democratization of the accessibility to information and communication technologies. Nursing has been using this modality of education in both undergraduate and graduate courses, which has provided knowledge about other technologies, an easier accessibility, flexibility of time and space, and reduced costs. The objective of this study is map the national higher education distance nursing courses. This exploratory, descriptive study was developed by visiting governmental, non-governmental and institutional websites. Two undergraduate and nine graduate courses in nursing were found, which is considered to be a low number, considering that distance education is an appropriate pedagogical tool that permits to prepare a large number of nurses who are geographically dispersed and who do not have access to the conventional educational processes.","1662":null,"1663":"Medical device reprocessing is extremely important and complex, thus requiring both the operational skills for its implementation and the technical qualification of the professionals involved in the activity. The typical issues of medical device reprocessing involve technical, economical and regulatory aspects when involving either the so-called reusable articles or those considered as for a single use. The objective of the present study is to propose a new regulatory model for medical device reprocessing in Brazil that would, on the one hand, satisfy the requirements for quality and safety, as recommended in the literature and, on the other hand, prove to be operational under the conditions prevailing in Brazilian hospitals. The elaboration of the present normative proposal was based on the Consensus Conference technique among specialists in the area. Guided by the contribution of these specialists, a proposal is put forth of a regulatory model for reprocessing medical products, so as to address some previously identified gaps in the normative body currently used in Brazil.","1664":"The objective of this study was to learn the level of satisfaction that nurses have about their work. Participants were 34 nurses, who answered the Professional Satisfaction Index (PSI), translated and validated for the Portuguese language and adapted to home care. The following six components were analyzed: Interaction, Autonomy, Remuneration, Professional Status, Organizational Norms, and Working Requirements. The PSI found in the study was 13.19. This was a low value, considering the possible variation from 0.9 to 37.1, though it was greater than the satisfaction indexes found in other nurse studies.","1665":"The objective of this study was to learn the profile of workers in the economically active age group admitted from 1997 to 2007 to a hematology hospital, diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML); check which professions have the highest prevalence among the assisted workers who died; and identify the occupational risks compatible with the appearance of AML in the prevalent professions. This is a quantitative, exploratory study. Most profiles were characterized as originally from the agreste and the metropolitan region of the state of Pernambuco, male, white, and with incomplete primary education. The most common occupations were related to agriculture and domestic work, both of which involve the use of chemical substances that, according to literature, are possible factors involved in triggering the pathology.","1666":"The scrubbing of hands and forearms using antiseptic agents has been the standard pre-operative procedure to prevent surgical site infection. With the introduction of antiseptic agents, the need to use brushes for pre-operative disinfection has been questioned and it has been recommended that the procedure be abandoned due to the injuries it may cause to the skin. With the purpose to provide the foundations for the efficacy of pre-operative asepsis without using brushes or sponges, the objective of this study was to evaluate three methods of pre-operative asepsis using an antimicrobial agent containing chlorhexidine gluconate - CHG 2%; hand-scrubbing with brush (HSB), hand-scrubbing with sponge (HSS), and hand-rubbing with the antiseptic agent (HRA) only. A comparative crossover study was carried with 29 healthcare providers. Antimicrobial efficacy was measured using the glove-juice method before and after each tested method. Statistical analyses showed there were no significant differences regarding the number of colony-forming units when comparing HRA, HSB, and HSS techniques (p=0.148), which theoretically disregards the need to continue using brushes or sponges for hand asepsis.","1667":"The objective of this quantitative study was to identify stressing factors, level of stress in nurses, overall health conditions, and coping strategies used by nurses in the working environment. Data collection was performed using three instruments: a survey for daily activities, an inventory of coping strategies, and an inventory for overall health conditions. The population of this study was composed by 143 nurses, most of them with a low level of stress (55.25%) and with a regular health condition (50.35%). Regarding coping forms, problem solving was the factor of highest average. In conclusion, educational actions must be encouraged with an aim to offer tools for professionals to develop coping strategies in their everyday activities, thus minimizing the effect of stress on their health conditions and at work.","1668":"The objective of this study was to learn about the central nucleus of the social representations of caring and treating for patients and nurses. This qualitative study was founded on the theoretical-methodological framework of the structural approach of social representations. Participants were 90 subjects, who answered a questionnaire using the free association technique. Data analysis was performed using Evoc software. Results show that the social representations that patients and professionals have of the concepts of caring express an ethical, sensitive, solidary, affective and committed relationship with a loving human life. However, the representations of treating point at different meanings and different expectations. In conclusion, the difference between these representations is rather concerning and deserves special attention. Such discrepancy denounces that the service that the professionals have delivered does not meat the demand and desires of patients.","1669":"The objective of this study was to present the computerized structure that enables the use of the Nursing Activities Score (NAS) in mobile technology. It is a project for the development of technology production based on software engineering, founded on the theory of systems development life cycle. The NAS system was built in two modules: the search module, which is accessed using a personal computer (PC), and Data Collection module, which is accessed through a mobile device (Smartphone). The NAS system was constructed to allow other forms, in addition to the NAS tool, to be included in the future. Thus, it is understood that the development of the NAS will bring nurses closer to mobile technology and facilitate their accessibility to the data of the instrument relating to patients, thus assisting in decision-making and in staffing to provide nursing care.","1670":null,"1671":"The objective of this study was to identify the social representations that nurses have about technology applied to intensive care, and relate them to their ways of acting while caring for patients. This qualitative study was performed using social representations as the theoretical-methodological framework. Interviews were performed with 24 nurses, in addition to systematic analysis and thematic content analysis. The results were organized into three categories about the lack of technological knowledge, approach strategies, mastering that knowledge and using it. The knowledge necessary to handle the technology, and the time of experience using that technology guide the nurses' social representations implying on their care attitudes. In conclusion, the staffing policy for an intensive care setting should consider the nurses' experiences and specialized education.","1672":"Cross-disciplinary work in health is an important element to deliver comprehensive health care actions. The present study analyzed cross-disciplinary actions in intensive care according to Habermas. This case study was performed using a qualitative approach. The empiric material capture was collected by observing the setting and using semi-structured interviews with health workers. The information was analyzed using the meaning interpretation technique. The analysis revealed two thematic lines: individual instrumental care in view of the clinical inconstancy, and the collective care fragmented by functions. This result weakens the worker\/worker and the worker\/patient interactions and compromises the association between health actions. As it does not favor communicative actions, it becomes fragile and the strategic\/instrumental action is evinced.","1673":null,"1674":"The objective of this study is to analyze the knowledge that nurses from a large hospital in Recife, Pernambuco, have about Nursing Care Systematization (NCS). This is a descriptive, exploratory, quantitative study. The study population consisted of 107 clinical nurses, with a sample of 73 (68%). Data collection was performed in June 2008, using a semi-structured questionnaire that was filled out by the subjects. We found that 50 (69%) nurses had no knowledge about NCS, especially about nursing diagnoses. We identified the absence of forms in most hospitalization units. The nurses gave several justifications for their not working with NCS, including work overload and the scarcity of forms. We concluded that there is a need for more incentives by the institution and through policies, so as to permit nurses a greater autonomy in their practice.","1675":null,"1676":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) of adults with spinal cord injury and to identify the domains that may influence QOL.

A questionnaire with subjective questions was applied to identify the meanings of gestational hypertension and premature delivery for postpartum women. Results were analyzed based on the Theory of Social Representations. We observed the construction of a negative social representation, with death as the central nucleus and negative aspects as the peripheral nuclei. The latter derive from the risks the mother and fetus were exposed to during pregnancy and later in the postpartum period with the hospitalization of the child in the neonatal intensive care unit.","1688":"","1689":"There is increasing interest in the early years as a focus for reducing health inequalities as well as one that is important for the children themselves.

The goal is to provide a brief retrospective and analysis of the management mechanisms that have permitted the Psychiatric Reform to advance. This historic process is divided into three periods: the implementation of deinstitutionalization, the expansion of the psychosocial support network, and the consolidation of the reformist hegemony. It is verified that the Brazilian Psychiatric Reform advances as management mechanisms are created to increase the service network. Nonetheless, consolidating the territorial support network and increasing the resources of the annual mental health care budget of the national health system remain a challenge.","1695":"This article describes the process of the expansion of higher education in Brazilian nursing, highlighting the diversity and heterogeneity of the system. It is observed that teaching in this area developed in a very fast and disorganized fashion, as of the nineties. This growth resulted in great diversity and variety of educational institutions, which are aspects that also affect the profile of the faculty, particularly their title and working arrangements, which vary according to their institutional placement. It is argued that these aspects will, eventually, affect the faculty, and, thus, in the early nursing training, in the qualification of nurses, and, therefore, in the nursing care offered to users of different health services. In conclusion, it is necessary to identify the professional profile and the particular working processes, contextualized in the current setting of the public policies for higher education in Brazil.","1696":"This article presents the evolution and the contribution of the scientific production related to the concept of vulnerability and its potential to help studying transmissible diseases.

Reflecting upon the psychosocial and asylum ways regarding the conceptions of object and mode of work permitted to locate the group in a psychosocial manner, as knowledge and experience favor the autonomy of the individuals, who have more chances to face the difficulties that occur in their suffering-existence process.","1771":"The objective of this study is to reflect upon the vulnerabilities experienced by the families dealing with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus\/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV\/Aids), and is based on the pertinent literature. To do this, we attempted to propose consideration related to the plurality of families in contemporaneity, and present the understandings and development regarding the vulnerability framework to the Aids epidemics. Finally, the study presents a description of the reflections made about the vulnerabilities to HIV and\/or falling ill with Aids to which the families are exposed to in their personal, social and pragmatic levels. In conclusion, it is emphasized that knowing these specific vulnerabilities experienced by the families is essential in order to guide and develop the health care actions.","1772":"In this reflection we problematize the action of caring and teaching how to care in nursing based on some of Pierre Bourdieu's concepts about domination and symbolic power. The basic tenet of this work was to think of education as something vital for our existence on Earth. In this article, we used Pedro Demo's ideas as a reference to talk about education, which is understood as a developer of political subjects and as something far beyond formal knowledge management. It is the very first base on which human autonomy is built, and it leads to a constant growth of opportunities to exercise citizenship, qualifying our everyday existence. In the academic context, where health, education and nursing are all gathered, the competent, critical and reflective teaching work can be highly institutive praxis.","1773":"Currently, we are experiencing a paradigm shift in relation to how we understand health and care. The biomedical model has been replaced by a vision of an integral being, and care emphasis is being placed on health promotion and disease prevention. However, the discourse of personal responsibility for health can generate in patients feelings of guilt, shame, fear and paranoia, while in professionals it can cause feelings of powerlessness and frustration. These feelings disrupt attachments and, thus, reduce the effectiveness of care. The objective of this theoretical study is to propose a dialogue between Psychology, with social constructionist sensitivity, and Nursing, to examine the possibilities of improving care from this approach. As an alternative to the discourse of personal responsibility, relational responsibility and understanding health and care in the long time, lived time and short time, is proposed.","1774":"The objectives of this historical-social study are: to describe the circumstances that determined the participation of North American nurses in the formation of the Brazilian nurse; and analyse the process of implementing institutional rituals as a strategy of symbolic fight, to confer visibility to the nurse profession and discuss the symbolic effects of institutional rituals for the consecration of a nurse model for Brazilian society at the time. The primary sources are constituted of pertaining written and photographic documents relative to the studied theme. By reading the documentary corpus an analysis was made of the symbols that had distinguished and established the hierarchies of the actions, as well as the strategies undertaken for the North American nurses, towards implementing a new model of nurses in Brazilian society, coherent with the model of the North American schools of nursing. Institutional rituals, conducted or testified by prestigious figures of the history of Brazil and nursing, were fundamental for the construction of professional identity.","1775":"The objective of the following study was to analyze the conceptions that head nurses of a university hospital have about nursing communication management. It is a descriptive-exploratory study with an interpretative qualitative approach. The set of data was produced between September and October 2007 through interviews with 19 head nurses in a university hospital in Southern Brazil and submitted to thematic analysis. The nurses recognize the relevance of communication in nursing management, but have different perceptions: part of the research group understands communication from its interactive and dialogical perspective; others understand formal communication, based on the transmission and maintenance of standards and hospital routines, with emphasis on written communication. Further discussion about the triad communication, management and dialogue is required in order to build more interactive forms of hospital nursing care management.","1776":null,"1777":null,"1778":null,"1779":"The objective of this study is to describe the profile of the entering students as to gender, age, marital status, educational background (elementary and high school studies) and employment status of the first class of the Nursing Teaching Diploma Program in EERP\/USP, in the year 2006, highlighting their implications for the teaching-learning process.

The age group of the students is diverse, varying from 19 to 46 years old, most (67.5%) of them comes from public schools (high school studies), 42% work, of those, 67% already work in the health area. These data can influence in the pedagogical practice of professors.","1780":"The objective of this study is to identify the concept that nurses in the Amazon have on alcohol abuse and the forms used for management. Focal group and individual interviews were performed with all nurses of twelve family health teams from a city in the Amazon. It was observed there was a lack of university degrees, continuing education and of support\/reference - counter - reference towards the dimension of alcohol use in the studied population. There is need to reform nursing courses and perform continuing education for family health team members, and provide them with the necessary support regarding this important theme and its consequences, for individuals and their families, as well as for the society as a whole.","1781":"This study aimed to analyze the items of the Scale of Attitudes toward Alcohol, alcoholism and alcoholics in order to prepare a reduced version keeping the instrument's psychometric properties. The preliminary version of the Scale composed by 165 items was tested in a sample with 144 nursing student. The evaluation process of the items consisted of the total-item coefficient correlation and reliability of the instrument was estimated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Results indicate the permanence of 83 items, divided into five factors that showed satisfactory values in the different coefficients of internal consistency. Further studies are needed with larger samples in order to give continuity to the process of scale validation among health professionals.","1782":"With a view to the changes in psychiatric care, the objective of this study was to learn about the opinion of patients, users of a Psychosocial Care Center, about their treatment, their experience of living with a mental illness and its psychosocial implications. The results were then matched with their social-demographic and clinic profile. A descriptive exploratory study was performed, where 65 patients with mental illnesses being treated in a center in Pindamonhangaba-SP and 53 of their relatives answered a semi-structured questionnaire. The results showed that patients with mental illnesses and family problems recognize that the disease has changed their lives, but their opinion differ about the degree of difficulties they have in doing their everyday activities. Although they have been treated for years through this extra-hospital individualized system, they know little about their disease. It was observed that 62% of them have severe diseases, but both groups showed a special ability of dealing their adversities. This study contributes with important information for mental health nursing practitioners.","1783":"The objective of this study is to analyze the easy and difficult aspects of teamwork according to community health agents. Qualitative analysis was carried out from the hermeneutical and dialectic perspective; the reference point was the senses interpretation method. The strengths and weaknesses they pointed out revealed that working as a team requires emotional relationships, with emphasis on communication, respect and cooperation, and that team meetings is an important strategy to achieve this. In conclusion, there is a need for continuous investments in team member relationships.","1784":null,"1785":"This article discusses the legal structure of the municipal Health Councils in a Health County in the state of Sao Paulo comprising six municipalities. This descriptive and exploratory study was based on documental research according to federal laws for the creation, organization, structure and routine work of the health councils. Results were presented and discussed in categories. The health councils were created in 1991, and four of them have changed their legal instruments, two of them have innovated in some procedures, such as election of the director, administration non-coincident with local majors, administrative structure and commissions. Some council regulations are in disagreement with local and federal laws, such as the deliberative character, parity representation of users, internal regiment, municipal staff in charge of council directory, and no guarantee of administrative and financial support for routine work. It can be concluded that it is necessary to improve and correct regulations to guarantee a suitable performance of health councils and also to improve the discussion about social participation in the nursing curriculum.","1786":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the Quality of Life (QOL) of family caregivers of handicapped people attended at home by Family Health Teams and the relationship with their social support. Sixty-six family caregivers were interviewed using the WHOQOL-bref for a QOL evaluation and Zarit Burden Interview for the burden. The Social Relations domain of the WHOQOL-bref received the second best score within the domains of the instrument. During multiple linear regressions analysis, female caregivers, with low burden scores and who had received help from someone to perform the care, obtained the highest scores. Similarly, caregivers with partners had higher mean scores in the overall global assessment for QOL and health than those without partners. The results provide evidence of the influence of social support regarding Quality of Life and the burden perceived by family caregivers.","1787":"This qualitative investigation was supported by Foucault's analysis with emphasis on the notion of governability, and had the following objectives: to analyze the relationship between techno-biomedicine and bioethics as discourses of the contemporaneousness implied in the production of nurses' subjectivity within the context of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU); and approach the responsibility implied in health care as one of the unfolding strategies of technology of speech of bioethics and biotechnology, creating certain forms of the nurse understanding and intervening in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). From the perspective of the multiple ways that can emerge when analyzing a critical reading of analyzed texts and interviews with nurses, responsibility in health care was unfolded into categories that expressed the responsibility in front of new languages and of nursing as a guardian of certain attributes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).","1788":"The purpose of this study is to help improve nursing care to dependent people and their families. The study objectives were: to describe the degree of dependency of the elderly in the family context; to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of the dependent elderly in the family context; to describe the main cause of dependency in the aged at home. This is a exploratory, descriptive study with a quantitative approach. In the period comprised between October 2007 and June 2008, 108 families from a northern region of Portugal were selected, with an elderly dependent. It was a convenience sample. For the collection of information, we used a questionnaire with the Barthel Index. Results showed that older people are predominantly women, widows, in average 81 years old, with severe level of dependence, and the leading cause of dependence was circulatory system diseases.","1789":"The objective of this study was to characterize patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, according to sociodemographic and clinical variables, and to analyze scores of knowledge and attitudes regarding the disease. Participants were 79 users who received care in a primary health care service, in 2008. The Diabetes Mellitus Knowledge (DKN-A) and Attitude (ATT-19) questionnaires were used for data collection. The population was formed by adults and elderly adults, who were between 30 and 80 years old. Most were literate (96.3%); married (63.3%); female (63.3%) and classified as class-2 obesity. As to the knowledge about the disease, subjects obtained scores lower than 8, indicating unsatisfactory results on self-care. Scores obtained regarding attitudes show difficulties to cope with the disease. Results evidence the need to adopt a Diabetes Education Program at the studied unit.","1790":"The objective of this study was to relate the scores obtained with the application of the scales of locus of control of health and self esteem with socio-demographic and clinical variables, risk factors and chronic complications in 65 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's Correlations tests. Regarding the locus of control, in average, patients presented higher scores in the internal dimension, and women showed more externality-at random for health. Statistically significant relationships were found between internality with time of diagnosis and physical activity; between externality-other powerful entities with glycated hemoglobin and physical activity; and between externality-at random with practice of physical activity. Most individuals has high self-esteem, but no variable was statistically related.","1791":"The objective of this study was to identify the recommendations for the care of children with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and to describe the process of communication between professionals and mothers during the consultation. Data collection was performed in Primary Care Units, through interviews and observation of physicians' and nurses' consultations to children with ARI. The recommendations ranging between professionals and were incomplete and focusing on the disease, mainly on the treatment; communication is focused on the professional, which does not promote an emancipatory education process. The results confirmed the need to include such issues in the initial and ongoing training of professionals.","1792":"The objective of this study was to understand how nurses become aware of the use of therapeutic play as a nursing intervention instrument. Symbolic Interactionism was the theoretical framework and Interpretive Interactionism was used as the methodological framework. Participants were seven nurses working at hospitals and outpatient pediatric units who used the therapeutic play in their practice. Four representative themes emerged: Expanding the way he\/she sees the child; Becoming fascinated with a new possibility to provide care; Noticing his\/her revalidated action; and Committing himself\/herself to the theme development. Such themes revealed that when nurses become acquainted with therapeutic play and use it in his\/her practice, they begin on a journey that allows him\/her to recognize the benefits of this intervention. By doing so, nurses revalidate their actions more and more, thus valuing play as a nursing intervention tool. The authors believe that teaching about therapeutic play and integrating it to nurses' daily practice are challenges yet to be overcome.","1793":"The objective of this study was to verify and describe, from a gender focus, the associations between gender and specific postoperative pain variables in pediatrics. This is a cross-sectional study of 77 children between 6 and 13 years of age (M=9 years; sd=2.2 years), ASA I and II, 77.9% from low-income classes, 68.8% boys and 32.8% girls. Data were collected on the first postoperative (1st PO) day through semi-structured interviews and four measurement scales. The main baseline diseases were adenotonsillitis and fractures. Prevalence of pain on the 1st PO was 91.7% for girls and 75.5% for boys (p&gt;0.05). No association was found between pain intensity and gender. The most used pain descriptors were it cuts and it squeezes. The preferred scale was the EFMC (with faces from a Brazilian cartoon: Monica's Gang). Pediatric pain management is still inadequate and gender may influence the pain response.","1794":null,"1795":null,"1796":"The objective of this study was to describe scholars' feelings in terms of hospitalization, and discuss on their perception about hospitalization. It is a qualitative study performed using semi-structured interviews and recordings based on the following atopic for analysis: feelings and perceptions reported by scholars during hospitalization. It was found that the feelings reported by scholars during hospitalization are those of restriction, fear, pain, preoccupation, missing home and others, and anxiety. Most scholars see hospitalization as something negative, though they also report positive aspects such as receiving exclusive affection from their mothers, having access to foods they usually do not have at home and compensations they receive for being ill. Playing emerged as an important activity that alleviates the negative aspects of hospitalization. In conclusion, despite having negative feelings, scholars are able to realize that hospitalization is important for their recovery.","1797":"The objective of this study was to learn about and understand pregnancy and motherhood experiences in adolescence within rural settlements. The study started from a qualitative approach supported by the biographic method. Witnesses comprised women who experienced pregnancy and motherhood in adolescence. Data collection was performed in January and February 2009, by thematic biographic interview. The biographies show family trajectories of instability and constant moves as well as of precarious housing and employment. Pregnancy acceptance by the families of the adolescents is directly conditioned to the partner taking over the parenthood of the child and the adolescent mother as partner or spouse. The most frequently reported changes in the personal life deriving from pregnancy and motherhood were loss of freedom and increase of responsibility. At institutional level, it is observed the lack of public policies and, consequently, of services addressed to and adequate to health specificities within rural settlements.","1798":"","1799":"This is an integrative review of Brazilian studies on evidence-based practices (EBP) in health, published in ISI\/JCR journals in the last 10 years. The aim was to identify the specialty areas that most accomplished these studies, their foci and methodological approaches. Based on inclusion criteria, 144 studies were selected. The results indicate that most EBP studies addressed childhood and adolescence, infectious diseases, psychiatrics\/mental health and surgery. The predominant foci were prevention, treatment\/rehabilitation, diagnosis and assessment. The most used methods were systematic review with or without meta-analysis, protocol review or synthesis of available evidence studies, and integrative review. A strong multiprofessional expansion of EBP is found in Brazil, contributing to the search for more selective practices by collecting, recognizing and critically analyzing the produced knowledge. The study also contributes to the analysis itself of ways to do research and new research possibilities.","1800":"The objective of this study was to perform a literature review of the factors that may influence the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus using the PICO strategy. PubMed\/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge and EMBASE were the databases used. A larger survey of articles was possible by combining standardized and non-standardized descriptors. Though HRQL is a specific construct used to evaluate aspects related to the repercussions of health, illness, and treatment, it appears that sociodemographic, psychosocial, and family-related aspects have a significant effect on HRQL.","1801":"The objective of this study was to identify the evidence available in the literature that address, for children's perspective, factors that are relevant for an appropriate management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. An integrative review was performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, CUIDEN and PsycINFO databases, covering the period from 1998 to 2008 and using the following keywords: type 1 diabetes mellitus, child, prevention and control, triggering factors, emergencies, self care, learning and health education. Nineteen of the surveyed articles were selected, and their analysis revealed the following categories: living with diabetes; self care and glucose profile; the actions of family, friends and health professionals; and school. The evidence show that children appreciate the support they receive from their relatives, which have a direct relationship with being prepared for self care. Other members apart from their network are also valued. Areas that deserve attention are the school, the personal experience of each child, and health education.","1802":"The objective of this study is to examine the literature and identify most salient outcomes of early postnatal discharge for women, newborns and the health system. An electronic search strategy was designed including the following sources: Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and PubMed\/MEDLINE, using the following terms: (early AND discharge) OR (length AND stay) AND (postpartum OR postnatal) AND (effect* OR result OR outcome). Content analysis was used to identify and summarise the findings and methods of the research papers. The evidence available is not enough to either reject or support the practice of early postnatal discharge; different studies have reported different outcomes for women and newborns. The need of systematic clinical research is discussed.","1803":null,"1804":"The objective of this study was to quantify the colony forming units (cfu) on latex procedure gloves in the beginning, middle, and end of the containers in real (professional) and controlled (researcher) gloving situations; evaluate the microbial load of the gloves, considering the time of exposure in the environment. This comparative prospective study was conducted at an intensive care unit of a teaching hospital. The microbiological data was collected from the gloves using digital-pressure. Microbiological evaluations were performed on 186 pairs of gloves: 93 in the control group and 93 in real gloving situations. In the control group, the average cfu was 4.7 against 6.2 in the real gloving situation. Hence, no statistically significant difference was found (p=.601). In addition, the cfu values of gloves in the beginning, middle and end of the containers also did not show any significant differences (p&gt;.05). The most common strain was Staphylococcus spp. The time of exposure in the environment did not increase the cfu value of the latex gloves.","1805":"The objective of this study is to characterize how nursing care is performed at the ICU to patients with no possibility of cure. Ten nurses were interviewed. The field study was performed at the Intensive Care Unit of a public teaching hospital. For the nurses, there is no uniform pattern of care. Furthermore, according to their reports, it was observed that there is an overestimation of the technical care over the emotional, social and spiritual aspects. It was, however, observed that nurses are strongly with the suffering of the family in view of their loss. Results show that nurses must understand death as a part of the life cycle and review care as the essence of nursing, thus increasing the discussions on the issue in both the academic and daily practice environments.","1806":null,"1807":"Nursing professionals working in Emergency Care suffer from the physical symptoms of stress in their everyday activity. The objective of this study was to characterize these symptoms using the Occupational Stress Indicator, a semi-structured instrument. To do this, the authors created open questions that were applied in interviews that were recorded and analyzed. The researchers listed the following physical symptoms: headache, a sensation of fatigue, leg pain, and tachycardia. According to reports form the workers, pain always resulted from emotional stress or appeared after providing emergency care, which suggests the workers find it very difficult to differentiate physical from mental stress. The investigation found that there is a need for measures to follow workers in their working activity. A manual was created, containing basic suggestions to improve the quality of life of the health team.","1808":null,"1809":"This study verified the adherence of people with schizophrenia to the medication, identified and compared their beliefs about the disorder and the drug among patients who adhered and those who did not. Participants were 14 patients of a psychiatric outpatient clinic. Semi-structured interviews and the Morisky-Green test were performed. The data was analyzed using a quali-quantitative approach. Results showed that 64.3% of patients do not adhere to treatment. Most participants considered the drug capable of reducing the seriousness and severity of the disorder. However, the drawbacks for patients that did not adhere to the treatment were more expressive. Side effects were the cause for interrupting the treatment for 80% of patients who intentionally did not adhere to treatment. It was observed there is insufficient knowledge about schizophrenia and the drug treatment. Patients referred to faith as a strategy to cope with the process they were experiencing. This study points at the need for strategies directed towards the promotion of drug treatment adherence among people with schizophrenia.","1810":"The current national mental health policies confirm the need to encourage teaching, research and extension practices that favor new professional attitude. A previous study has shown that the students' representation about the competencies required in mental health fall into categories about the concepts of competence, cognitive resources, expressed feelings, and the concept of health and illness, but with no reference to themes related to the users' citizenship or psychosocial rehabilitation, which are central concepts in the course discipline. In this study, an analysis was made of the representation about these concepts, the knowledge and skills identified as being necessary to practice rehabilitation. Participants were students of a public university, attending the Mental Health Nursing class. The results show that students value the users' needs, but the representations about citizenship and psychosocial rehabilitation are founded on common sense about hazards and basic rights like health and leisure.","1811":"The characteristics of involuntary psychiatric commitment (IPI) may cause implications on the nursing\/patient relationship. The objectives of this study were to list the forms of nursing care delivered to psychiatric patients, according to the type of commitment; analyze the reaction of the nursing team towards the IPI patient, and discuss on the implications that IPI have on the practice o psychiatric nursing. A field research was performed with the nursing team of a psychiatric institution in Rio de Janeiro. After 50 hours of participant observation and 9 of focal group meetings, we found that the teams are concerned with the clinical evolution of the patients. No references of the nursing team to the IPI patient were observed. There are no records or actions of any kind that would suggest a specific look towards this type of patient. Nursing professionals are not able to clearly identify this type of patient, thus the care is provided as per the patient's needs or requests.","1812":"The objective of this study was to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of caregivers to people who have been discharged from psychiatric hospitalization. A quantitative exploratory study was performed at an outpatient clinic of a mental health service. The sample consisted of patients who had been discharged and their caregivers. A questionnaire was used, and the study was approved by the local research ethics committee. Of the 48 discharged patients, 21 had a caregiver. All the identified caregivers were relatives of the patients, and their average age was 46.6 years. In 38% of cases, the patient's mother was the caregiver. In terms of marital status, 61.9% of the caregivers were married or living in common-law relationships, and only one caregiver did not have children. The main source of income for 28.6% of the participants was temporary keeping eventual jobs. By knowing who is the caregiver of a patient discharged from psychiatric hospitalization it is possible to identify the characteristics that may help to determine the best treatment and professional support for that population.","1813":"The objective of this qualitative study was to identify the service that is offered to the family members of patients with mental disorders at Primary Care Units, and understand the everyday life of that family. Data collection was performed from May to June 2007, by means of semi-structured interviews and observation of five families at their homes. Thematic analysis of the data was performed, generating two categories: 1) mental disorder from the family's perspective and the relation with the health service; 2) living with the mental illness. Result confirm the importance of seeing the family of patients with mental disorders as clients of the care process, and the need to prepare health professionals to answer the needs of the people that seek these services.","1814":"The objectives of this study were to verify the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) and its characteristics in pre-frail and frail elderly patients of a geriatrics outpatient clinic, compare the presence of frailness criteria among the elderly with and without UI and identify among the frailty criteria the chance of risk for UI among those elderly outpatients. Participants were 100 elderly individuals, with an average age of 76.2 years; 65 participants reported UI, 71.3% of which presented three or more frailness criteria. The occurrence of UI was greater in frail participants (p=0.0011). Multivariate analysis showed that the criteria slowness (OR=4.99) and exhaustion (OR=4.85) has a statistically significant relation with UI. The occurrence of UI was high and participants who presented slowness have a risk almost five times greater to presenting UI while those reporting exhaustion have a risk five times greater for UI compared to those without these criteria.","1815":"This cross-sectional, comparative study was performed with the objective to evaluate the quality of life of elderly individuals who perform volunteer work, compared to those who do not. The WHO Quality of Life questionnaire was applies in a group of 166 elderly individuals who performed volunteer work and to another 33 who did not. Results show most are women, single and with high-level education. Compared to No statistically significant difference was found between the groups for the quality of life scores in the physical and environmental domains (p&gt;0.05). In the psychological and social relations domains, and in the global evaluation, it was observed that volunteers had higher scores (p&lt;0.05). In the linear regression model, performing volunteer work appeared as a determinant for better quality of life in the psychological domain and global evaluation. It is suggested that volunteer work is a mechanism to promote quality of life among the elderly, and can be encouraged by health professionals.","1816":"The objective of this study was to identify the epidemiological profile of elderly victims assisted at the Emergency unit of a university hospital. This is a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study. Data treatment was performed using descriptive statistics, charts and tables. Most victims lived in de Campinas (93.5%) and were females (66.7%) with ages between 70 and 74, and presented comorbidities (77.8%), of which arterial hypertension was the most common. As for the type of accident that resulted in the trauma, the highest incidence was falling from their own height (79.6%). The resulting lesions were characterized by the predominance of superficial lesions (22.7%) followed by mild brain injury (15.1%). As to the victim's destination in the first 24 hours, 49.1% were discharged and 22.2% were admitted for surgery.","1817":null,"1818":"The objective of the present study was to know the relationship and the exchange of support between patients with AIDS and the people around them. This study is based on the convoy model of social relations, which, as one of its features, presents the network as three concentric circles. Participants were people who were hospitalized and talked about the health care support their received from the people close to them, i.e., those belonging to the internal convoy circle. Most participants described the circle as being composed by a maximum of five members, with relatives being the most common. Health professionals must know patients and their convoy, and be able to recognize them in the pscychosocial and cultural context so as to favor the acceptance of being HIV-positive, the need to make changes to their lifestyle, help with health care and adhere to the treatment.","1819":null,"1820":"The objective of this study was to learn about the importance of communication when the nursing team gives postoperative orientations to patients and\/or relatives at a private institution, and learn their perception about those orientations. This cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed using a qualitative approach, having Interpersonal Communication and Content Analysis as the theoretical and methodological frameworks, respectively. Participants were 16 patients interviewed in the postoperative period. Results showed that the nursing team focused the orientations on the instrumental techniques of the professions and did not approach the individuals in a holistic manner. It was also observed that when the nurse stands away from the patient and\/or does not provide appropriate information, it generates feelings of anxiety, fear, insecurity and a sensation of lack of care in the patients. On the other hand, when the nursing team is present and provides coherent information, patients reported high satisfaction and a feeling of being well cared for.","1821":"This cross-sectional study evaluated the clinical and anthropometrical parameters of 100 individuals with coronary artery disease, who were assisted at preventive cardiology outpatient clinic at a public hospital in Salvador\/BA.

It was observed that individuals with high cardiovascular risk and deficient socioeconomic conditions show a lack of control of several cardiovascular risk factors, thus demanding effective health care practices to control the illness.","1822":"This study was performed with the objective to evaluate the knowledge that nursing professionals have about the process of preserving, preparing and administering erythropoietin (EPO). This exploratory, descriptive study used a quantitative approach. It was performed at a Dialysis Center, from January to March 2009, and consisted on applying a questionnaire to 40 nursing professionals. All ethical aspects were taken into consideration. About the interaction of EPO with the patients' blood pressure, 87.5% had inadequate knowledge; only 32% knew the ideal temperature to preserve the drug, and 52.5% believe that it should be removed from the refrigerator about 15 to 30 minutes before its administration; intravenous administration was the most reported. Among the care before the administration, the most frequent was checking the expiration date; 57.5% used exclusive syringe for the administration and 95% usually register having administered the drug.","1823":null,"1824":"The objective was to follow the working process of a family health team in their regular meetings held to discuss family cases. This study used a qualitative approach, founded on the theoretical and methodological framework institutional schizoanalytic analysis. Seventeen meetings were followed, which counted with the participation of an average of 7 to 8 of the 17 workers participating in the study. The team held discussions on the families, and classified them according to the risk criteria, reviewed what had been accomplished in the meting and searched for action alternatives. There were disagreements when participants faced differences and difficulties to be heard by their colleagues, which were gradually overcome, and made it possible for the members to share care situations they had in common. The team made an effort to analyze the how they take care of the families and to get them to integrate. It was concluded that the meetings favor the production of care and the construction of group work as the team, while delivering care, deals with the subjectivities produced in their practice.","1825":"This descriptive study was performed using a qualitative approach. The objective was to listen and report on the etiology of the malformation and learn about the beliefs of relatives regarding the manifestation of oral fissures.

The sources used for data collection were the regulating documents of technical professional education of the referred Ministries regarding the years 1996 and 2006. Results showed that, for the Ministry of Education, the guiding principles of professional education are the demands of the working market; the idea of competency is supported on the constructivist perspective, highlighting personal features over their social dimension. For the Ministry of Health, professional education is an instrument of citizenship, guided by the political health care paradigm of the national public health system, referred to as the Unique Health System; the idea of competency is founded on the critical-emancipatory perspective. In conclusion, the two Ministries, despite having regulations regarding professional education, are contradictory in terms of their conceptual foundations.","1881":"The objectives of this study were to analyze the fecal incontinence (FI) in adults living in Pouso Alegre (Minas Gerais, Brazil) and the associated demographic and clinical variables. This epidemiological study developed sing stratified sampling by conglomerates. The final sample consisted of 519 individuals, of age &gt;18 years, with adequate mental and physical conditions, living in 341 homes, which were randomly selected. Prevalence rates were standardized by gender and age, and revealed 7.0% of FI, overall and for men and women. In the final model of logistical regression, the number of children (OR=5.1; p&lt;0.001), hemorrhoids (OR=4.4; p&lt;0.001) and cystocele (OR=3.0; p&lt;0.001) were statistically correlated to FI. This study identified the epidemiology of fecal incontinence in a small town in Brazil and may contribute to establish public policies and programs for primary and secondary prevention and treatment of FI, starting at the local level.","1882":"This descriptive, exploratory study aimed to validate nursing interventions proposed by the Nursing Interventions Classification for impaired skin integrity, deficient knowledge, ineffective therapeutic regimen management for predominant nursing diagnoses in people with diabetes. Participants were 21 specialist nurses in diabetes mellitus in Brazil, in 2007. Interventions were analyzed according to Fehring's evaluation model. The nursing interventions with the highest weighted average were care to injuries: closed drainage and circulatory precautions for the impaired skin integrity nursing diagnosis, teaching: disease process and teaching: prescribed medication for deficient knowledge and teaching: disease process and teaching: prescribed diet for ineffective therapeutic regimen management. Among the 1005 activities of nursing, 51% were validated as very characteristic by experts. Other studies should be carried out to expand the validation of the nursing interventions to people with diabetes mellitus in Brazil, searching for scientific evidences for care to these clients.","1883":"The safety culture of Intensive Care Units (ICU) recommends following the no-punishment approach when adverse events (AE) occur. It is, however, questionable if nurses perceive those AE. to characterize AE report systems; to verify AE frequency and consequences to the professionals; and to verify the nurses' level of confidence to report AE. This descriptive study involved 70 ICU nurses, who answered a questionnaire in 2007, followed by descriptive analyses. Most nurses (70.0%) reported the existence of an AE notification system at their place of work. The frequency of AE was reported as sometimes and several times by 51.4% and 28.6% of the sample, respectively. For 74.3% of nurses, punishment happens sometimes and always, mainly through verbal notice (49.0%). Most nurses (74.3%) reported feeling confident and completely confident to report AE. In conclusion, punishment still exists in the Units. ","1884":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological conditions of the egg crater mattress in hospital use to identify the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and its methicillin-resistance phenotype (MRSA). Petrifilm plates were used to collect the microbiological data from the mattresses, in pre-established positions. A total 180 plates were collected in 15 mattresses, 139 (72.2%) of which were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Of the positive plates, 77 (55.4%) were collected before and 62 (44.6%) after washing the mattresses. There was a significant reduction (p=0.023) in Colony Forming Units (CFU); however, regarding the resistance profile, 8 (53.3%) mattresses with MRSA were identified. Results show the risk of these mattresses acting as a secondary deposit in the infection chain, especially regarding the presence of MRSA.","1885":null,"1886":null,"1887":"This qualitative study was performed using the multiple case study method and Heidegger's existential phenomenology for data analysis. The objective was to understand how family members perceive the influence of musical experiences on the physical and mental health of a relative living with a terminal illness. Participants were seven individuals belonging to two families. Data collection was performed through interviews and observation from May to June 2009. Results showed that using music while providing care to beings living with cancer can provide well-being to patients as well as their caregivers. Considering the deficit of leisure and the monotony of the home environment, using music contemplates the philosophical and humanitarian precepts of palliative care, thus being characterized as a complementary resource to nursing care, as besides being a communication resource, it improves the interpersonal relationship between patients and their families.","1888":null,"1889":"The objective of this study was to learn about the experience of suffering in hospitalized school-aged children. The methodological strategy used was narrative inquiry, and the Model of Suffering as the theoretical framework. Participants were 14 children. Data collection was performed using semi-structured interviews, guided by the following question: Tell me your story about getting sick and coming to the hospital. Results show that hospital events comprise the child's experience of suffering, represented by five categories: knowing the suffering caused by the disease; enduring to survive the experience of being ill, relaxing from enduring to free their emotions, living the suffering, and floating between enduring and suffering. The suffering or enduring of the child is determined by the context of the experience and by the support or interactions that surrounds them. In conclusion, nurses have the duty to offer children opportunities to express themselves and make the suffering bearable.","1890":"The objective was to understand the meaning of the social practice of nurses in Luhmann's perspective and allow for a discussion about the construction of a specific code for nursing; one that would go beyond the traditional health-disease code prevalent in the health system, whose relevant social communication is the disease. The Grounded Theory was the methodological framework. Data collection was performed by interviewing the 35 participants between May and December 2007. Data coding and analysis resulted revealed that assuming that nursing is as a functionally differentiated system implies on developing a binary code to enhance health as socially relevant communication and human beings as social beings who are part of a complex and multidimensional reality.","1891":"This descriptive, exploratory study was performed using a qualitative approach with the purpose of learning about the life style of children with AIDS and the implications that following a antiretroviral therapy have on them. Participants were five children with ages between 10 and 12 years. Data collection took place after the study was approved by the Review Board and was performed using the Focal Group technique. Data analysis was performed using thematic analysis, from which three categories and respective subcategories emerged. This article addresses one of the categories: The child's involvement with the antiretroviral drugs. This category reveals how the children perceive and relate with the antiretroviral therapy. The study findings may serve as supporting information for health professionals, education programs about health care to children living with AIDS.","1892":"The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate alcohol use and the levels of spirituality among nursing students. The tests used were the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and the Spirituality Scale. Participants were 191 (80.2%) nursing undergraduates from a city in the state of Minas Gerais, 75.4% of which were female, average age 25 years, and 149 (78%) were Catholic. As for alcohol use per gender, 117 (75%) women used alcoholic beverages and 33 (56.9%) had a drinking problem (p?0.05), against 25 men (431%). Low scores for spirituality levels were found in the sample: in average, women had lower scores compared to men (12.7 against 13.5). Comparing the level of spirituality with having a drinking problem, it was observed that students with low risk alcohol use had lower levels of spirituality. In conclusion, spirituality may not function as a protecting factor for alcohol use, hence this behavior may be under the control of other variables.","1893":"More than being a sense, vision is a powerful instrument that identifies and selects, hence everything depends on what one has seen before to determine how to interpret what is currently being seen. The objective of this article is to discuss the role that vision plays as an instrument for holistic and quality nursing care. This is a qualitative, exploratory study, using the Sociopoetic method. The data was categorized as follows: (1)Vision as an instrument and (2)Outer body changes. In trauma and orthopedics, nurses should be able to provide patients with care in complex conditions and in an environment which changes fast. Results show that vision is a powerful health care instrument in trauma and orthopedic nursing, promoting professional practice that is truly appropriate to the patients' needs.","1894":"The objective of this study was to identify common features between people that have been recently discharged from psychiatric hospitalization. A quantitative exploratory study was performed at an outpatient mental health service center. The sample was comprised by patients who had recently been discharged. A questionnaire was used and the study was approved by the Review Board. Interviews were performed with 48 patients who were in average 39 years old.

An integrative literature review was performed for the years 2006 to 2009. The data analysis revealed that the studies used different elements and specific effectiveness indicators to evaluate the intervention strategies that were addressed. Based on current evidence, it is not possible to identify the best strategy. The present review points out the need to define more consensual outcome indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Hence, it is necessary to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of nursing intervention strategies, turning to those indicators, to define the best evidenced-based intervention strategy.","1908":"The doubt regarding the re-sterilization of articles made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sterilized with gamma radiation (GR) and subsequently with ethylene oxide (EO) persists to date. Through a systematic literature review, this article analyzed studies that demonstrated compatibilities and incompatibilities between the sterilization processes with GR and EO, when used as consecutive sterilization methods. Seven studies were analyzed. It was verified that there is a multifactor influence regarding the safety of the procedure and that the chromatography analytical method employed by most studies yielded controversial results. This fact indicates the need for further studies on the issue, using more sensitive analytical methods than gas chromatography, such as the biological reactivity test in cell cultures, in an attempt to clarify the chronic doubt regarding the adequacy or inadequacy of sterilizing previously gamma-irradiated materials with EtO.","1909":"The main objective of this study is to identify, in the literature, articles about the occurrence of contamination from inanimate surfaces and a possible dissemination of resistant bacteria in the hospital environment. A bibliographic survey was performed with articles published in the databases LILACS, MEDLINE, Science Direct, SCOPUS and ISI Web of Knowledge, between 2000 and 2008. Twenty-one articles were selected and analyzed. The analyzed studies highlighted the presence of bacteria on monitors, bed grids, tables, faucets, telephones, keyboards and other objects. There was a prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus resistant to vancomycin, being the predictive factor the previous occupation of patients colonized by these microorganisms. There was a similarity observed among the isolated strains of colonized and\/or infected patients and the strains of the environment by molecular typification. These evidences reinforce the need for knowledge and control of the sources of pathogens in the hospital environment.","1910":"This article presents a reflection on the meaning of the terms citizenship and health, addressing the Theory of Social Representations as a strategy for implementing and evaluating health care models in Brazil.

This fact has been less investigated among nursing students. The objective of this review was to learn about the prevalence of homophobia and its associated variables among nursing students. A systematic review was performed on original articles published in EBSCO, Imbiomed, LILACS, MEDLINE, Ovid, and ProQuest, including articles published between 1998 and 2008 in English, Portuguese and Spanish. Keywords used were homophobia, homosexuality, and nursing students. Descriptive analysis was performed. Eight studies were analyzed. The incidence of homophobia in nursing students is between 7% and 16%. Homophobia is more common among males and religious conservatism people. Homophobia is quite frequent in nursing students. This negative attitude toward homosexuality may affect services and care giving by nursing professions and could have negative implications in nursing practice.","1948":null,"1949":"Patient safety concerns in surgery are increasing. The frequency of surgery-related adverse events and errors is high, and most could be avoided. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) proposed the Universal Protocol (UP-JCAHO) for preventing wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong person surgery. In Brazil, very few health-care institutions have adopted this Protocol. Thus, there is a need to improve its dissemination and assess its effectiveness. The aim of the present study was to report the experiences of the Sao Paulo State Cancer Institute (ICESP, acronym in Portuguese) in implementing the UP-JCAHO. The Protocol comprises three steps: pre-operative verification process, marking the operative site and Time out immediately before starting the procedure. The ICESP surgical center (SC) has been functioning since November 2008. The UP-JCAHO is applied to all surgeries. A total 1019 surgeries were performed up to June 2009. No errors or adverse events were registered. The implementation of the UP-JCAHO is simple. It can be a useful tool to prevent error and adverse events in SC.","1950":"This is a historical and social study about the symbolic effect of medication advertisements presented by women using object representations used by nurses, featured on Fon-Fon Magazine, which describes the medication advertisements featured on Fon-Fon Magazine; analyzes the object representations of the nurse image present in the referred advertisements and discusses on the symbolic effect of those representations on the consumption of medication by the Brazilian society.

Thirty-two workers were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data analysis showed that comprehensiveness permeates the various levels of health care, adding the concept of health promotion. Interdisciplinary work emerges as a key element for the health care practice, which is made effective by sharing feelings. On the other hand, data show that comprehensive health care is only made effective provided that basic conditions are present, and services often do not provide those conditions. In conclusion, it is necessary to eliminate the fragmentations that exist in the form of health care organization as well as in the everyday practice of health care workers at the referred services so that it is possible to offer comprehensive, problem-solving care and humanize health care practices always aiming at the quality of life of the population.","1974":null,"1975":null,"1976":null,"1977":null,"1978":"This paper discusses on the social representations of community health agents (CHAs) about drug use as part of a qualitative, ethnographic study with data collected by means of a set of research techniques among health professionals including 22 CHAs in a basic health unit in Salvador, Bahia (Brazil) from January, 2006 to January, 2007. The Theory of Social Representations was adopted as the theoretical framework whereas gender was the chosen analytical category. CHAs were found to recognize the women's proximity and participation in the drug phenomenon in the community where they live and act, although they take no professional measures towards such an issue. Their social representations were shown to reproduce stereotypes and prejudices towards drug users and drug use, especially gender- and social class-related, while highlighting the invisibility of drug use as a health problem for the population under study.","1979":"This cross-sectional study was performed with 160 women between 2005-2006.

Results revealed that these adolescents display the same sexuality development characteristics of their age group, though they have particular characteristics. It was observed there is a lack of knowledge regarding contraceptive methods and sexually transmitted diseases, of which the adolescents have superficial information. Making knowledge on the referred issues accessible to this population is indispensible.","1983":"The objective of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the self-esteem of 127 pregnant women seen in a prenatal care program conducted in a public school hospital. Data collection was performed using the Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale; unsatisfactory self-esteem was related to socio-demographic and health variables of the pregnant woman, and to the presence or absence of support systems. Descriptive and univariate statistical analysis were used to assess possible associations. Pregnant women who had low scores for self-esteem were 60% of all subjects. As for the sociodemographic data, women with fewer years of education presented higher frequency of lower self-esteem scores, which disagrees with other studies. Pregnant women who report having an unplanned pregnancy presented higher prevalence of low self-esteem than those who reported having planned their pregnancy. The lack of support from the partner to look after the baby was also associated to the pregnant women's low self-esteem. Other associations between variables were not statistically significant.","1984":"The objective of this cross-sectional, comparative study was to describe the demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics of elderly voluntary workers of a Non-governmental organization of Porto Alegre, and investigate the influence of voluntary work and the referred characteristics on the subjects' self-perception of health, compared to a paired group of elderly individuals who did not perform any voluntary work. Through interviews it was found that 87.4% of the elderly voluntary workers were women, with complete secondary education, had their own income and followed a religion and a healthy lifestyle. The comparison of data from both groups showed that self-perception of great health was more common among voluntary workers (30.5% compared to 6.1%, p = 0.054). Multivariate analysis revealed that performing voluntary work and having fewer diseases influenced the individuals' having a positive self-perception of their health (p &lt; 0.05).

According to subjects' reports, there are no activities for mental disorder patients in the primary health care network and the lack of training for nurses is as a challenge to be overcome.","2011":"The paper analyzes the emphasis of the professionals of Family Health Teams (FHTs) on adolescent women's puerperium as a period in which women are particularly vulnerable. The adolescent women's special vulnerability in the puerperium period is justified by their way of living, showing a natural tendency to making the adolescence phenomenon something natural. The analysis was performed on some results from a qualitative study performed with FHTs of Santa Maria\/RS, which used the focus groups strategy and content analysis. This study adds important contributions to the work of health professionals, indicating and giving visibility to the circumstances and elements implied in the production of adolescent women's vulnerability in the puerperium. Results suggest that a reorientation of education and health promotion practices that goes beyond the informative component are needed. In addition, there is a need to incorporate the vulnerability perspective in the planning of those actions.","2012":"Hospitalization is a complex experience; this can be made worse if surgical intervention is required, especially when the patient is a child. When surgery is suspended, patient and family can experience feelings of insecurity, distress, and anxiety. The objective of this study was to identify and describe the perceptions of fifteen mothers or guardians of children between 0 and 18 years old admitted in a teaching hospital, after receiving news that surgery for their child was suspended. This was a descriptive qualitative study which used Interpersonal Communication as theoretical reference and Analysis of Content as the methodology. Results showed that suspension of pediatric surgery in our institution causes repercussions to patients, their families, and institution organisation; that communication between health team professionals, patients and families is inadequate; and that the nurses' participation in informing surgery suspension must be effective.","2013":"The aim of the study was to identify the clinical and prehospital indicators associated to the survival of blunt trauma victims. The Kaplan Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the association of 33 variables to early and late death, proposing multivariate models. The final models until 48 hours post-trauma showed high rates of risk promoted by abdominal injuries, Injury Severity Score &gt; or = 25, advanced respiratory procedures and prehospital chest compressions. In the model up to 7 days, a systolic blood pressure in accident site lower than 75 mmHg was associated with increased risk of death, and if absent it was associated with higher risk of death after 7 days. The prehospital volume replacement showed a protective effect in all periods. Results suggest that the magnitude of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability due to bleeding had a significant influence on early and late death in this group of victims.","2014":"The present study is a clinical case report of a patient with diabetes and hypertension, with an ischemic wound, treated with a non-conventional Aloe vera and collagen plastering. This study is part of an experimental research project, coordinated by professors and nurses that work together to discover new ways for wound treatment. This case was chosen among many patients. Data was collected through anamneses and physical examination of the patient's condition, the wound, and pictures were taken. The plastering was applied every day, and by the end of ten weeks, total healing was obtained. There was no discomfort or any other implication as a result of using the compound. In conclusion, the compound was well accepted and efficient in this particular case.","2015":"The objective of the present study was to compare three methods of cryotherapy in healthy non-pregnant women. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial that was conducted by 32 undergraduates of a private nursing college in the city of Sao Paulo, divided into three groups (iced water, soft ice, ice gel). The temperatures were verified (axillary, thigh, of the three ice packs) between zero and twenty minutes. The temperatures of the packs were the following: soft ice, from negative 9 degrees C to 2 degrees C; iced water, from 0 degrees C to 8 degrees C; and ice gel from negative 11 degrees C to 2 degrees C. There was a significant difference between the average thigh temperature values at 10 minutes (p = 0.007), 15 minutes (p = 0.003) and 20 minutes (p = 0.005). The gel was the most efficient cooling method. The three cryotherapy methods achieved the recommended temperature for analgesia and may be tested in women with perineal pain after childbirth.","2016":null,"2017":"To analyze the coverage and the colpocytology exams that were not collected from a Health Center. This is a retrospective documentary study, in which the data were evaluated for coverage of 2007 and all 225 tests that were performed but were not collected by the patients unit until January 2008. Statistical analysis was performed using the frequency of the studied variables. The average monthly number of tests was 102.6 examinations. The coverage of the examination in 2007 was 11.22% among women with 25 to 59 years of age. Of the 938 tests conducted between February and November 2007, 225 (23.98%) women did not receive the result. Most women (67.5%) who performed the examination and had not returned were 30 years old or younger. The women's attitude of not returning to collect their exam results increases the difficulty of follow up, and providing comprehensive and continuity of care, contributing with an intervention in advanced stages of the disease.","2018":"The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) is an indicator that analyses the life conditions and care given to pregnant women, and indicates whether the constitutional rights related to life and health are being complied with. This study shows losses of lives among adolescent women associated with pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperal period, in the state of Santa Catarina between 1994 and 2005. It is an exploratory study of a quantitative nature. There were 72 maternal deaths in adolescents, 67% had a direct obstetric cause, 23% had an indirect obstetric cause and about 9% were classified as accidental or incidental. The Maternal Mortality Ratio in adolescents was high and most could have been prevented and its causes controlled. The identified situation shows an absence of quality health care. To reduce these deaths it is central that nursing action be combined with other professionals and other organized sectors of society.","2019":"Considering the need of parameters to know the workload existent in Rooming-in (RI), it is imperative to identify nursing activities in the mother-child binomial. The objectives of the study are: to identify nursing activities in the Rooming-In Unit of the HU-USP; to classify activities in nursing interventions according to the Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC), and to validate the interventions. A survey of all activities was carried out by means of clinical records and direct observation of nursing assistance in all the shifts. The content of interventions was validated with the nurses of unit, by means of the workshop technique. It was identified 43 direct and indirect nursing interventions; activities associated and personal activities of the staff. The instrument built with the number of these interventions\/activities will permit to, in further studies, correlate the time expended to perform these interventions\/activities and thus to propose parameters to measure the need of nursing professionals in RI.","2020":"Home care within the health area has largely been improving the life quality of patients and their relatives. It has been an efficient alternative in health care as an answer to meet the needs of patients with chronic diseases, because it does not expose them to nosocomial risks, thus avoiding rehospitalizations and having to stay away from their family life, besides the evident reduction of costs. Nevertheless, it is observed there is a shortage of specific equipments that provide the necessary support in this care modality. The development of a versatile hospital bed that is easily handled is a crucial step for home care. This study addressed the development of a dismountable and lightweight hospital bed that is easy to move, transport and assemble.","2021":"This study aimed at developing an information system in nursing with the implementation of nursing care and management of the service. The SisEnf--Information System in Nursing--is a free software module that comprises the care of nursing: history, clinical examination and care plan; the management module consists of: service shifts, personnel management, hospital indicators and other elements. The system was implemented at the Medical Clinic of the Lauro Wanderley University Hospital, at Universidade Federal da Paraiba. In view of the need to bring user and developer closer, in addition to the constant change of functional requirements during the interactive process, the method of unified process was used. The SisEnf was developed on a WEB platform and using free software. Hence, the work developed aimed at assisting in the working process of nursing, which will now have the opportunity to incorporate information technology in their work routine.","2022":null,"2023":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between stress and sleep quality among nurses who work on different hospital departments during morning, afternoon and night shifts. This study was performed in a hospital in Campinas, Sao Paulo. Data collection was performed using the Bianchi Stress Scale modified (BSSm) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Study participants were 203 registered nurses, mostly aged between 40 and 49 years. Results show there is a significant correlation between stress and sleep (Spearman Analysis; r = 0.21318; p = 0.0026). Nurses working morning shifts showed higher stress levels (p = 0.030; Chi-square Test,) and poor sleep quality. In conclusion, stress level was a factor directly correlated to sleep, showing that the higher the stress score, the worse the quality of sleep.","2024":"This descriptive study was developed with sixteen Family Health Strategy teams from Santa Maria (Rio Grande do Sul), with the objective to identify works with the Burnout syndrome and the variables associated with this disorder. The sample consisted of 86 workers, representing 86.3% of professionals (physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, dentists and dental office assistants) and 30.2% of community health agents, who answered the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The average age of the group was 36.94 +\/- 9.3 years, with a predominance of females (84.9%). Most participants had a partner (68.2%), children (69.4%), have worked in the team for, in average, 3.38 +\/- 1.9 years and do not exercise regularly (62.8%). Six workers (6.9%) presented the Burnout Syndrome, which has a statistically significant association (p = 0.034) with the young age variable. Younger subjects obtained higher scores on the subscales for emotional distress and depersonalitation on the Burnout Inventory.","2025":null,"2026":"Brazil is going through problems with obesity as well as malnutrition and starvation--the nutritional transition. This is a cross sectional study with a sample of 1322 children under 10 years of age, residents in Ferros, Minas Gerais, Brazil, enrolled in SISVAN. Results showed that: 20.7% of children had nutritional disorder (10.1% nutritional risk, 3.8% malnourished and 6.7% overweight risk). Malnutrition risk factors were also identified: low birth-weight, RP = 3.57, IC 95% (1.96-6.52); stunting, RP = 19.36, IC 95% (11.53-32.52); no breastfeeding, RP = 2.23, IC 95% (1.19-4.18); family income below RS 95, RP = 2.39, IC 95% (1.10-5.16). Prevalence for overweight was higher than for malnutrition. While the rural population presented higher prevalence for nutritional risk and malnutrition, in the urban area there was higher prevalence of risk for overweight. These results show the need for specific nutritional interventions according to the specific issues identified.","2027":"Although some years ago the Moroccan immigrant population was mostly male, the number of women is increasing every day. This research is focused on this group, and has the following objectives: to know how emigration affects the fulfillment of Virginia Henderson's basic needs; what transformations and adaptations must be adopted in order to fulfill them; and what reinterpretations and strategies are implemented in order to minimize the impact of culture shock. A qualitative study was performed from 2004-2005 by means of semi-structured interviews to 20 Muslim immigrant women in a municipality of Galicia (Spain), and showed that for Muslim people, everything is regulated by religion, so the necessities affected are strongly related with the need of acting according to one's values and beliefs. Therefore, valuing the referred need provides fundamental data in order to direct the activities towards keeping and recovering health.","2028":"","2029":null,"2030":"The perception that obstetrical nurses have of their competence in assisting hospital deliveries has been investigated in this qualitative study. Data collection was performed through individual semi-structured interviews at a university hospital in Porto Alegre, and was then submitted to content analysis. The analyses were grounded on frameworks that define professional competence as the ability to mobilize different kinds of knowledge, depending on the practice problems to be solved. The obstetrical nurses understand competence in attending hospital deliveries as something multidimensional, although they have emphasized its technical dimension. This emphasis is justified through insecurity resulting from a lack of space to provide nursing care to hospital delivery, due both to disputes with physicians and to deficiencies in nurses' training. The desire to be competent in providing care during hospital deliveries has not been translated into awareness of their responsibilities in changing that scenario. This suggests that in order to act towards those desired changes, it would be necessary to develop not only technical but also ethical-political competence.","2031":"With the objective of identifying how teachers at a primary education level understand sexuality\/sex in the school, we sought to collect data relative to these issues in the everyday school life, observing the school's position and how they deal with this issue. This is a qualitative, humanist study, performed by means of research-action. Data collection was performed through participant observation and individual interviews, using a questionnaire containing guiding questions. Data analysis revealed that most teachers value dialogue as a form of orienting their students. They emphasize the need to consult with qualified professionals to gain support regarding the issue and value family participation in the orientation process. In this manner, the school can help relatives, teachers and stu-,. dents to better understand the presuppositions of sex education, and health professionals are strong allies to build their awareness and provide orientation. Based on the findings, educational actions\/interventions were performed with the teachers for the purpose of preparing them to work as multiplying agents in everyday school life. The teachers suggest seeking partnerships and creating sex orientation strategies.","2032":"The objective of this documentary study was to reflect on the state of the art of nursing in Brazil regarding care given to newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The data source used was the Brazilian Nursing Association base of theses and dissertations. Eighty-one studies were located. Data analysis was performed in two stages: first, the study's characterization was performed; second, the material was organized according to data evident in the study, resulting in thematic categories: care centered on the newborn's physiological aspects; care provided to the family accompanying their newborn in the NICU; and the health team providing care to the newborn in the NICU. It was found that nursing research seeks new forms of care and brings theory closer to practice, thus guaranteeing its support of the nursing profession and contributing to the production of knowledge in neonatology.","2033":"The objective of this study was to analyze the approach used to teach the nursing process based on the class plans of courses that evidence the concept and method bases of the nursing process in superior education institutions in a state capital of Northeast Brazil. Results showed that the courses are mostly theoretical, with amendments and concept bases emphasizing the theoretical-philosophical support of the nursing process, as well as on the study of the phases comprising it. Furthermore, it was shown there was an expression and prevalence of cognitive and psychomotor objectives and the use of traditional methodology.","2034":"The objective of this study was to validate the content and comprehensibility of the informative material for patients and their families undergoing chemotherapy, while describing its utility as a written tool of communication between healthcare provider and healthcare consumers. The informative material draws on information derived from twenty-three interviews of caretakers. The data were collected via surveys involving nine closed questions plus one open-ended question to analyze if the material's content was self-explanatory, sufficient and clear. The analyses of the informative material was positive and the information within was considered satisfactory and explanatory to the majority of the interviewees. Some of the people interviewed contributed with suggestions, which were added to the material. The informative material will be introduced, aimed at improving the quality of nursing assistance provided to cancer patients, as it is believed that when health professionals are well oriented regarding the most adequate way to care, patients adhere to their treatment more seriously; in other words, the information makes them feel more secure and fosters collaboration, leading to successful treatment.","2035":"The aim of this study was to critically reflect on the experiences of duty nurses. The objectives were: to learn how duty nurses described and interpreted their knowledge and experiences about this reality; and to reflect about possible ways to overcome the identified problems. This is a qualitative study using the focal-group technique. The group consisted of thirteen duty nurses. The methodological framework was that of the Collective Subject's Discourse. Important difficulties were identified for both collective and solitary work: incomprehension among staff members; between nursing staff and other professionals working in the hospital; lack or inadequacy of materials for care provision; and perceived absence of support, among others. The relevance of creating opportunities for communication and reflection with the purpose of strengthening collective professional practice and reducing duty nurses' afflictions in the workplace was observed.","2036":"The objective of this qualitative study, of a historical-social nature, was to learn and understand the perceptions of a group of nurses, who graduated in different decades, regarding the prejudice and forms of coping involved in choosing the profession, during their university studies, or in professional practice. Oral Life History and content analysis were used. The EEUSP Research Ethics Committee approved this study. The following categories were obtained from the subjects' statements: prejudicial attitudes when choosing nursing as a career; prejudice noticed during the course of nursing education; and prejudice experienced within professional practice. Regarding the forms of coping, collaborators reported that dissemination of information about nursing is important, as is skillful practice and teamwork. This study contributed to a better understanding regarding ways of confronting situations concerning prejudice, thus making it possible to seek strategies for social recognition and appreciation of the profession.","2037":"The objective of this study was to identify facilitating and limiting factors for professionals' compliance with contact precautions in an intensive care unit of a general hospital. This cross-sectional study was performed from May to October 2007, using a semi-structured questionnaire for data collection. Participants were 102 professionals, as follows: nursing technician (54.9%), nurse (12.7%), preceptor physician (10.8%), apprentice physiotherapist (8.8%), preceptor physiotherapist (7.8%) and resident physician (4.9%). The limiting factors for compliance with hand cleansing were forgetting, lack of knowledge, distance from sink, skin irritation, and lack of materials. The use of scrubs presented the most difficulty (45%) because they were not available at the shower box, were inappropriately stored, and due to the heat and collective use. Glove use was the practice most easily conducted in everyday practice. Results show the need to implement precaution measures to minimize the dissemination of resistant microorganisms.","2038":"Considering the particular nuances of the nurses who exert management function, the following problem was delimited: what is the profile of the nurse leader in a management role? The objective of the study was to delineate the profile of the nurse in a management position according to personal and professional characteristics. The research was performed in 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the descriptive method, applying a questionnaire to 66 nurses in managerial positions. The predominant age group was 44 to 48 years, in a stable relationship and having one child. Most participants (89.39%) have two public jobs, graduated from 21 to 25 years ago (39.39%), have theoretical preparation for leadership (80.39%), and have postgraduate diplomas either lato sensu (36.36%) or stricto sensu (36.06%). In conclusion, nurses in leadership roles have, predominantly, specialization in clinical areas and leadership is essential for the care process. Future studies should correlate their profile to managerial styles and to leadership dimensions.","2039":null,"2040":"The objectives of this study were to identify and analyze the types of medication errors observed in doses prepared and administered differently from those prescribed. It is a descriptive study using the root cause analysis method, in which a secondary analysis of data from a previously existing investigation was performed. In the study, 74 medication errors were identified during medication preparation and administration by the nursing staff. Dose errors (24.3%), schedule errors (22.9%) and unauthorized medication administration errors (13.5%) were the most frequent. Hence, medication errors were identified, and root cause analysis was performed, leading to the identification of multiple factors that contributed to error occurrence. Strategies and recommendations were presented for the prevention of errors.","2041":"The objective of this study was to observe the characteristics of falls occurring in the inpatient population at a tertiary hospital. Eight hundred and twenty-six Adverse Events Notification Reports were analyzed over a 30 months period, and 0.30 falls per 1000 patients\/day were reported. Falls from beds were the most frequent (55%), showing the highest occurrence in the neurology ward. A higher frequency of falls was observed at night time (63.7%), during the first five hospitalization days (61.7%), in male patients (57.5%) over 60 years old (50%). In cases of falls from a bed, the diagnoses were related to infectious and parasitic diseases (18.2%), diseases affecting the nervous system (18.2%) and those affecting the circulatory system (13.7%). In cases of falls from one's own height, they were related to neoplasms (19.4%) and diseases affecting the genitourinary system (16.1%). It is concluded that high importance should be placed on studying the population to characterize those at high risk for falls to assist in the implementation of preventive measures.","2042":"This exploratory, retrospective study was performed at the Pousada de Maria lodging in Curitiba, Brazil in 2007, with the objective of characterizing the profile of the violence practiced against women staying at Pousada de Maria from 1993 to 2007. Data collection was performed by analyzing 886 records of the victims' registration and transcribed to an instrument formulated for the study. The victims were between 18 and 88 years old, with low education; they suffered physical, psychological, sexual and structural violence, mainly by their partners and acquaintances. They lived with violence to maintain their family union and decided to resolve the situation when they had access to social programs and shelters. Violence is a common phenomenon among single women with incomplete primary education; 24.6% suffered physical violence, 24.15% psychological, and 14.22% structural violence. Single women, whether in a common-law relationship or married, should be considered as an at-risk group and worthy subjects of attention by health professionals when planning preventive actions.","2043":"Given the recommendation not to breastfeed their infants, HIV-positive women may experience breast problems. The aim of the study was to gain knowledge regarding breast health as revealed by HIV+ women before the non-breast-feeding. This qualitative study was performed with 15 mothers with HIV\/ AIDS in Fortaleza, Brazil. Recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed. The mothers revealed problems with their breasts following childbirth, such as engorgement and pain in the breasts. They revealed that they received instruction in the course of prenatal care not to breastfeed; however, there was no further instruction or care in the postpartum period. The use of lactation inhibitors and bandaging (binding) of the breast were reduced. Health professionals should adopt appropriate measures to guide HIV- positive parturient women. Health services need to broaden strategies to minimize the current emotional problems resulting from non-breast-feeding, as well as the discomfort in the puerperal breast.","2044":"The objective of this study was to understand how the partners of mastectomized women perceived life after the surgery. The study is both descriptive and exploratory, and was conducted in 2006 with five men who lived with mastectomized women in Fortaleza, Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were performed and the results were grouped into three analytic categories. We identified a level of misinformation about the illness, tranquility attributed to a faith in God, and a strong conviction that cancer and death are synonyms. Nursing\/health professionals are responsible for providing knowledge about breast cancer and for fostering for integration between the woman and her partner, prioritizing a healthy life together.","2045":"The new guidelines for undergraduate courses in the field of health care imply a need to prepare professionals to deal with life and death. To study death and dying in the context of nurse education means to contribute to the humanization of education and to preparing humanistic and critical professionals. We performed individual interviews with professors so that each could reveal their thoughts about experiencing death and dying in the educational relationship between nurse\/professor and the nursing student in the hospital environment. Content analysis was performed using ideas close to those of Heidegger, revealing that education towards the concept and experience of death appears to be possible only if there is reflection regarding human existence, thoughts, and accepting finitude. By understanding one's own attitudes towards death and existence, it is possible to perceive possibilities in education for care in the death process.","2046":null,"2047":null,"2048":"The Pan American Health Organization referential of Essential Public Health Functions (EPHF) was developed to improve public health performance, which depends on professional education. A case study with the objective of identifying the insertion of EPHF in the curriculum of the nursing undergraduate course at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul was developed. Keywords were defined from the definitions of the eleven EPHF. These were searched for in the class plans of the curriculum courses. Ten EPHF were identified, with major occurrence of the human health resources development and training in public health. Contemplating more intensively some of the EPHF, the curriculum under study should propitiate the education of nurses capable of contributing towards their performance. It is necessary to insert the other EPHF into the curriculum, contributing to the excellent performance of public health by the professionals educated in this institution.","2049":null,"2050":"The implementation of the electronic health record in the basic networks of Curitiba enabled an advance in the implementation of the nursing consultation and the ICNPCH, whose modeling uses the ICNP axes structure and the ICNPCH list of action. The objective of this study was to evaluate the nursing consultation from the productivity and assistance coverage perspective. The studied population was obtained from a secondary database of nursing consultations from April to June of 2005. The analysis was performed using the Datawarehouse and OLAP tool. The productivity per professional was found to be 2.5 consultations per day. Professionals use 16% of their daily work time with this activity and up to 27% of their potential per month. The ICNPCH was used in 21% of the consultations. There is a 0.08 consultation coverage per inhabitant for 6% of the population. The nursing consultation makes it possible to characterize the nurses' role in health care and a new professional position capable of affecting the construction of public politics.","2051":"This descriptive study used a qualitative approach and was developed with older adults who were members of a recreational center in Porto Alegre (Brazil). The objective was to understand the influence of the sense of self-efficacy on maintaining health-promoting behaviors among the participants. Interviews were performed with eleven older adults who obtained scores on the WHOQOL-brief questionnaire with standard deviation equal or above the group mean (&gt; or = 85.18). Content analysis of the interviews revealed four categories: positive personal attitudes and attributes; expectation to enjoy a higher quality of life; expectation to live longer; and other aspects that make behavior maintenance easier. The study found evidence that these individuals sustain health-promoting behaviors similar to what is recommended by health professionals and organizations. It appears that they maintain those behaviors due to their positive sense of self-efficacy.","2052":"The objective of this study was to identify elements of the international classification of functioning, disability and health, applicable to quadriplegic men's home care, to reduce the dependence on their parents' help for activities of daily living and self-care. Data were collected from June 2004 to March 2005. Semi-structured interviews were performed with eight adults with high spinal cord lesions who were being cared for at home. Content analysis was performed based on the categories of meaning extrapolated and the following themes were discovered: family support: safety for the corporal functions of the disabled; supporting technology: inventiveness to promote quality care; fears, uncertain future and parents' loss: thresholds and human fragilities; and functional gains: objective response of body functions. In conclusion, family support, and especially the presence of parents, is fundamental to facing limitations and to reacting in the search for balance with the deficiency, disability, disadvantage and health of that population, preparing them to achieve gradual functional gain and independence for daily activities and self-care.","2053":"Considering that elderly people using multiple drugs are prone to a higher vulnerability of their health conditions, in this study we proposed to identify nursing diagnoses, according to NANDA's taxonomy II, in a group of elderly people who use five or more drugs. Sixty-seven elderly people were selected using the Wide Geriatric Evaluation (WGE), out of 301 elderly residents from a Family Health Program (PSF) unit. All of the 67 seniors presented a total 16 diagnostic categories, an average of 5.2 diagnostics\/elderly: 59.7% of them having chronic pain; 58.2% with impaired physical mobility; 47.7% with unbalanced nutrition: more than the body needs; and 47.7% have an inefficient control of the therapeutic regimen, among others. These diagnoses reveal the need for measures involving changes in lifestyle, as well as a systematic following of these elderly people.","2054":"The objectives of this study were: to characterize the polipharmacy in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and to verify the correlation between polipharmacy and number of medications for DM2 complications with depression indicators (Beck Depression inventory (BDI) and urinary cortisol (CORT) levels). A sample composed of 40 patients with DM2 from the Diabetes League of HCFM-USP was analyzed for depression indicators (CORT and BDI) in addition to evaluation for polipharmacy and number of DM2 complications. The results showed oral hypoglycemic agents, insulins, antihypertensives, diuretics, lipid-lowering drugs and thrombolytics are the most frequent medications used. In this sample, 75% used from 5 to 8 medicines daily and 12.5% used more than eight medicines\/day; all of them used to take each medication at least 3 times daily. Between 1 and 3 DM2 complications were observed in 60% of the individuals and 22.5% showed more than 3 DM2 complications. No significant correlations were observed between depression indicators (BDI and CORT), number of medications and DM2 complications. However, positive correlation was observed between CORT and daily frequency of medication (Spearman, r = 0.319, p = 0.019).","2055":"The objective of the study was to understand how family caregivers experience the depression of older people in their care, within their cultural context. This is a qualitative study of ethnographic trajectory, performed using Spradley as the framework. The cultural universe consisted of relatives who performed the role of caregivers, who provided informed consent. Caregivers perceived the disease as a deep limitation on their way of living, involving loneliness, sadness and pity. The feelings of the depressed patients extend to the caregiver, who also faces the risk of suffering from depression. The responsibilities of caring also generate feelings of guilt that produce more suffering. Relatives recognize the onset of the disease, their attributes, the forms of treatment, and the social stigma associated with this mental disease and that they have a fundamental role in providing support and care in the recovery process.","2056":null,"2057":null,"2058":null,"2059":"This theoretical study addresses the education system for Psychiatric Nursing in an increasingly changing world of accelerated scientific and technological modernization. The objective is to discuss the pedagogy in Psychiatric Nursing, and its interface with the principles of the Brazilian psychiatric reform and national curriculum guidelines of nursing undergraduate courses. The theoretical foundation of the study consisted of constructs of the Brazilian psychiatric reform and national curriculum guidelines of nursing undergraduate courses and their relationship to factors constituting the pedagogy in psychiatric nursing. The study shows that it is not enough to identify technical issues regarding contents and teaching, didactic procedures, methods and pedagogical techniques; it is necessary to implement changes, using a new perspective and by daring to question the nature of knowledge and institutional psychiatric practices.","2060":"The objective of this study was to identify the prevalent complications in the postanesthesia recovery room (PARR), and correlate nurses' work hours with the complications. The sample consisted of 400 records of patients older than 18 years, who had major and medium surgical procedures, admitted at the PARR unit, with a stay of at least one hour. The prevalent complications were pain and hypothermia. The following complications showed a statistically significant relationship with the nursing intervention: pain: routine, oxygen therapy, medication and bandages; agitation\/anxiety: routine and oxygen therapy; hypotension: hydration, complementary exams, and observation; hypertension: observation; tremor: mat heater, blood transfusion; nausea\/vomiting: routine, medication and urinary catheterization; bleeding: routine, medication and bandages; hypoxemia: routine and oxygen therapy; hypothermia: routine, mat heater, and medication. Pain, nausea\/vomiting, agitation and bleeding showed a statistically significant relationship with the PARR nurse.","2061":null,"2062":"The study was performed with the objective to understand the ethical challenges of implementing the Program, using a qualitative approach and focal group discussion. The study included members from different FHP teams in the city of Campo Bom (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil): three physicians, three nurses, two technicians, and four community health agents. Eight situations were created to discuss different aspects of the FHP. This article is an excerpt of the study, addressing the bottleneck effects in the FHP work process. The theoretical framework included concepts of crossing and transverse and the amplified clinic proposition. The results were categorized according to the individuals involved in the work processes: users of the health system, community health agents, professionals, administrators, and health system. The bottleneck effect in these processes originates in the repetition of primary care procedures and hospital practices, disregarding the subjective and social dimensions of the health\/disease process.

Patients often report that the time seems to take longer to go by. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of two different musical rhythms in the states of mind and perception of adult patients undergoing dialysis, since the literature on this subject is scarce. The study was performed at a private hospital with 43 patients, who participated in two sessions of musical improvisation with a keyboard. The subjective states and perception were evaluated before and after the intervention. Over 80% of the patients felt that time went by faster after the interventions in both rhythms. However, the pace was a decisive factor in the kind of emotional experience that the patients had.","2065":"This exploratory study was performed to understand the system of meanings about the purpose of the nursing and medical work performed by Family Health teams, in the cities of Rio Grande and Pelotas (Brazil). Data collection was performed by semi-directed individual interviews. The interviews of 82 participants were recorded, and analyzed. The nuclear meaning of the purpose, as an end transmuted into the product of collective work, was in agreement with the possibility of the community implementing changes and acquiring healthy individual and collective behaviors. This gives evidence of the component of ethics in the process, by means of categories such as solidarity and compassion. This led to a marker, in the text production, of the human condition in the construction of the work purpose. Through the analysis and critical discussion of the theme, this study contributes to the macro-dimension of developing competencies and adjustment to the health needs of society.","2066":"The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the comorbidities of fatigue and depression in colorectal cancer patients. A non-probabilistic sample of 154 outpatients (53% men; mean age 49.6 +\/- 11.7 years; mean education 8.9 +\/- 5.4 years). Fatigue was evaluated using the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale (min:0; max:10) and depression was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (min:0; max: 63). Fatigue was identified by 76 (49.4%) patients, and was intense (total score &gt; or =6) for 19.7%. Scores compatible with depression (BDI &gt;20) were found in 11 (7.1%) patients. Fatigue and depression were correlated (r = 0.395, p &lt; 0.001). Comorbidities of moderate\/severe fatigue and dysphoria\/depression occurred in 12.3%. Fatigue was present in all patients with depression (100%) and depression occurred in 18% of patients with fatigue. Fatigue and depression are related phenomena. Comorbidities can be deleterious to the patient. Depression had a stronger effect on the occurrence of fatigue than the effect of fatigue on depression.","2067":null,"2068":null,"2069":"This cross-sectional study was conducted among 753 students (10th and 12th graders) from the Douro Region (Northern Portugal) to identify the information that adolescents have about emergency contraception (postcoital contraception), as well as their attitudes.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the determinants of the process of implementing the Birth Center and analyze the influence that hegemonic and counter-hegemonic groups have on that process. The theoretical framework used was the concept of hegemony. Data analysis was guided by the dialectic method of contradiction, totality and historicity. Semi-structured interviews were performed, from January to July 2007, with four municipal health administrators and 11 technical-administrative professionals assigned to implement the Birth Center. This study showed that the implementation of the Birth Center was determined by the counter-hegemony established in providing care during pregnancy and physiological deliveries.","2072":null,"2073":"The purpose of the present study was to identify, according to the mothers' perspective, the benefits related to her permanence and participation in the care for her child hospitalized at a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The theoretical framework was Cross-cultural Nursing Theory, and the methodological framework was the assistant convergent research approach. Data was collected from six mothers of children hospitalized at a PICU of a University Hospital, in the period from January to May 2007, through interviews and active observation. Analysis was conducted following four generic processes: collection, synthesis, theorization and application. The results evidenced that the mothers' presence and care increased the attachment between mother and child, increased mothers' confidence, and made the child calmer. This produced positive feelings such as joy and satisfaction for being able to care for their child. Nurses should review their behavior toward the mothers accompanying their child at the hospital, and adopt attitudes that support her participation in the care for her hospitalized child.","2074":null,"2075":null,"2076":"This study was performed to identify and analyze the distribution of nurses' work hours at a medical-surgical hospitalization unit, in view of the impact on making the nursing personnel dimensioning process effective during their work hours.

The theoretical phase consisted of analyzing 52 studies addressing this issue. The analysis showed that the phenomenon is evidenced by the caregiver through physical and emotional changes, unbalance between activity and rest, and compromised individual coping. In the field phase, an assessment was made of 30 women who, during the nursing consultation, showed evidence of tension due to their role as caregiver. Data collection was performed through interviews at home, which were recorded and followed a script created based on the theoretical findings. Every time it was considered adequate, excerpts from the caregivers' discourses were added to improve understanding.

Data collection was performed by means of a Focal Life History questionnaire and by observing health care professionals. Data analysis was based on the comprehensive approach, which permitted understanding the everyday life as a scenario for those living with the experience of falling ill and searching for care, considering that this experience is unique and personal. It is impossible to create health care practices that disregard the everyday life and health situation of the person. Furthermore, it is impossible to propose such practice without the active participation of the person affected by those decisions and conducts.","2088":"This study was motivated by the aspects lived by people with diabetes and the implications the disease have on their lives. In essence, this study was performed with the purpose of changing the disease from its position of a fact to the position of a phenomenon that needs further clarification. Phenomenology was the framework used in this investigation, with a view to undertand the meaning of living with diabetes. The study location was a health institution in the city of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, where people with diabetes were interviewed and provided statements about their experience. Data analysis permitted the construction of thematic categories, which revealed important facets regarding these people's existence. The study provided new perspectives for looking beyond the disease, and seeing the person with diabetes within their situational context, thus, showing some paths for health care policies.","2089":"","2090":"Historically, nurses' management functions have evidenced that their conduct is compatible with programmatic commitments. This fact was observed in the analysis of 18 studies carried out in healthcare services located in different Brazilian regions. Since the 1990's, management experts have alerted that traits such as commitment, interdisciplinarity, risk, uncertainty, spirituality, and ethical involvement will frame the characteristics of the human capital of 21st century organizations. In this much more humane environment, people's integrity and their way of relating at work must be based on the dimension of BEING. In order to face the new century institutions' healthcare demands, nurses are now urged to present a conduct permeated by the ethics of the attitudinal commitment. Thus, this study aims to stimulate a critical reflection on this ethical trend of nurses and finally propose that this trend be an essential value in nursing management processes.","2091":"This study is a literature review with the objective to reflect about stress and coping in the perioperative period of breast cancer. The study was performed based on a national online database including studies published from 1996 to 2006. The search found 63 articles, 17 of which were selected. The selected articles were read, analyzed and grouped into thematic categories: (1) Breast cancer as a stressor and impact on the diagnosis; (2) Stress and breast cancer treatment; (3) Coping and breast cancer; (4) The nurse as a cooperator in the coping process. This study found that national literature about breast cancer is substantial, but there few studies emphasize stress and cancer as a process lived by patients. Therefore, further studies should be performed regarding the stressors experienced by Brazilian women with breast cancer and the coping strategies they use.","2092":"The differential diagnosis of urinary incontinence classes is sometimes difficult to establish. As a rule, only the results of urodynamic testing allow an accurate diagnosis. However, this exam is not always feasible, because it requires special equipment, and also trained personnel to lead and interpret the exam. Some expert systems have been developed to assist health professionals in this field. Therefore, the aims of this paper are to present the definition of Artificial Intelligence; to explain what expert system and system for decision support are and its application in the field of health and to discuss some expert systems for differential diagnosis of urinary incontinence. It is concluded that expert systems may be useful not only for teaching purposes, but also as decision support in daily clinical practice. Despite this, for several reasons, health professionals usually hesitate to use the computer expert system to support their decision making process.","2093":"This article presents a reflection about care, self-care and caring for oneself and establishes these issues' relations with the paradigms of totality and simultaneity. On the first part of the text, care and its general aspects are contextualized; the second part discusses about care in Martin Heidegger's philosophical perspective; the third part explores self-care on Dorothea Orem's conception; the fourth part considers Michel Foucault's care of oneself. And finally, the fifth part aims to establish the relationship between the concepts of self-care and care of oneself, and the totality and simultaneity paradigms. Self-care and care of oneself are connected to the objectivism of the totality, and to the subjectivism of the simultaneity. These subjects lead nursing to comprehend such paradigmatic inheritance and its implications on the nursing care.","2094":"It is quite common to consider the terms ambiguous and confusing as synonyms. Confusing information brings together various data with similar meanings. In ambiguous information, on the other hand, several meanings are assigned to a single word. Excessive information also generates ambiguity; therefore, a concise, clear language is demanded. The term adverse event (AE) is defined as any inconvenient medical occurrence suffered by a subject during a clinical investigation research. Confusion and ambiguity in the use of words may generate relevant consequences in the appraisal of AEs. The objective of this present theoretical study is to harmonize the vocabulary applied in the characterization of risks and in the communication of AEs in clinical research processes. AEs may be classified according to their predictability, frequency, gravity, causality, and severity. Regulatory documents usually address AEs in their severity and causality aspects. Vocabulary conformity in the communication of AEs is an essential step towards avoiding inaccurate use of words with confused or ambiguous meanings.","2095":"This article reflects on technology and humanization in care of newborns, having as theoretical premise the health-illness process. Some parallels are established among the several conceptions of health and illness, and their influences in the way we behave and think about the care spaces as subjects of the neonatal care. The Kangaroo Mother Care is presented as a relational technology that proposes to shelter the family-baby unity in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, valuing experiences and major needs of affection and comprehension.","2096":"This transversal, survey-based research was carried out with a multiprofessional emergency care team in Belo Horizonte, between June and December 2006. The study aimed at estimating the incidence of occupational accidents by exposure to biological material, post-accidents conducts and demographic determinant factors. The study applied a structured questionnaire and descriptive analyses, as well as incidence calculations and logistic regression. The incidence of accidents with biological material reached 20.6%, being 40.8% by sharp materials and 49.0% by body fluids; 35.3% of the accidents took place among physicians and 24.0% among nurses. Post-accidents procedures: no medical assessment, 63.3%; under-notification, 81.6%; no conduct, 55.0%; and no serological follow-up, 61.2%. Factors associated with accidents: working time in the institution (Odds Ratio--OR, 2.84; Credible Interval--CI 95%-1.22-6.62); working in advanced support units (OR = 4.18; CI 95%--1.64-10.64); and interaction between working time in the institution and working in Basic Support Unit (OR 0.27; CI 95%--0.07-1.00). In order to reduce accidents, the implementation of post-accident protocols and follow-up, as well as under-notification norms, are suggested.","2097":"This study identified how health professionals assess work conditions in different hospitals and verified how these conditions affect labor satisfaction. The sample was composed of 213 professionals from several healthcare fields. The analysis of the results indicated a distinct profile among the hospitals when it comes to work conditions. In a general perspective, the study observed low labor quality averages in State-run hospitals, while the highest ones were observed in the philanthropic hospital. This result corroborates the current condition of Brazilian public health. It also significantly associates labor satisfaction with the variables of family income and workplace. Therefore, conflicts in this scenario are considered as inevitable due to the precarious structure of some public health institutions; however, these problems can be foreseen and solved if hospitals create a free, accessible expression channel to all agents.","2098":"This exploratory, descriptive study aimed to describe and analyze the vulnerability of HIV serodiscordant couples. The research was developed at an Aids Outpatient Service in a city in the State of Sao Paulo. Data were collected through individual interviews with 11 HIV\/AIDS carriers who had a known serodiscordant partner. Prose analysis was applied for data organization and analyses, and the concept of vulnerability was used as a theoretical reference. The naturalization of HID\/AIDS related to an undetectable viral load, the invulnerability feeling that stems from the time spent together by the couple, and its influence in the maintenance of safe sex are vulnerability factors for seronegative sexual partners. Specialized services to assist HIV\/AIDS carriers need to include sexual partners in actions promoted by healthcare professionals targeting prevention and\/or education.","2099":"The present study is a qualitative and phenomenological research aimed to understand the phenomenon Nurses working in the FHP (Family Health Program) and home care provided to the family living in a home where terminality of one of its members is being experienced. The study was carried out with healthcare providers who work in the Southeastern Region of the city of Sao Paulo\/SP, Brazil. Existential phenomenology was used as the theoretical background. This study made possible the comprehension of what this experience meant to healthcare providers in a moment of being with the family in an existential situation of loss and death, creating a home protection network in order to make this process of terminality of one of the family members as smooth as possible. Even though permeated by care giving filled with humane feelings, thus representing a unique and remarkable experience, it was also a weary and difficult event that triggered labor health problems.","2100":"This is a qualitative study aimed at analyzing the performance of healthcare professionals, as well as their contribution to a holistic-oriented care towards newborn babies in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The study was carried out in the Sofia Feldman Hospital, in Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The study's subjects were ten healthcare professionals who cared for newborns in the NICU, and seven parents of admitted newborns. Data was collected by means of workshops and participant observation processes. Data were treated and analyzed by means of discourse analysis concepts. The resulting data highlighted the following aspects: the potential and holistic-oriented practices of healthcare professionals; the presence or absence of healthcare actions that materialized the holistic care; the different perceptions of the participants about the work carried out by the team; and in what sense the rationale of the work organization encompassed the workers' collective performance.","2101":"This study has the objective of understanding the existential experience of mothers of children hospitalized in an intensive pediatric care unit (IPCU). It is a qualitative-based research grounded on the humanistic nursing theory. The investigation scenario was the IPCU of a public hospital. Five mothers of children who were hospitalized in the referred unit participated in the investigation. Data were analyzed from the standpoint of the five phases of the phenomenological nursing. The following issues emerged from the collected statements: the relationship between mothers and nursing professionals at the moment of admission and throughout the child's hospitalization period in the IPCU; and mothers who experience fear, despair and loneliness in face of the child's disease. The present study highlights the complexity of a mother-centered approach and subsidizes a new look at the field of the care, teaching and nursing research.","2102":null,"2103":"Family participation in the care of a hospitalized child, both regarding its forms and dimension, has been a theme of study in nursing. The objective of this study was to analyze the organization of both nursing care and family care to the hospitalized child. This qualitative research was performed using semi-structured interviews with nursing staff of a school-hospital. Theme analysis was used to guide data organization. The results show that nursing care focuses on procedures. Interaction with the children and their family is tangential to the caring process. Families have shared responsibilities with the staff but have not been recognized as a co-participant or been included into the caring perspective. Efforts should be made to create bonds to promote a logic regarding the process of work within the integrality perspective and to rescue the caring dimension of nursing.","2104":"As nurses face challenges in the development of care focused on the family as a context and unit of intervention, this research aimed to identify family intervention processes in the context of Primary Healthcare. This qualitative-based study adopted the investigation-action approach on a study plan's five-step path. By means of the comparative analysis of family care practices and conceptual models, the diagnosis results brought forth the need for change triggered by training processes. Having the Systemic Model, the Calgary Family Assessment Model, and the Calgary Family Intervention Model as references, the family nursing care model was (re)constructed and operationalized through the definition of attention and intervention areas. The (re) construction of the model from the needs identified by nurses and legitimated by their decision-making processes is the basis for family nursing focused discussions.","2105":"This descriptive research aims to identify the profile of the family caregiver using the World Health Organization's QPFC and WHOQOL-Bref (instrument application methods) in a sample of 120 family caregivers of dependent elderly patients who represented the population of three Healthcare Centers in the area of the Great Porto, Portugal. Data were collected in the period between January 2005 and March 2005. Results indicated that female caregivers with 55 years of average age, who had other family care giving duties besides caring for the elderly family member, were the majority. The circumstances surrounding care giving, in the perspective of the elderly patient and the other family demands, generated negative consequences to the caregiver's life and health. However, at the same time, caregivers expressed positive perceptions and rewarding feelings when caring for the elderly family member. In a nutshell, it is essential for nurses to consider the binomial caregiver and dependent elderly patient, since both demand special healthcare attention from healthcare services.","2106":"The objective of this study is to characterize elderly victims of traumas admitted to three tertiary hospitals in Londrina, Paran State. This quantitative-based research lasted six months and was carried out by means of an observational and cross-sectional study of 121 elderly people (60 to 74 years old) and their caregivers at the patients' homes, by the use of interviews. Results indicated that the majority of the elderly patients were males, with average age of 67.7 years. The suffered traumas were distributed as follows: 62.0% by falls; 25.6% by transport accidents; and 10.4% by other sources. As a consequence of the trauma, the elderly patient had from one to three injuries and 11 (9.1%) died. Falls were the major source of traumas. This event can be avoided by the observations of predisposing intrinsic and extrinsic factors, aiming at establishing prevention strategies to this type of trauma.","2107":"This quantitative-based, prospective-oriented study aims to evaluate the repercussion of hair removal in post-craniotomy's patient self-esteem. Data show that the majority of patients mentioned not having an altered self-esteem due to hair removal; self-esteem was kept the same among patients that were instructed about the hair removal process. The major part of patients made use of accessories as a strategy to hide shaved areas and believed that hair removal damaged neither their quality of life nor their social relationships. We conclude that the feelings directly related to the decrease of self-esteem are loss of physical attraction, insecurity and shame. The employment of accessories is made necessary towards improving self-esteem, and healthcare professionals must work with the psychosocial aspects of pre and post-surgery patients.","2108":"Successful heart transplantation in patients with Chagas disease depends on special care to be provided during all phases of the transplantation process, and requires specific and rigorous follow-up by the health care team. Recipients must be aware of the permanence of the trypanosome in their organisms as well as of the possibility of infection reactivation after transplantation. Therefore, the patient's knowledge regarding this condition and his active participation in his own treatment are of utmost importance. This study aimed at investigating heart transplantation as experienced by patients with Chagas disease, seeking to understand the meanings that they attribute to such an experience. The methodological procedures included: patient selection; interviews; data analysis, indication of the meaning units and individual analysis; search for discourse convergence; and hermeneutic analysis of convergences. From the data analysis, the following themes emerged: the time lived by recipients with Chagas Disease; the conception of heart transplantation presented by patients with Chagas Disease; and care in the course of heart transplantation.","2109":"This descriptive and cross-sectional study aimed to assess the Quality of Life (QoL) of cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy. The instrument European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer--Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used for data collection. The sample consisted of 30 patients who signed the informed consent term. Data were analyzed in SPSS software. The QLQ-C30 showed that, for physical, cognitive and social functions, and role performance mean scores ranged from 71.26 to 75.12, demonstrating a satisfactory level. In the emotional function, the mean score was low (55.46). On the symptoms scales, there were a predominance of insomnia, with a mean score of 34.44, followed by pain 23.33 and fatigue 22.31. The QoL was satisfactory in all domains except for the emotional function, which scored low demonstrating that the collateral effects of chemotherapy exert a negative influence on patients' quality of life.","2110":"The present study exploresanddescribesthe adaptation phenomena following spinal cord injury, focusing on the applied strategies of adaptation and identifying the necessary nursing care. The research used a qualitative approach, applying the Grounded Theory as a methodological reference. A group of nine individuals who had spinal cord injuries, and who presented a successful adaptation to a new way of life, was assessed by means of semi-directed interviews. Documentary analyses about life histories were performed and the Grounded Theory was used for data analyses. The study allowed for the explanation of the adaptation phenomena following the event of the spinal cord injury, which highlighted the influence of the acceptance of a new meaning of life and the maintenance of the will to manage new situations and challenges stemming from the injury. The central subject of this study is the spiritual dimension of the Individual. This anticipates a specific nursing intervention for people suffering from spinal cord injuries.","2111":"This study aimed at learning how relatives of patients with mental disorders have experienced dealing with a mental health care service. The exploratory and descriptive method was used with a qualitative approach. Data collection was performed using semi-structured interviews. Subjects were six family members who had been living for over three years with the process of having a mentally ill relative. Data analysis allowed us to infer that relatives who closely follow the patient had to deal with the knowledge acquired from their day-today experience and were subject to rejection by other family and community members. As regards the psychosocial care center, the relatives felt welcomed in their complaints, receiving a unique treatment; however, they did not knowthe mechanisms for social participation, which points to a deficiency in the service as it should stimulate forms of insertion into the community and the strengthening of the patients' rights as citizens.","2112":"The objective of the present research was to analyze the therapeutic factors identified in the accounts of the participants of a group of people with diabetes. An exploratory, assessing research carried out by means of semi-structured interviews pinpointed the following therapeutic factors: information availability (100%); cohesion (100%); universality (86%); interpersonal learning (57%); development of socialization techniques (57%); altruism (28.5%); imitative behavior (28.5%); and hope stimulus (28.5%). The implementation of group intervention actions for the promotion of self-care towards diabetes carriers can generate a beneficial interaction among group members, thus allowing for experience exchange processes, as well as a broader understanding of the disease and other positive experiences evidenced by the presence of the therapeutic factors.","2113":"This study aims to analyze the degree of knowledge adolescents have on STD\/AIDS prevention, transmission, signs, and symptoms, and to contribute with the elaboration of educational actions in the University Extension Program called Corporality and Health Promotion. The research counted on 1,087 adolescents (40% females, 60% males) and was carried out in three elementary and high schools located in the municipality of Embu. A structured, multiple choice questionnaire was applied. Data indicated the achievement of the following results: as per the prevention, 92% of girls and 78% of boys referred to the use of condoms, while 42% of girls and 43% of boys affirmed to wash their genitalia after the sexual relation; 75% females and 52% males quoted television as their source of information. As per the knowledge of STD, girls and boys indicated not to have much information on the issue. Regarding STD healing programs, 57% females and 71% males affirmed not to have any knowledge on the issue; 5% of girls and 6% of boys thought AIDS to be curable. In a general perspective, we can conclude that girls were more familiar with the study's issues than boys.","2114":"Using the Glasgow Coma Scale (ECGI) as a subject, this paper aims to analyze and verify the apprehension of knowledge towards the teaching-learning and self-learning offered to nursing workers, and to check the degree of knowledge acquired during the process and possible results stemming from the nursing student\/nursing worker association. This descriptive, quantitative-based study counted on the participation of 62 currently enrolled students in the first semester of the 4th year of nursing. The following teaching-learning strategies were used: expositive classes with the use of slides and videotape, and a basic text. Among participants, 41.9% were nursing workers; 61.3% informed to have taken care of patients with high alteration of the consciousness level, predominantly located in their working group. Statistically, there has been a successful improvement in the percentage of correct actions after the expositive class and videotape. Self-learning results showed no alteration either. Intergroup correlations displayed no disparity in the degree of acquired knowledge.","2115":"This descriptive, quantitative-based exploratory study was carried out between 2000 and 2005 and aimed at characterizing the profile of students who had completed the Nursing Course at the University of Sao Paulo. From the 465 graduates found in the period of the research, 175 (37.6%) provided responses for the data collection instrument. Their insertion in the job market occurred most of all into private hospitals by means of election processes in the city of Sao Paulo. The majority of the subjects remained in their first jobs from one to six months. The wage of the major part of the graduates ranged from US$ 950.50 to US$ 1520.00. In the data collection process, most of the researched participants had a formal job in private healthcare institutions, with average salaries of US$ 1437.50. Results showed that there was a quick insertion of the graduates into the job market.","2116":"This study aimed at understanding the reality of being a clinical nurse who works with nursing students while they develop their care experience in the clinical practice. The research was carried out by means of a phenomenological approach. Nine clinical nurses were interviewed and based on their discourses four categories of concretely experienced events were identified and interpreted according to Martin Heidegger's philosophical reference. Among the categories emerging from those discourses, this article highlights the following: being a nurse with students in their educational process, and the possibility of being with private and public university students. These aspects are presented here in order to encourage reflections on the important participation of clinical nurses in the education of future nursing professionals.","2117":null,"2118":null,"2119":"The objective of this qualitative-exploratory was to learn about the process of developing knowledge in nursing care in terms of the experiences of the students who attend the seventh semester of a Nursing Course located in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, from April to June\/2007.

This text discusses the Evaluation of College Courses, recovering concepts in the field of Education Evaluation; describes the practices developed in Brazil, directed towards course evaluation, based on the graduate's perspective. The following descriptors were used: college graduates, indicators, evaluation and graduation available in the databases: PeriEnf, BDEnf, LILACS and DEDALUS. The analysis of the surveyed studies highlights the need to consider the opinion of college graduates in the curriculum proposals with a view to implementing an educational process with emancipating and transforming characteristics.","2122":"Preterm birth is an event that affects the child's healthy development. Several studies have addressed the evaluation of children born preterm and the influence that multiple risk factors have on the course of their development. This study performed a systematic review of the literature from 2000 to 2005 about the evaluation of the development of children born preterm until the age of 24 months. The biological risk factors were present in every study, with highlights on intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic pulmonary disease, and retardation of intrauterine development as the most studied risks. The child's motor development was the most studied area. In terms of age, the first evaluations focused on the first six months of life. Neonatal risk, low birth weight, baby boys, cerebral injuries, and first-week abnormal spontaneous movements were predicting factors of preterm child development at the age of two years.","2123":"The purpose of this study was to understand how infant-juvenile prostitution is being explained by researchers through an extensive bibliographical survey on national and international scientific sources. It was possible to access 20 references in full text form, which were analyzed according to the Content Analysis method. The analysis consisted in answering how infant-juvenile prostitution is represented by the author in relation to the concepts, causes, effects and solutions described in the references. It was found that the authors approached the subject as a way of survival, resulting from an unequal society, adult-centered and male chauvinist causing mental and physical diseases in children.","2124":"We aimed to describe the instructions that Alzheimer patient caregivers receive before they participating in the Neuro-geriatrics Center; analyze the applicability of the instructions received at the Neuro-geriatrics Center in everyday home care; and identify the coping and adaptation mechanisms found in these caregivers. We adopted a qualitative approach, in this descriptive-exploratory case study. The chosen technique for data collection was the semistructured interview. Subjects were 15 caregivers seen at a Federal Hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Data analysis was performed using thematic content analysis, and three categories were obtained: Instructions received before participating in the Neuro-geriatrics Center; Instructions received at the Neuro-geriatrics Center; Coping and adaptation mechanisms within the context of family care. It is concluded that the coping mechanisms are used to adapt to overload situations, which can be relieved through the educational and emotional support received in the orientation groups.","2125":"The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the health information system in monitoring woman abuse by analyzing the extent to which each data source may contribute to actual event dimensioning and underlie the decision-making process. Therefore, the text presents advances and contributions of each officially existent database in the health sector, and also its persistent shortcomings due to the scarce sensitivity and specificity of these systems in monitoring woman abuse. The article also discusses the need for further studies in order to deepen the issue, as well as a gender-based information policy for analysis and intervention of the violence determinants against women, considering the significance and seriousness of the issue, not only for women but also for society as a whole.","2126":null,"2127":"The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmacological strategies to relieve pain in parturients in labor. This is a before and after therapeutic intervention clinical trial, performed at a public maternity in the city of Natal, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, with 100 parturients applying breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, lumbosacral massage, and showers. A visual analogue scale was used for data collection. Most parturients were between 20- and 30-years-old (60%), had incomplete primary-level education (85%), family income of up to 2 minimum salaries (74%), and 78% had a companion with them at the hospital. Oxytocine was administered in 81% of cases, but 15% did not receive any medication. A significant difference was observed in pain relief after using non-pharmacological strategies, showing reduced pain as cervix dilation increased. It was concluded that the strategies were effective in reducing the intensity of pain in the studied parturients in labor.","2128":"The objective of this study is to perform the content validation often Nursing Care Quality Indicators in Adverse Event Prevention. Nine experts took part in this study and answered three forms. The results appointed the validity of the indicators, but with reformulations. The process yielded twelve indicators: identification of the patient's bed; identification of the risk of falling out of bed; Identification of peripheral venous accesses; Verification of skin lesions after infiltrations; Identification of venous infusion equipment; Identification of serum bottles and infusion speed control; Identification of peptic probes; Fixation of vesical delay probe and positioning of the urine collection bag; Checking of Procedures in Nursing Prescription; Control of Vital Signs; Checking of Nursing Procedures in Medical Prescription and Nursing elaboration of daily and complete prescription. The results confirm that the content validation procedure is indispensable for the development of evaluative measures.","2129":"This retrospective descriptive study, using structured validated questionnaires, analyzed 86 hospital housekeeping workers who were exposed to a huge diversity of occupational risks at a public municipal teaching and emergency hospital. The purpose of this study was to identify the quality of life aspects and musculoskeletal symptoms in hospital housekeeping workers. The results found by administering the Nordic Questionnaire confirmed that workers had problems in some part of their bodies. This finding accused musculoskeletal symptoms, mainly involving the following body parts: shoulders, upper back, neck and lower back. The difference between the groups of workers with or without musculoskeletal symptoms pointed out on the Nordic Questionnaire and obtained by applying the generic Quality of Life evaluation questionnaire (SF-36) was significant for the Functional Capacity, Pain, General Health Condition, Vitality and Mental Health domains.","2130":"Nurses work within the interface of the population's process of falling ill and of occupational diseases. In this setting, chronic diseases are evidenced, and they affect the work process. The purpose of this study was to identify, in nurses, the measures used to prevent health problems in the presence of a chronic disease, analyze the relation between their knowledge and attitudes toward chronic diseases, and the relation of risk factors with their work process. This is a quantitative and descriptive study, involving 23 nurses with chronic diseases, representing 76.6% of the 30 nurses diagnosed with a chronic illness at a Federal Hospital, 22 of whom are women. It was observed that the nurses comply with the treatment proposed for their disease and have effective strategies to cope with the fact of falling ill, changing their lifestyles. Furthermore, they reported there were factors in their work environment that contribute to worsen their illness.","2131":"The purpose of this descriptive study was to evaluate the social support and self-esteem of coronary disease patients hospitalized for the clinical treatment of this disease. The sample consisted of 80 patients, 49 men, 52 married, and with an average age of 52 years. Interviews took place from August 2005 to July 2006. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, and the measured social support and self-esteem were compared by the descriptive statistics, and the social support and self-esteem measures were compared using the Mann-Whitney test, according to patient gender. Internal consistency was verified, achieving values that indicate good internal consistency for both scales. The results showed high social support and self-esteem values in the studied group. No statistically significant differences were found between these values, according to patient gender. These variables have been pointed out as aspects that favor the rehabilitation process of heart disease patients after hospital discharge.","2132":"This is a descriptive study using a qualitative approach. The purpose was to analyze women's perception about female vulnerability to acquire STD\/HIV. The study took place in 2006 at a university campus in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Interviews were carried out with 12 women, older than 18 years, of different educational levels, ethnic origins and religions. The women were students, technical-administrative workers and faculty members, among other users. The study complied with the requirements of the National Research Ethics Committee. Data analysis was performed according to the premises of Content Analysis. Results revealed two large dimensions: one related with the women's personal perception and their behaviors, and another related with these women's opinion about other women's behavior. This article discusses the data regarding the collective dimension. It was concluded that the interviewed women recognize vulnerability factors in other women and realize the risk that others face of acquiring STD\/HIV, but do not consider themselves to be at risk.","2133":"The objective of this study was to understand the experiences of family members of patients seen at a Psychosocial Care Center (PSCC) in terms of the work performed by the mental health team. The theoretical-philosophical framework used was phenomenological sociology. Data collection took place by means of an interview performed with 13 family members in October and November, 2006 at a PSCC in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The comprehensive analysis yielded three categories. This article focuses on one of those categories: work as a project, action, and act. The analysis permitted to consider that the PSCC team's work has concrete results in mental health care; the team's actions are user-centered; and that the team's work should increase family-service integration. These considerations could serve as support for mental health teams to reflect about their practice regarding involving the patient's family in their work.","2134":"This is a descriptive, analytical qualitative study, which looks at workers' action in the Inclusion Cup (their work processes). It aims to understand if that action considers mental health service users' real life and, to do this, it adopted the following theoretical categories: the elements constituting the work process, health technologies and the premises of the psychosocial field. The empirical data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and analyzed according to the discourse analysis technique. Results point at changes in the users' lives, in services and in the society coherent with the premises of the Brazilian Psychiatric Reform. The Inclusion Cup proves that intersectorial activities are living work in their action, use intervention instruments that are very strong in terms of rescuing and building the citizenship of people with mental disorders. The changes (purposes of the work processes) may be occurring because the intervention project is no longer centered on the disease.","2135":"This study assessed individuals undergoing treatment at a Psychosocial Care Center for Alcohol and Drugs Abuse (CAPS ad) in Southern Brazil. There were 300 hours of participant observation and focal groups, in which the ecomap was used as an instrument to describe social support sources. The study objective was to identify the social network of individuals undergoing treatment due to drug abuse, promoting a reflection about the quality and situation of the bonds established with the people they considered important. The results showed a trajectory of separations and losses. The ecomap permitted to identify points of vulnerability in these subjects' bonds, and is thus an ethical strategy that allows for a joint identification (between professionals and users) of the needs regarding the social, family, and individual contexts that should be addressed when planning health care, especially concerning mental health.","2136":"This study analyzed the concepts of bonding that guide the practice of Family Health Program (FHP) teams in terms of tuberculosis (TB) control measures in the public health setting, in the city of Bayeux, Paraiba, Brazil. Using a qualitative approach, the study involved 37 health care professionals. Data collection took place using the focal group technique, in April 2007. Data analysis was performed based on discourse analysis. It was observed that FHP team concepts about attachment were in agreement with the studied theoretical concepts, with evidences of trust, commitment, intimacy, and responsibility in the team\/patient relationship. The following aspects strengthen the bond: the time that FHP teams work in the community; the number of home visits and consultations and the involvement with TB control. Bond weaknesses: insufficient intersectorial measures, the patient's socioeconomic situation, and family abandonment. It is emphasized that there is a need for changes that would strengthen the relationship between the FHP team\/patient. This way there would be a concrete care founded on the integrality of health care service routine.","2137":null,"2138":"The objective of this study was to identify caregivers' activities in elderly-patient hospital care and the activities that the nursing team expects caregivers to perform, according to activity frequency (always, when necessary, and never). Interviews were carried out with thirty family members of hospitalized elderly patients and with 30 nursing professionals. The results showed there were very significant differences in terms of frequency: always, regarding the activities changing position, cleaning mouth and teeth, dressing and undressing, sitting, standing, and caring for the skin; when necessary for the activities standing, using the toilet, walking, and exercising; and never for the activity walking.","2139":null,"2140":"Training laypeople to give first aid in emergency situations and offer basic life support (BLS) is crucial in order to save lives and avoid sequelae. The objective was to identify laypeople's knowledge about BLS. Structured interviews were performed using non-technical language. The sample consisted of 385 subjects. Most (57.1%) were women with complete secondary-level education and incomplete higher education (53.7%). It was verified that only 9.9% know the mouth-to-mouth ventilation maneuver; 84.2% knew the chest compression technique (CCT), and 79.9% of these knew its purpose. Only 14.5% know how to position the victim to perform CCT; 82.4% reported a frequency below 60 CCT minute. Since they do not have adequate information and foundations regarding the stages of BLS, laypeople can give incorrect first aid to victims, which can harm resuscitation.","2141":null,"2142":"The objective of this study is to characterize prehospital teamwork service for traffic accident victims, identifying the actors' activities, the teamwork and the relations with actors from other areas. This is a qualitative study, in which data collection took place by observing the events that occurred at a public service in the city of Porto Alegre, in addition to interviews with each professional involved in the service. The results showed that prehospital care is founded on teamwork and that the understanding among professionals should go beyond the historical hierarchic relation existing in health organizations. There is a need to value the broad field of knowledge, which is associated with the core of care activities that meet most trauma victim needs.","2143":"The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of health care professionals regarding their use of universal precaution measures at a public emergency service. The study also aimed to assess the rates of occupational accidents involving biological substances among those workers. This study was performed with 238 workers, from June to November 2006, using univariate and multivariate analysis. The chance of not adopting precaution measures was 20.7 (95% CI: 5.68 - 75.14) times greater among drivers compared to physicians. No significant association was found between adopting universal precaution measures. The occupational accident rate was 20.6% (40.8% involving sharp-edged objects). The risk of physicians having an occupational accident was 2.7(95% CI: 1.05 -7.09) times higher than that of drivers. The fact that a staff member had adequate knowledge about universal precaution measures was insufficient to foster compatible attitudes towards reducing the risk of transmitting infectious agents and causing occupational accidents.","2144":"Urinary incontinence (UI) is seen as a problem that affects older multiparous women. Little attention has been given to identifying UI in groups of younger or nulliparous women. This study verified the prevalence of UI and the characteristics of urinary loss among young nulliparous female physical education students. Data collection was performed using a questionnaire. Of all 95 students, 61.1% answered the questionnaire. The average age was 21.4 years and 20.7% stated having presented involuntary urine loss. In 75% of cases, urinary loss occurred during sports activities. The students who had experienced urinary loss rated the problem with a 2.3 average score (ranging form 0 to 6), with 0 being no problem and 10 being a serious problem. It is concluded that urinary loss during exercise, though relatively frequent, is not considered a relevant issue for the physical education students.","2145":null,"2146":"This study addresses the use of digital learning materials in the format of hypertext, educational games and simulations about oxygen therapy with professors of an Undergraduate Nursing Course. It is a cross-sectional exploratory study that was carried out at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in 2006 with 10 intentionally selected professors. Data collection was performed by means of a questionnaire, using a Likert scale to assess the suitability of the content, visual presentation and use of learning materials. Descriptive statistics was used to organize and process the data. Results showed that the professors approved of the presentation of educational materials, they agreed with the suitability of the contents presented and with using the materials with the content regarding oxygen therapy. There was no significant relation between the professors' opinion and their age group, nor with their computer technology knowledge, their time in teaching and the addressed contents.","2147":"The aim of this study is to understand how nursing undergraduates perceive themselves while care delivery to terminal patients and expose the meaning of the experience they have. Fourteen students were interviewed, and answered the following question: What is the image you have about caring for a terminal patient? Students always consider this to be a painful experience, one that puts them face to face with their weaknesses and insecurities. They attribute their difficulties to their personal incapacity to accept death and to their lack of preparation and their inexperience. They report a lack of support from professionals with whom they share this care. In terms of professional development, for some, the experience was positive, despite the difficulties; others evaluate it as negative, resulting in a rejection of similar situations. Further studies on this subject are needed with a view to a deeper and broader reflection on nursing education in Brazil.","2148":"A regionalized figure scale (RAD) was developed. The objective was to validate the scale, evaluate the correlation between the visual acuity coefficients, verify the association between the tests, and verify the agreement between the measures. This is a triple-blind, experimental, random technology validation study performed on 246 students. Sensitivity was 88.6 RAD1 and 85.7 RAD2 for the right eye (RE), and 78.6 and 92.9 for the left eye (LE), whereas RE specificity was 95.3 RAD1 and 98.1 RAD2, and, 97.7 and 98.6 for the LE, respectively. As for the positive predictive value, RAD1 was 75.6 RE and 81.5 LE, and RAD2 88.2 RE and 89.7 LE. The negative predictive value in RAD1 was 98.0 RE and 97.3 LE, and in RAD2 97.6 RE and 99.1 LE.

The objective was to characterize, from a longitudinal view, the construction of care competencies that exist in the teaching plans of nursing undergraduate programs. This exploratory-descriptive study used a qualitative approach. Documentary analysis was performed on the nine teaching plans of undergraduate care subjects. The ethical-legal aspects were guaranteed, so that data was collected only after the study had been approved by the Research Ethics Committee. The data evidenced a curriculum organization centered on subjects, maintaining internal rationales that seem to resist summative organizations. Signs emerge of hardly substantial links between any previous knowledge and the strengthening of critical judgment and clinical reasoning. As proposed, the study contributed with reconsiderations for the teaching-learning process and showed the influence of constructivism on the proposal of clinical competencies.","2151":"","2152":"Surgical scrubs are made with both fabric and non-fabric material. The study aimed to observe whether there is scientific evidence, according to the systematic review, that supports the practice of wearing scrubs in surgeries, according to the material they are made of. Basic intervention studies were considered, which investigated contamination and\/or infection of the surgical site with the use of either reusable or single-use surgical scrubs, using people submitted to surgeries as the study population, either in real or simulated situations, at any period, without any language limitations. The strategy of searching electronic databases was used to find studies. With this, difficulties in isolating the object of intervention from countless other factors that can interfere in the outcomes were identified in studies of this type. Two studies (E1 and E2) showed strong evidence for the recommendation. In conclusion, there is no difference in contamination and infection of the surgical site between fabric and non-fabric scrubs.","2153":"Hypertension has high prevalence and mortality. Preventing and controlling this disease poses a challenge, which implies in considering the educational process as a necessary tool for care. The study had the purpose to reflect on the assumptions for care in the healthcare education of hypertensive people. It was observed that the assumptions for caring, in the process of healthcare education, are based on considering the person instead of the sick body, and in comprehending caring while being capable of investing in the clinic of the individual, favoring spaces for sensitive listening and welcoming, comprehension of suffering, the meaning of falling ill and caring for the self. We expect this reflection to contribute for the implementation and enhancement of new forms of caring in the programs of hypertension, comprehending the human being as someone destined to have freedom, happiness and full satisfaction.","2154":"Pressure ulcers are still considered a serious problem, especially in elderly people and in situations of chronic-degenerative diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify the literature production about actions of prevention and treatment performed by nurses published from 1999 to 2004, describing the knowledge produced about the theme. This is a descriptive literature review of nursing journals indexed in LILACS and MEDLINE about the theme from 1999 to 2004. Data collection occurred from May to June, 2005. Afterwards, the material was read exhaustively, which yielded three aspects to be studied: prevention of pressure ulcers, treatment of pressure ulcers and nursing care of pressure ulcers. It was also concluded that there is need for research involving the work of the nurses in the clinical evaluation of the client and the development of systematized prevention programs.","2155":"The purpose of this study was to describe the background, attributes and consequences of the concept of dignified death for children. The concept analysis strategy was used to evaluate the 40 articles found in journals in the medical and nursing areas, which studied or focused on the dignified death of children. The attributes of the dignified death concept include: quality of life, child- and family-centered care, specific knowledge about palliative care, shared decisions, relieving the child's suffering, clear communication, helpful relations and a welcoming environment. Few articles bring the definition of a dignified death for children, and, when they do, such definition is vague and often ambiguous among the many authors. This aspect indicates that the concept is not defined consistently, demanding studies about its manifestation in the clinical practice, contributing with the care at the end of life in Pediatrics.","2156":"The purpose of this study is to present a theoretical reflection about the relation between the Human Being, health and disease concepts, and the perspectives stemming from the development of the Quantum Theory. It presents arguments for the comprehension that, from the moment where the spiritual dimension is recognized, there is the need for reformulation of concepts that guide the professional practice, since they make interpretation possible and direct the communicational response that, in the case of healthcare, results in the service provided to the patient. The study also understands that the necessity of furthering the communicational level exerted on people is imperative to provide care and to comprehend the spiritual dimension of the Human Being.","2157":"It is necessary to understand the person who will receive care in order to provide zealous and authentic care. This requires the caregiver to carefully research the existential experience of the being who needs care. It demands, overall, that one knows how to question and to reflect on what is revealed. By believing in the fundamentals of phenomenology, the authors have been attempting to build a methodology in the art of nursing care. Being inspired by this perspective, they attempt to develop phenomenological thinking and skills so that they can be with the other, in an authentic mode of solicitude. In this article, reflections about the patient-being's comprehension are presented, and about a methodology of care, so that they can support the nurses in their day-to-day activities.","2158":null,"2159":null,"2160":"This study aimed to understand the testimonies of disabled people about the concreteness of the social inclusion process, as well as to articulate their testimonies with the directives of Law 3289\/99. Eighteen people were interviewed, six of which were physically disabled, six visually disabled, and six had hearing disabilities. Data were standardized and categorized in two meaning cores: pre-inclusivist and inclusivist guidelines of the disabled person. The methodological perspective was discourse analysis. In conclusion, these subjects had achievements in legislation that guarantees their rights to citizenship, but there are challenges in the areas of healthcare, education, professional training and insertion in the job market. The rehabilitation nurses must know the experiences of these subjects and their relatives to help them with strategies of coping for the problems affecting their inclusion, and consequently their health.","2161":null,"2162":"Non-compliance with drug-based treatment is a complex and universal phenomenon that develops gradually during psychiatric treatments, and is related to disease aggravation. The purpose of this study was to describe the profile of using a given medication in the clientele of a community mental healthcare service and its characteristics. We performed a retrospective study in the medical records of patients who used Haloperidol Decanoate in a period of 1 year and 8 months. 167 medical records were analyzed. 60% of the patients presented irregular use of medication, which reflects in high risks of relapse and re-hospitalizations. This profile configures low compliance with the prescribed drug treatment, leading to reflections about which factors influence this behavior and which measures could be implemented in the maintenance of extra-hospital treatment for these patients.","2163":null,"2164":"This study had the purpose to understand academic participation and its relation with the professional life, according to the perception of nurses who experience it. The study was based on the precepts of qualitative research and the modality of the phenomenon, or Phenomenology.

The inclusion criterion was that these studies should have been published in the past five years. The sample was made up of 14 studies (four dissertations, two theses and eight articles). The content analysis method allowed for the identification of three thematic categories: the researcher's perspective, what their perspective identifies and their perspective beyond the physical body--which reveal the necessity of addressing women considering their whole context as human beings, including issues of vulnerability, social gender ideology and the promotion of self-esteem and citizenship.","2174":"The main purpose of this study was to verify why incontinent women, users of a Basic Healthcare Unit in Campinas, SP, do not seek treatment for urinary incontinence (UI). This is a descriptive, cross-section study, where 213 women who attended the service to have their cancer cytology examination were approached, and 35 of them, being incontinent, were included in the study. Three questionnaires were used: ICIQ-SF, King's Health Questionnaire and a specific instrument elaborated for this study. A large share of the subjects (45.7%) did not know any form of UI treatment, and more than half (65.7%) did not seek treatment for the problem, with the main stated reasons being that they thought that urinary loss was normal, did not consider it important and the physician said that it was not necessary. It is concluded that the lack of knowledge about the types of treatment can contribute for not seeking professional help.","2175":"This is a qualitative study with the purpose to understand the social representations of the diabetic foot for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Semi-structured interviews were held with ten people with diabetes mellitus, who participated in a support group. Two categories emerged from the content analysis: the foot disease with perceived alterations and present threats, and feet care, with care as a concern with the future, and non-care as a feeling of guilt. The results show that the subjects seek hopes of not developing foot disease or controlling the situation, influenced by the representations of alterations and threats. When non-care occurs, the feeling of guilt emerges, since the subjects knew about the necessary care but did not use it. The social representations contributed in the search for comprehension of how the subjects with diabetes mellitus build the knowledge that that express their identity and guide their behavior, especially regarding the diabetic foot.","2176":null,"2177":"This study had the purpose to identify the sociodemographic and clinical profiles, history of hospitalizations due to Heart Failure (HF) and follow-ups (regular appointments, drug treatment, facilities and difficulties for follow-up) of patients admitted for clinical decompensation.

Both predicted and actual mortality rates were compared, according to four risk groups: 0-4%, 5-14%, 15-49%, 50% and over, and the area under the ROC curve of the POSSUM and APACHE II for mortality. The POSSUM and APACHE II scores overestimated the risk of death. The area under the ROC curve of the POSSUM was 0.762, and under APACHE II was 0.737, suggesting the use of POSSUM as an auxiliary tool to predict the risk of death in surgical patients.","2181":"This is a descriptive, cross-sectional, qualitative study performed at the surgical units of two hospitals in the city of Ponta Grossa. The purpose was to characterize the nursing care provided to patients in the pre-surgical period of elective surgeries. The studied population, chosen as a convenience sample, consisted of 129 patients, aged 18 to 70 years. Data collection was performed through structured interviews carried out at the hospital after the surgery. The results show that the care provided is mainly focused on the physical preparation of the patient, in which few instructions are provided about the surgical procedure and the nursing care delivered. It was also observed that some types of nursing care embarrass the patients, such as wearing the surgical gown and removing their underwear and dental prosthetics. Eventually, this study allowed for the identification of weaknesses in the care provided to the surgical patients, so as to contribute for the reflection about the need to make changes in the nursing practices performed in the hospital.","2182":"","2183":"The goal of this study was to identify the scientific production about work-related needlestick accidents among nursing professionals involving HIV-contaminated biological material, as well as to characterize the pre-existing factors to such accidents, such as procedures occurring after the exposure to potentially HIV-contaminated needlestick material. This is a literature review, whose bibliographic search for keywords was carried out within the LILACS databases from the year 2000 onward. This study confirms that pre-existing factors for the occurrence of work-related needlestick accidents are related to work conditions as much as to individual conditions. In face of these accidents, the nursing workers need to know the conducts concerning post-exposure to potentially HIV-contaminated needlestick material. We conclude that the adoption of standardized precautions when working in healthcare is a fundamental condition for worker safety, independently of their area of expertise, given the increasing number of HIV cases.","2184":"The proposal of Health Surveillance is a techno-assistance model that is still in construction in Brazil. To implement the Health Surveillance proposition, the healthcare professionals have to be prepared to capture and understand the epidemiologic and social profiles of the population.

This study was aimed at describing the health condition of the elderly within the wide picture of old folks homes and identifying how the elderly perceive their own health. It is a qualitative study for which data was collected through participative observation and half-structured interviews with 17 elderly living in an old folks home in Rio de Janeiro. The results showed that the elderly see their health as satisfactory because there is no pain, no physical discomfort and they have a feeling of security provided by the fact that they live in the institution. On the other hand, concerns related to aches and suffering deriving from natural losses, distance from the family and feelings of solitude and abandonment were conditions associated to the occurrence of diseases. It was concluded that the social fact of living in an old folks home is characterized mainly as an abandonment, which has a direct impact on the health conditions of this population.","2253":null,"2254":"This study was aimed at knowing the conception nurses who work in the Family Health Program have about the development of teamwork regarding the coordination of the actions of the various professionals that comprise it. It is a descriptive study with a qualitative approach. The data collection was carried out through semi-structured interviews with 23 nurses. The analysis of the data was carried out based on Theme Analysis. The results showed that the nurses, at certain moments, coordinate their actions with the other professionals of the team. However, there are factors that make this coordination difficult, such as excess of demand from users and lack of time for the professionals to prepare the collective planning of their practices and develop preventive actions. According to the results obtained, it is necessary to reorganize the work process in order to perform an effectively integrated work.","2255":null,"2256":"This exploratory-descriptive survey was carried out with a sample consisting of 73 nurses from two hospitals in order to know the perception they have of their work via-a-vis patients' rights and develop an instrument capable of measuring such perception. Four constructs referring to the nurses' performance via-a-vis patients' rights were identified and validated, based on questions the nurses answered: preservation of individuality; respect for the patient's autonomy; personal identification; and information for decision-taking. Preservation of individuality was the construct with the best performance. Respect for the patient's autonomy and personal identification appear in an intermediate level, whereas the construct information for decision-taking was the least used. In general, preservation of individuality and respect for the patient's autonomy are the constructs that influenced the most nurses' perception on patients' rights.","2257":"The scarcity of publications about personnel dimensioning in psychiatric nursing motivated the development of an Instrument to Classify the Level of Dependence in Psychiatric Nursing, the initial stage for the establishment of the ideal number of professionals in the nursing crew of the specialty. The purpose of this study was to look for the clinical validation through reliability and construct validity tests, as well as to verify its applicability in the management practice of nurses. Two samples were used, of which n = 40 pairs of instruments filled in Stage 1 of data collection and n = 100 instruments filled in Stage 3 of the study, with different statistical criteria being applied, among them the Kappa coefficient and the Spearman correlation. The Instrument to Classify the Level of Dependence in Psychiatric Nursing was considered reliable, with good indicators of agreement, and the construct was validated, determining the degree of dependence of mental disorder patients.","2258":"This study was aimed at making available the Herth Hope Index adapted and validated into Portuguese in a study carried out with chronic disease patients. The scale is based on the original American instrument, and made possible the existence of an instrument to measure hope, something that did not exist previously in Brazil.

Thirty-eight publications in English and Portuguese were analyzed using the MEDLINE and LILACS databases as well as through research in libraries. There is evidence that the main risk factors are age, pelvic floor trauma, hereditary factors, race, menopausal status, obesity, chronic diseases, use of some sympathomimetics and parasympatholitics, constipation, smoking, coffee consumption and intense abdominal exercises. Nurses are able to identify these factors through anamnesis and determine interventions for the prevention and treatment of UI, thus contributing to improve incontinent women's quality of life.","2263":"The project International Classification of the Nursing Practices in Collective Health-CIPESC was the Brazilian contribution for the incorporation of the notion of collectiveness in the International Classification of Nursing Practice-ICNP.

This is a bibliographical survey of nursing practice classification systems and is part of a larger research that intends to identify the collective face of the CIPESC instrument in the municipal health network of the city of Curitiba, in the State of Parana. The result shows that the majority of the texts are based on the clinical-individual model, and those that emphasize the social-epidemiologic model are still a minority. In addition, most studies focused on the collective were disseminated through the publications of the Brazilian Nursing Association, which has the hegemony in the diffusion of the knowledge about the collective face of classification systems.","2264":"This is a critical-reflective study carried out in 2005 aiming at analyzing dialogue as a presupposition in Peterson and Zderad's Humanistic Theory.

The authors clearly perceive the quest for and the construction of the dialogue in the stages of the theory's methodological process: Preparation in order to get to know, Knowing the other intuitively, Knowing the other scientifically, Complementary synthesis of the others' knowledge, Succession within the nurse from the many to the paradoxical one. The presupposition of dialogue was brought up in an explicit manner in the theory, grounded on the philosophical bases of existentialism, humanism, and phenomenology. There was a distinct behavior in each experience, in spite of the common aspects, such as having been experienced with neonates and in the same institution.","2265":"Any effort to make sense of the complexities of contemporary midwifery must deal not only with biomedical and governmental power structures but also with the definitions such structures impose upon midwives and the ramifications of these definitions within and across national and cultural borders. The international definition of a midwife requires graduations from a government-recognized educational program. Those who have not are not considered midwives but are labeled traditional birth attendants. Since there are myriad local names for midwives in myriad languages, the impact of this naming at local levels can be hard to assess. But on the global scale, the ramifications of the distinction between midwives who meet the international definition and those who do not have been profound. Those who do are incorporated into the health care system. Those who do not remain outside of it, and suffer multiple forms of discrimination as a result.","2266":null,"2267":null,"2268":"Cognitive impairment can negatively impact daily routine. This fact encouraged the elaboration of this study, which analyzed the impact of pain treatment with opioids on attention. Patients were divided into groups that were given (n=14) and were not given opioids (n=12). Three interviews were conducted to assess attention using the Trail Making Test and the Digit Span Test. The groups were homogeneous regarding socio-demographic variables, pain and depression; they were not homogeneous regarding the Karnofsky scale and the use of adjuvant analgesics. The patients in treatment without opioids had better performance in the Digit Span Test-reverse order, in the second assessment (p = 0.29); no differences were observed on the Trail Making Test. The observed impairments were limited, but while new studies do not confirm the findings, patients, professionals and caregivers must be alert about the possible deleterious effects of opioids on the cognitive function.","2269":null,"2270":"This research has the objective of identifying the mental health activities developed at Centers of Psycho-Social Attention (CAPSs) directed to the family in the care of individuals in psychological suffering.

The musicians see their performance as a human experience; they intentionally look for proximity and communication; they recognize the old persons' reality and wish to transform it; they present difficulties in interpersonal communication and in professional development, and adopt musical, personal and intuitive criteria when choosing their repertoire. The results indicate social, human and professional commitment from the musicians analyzed, and may be used as a source for reflection for the health team.","2278":"This study attempts to unveil contradictions in humanized nursing care in ICUs. It is a qualitative, dialectic-based study involving 7 nurses, 4 family members and one patient of the Adult ICU of the Hospital of the Federal Universityof Santa Catarina. Participatory observation and semi-structured interviews were applied to collect the data. Marxist and Gramscian ideas of contradiction were used as the theoretical-philosophical reference. This study demonstrates that humanized care is part of a complex network, in which care knowledge seems to give way to closer network ties, while care practicefollows an impersonalized strategy within the logic of partitioned and routine health care production. The dissociation between knowledge and practice also contemplates the difficulties in dealing with the burdens of suffering and institutional-professional limitations. The conclusion is that knowledge of this reality should be a renewed, yet age-old challenge for the nurse in the search for the constant construction\/ reconstruction of Nursing in terms of practice, knowledge and work relations.","2279":null,"2280":"This study has the objective of understanding the training of nurses for comprehensive health care. It used data from interviews with teachers, students and service nurses submitted to discourse analysis. There is an understanding of comprehensive care in the training of nurses from the perspective of establishing a healthcare model in which care is directed to the patient. There are reflections regarding the technologies and the form of organization of the work, expressed in a permanent tension: Clinical versus Collective Health as a challenge for comprehensive care. It was identified that building completeness in the formation implies assuming acting in health as an educative principle in a new form of learning-teaching in health, which breaks up with pre-formed, out-of-context knowledge. The conclusion is that comprehensive health care is taken as an object of reflection in the movement for change in the pedagogical practices, and that it is reflected in health attention.","2281":"This research was aimed at examining the organization of labor processes in an emergency service as well as the autonomy nursing workers have when providing care. It is a qualitatively-oriented case study. Data were collected by free observation, with focus on the service provided to users. It was observed that the labor process is organized around the treatment of the main complaint, having the doctor's visit as its core action. Technological organization places doctors as the main power holders, followed by nurses in their spaces of powerandautonomy-an autonomy that is seldom exercised by the remaining agents. Nurses' work is crucial, traversing all spaces of service and interlinking actions; however, it is seen as supplementary to primary care activities.","2282":null,"2283":"This study was aimed at finding out how an interdisciplinary team deals with the Elderly Statute and how it interfered in the care of institutionalized elderly. The setting was a geriatric hospital in Sio Paulo where 297 elderly people reside. Thirty-five professionals from the facility's interdisciplinary team took part in the study and answered a questionnaire with open and close questions. Results were divided into categories and submitted to a descriptive analysis. It was observed that 68.6% of the professionals thought that after the enactment of the Statute there have been changes in the care provided, even if slowly, and that they occurred in the interdisciplinary staff, which went after specialization in order to improve care; in the facilities, which adapted so as to attend to the needs of the elders; and in the elderly people themselves and in their families, whom, feeling protected by the law, increased the demands for their rights.","2284":"Care for a dependent elderly individual with a chronic disease can be a threat and cause stress. Success in dealing with this situation will depend on coping strategies, defined as processes used in order to control the demands of the individual-environment relationship. In this study the goal was to detect coping strategies used by caregivers for the elderly. A qualitative study was carried out through the analysis of coping discourse and theoretical reference. The sample was comprised of 16 individuals. It was observed that the coping strategies most used by caregivers were centered on emotion, and that caregiving tasks imply many changes in the life of caregivers, who perform them with no aid, with work overload, loss of liberty, and frustration. The greatest stress is related to the lack of help from family members and of shared responsibilities. Stimulating the involvement of the family, educating and giving basic orientation, which may reduce the difficulties of caregiving, could improve these individuals' well-being.","2285":null,"2286":null,"2287":"This theoretical study focuses on the influence of myths and historical traditions of Nursing in professional practice, and is based on the emancipatory trihedron of care: to know in order to better care, to care in order to confront, to care in order to emancipate. The analysis of nurses' political fragility unveiled conservative and positivist tendencies that have been historically associated with the profession, leading to a theoretical reflection on conservative discourses about Nursing. Through the emancipatory care perspective, the study aims at pointing out possibilities for the reconstruction of historical practices of health care, adding dimension to social practices. Additionally, Nursing should take these myths and rituals as rich contradictions of reality, reflexively demystifying them through the politics of care (mediation between help and power to create autonomy).","2288":"This theoretical-analytical study is aimed at discussing the concepts of teaching competences in Nursing courses in Brazil, with the starting point being the transfer of this concept from the professional practice. Nursing education takes place in a specific environment and puts into effect the pedagogical phenomena among the complex relations that occur between instructor, pupil, patient and family. Therefore, instructors and nurse-educators experience the activities of teaching-learning in Nursing in the processes of educational, caring and management work. For such new conformation of the teaching-learning process it is necessary not only that the new nurses, but the current and future nurse-instructors as well, develop abilities that make possible for them to think and act with ethics and boldness.","2289":"This article presents the notion of the postmodern midwife, defining her as one who takes a relativistic stance toward biomedicine and other knowledge systems, alternative and indigenous, moving fluidly between them to serve the women she attends. She is locally and globally aware, culturally competent, and politically engaged, working with the resources at hand to preserve midwifery in the interests of women. Her informed relativism is most accessible to professional midwives but is also beginning to characterize some savvy traditional midwives in various countries. Thus the concept of the postmodern midwife can serve as a bridge across the ethnic, racial, and status gaps that divide the professional from the traditional midwife, and as an analytical focal point for understanding how the members of each group negotiate their identities and their roles in a changing world.","2290":"This study was aimed at verifying the clarity in the organization of the social systems in the Theory of Goal Attainment. It is a theoretical-reflexive study that uses as referential for analysis a Model of Analysis of Theories. One thesis and two dissertations were analyzed in the months of April, May and June of 2005. Regarding the operational definition of the concepts, all three defined adequately the concepts pointed out in the Conceptual Model, making use of them in the situations of the studies. In what refers to the validity of content and construct there were gaps identified. In one of the studies, for example, the work groups to which the individuals belonged were not consonant with the Theory's social system concept.

Twenty-five multiparous women in a public maternity in Rio de Janeiro who had had low risk, normal labor deliveries were interviewed. The analysis of the reports revealed that immediate care given to babies away from their mother's view generates in mothers concern, a feeling of distance and fear of being separated from the baby. However, some women valued the interventionist assistance because they believe that this care is indispensable to ensure their child's physical integrity. Although they valued closeness to their babies in the immediate post-labor period, the surveyed mothers failed to notice the interference of this initial contact for the establishment of an early bond because of a number of factors, among them social-cultural ones.","2292":null,"2293":null,"2294":null,"2295":"When it comes to dying and death each society has its own culture, habits, beliefs and values, which brings it closer to or draws it apart from others and gives its members guidance as to how they should behave and what they should or should not do in the face of them.

The results show social representations based on the traditional psychiatric paradigm, which considers the mentally ill as a passive person, without the necessary conditions to become the protagonist of his\/her own history. This prejudice is typical of the traditional view. Therefore, the authors suggest that a substantial effort should be made to provide a better professional formation to community agents in the Family Health Program.

The most relevant results indicate that autonomy incorporates aspects professional and patient's that are sustained by their respective categories. About needs we found that tracks biological needs and social needs, which intersect with the psychological to cover biopsychosocial needs. It was found that the application of the concepts was not present in classification systems of nursing. However, they were more related to International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP) and International Classification of Nursing Practice in Collective Heath (ICNPCH) projects.","2324":"This study aims to present the basis to build a re-reading tool of the Health-Disease Process which relies on dialogical relation among social categories and the functional variables found in the a consultation instrument. The tool is an analytical model for decision support that intends the development of data warehousing. Data from the electronic records of nursing consultation were related to the categories: need, social class, gender, race and generation, unveil the social aspects of the health--disease process and assign degrees of vulnerability to homogeneous social groups. Four degrees of vulnerability can be observed that are qualified by eleven markers. The tool lead to the reflection that inequalities are reproduced as time goes by and transforms groups in targets from the social immobility. Although there are some gaps for the visualization of the social categories, the tool enables to visualize the collective face of families and social groups.","2325":"Considering that scientific articles have emphasized the link between the onset of sexual life and peer pressure, the aim of this study was to identify peer pressure in the adolescents' sexual initiation from the point of view of their relationship with the group of friends. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 363 15-19 year-old teens that represented a sample ofthe adolescents enrolled in a family health unit in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. Results showed a relation between sexual initiation and age, being involved in physical experience with someone without wishing, having the majority of friends with sexual experience and dating. Eventually, data show that peers might play some influence on adolescents' option for sexual debut.","2326":null,"2327":"The text approaches the inequalities and the social exclusion in health establishing its social, historical, cultural and economic inter-relations and determinations. It points to the iniquities as consequence of the inequalities in the production and distribution of the wealth expressed by access to services and material goods. It discusses the practices of management, in the field of the health, as supporters of the equity, indicating the shared management as a tool that promotes the values of citizenship and respect to the diversity. It approaches the participation and the social control as practices that promote equity in the health services. It comments the experience of the Department of Social Politics and Health of Belo Horizonte with the work in geopolitical and social territories with practices of management, assistance and social control that contribute for equity. It concludes that, beyond the analyses and macro interventions, it is basic to take the spaces micro of the work for reflection and performance in the construction of equity.","2328":null,"2329":"This paper presents a preliminary overview of policies and practices in health focusing equity.

Such knowledge rarely transfers directly from one country or place to another, but to hear about developments from elsewhere can spark ideas and thinking that may be helpful for local developments. This paper gives some brief background about how the health visiting profession developed in Great Britain, and then explains the values and principles that underpin its practice today. Some parallels are drawn with the health situation in modern Brazil.","2331":"","2332":"This paper describes a teaching experience aimed at providing interactivity to the technique of field diary by using a virtual learning environment. The educational proposal derives from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)'s Teaching Training Program of the Stricto Sensu Post-Graduation Program in Nursing, in which the author, a Master's degree candidate, oriented by her advisor, proposed forming virtual discussion groups in order to write the field diary for an undergraduate discipline in Nursing, with the aim of providing an opportunity for a joint discussion of academic experiences in the realm of practice. The instructors of the discipline in which the proposal was developed also participated in the activities. The virtual technology gave new dynamism to the technique of field diary, making possible an exchange of experiences among the students, the instructor and the author, as well as moments of reflection and discussion regarding the themes faced in the Nursing practice.","2333":"The purpose of this case study was to apply nursing diagnoses and interventions based on the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) Taxonomy of Nursing Diagnoses and the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) on an adolescent with secondary mellitus to cystic fibrosis and on her caretaker in order to provide them full care and guidelines. The nursing interventions were based on the following diagnoses: ineffective confrontation and stress syndrome due to alterations. These references helped us develop effective nursing interventions that provided a framework for individualized care, in addition to promoting a standardized nursing language.","2334":"This is an experience report that has the goal of presenting reflections on the experiences lived with undergraduate Nursing students of the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro. In the day-to-day teaching practice students have to deal with adolescents that are victims of onco-hematogenic disorders. It was observed that for the students it was a challenge to learn how to care for adolescents suffering from cancer, an illness that brings with it important significances in the social imaginary. As a learning strategy was used an activity called workshop of ideas, which made possible for the students to express their feelings, their (pre)conceived ideas and their expectations regarding the care for adolescents with cancer. Results evidenced a unique moment of reflection\/sensibilization that leads to a preparation and to recognition of the peculiarities of this group of patients, and to an attitude that brings them closer to caring within the hospital space.","2335":"This study is about interdisciplinarity as a phenomenon and as an emerging subject in Science, which has been divided into many knowledge and professional formation specialties or disciplines, mainly in the health and nursing areas. The approach is of a critical and philosophical nature and the main intention is to point out difficulties and problems with the aim of encouraging and further advancing the discussion. General, more current concepts are presented along with epistemological ideas subjacent to the repercussions of teamwork and transcendent to the conscience beyond the subject's philosophy.

It is a research of qualitative nature, for which the data was gathered using the technique of focal group in six sessions recorded in audio and video. Nine nurses of a school hospital took part in it. For the analysis of the data was used the technique of collective subject speech, which consists of the organization and computation of the qualitative data of oral nature recorded, from which resulted a single speech. The research showed that the nurses differentiated the terms permanent education, continuous education and in service education, building their own concepts, highlighting the importance of differentiation in order to define the kind of approach to be taken to address the educative need presented.","2339":"This study uses a comparative approach, as well as two already concluded ethnographies, to achieve its objective of identifying how families perceive their insertion into the overnight stay unit in a hospital and how they are perceived by the health care team, considering the rules and regulations of the institutional culture. The results obtained show that teams and families get closer or more distant depending on whether there's agreement or disagreement regarding the hospital's governing rules. Although families, in many situations, subject themselves to the regulations imposed by the hospital and the health care team, they also use individual and collective resistances in order to confront the regulatory mechanisms. The results contribute to increase the comprehension of this theme, both for the health care team and for the practice of family nursing, especially in the sense of recognizing the family as an active, responsible, and co-participatory unit within intra-hospital care.","2340":"The purpose of this descriptive, exploratory study was to analyze, with focus on the referential of the communicative action paradigm, what were listed as ease and difficulties by fifteen students of specialization courses in Nursing concerning the teaching process of the discipline of Scientific Investigation Methods. The categories expressed as ease and difficulties regarding the discipline's content, the elaboration of the research project and its development were analyzed in accordance with the standardized types of communicative action. After the analysis there could be noticed an emergence of elements at different development levels interpreted in a sequence of communication forms that show no commitment with innovation or change of the teaching process, demonstrating the disturbances of the consensus in this process.","2341":"This survey was aimed at analyzing health professionals' concepts concerning male participation in the different aspects of the reproductive process. The data were collected in a philan-thropic hospital in the outskirts of Belo Horizonte, in the State of Minas Gerais, by means of a workshop whose theme was: \"Men's place in the reproductive health service\". The data obtained are part of the results of this study. It was possible to observe that men go with their partners and children to many of the service's sectors, but are absent in situations like postabortion and child donation for adoption. One of the main obstacles for full assistance has been the precarious physical and material infrastructure of the services.","2342":"This social-historical study analyzes the proximity between the nurses at the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB, in the Portuguese-language acronym) and the authorities in charge of the U.S. the Brazilian Armies in World War II. Primary sources: two photographs that complement each other and reports from nine nurses who participated in the conflict. Secondary sources: literature on the subject. Some of Pierre Bourdieu's concepts were used to give support to the discussion. in the military milieu the nurses received a special treatment from the commanders of the U.S. and the Brazilian Armies, and had more visibility to the Brazilian nurses amongst soldiers and in the media. The nurses won a battle by being respected in a new and unknown world, within the universe of the Armed Forces, which is historically dominated by men. Working as part of a team, those nurses struggled for self-affirmation and respect in that peculiar historical moment.

For data analysis, the Collective Subject Discourse was constructed. Of the 27 women that were interviewed, 18 had finished elementary education, 8 had completed secondary education, and one had college level education; 14 had a stable union and 6 were married. Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) starting to smoke: a natural, social practice; (2) satisfaction versus guilt; (3) shattering news: effects of smoking on pregnancy; and (4) quitting: between will and ability. Pregnant women revealed negative ideas about smoking, considering smoking the worst of addictions and a potential cause for complications to the fetus and the mother. Smoking was represented in a prejudicial manner, disregarding the existence of treatment and the need for it. Emerging difficulties were related to quitting, for which professionals, information and adequate approaches for treatment and support for achieving success are utmost necessities.","2345":"This qualitative research was aimed at investigating the representations and significations that a group of community health agents (CHAs) has concerning the vulnerabilities for suffering in their work to which they are exposed to, as well as the manifestations of this suffering as they perform their actions in the Family Health Program (PSF, in the Portuguese language acronym). The semistructured interview with the group of agents explored the meaning of being a CHA and their perception of their work organization; the analysis was based on the hermeneutics theoretical-methodology referential and on the theories related to labor psychodynamics. The findings show the existence of considerable suffering vulnerability, generated by an idealized ideation of the practice and by the scarce perspective for rearranging the constitutive ingredients of work organization, since these professionals depend on factors that are beyond their grasp, which include the limitations of the assistential model proposed by the PSF.","2346":"The current study has the purpose of verifying if nurses are able to identify situations in which the nonverbal aspects of interpersonal communication between health professionals and patients constitute an iatrogenic factor. The data were collected through semistructured interviews with eight nurses and were analyzed according to the content analysis methodology. Three categories appeared from the professional discourses, and these categories make evident the perception of iatrogenesis, its consequences and characteristics and the interrelation between nonverbal language and nursing care.","2347":null,"2348":"The objectives of this research were to recognize, interpret and discuss themes that arise out of the speeches of instructors of an undergraduate course of Nursing as guiding sources to a humanized teaching-learning experience in the light of Edgard Morin's Theory of Complexity. It is a qualitative, exploratory and analytic research. The study tried to verify principles of the paradigm of complexity through content analysis, theme modality, in the speeches of 11 instructors, obtained in 2004. The themes that were found were: teaching the instructor's responsibility; combining knowledge: connections and interrelations to face reality; teaching human complexity; stimulating creativity and curiosity; facing uncertainty: building life's continuous, dynamic knowledge; experiencing the teaching-learning process through transdisciplinarity; and teaching citizenship. This study shows that it is possible to have a university education based on the human condition, solidarity and knowledge interconnection.","2349":null,"2350":null,"2351":null,"2352":"The adequate sizing of the nursing staff in intensive care units has been one of the main concerns for the nurses that work in them, in spite of different classification models for patients that have been proposed at the domestic and international levels. In the present case study, the goals were to establish the average time spent in direct nursing assistance in an ICU and to calculate the average number of hours of direct nursing assistance delivered to its patients. In order to do that, the first step was to classify the nursing procedures carried out with ICU patients according to their complexity: low, medium and high. Next, the average time spent in theses procedures was counted during a three-month period, in order to find out the average time of direct nursing assistance delivered to patients.","2353":"The existence of a specific language for the profession is essential, and the International Nursing Practice Classification in Collective Health (CIPESC, in the Portuguese-language acronym) has as one of its goals the classification of the work of nurses in collective health. In Brazil, the Brazilian Nursing Association (ABEn, in the Portuguese-language acronym), responsible for the classification, found in the Municipal Secretary of Health of Curitiba, in the State of Parand, an ally for its effective implantation. The purpose of this article was to validate the nomenclature of the 52 diagnoses of prenatal Nursing CIPESC base--in Curitiba. It is an exploratory-descriptive study developed with assisting nurses and experts in the area of gynecology obstetrics and terminology. The results were presented through the Consonance Index through absolute frequency. All the definitions were validated, but they need to be adjusted to the daily language. The nurses show difficulty in interpret nursing intervention in the promotion of well-being, and it is urgent to discuss the concept of health promotion and the health-illness process in collective health.","2354":"In this paper, which uses a qualitative approach, we try to understand the conception undergraduate Nursing students at the Federal University of Santa Catarina have regarding worker's health. Three questions were asked to twenty students: What does he\/she understand as worker's health? How can Nursing help to improve worker's health? Which is the relation between work and lifestyle? The results were grouped in the following themes: conceptions of worker's health; the role of Nursing in the context of worker's health; and relation between work and lifestyle. We highlighted the interrelation between work and lifestyle, and between work and worker's health. Our reflections reinforce the need to discuss these themes in the universities so that students are stimulated to think about their own health since the beginning of their academic life. That way, we believe that they will be able to incorporate protective actions to their own health in their daily's work.","2355":null,"2356":"","2357":"The growing number of the elders has been increasing the need for the use of functional evaluation instruments. But such use should be done in such a way as to allow comparisons among the various studies and the different realities. Among those instruments, the Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL), developed by Sidney Katz, is one of the oldest and one of the most frequently mentioned in Brazilian and international literature. Different articles have been showing, however, modified versions of that instrument, thus making it difficult for readers to correctly use it. This paper has the objective of making a historical account of the development, evolution and correct use of Sidney Katz's Index of Independency in the Daily Living, as well as the changes and adaptations it has gone through time, with the author's agreement, so as to contribute for the standardization of the research information related to functional evaluation in gerontology.","2358":"Identifying feelings and experiences related to breast cancer becomes important to enable those who are part of a woman's social circle to grasp this stage of her life. For this study, a literature review was carried out in order to identify what are the most common thoughts and feelings women experience after a breast cancer diagnosis. The review was conducted through bibliographical research in LILACS and MEDLINE databases using the key words breast, cancer, feeling, female, and representation. Contents related to cancer were searched, such as the meaning of the disease and its implication to the woman's emotional and social life. The conclusion was that experiences related to breast cancer have an individual scope, and that their representations are different for each woman.","2359":null,"2360":null,"2361":null,"2362":"This study investigates the relation between female nurses and osteomuscular disturbances associated with their work. It is clear from the study that Nursing professionals are exposed to a number of unfavorable conditions in their working environment. Predominant complaints are related to the osteomuscular system, which affects mostly females due not only to the biological characteristics of women, but also because of the uneven distribution of work between genders that prevails nowadays.","2363":"Analyzing the politics of professional education and questioning the changes that have been introduced in the Brazilian high school system are the main objectives of this study. In general, the approved legislation expresses the interests of the neo-liberal policies, of multilateral organisms, and of the implications of the worldwide productive reorganization and of the reduction of State participation in social policies. It also mirrors the manner in which Brazil inserts itself in the globalization process, in a dependent role, more as a knowledge consumer than a producer of it, thus missing the opportunity for achieving its autonomy, including in the area of professional formation. Based on the possibilities that these laws offer for curricular organization, this article defends that professional teaching in Nursing should take up a technical perspective integrated to a general education and be provided in a single space, thus reducing the risk of a minimalist, superficial training.","2364":null,"2365":"This study identifies productivity indicators at a Sterilization Central Supply (CME) through documents, observation and time counting of the process for two items selected from the sample: a bandage pack and a herniorrhaphy box. The monthly average production was 30,466.42 items, and the production capacity per hour was 10.3 items per employee. The bandage pack averaged 295 minutes from the expurgation area to storage; the manual process lasted 46 minutes and the automated 88 minutes. For the herniorrhaphy box the average was 329 minutes; the manual process lasted 60 minutes and automated 98 minutes. In the bandage kit, the manual process used up 59.23% of the productivity hours in the expurgation area, 3.28% in the preparation, 10.94% in the sterilization process, and 26.31% in storage and distribution. Figures for the manual process of herniorrhaphy box were: expurgation, 11.84%; preparation, 16.20%; storage and distribution, 7.47%; and sterilization, 1.89%.

It is a prospective study carried out at a university hospital between August of 2001 and March of 2002. Of 357 patients submitted to SDS, 64 SSI cases were notified--16 in the hospital and 48 after discharge, incidences of 4.5% and 13.9% respectively. It was verified an association of SSI with the preoperative stay in hospital and with the classification of the surgical wound. The global incidence of SSI was 18.0%, and there was a four-fold increase when the post-discharge surveillance was carried out. In consequence, it can be concluded that if the post-discharge surveillance is not conducted the global SSI incidence would be strongly undernotified.","2367":null,"2368":null,"2369":null,"2370":"This study, conceived in order to try to understand the situations that motivate families to place elderly relatives in nursing homes, used a methodological qualitative approach.

Living through the process of placing an elder relative in a nursing home constituted a transition period in which different factors were taken into account and contributed for the decision. When this decision is taken, the family looks for the best place in terms of physical structure, care and social living, with equals and with other people, because it is believed that through visits family and affective bonds can be kept.","2371":null,"2372":"This study has as its objective to explain the assistance to the school age child's health under the light of historic and dialectic materialism, including gender for the social approach.

The data analysis, according to the feminist theory, shows that the idea of gender inferiority is the origin of the biased conceptions regarding the mothers of the studied children. Such prejudices were observed in the three locations studied (heath service, school and family).","2373":null,"2374":"The aim of this study was to identify hypertension associated factors (AF) and verify blood pressure (BP) levels among adolescent workers. Interviews were conducted with 193 working adolescents--135 men and 58 women between 16 and 18 years. After five minutes in seated position, their arm circumferences were measured and their BP was determined using correct (CCW) and standard (SCW) cuff widths. The values were related to AF. BP was, in average, 105.2\/60.9 mmHg (CCW) and 101.0\/57.9 (SCW- p &lt; 0.05). Among the AF found, only skin color and alcoholic drinking were associated to BP elevation, also noted in male adolescents. When using CCW, more hypertensive and borderline adolescents were found than using SCW. All of them had at least one AF. It can be concluded that there are several hypertension AF among this population, and some of them are already causing BP elevation. Studies such as this should be made frequently because adolescent blood pressure levels can predict hypertension in adulthood.","2375":null,"2376":"The main objective of this investigation was to identify and compare preventive knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding AIDS between adolescents at the secondary school in urban and non-urban areas in Portugal.

However, these spouses frequently have health complaints themselves. To understand the meaning of health for elderly spouses who are caregivers, to know the changes in their health after taking this role and to learn how they take care of their own health, the authors developed an exploratory qualitative study in which elderly spouses caregivers were personally interviewed. The speeches were analyzed according to the Discourse Analysis on Collective Subject. The result is that they understood health as having energy, showing no symptoms, needing no doctor, depending on no one and requiring no care. They took care of their own health through diet control, respect to routines and personal habits, performance of their daily activities, physical activities and medical control. The changes noticed after becoming caregivers were tiredness, stress, preoccupation, development of symptoms and illnesses, increase of health risks and changes in routine and in self-esteem.","2413":null,"2414":null,"2415":"This article discusses one of the emergent themes of a qualitative research carried out with female adolescents in the neighborhood of Acaba Mundo, in the city of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, and aims at understanding their social representations on sexual initiation concerning gender. The data was collected in four workshops and analyzed on the basis of the social representation theory by means of the discourse analysis technique. Two empirical categories and their consequences emerged from the discourse: leaving childhood behind and fear of pregnancy. The understanding of the social representations and of the gender relationships made the values, ideas and practices of the adolescents and their family clear. It also made clear that those values, ideas and practices were in frequent transformation in the social field.","2416":"This study is part of a larger survey called \"Use of indicators in nurses' managerial practice in Basic Health Care Units in the city of Rio de Janeiro\", which was carried out in the Basic Health Care Units of the Planning Area 5.3 and whose objectives were to identify nurses' conception regarding the tools required for management in those units and to discuss the role of management in organizing health services. The study is descriptive and data were collected in interviews with seven nurse managers.

Answered the questionnairel02 students from Salvador, State of Bahia, of which 11 were smokers. Their mean age and the age in which they first smoked were 18.2 and 13.4 years respectively. Most of them were male, in the first year of senior high school, of brown skin color and had close relatives who smoke. The majority of those young smokers had been advised about the risks of smoking at home and in school, but few had knowledge about the benefits of quitting. Almost half of them had been smoking for more than three years and had started to smoke out of curiosity. More than half of them smoked one cigarette per day, with low levels of nicotine, bought the cigarettes in shops, and wanted and tried to quit smoking, but never succeeded. The degree of dependence was low for most of them. This study offers hints for nurses to act against smoking with young adults.","2418":"This paper is aimed at discoursing on the regulation of labor relations in Nursing and at giving subsidies to the nurse's managerial practice concerning the rights and obligations of employees and employers based on the Brazilian Labor Law and the Federal Constitution. It emphasizes some regulations that are not clear enough and give rise to doubts and conflicts on the nurse's daily professional activities, such as working hours, resting periods in and between journeys, extra pay for overtime work, weekly paid rest and changes in work schedule. The adequacy of nursing practice to legal rules should allow nurses to get more knowledge, resulting in more confidence and safer actions. By having professional and patient's rights respected, occasional juridical problems inherent to labor rights and obligations will be reduced.","2419":"In this study, the author aimed at characterizing Nursing Consultation attendances according to pre-surgical patients of the Coronary Program, estimating the nurse's average time and work mean cost in performing it, and studying the existence of association\/correlation between time, cost and other variables of interest.

Their work is characterized by indirect care, and is instrumental not only for nurses' work, but for the work of other professionals as well. As a result, it not identified as specific nursing care, nor as care provided by the nurse. Its transforming potential upon relations and new production modes of care in health, and by the nurse, will occur first through his\/her competence in the specific knowledge about CSUs than through his\/her administrative skills.","2422":null,"2423":"The objective of this study was to identify and compare the trace and the anxiety state on the 10th day postpartum and the anxiety state on the 30th day postpartum of primiparous and multiparous nursing mothers who present insufficient breast feeding indicators and nursing mothers with normal breast feeding, in order to verify the possible relationships between the anxiety state of the nursing mothers in those two moments with the insufficient breast feeding indicators presented. This is an exploratory and descriptive study, whose data has been gotten from 168 nursing mothers and their children by means of interviews in nursing consultations in the 10th and 30th day postpartum. The results obtained showed that primiparous and multiparous with insufficient breast feeding and primiparous with normal lactation presented higher anxiety state trace than the anxiety state on the 10th and 30th day postpartum. There was remission of the maternal signals of anxiety with the passing of time, which may be caused by the correction of the breast feeding technique and support to the nursing mothers.","2424":"Many studies have been undertaken with the purpose of contributing towards the prevention of perineal trauma in normal birth. The objective of this study was to relate height of the perineum, duration of the second stage of labor, variation of the position of the head detaching, kind of effort, presence of the umbilical cord around the babies' neck, birth weight and vulva's ardor to urinate with the occurrence of perineal laceration.

It can be concluded that obstetric consultation can substantially help reduce morbi-mortality of pregnant women, since it makes possible the guiding of intercurrences and the prevention of troubles during and after the period of pregnancy.","2426":"This article is based on a survey aimed at validating the theoretical model \"Trying to preserve the integrity of the family unit\" by applying it to the situation of families living through the experience of having a child undergoing heart surgery. Data was collected through interviews with six family members who had gone through that experience. The questions were laid out according to the model, focusing on the family experience during the time of heart surgery. The data was analyzed according to the Grounded Theory. Results showed that it is possible to validate the theoretical model for the experience of families who had a child undergoing heart surgery through the comparative analysis of the results of both studies. Because of the specific nature of the experience, two new themes emerged: living a lonely experience and overcoming a phase, thus widening the original theoretical model.","2427":"This study validated the Survey of Pain Attitudes--brief version (SOPA) for the Portuguese language. Sixty-nine Brazilian patients were evaluated. Patients were female (71%), the mean age was 50.8 years (+\/-15.4), the mean schooling was 7.4 years (+\/-4.8), and the most frequent pain etiologies were: musculoskeletal (39.1%), cancer-related (34.8%), and neuropathic (20.3%). Factorial analysis produced seven domains (Control, Harm, Disability, Medical Cure, Emotion, Medication, Solicitude), as in the original instrument. Indices of reliability tests (mu Chronbach) ranged from .55 to .89, values that are accepted as moderate and good. The Portuguese language version showed conceptual equivalence to the English language version. The availability of SOPA-brief version in Portuguese may contribute for the improvement of research and clinical practices on chronic pain.","2428":"This study is aimed at investigating the nursing diagnoses of family members of burn victims. Seventeen family members were evaluated through observation and interviews. Nursing diagnoses were established on the basis of NANDA Taxonomy II. Eighteen different nursing diagnoses were identified.

Intervening in the first episode offers a unique opportunity in the treatment of schizophrenia and influences the course of the illness. This article consists of a critical literature review aimed at examining knowledge on first episode schizophrenia and discussing the contribution of nursing care. A research was carried out in bibliographical databases. The data collected made possible the organization of information on the general concept of schizophrenia, its first episode, types of intervention and nursing performance. We found out that in Brazil there are few studies related to first episode schizophrenia in Nursing, few available specialized services, and few social resources. This situation reveals the need for more studies on first episode schizophrenia.","2439":"In this paper we present a report of a clinical situation in which we identified the vulnerability of the family, propitiating to pediatric nurses the use of this concept in their practice and intervention with families. The study was carried out with a family that was going through a situation of a child illness and hospitalization. The vulnerability was identified in the interactions of family members with the illness, with other family members and with the health staff, and served as a guide for planning the nursing assistance. The interventions led to the strengthening of the family to face the situation and, for pediatric nurses, the recognition of the importance of using the results of theoretical research in their professional practice.","2440":null,"2441":null,"2442":"Home care is a rapidly expanding segment in Brazil.

We chose to make a qualitative survey in a phenomenological approach, based on the following directive question: \"I'd like you to tell me your experience: 'How is it to be a woman with gynecological cancer?\" ' Six women were interviewed. The ontological unification which emerged from the speeches were analyzed and interpreted according to Martin Heidegger's philosophical referential. These unifications made possible to see ways to care for these women that go far beyond technical and scientific knowledge. It is necessary to understand what has been lived by the other, thus ensuring a quality of care that contemplates subjectivity and inter-subjectivity.","2444":null,"2445":"The frequent reuse of disposable forceps instruments is justified by their high cost. However, few studies have been carried out on this topic. The objective of this study was to develop a methodological proposal for calculating the reprocessing costs for these instruments used in video-assisted surgery. A flowchart was developed for each phase of the reprocessing. This allowed subsequent identification of the cost components in terms of labor, materials and indirect expenses. From these data, a methodological proposal for cost calculation could be created, based on the Full Absorption Costing Method, including the spreadsheet for data collection.","2446":"The present study had the objectives of identifying the characteristics of gerontogeriatric nursing and of reflecting on this teaching, based on identified characteristics, in the light of Complexity. A qualitative research, its data sources were nine proceedings volumes of Brazilian Nursing congresses and seven Brazilian nursing publications of the 1991-2000 period. The main body of this article was comprised of 16 scientific articles; QRSNUD* IST4 was used for analysis. Results showed that this teaching does take place, and it is carried out through: mandatory disciplines in the curriculum; practical activities; activities during curricular training; extra-curricular activities; participation on specific or general Nursing events in which studies are presented; other activities. To use the principles of Complexity is tantamount to perceiving educative teaching as trying to convey a culture that will enable future workers to understand the human condition and to think in a contextualized, open, globalized, ethical way.","2447":"The humanization of the hospital environment cannot be achieved if the focus is directed only to external motivational factors or just to the user. A humanization program needs to be assumed as a participative construction process that demands respect and valuing of the human being that provides care. Based on human and ethics values and principles and on Freire's ideas, this study aims to describe how a humanization process was unchained in a hospital, initially centering on the worker, through the collective discussion of concrete problems and the construction of horizontal, reflective dialogical relations. The proposal made possible a better comprehension of the meaning of humanization, with the rescue of previous initiatives of humanization, the elaboration of a databank in which there is room for subjectivity, the creation of warm collective areas and a closer relationship between directors and workers.","2448":"This analytical and descriptive study is aimed at detecting concepts that translate myths and truths on hospital infection among nursing auxiliaries and technicians at the surgical centers of three hospitals. The data collection instrument consisted of 28 affirmative statements (15 true and 13 false) encompassing factors related to the patient, the surgical team, the environment, and procedures. The statements contain a three-point scale (I agree, I am in doubt, I disagree).

Available leisure activities were television and magazines. Most participants (99%) said they participate in leisure activities such as family\/ friends conversations and visits. Involvement in leisure activities decreases with associated diseases and increases with hospitalization time. Leisure was motivated by the elderly's personal characteristics, the reduction of the hospitalization's negative effects, and the benefits it brings to the health. Its limitation was associated to intrinsic aspects of the elderly and to the institutional context.","2452":"The aim of this study was to understand the meanings of the experience of pain suffered by women during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to identify their immediate actions in face of pain. This qualitative research used the Symbolic Interactionism theory and the Grounded Theory methodology. Forty-three women were interviewed at the University Hospital. The central category expressing the pain experience was that it was \"a break with day-to-day life\". The categories that expressed such break revealed that in face of increasing pain those women felt dominated and afraid of dying because they had lost control over their bodies and their lives. They did not recognize the occurrence of AMI and at first resisted to look for assistance by attempting to alleviate the pain. In face of the unbearable pain and their impotence to control it, they asked for God's salvation and help from surrounding people and finally resorted to medical assistance.","2453":"This is a descriptive exploratory study aimed at evaluating directed study as a teaching strategy used in professional education.

Both refer to the principle of Justice, the ethical pillar of Equality. From them is developed a gender analysis of the women's health situation and how much it reflects the iniquities that result from the conditions of social inequality to which they are subjected. The conclusion is that the adoption of gender equality as an ethical concept associated with the principles of social justice and human rights means to look over the daily life of thousands of women, to be indignant with the suffering and to bring about transformation, without mixing the right for dignified and respectable assistance because they are being, before anything, citizens, with the need to be healthy and productive, for being generators and maintainers of the present and future work force, of whom society depends for generating social wealth.","2490":"This study is aimed at contributing to the transformation movement to be developed in the Nursing Courses\/Schools.

For data collection a structured interview prior to the gynecologic consultation was used, with an intentional sample of 120 women. The results show that the surveyed women are aware of the importance of the test, that most of them undertake it annually and that they generally have satisfactory knowledge as for the care they must take prior to undertaking it. Embarrassment and fear of the results are the main causes associated with the refusal to undertake the test. It can be concluded that the educative projects are to be focused on the importance, the frequency and the care that must be taken prior to the test, as well as on the professional-client interaction during the gynecologic consultation, with the aim of reducing women's embarrassment and fear.","2510":null,"2511":"This study was aimed at analyzing the medication systems in hospitals based on the opinions of 107 professionals.

Grounded Theory methodology was used to guide data collection and analysis. Data collection strategies were: narrative interviews conducted with 5 nurses and 10 patients and relatives; a focus group with the nurses; 10 admission interviews carried out by the nurses; and a 60-day observation period. The findings describe the middle range theory that was built, whose nature is comprised of two components: \"Process of diagnostic evaluation\" - collection of new data, reevaluation of the process and monitoring of caring procedures-; and \"Process of nursing therapeutic intervention\"- the simultaneous management of feelings and information. In the theory that was developed, the component of the relational di-mension of the experience con-sists of a 3-phase sequential process: beginning, body and end of the relationship.","2517":"This study discusses the human being-machine relationship in the process called \"cyborgzation\" of the nurse who works in intensive care, based on post-structuralist Cultural Studies and highlighting Haraway's concept of cyborg. In it, manuals used by nurses in Intensive Care Units have been examined as cultural texts. This cultural analysis tries to decode the various senses of \"human\" and \"machine\", with the aim of recognizing processes that turn nurses into cyborgs. The argument is that intensive care nurses fall into a process of \"technology embodiment\" that turns the body-professional into a hybrid that makes possible to disqualify, at the same time, notions such as machine and body \"proper\", since it is the hybridization between one and the other that counts there. Like cyborgs, intensive care nurses learn to \"be with\" the machine, and this connection limits the specificity of their actions. It is suggested that processes of \"cyborgzation\" such as this are useful for questioning - and to deal with in different ways - the senses of \"human\" and \"humanity\" that support a major part of knowledge\/action in health.","2518":"The use of theories in Nursing reflects a movement in the profession towards the autonomy and delimitation of its actions. It is, therefore, extremely relevant that theories may be analyzed as for their applicability to practice. The object of this study is to make an analytical-descriptive study of Peplau's Theory of Interpersonal Relations in Nursing from the model of analysis proposed by Barbara Barnum. Among the structural components that may be analyzed in a theory was chosen the element \"process\", a method recommended for the development of nursing' actions, which was submitted to Barnum's criteria of usefulness. The assessment showed that Peplau's theoretical presuppositions are operational and may serve as a basis in any situation in which nurses communicate and interact with his\/her patients.","2519":"A case study aimed at knowing the perception of a teenager suffering from recurrent acute lymphocytic leukemia and of her mother regarding the visit of her pet dog during hospitalization, as well as at describing the experience as a nursing intervention.

This was a time of radical ideological transformation as a result of industrialization and urbanization in North America, which changed the role of women and that of the family. In Brazil the discussion of fertility regulation started in the early 1960s, when the Kennedy administration conditioned its economic assistance to Latin America on the adoption of population control programs, which was not well-received in these Catholic countries. The neo-Malthusian population concept originated in the international agencies, who saw fertility control as a solution to global economic problems. It also found acceptance among elite conservatives in Brazil because of the fear that the growth of poor people could subvert the prevailing social order. Since national interest arguments did not work in Brazil, the programs invoked arguments such as how high parity and high-risk pregnancies would affect the health of the mother; the disproportion between the number of children and family income of the poor; and the control of induced abortion. The economic development in Brazil in the 1950s was the basis of accepting neo-Malthusian reasoning. The debate about these programs involved the whole society. The Catholic Church, however, was the major opponent of a government-supported fertility control program. The capitalist state has assigned to women the role of reproducer and primary socializer of children, regarding motherhood as their principal role, and the control of access to contraceptives meant the continued subordinated of women in capitalist and patriarchal societies.

Periodic abstinence includes the rhythm or calendar method (25-30 pregnancies per 100 women) and the basal temperature method (7-15 pregnancies).  No medicine or device is needed, they are approved by the Catholic Church, but they require instruction for correct practice, and the rigorous observation of 6 menstrual cycles.  The index of failure of the ovulation method is 5-10 pregnancies, and it requires the observation of the cervical mucus of 6 cycles, just like the more effective (4 pregnancies) sympto-thermic method.  The failure rate of the contraceptive pill is 0.5-0.8 pregnancies, but even serious side effects (thromboembolitic diseases) can occur.  The intrauterine device is fairly effective (2-3 pregnancies), but its fitting requires medical assistance.  Female and male sterilization are also effective (0.1 and 0.9 pregnancies, respectively).  Other methods in decreasing order of effectiveness are:  diaphragm (2-10 pregnancies), spermicides (5-35 pregnancies), condom (7 to 13-15 pregnancies), vaginal sponge (9-27 pregnancies), and coitus interruptus (20-40 pregnancies).","3257":"","3258":"","3259":"","3260":null,"3261":"In their practice the authors observed a lack of research results in psychiatric nursing, brought to the nurses assistence activities.

The method is based on the observation of the cyclic changes of cervical mucus.  During the first phase of the cycle, or proliferative phase, the increased estrogen secretion produces abundant, wet, elastic mucus, of a quality very conducive to sperm transport; the peak of the mucus symptom coincides with ovulation or precedes it about 1 day.  Couples must refrain from intercouse during this period.  The second phase of the cycle, or secretory phase, is characterized by increased progesterone secretion which inhibits production of cervical mucus; these are the infertile days of the cycle; mucus will be scant, and dry.  This method, which implies periodic sexual abstinence, can by very advantageously used to prevent or to obtain pregnancy.  A couple wanting to use this method will have to carefully chart the daily appearance in quantity and quality of cervical mucus, and will have to be instructed on how to do so.
