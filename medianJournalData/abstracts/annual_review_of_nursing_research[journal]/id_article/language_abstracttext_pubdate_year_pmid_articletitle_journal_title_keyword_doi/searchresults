three-dimensional (3D) printing is often touted as cutting-edge technology, it actually made its appearance in the 1980s. Since then, this technology has made significant progress from its humble origins of layering polymers to create simple structures to the more sophisticated printing with elements such as metals used to create complex structures for aircraft. This technology has advanced and been finely tuned largely in thanks to the engineering profession. The variance within the printers, software, and printing material allows for broad application beyond engineering and manufacturing. Healthcare and academic applications are beginning to get traction. The National Institutes of Health has established a platform for sharing 3D ideas to support biotechnology and modeling for healthcare. It makes sense that nursing programs would, minimally, utilize 3D printers to enrich their institutional simulation laboratory and to manufacture specialty materials for training students in a cost-efficient manner. Opportunities to collaborate with other academic departments and community partners in the development and production of timely and effective solutions to pressing healthcare needs enriches student learning, nursing programs, and their graduates. Faculty buy-in and purposeful integration throughout the curriculum are vital variables associated with the successful implementation of 3D printing in a nursing program. Additional benefits include opportunities for publications, presentation of papers, and interprofessional collaboration.","1":"The use of simulation in nursing education is an integrated part of the curriculum and has demonstrated the benefit for learning in nursing students at all levels. The next stage in simulation-based learning will utilize the wide variety of new technologies that are currently available, including virtual and augmented reality. The use of these new technologies brings with it a need for standard definitions, evaluation of its impact on learning, and new opportunities for research. Efforts are underway to standardized definitions and publish early findings on research using these new technologies. There are many opportunities available for nursing educators to create a new era of simulation-based learning methodologies by incorporating virtual and augmented realities in their curriculum. The state of the science is showing promising outcomes and commercial products are maturing.The utilization of these new technologies should be approached in the same way as other learning methodologies as many new ideas and ways of learning are emerging in this area. It will be critical for nursing educators and faculty to determine the optimal ways to utilize them.","2":"Professional development in simulation methodologies is essential for implementation of quality, consistent, simulation-based experiences. Evidence demonstrates that participation in comprehensive training positively impacts learner outcomes. There are many benefits to professional development, however, challenges exist requiring thoughtful planning, administrative buy-in, and fiscal support. While there are no established guidelines, the literature provides an ongoing consensus related to overall concepts and strategies for training in simulation. We describe a continuum of growth for simulationists, ranging from novice\/advanced beginner, competent\/proficient, to expert. As a novice, one must conduct a self-assessment of current strengths and create a development plan to advance simulation skills and knowledge. A simulationist should use evidenced-base guidelines, mentorship, and feedback to inform simulation practices. They should be knowledgeable of the standards of best practice, modalities, simulation design, learning theories, and professional integrity. Simulationists must seek ongoing advancement through certification, scholarship, and lifelong learning. This chapter describes the continuum of education and methodologies for the development of simulationists.","3":"Simulation pedagogy and the operations of simulation-based experiences have become an integral part of healthcare education. Academic and healthcare institutions constructed simulation centers or dedicated simulation spaces to provide simulation-based experiences for multiple health professions. Architectural designs resemble acute care settings that have the flexibility to change or include virtual reality and enhanced technology. Professional organizations have standards of best practice, credentialing requirements, and accreditation standards that support the need for high-quality, high-fidelity simulation experiences. Within healthcare education, simulation operation has become a specialty in itself that requires knowledge and experience of healthcare, education, and simulation pedagogy (INACSL Standards Committee, 2017). Simulation center administration needs an understanding of personnel management, including standardized patients (SPs), staff, faculty, and learners, as well as knowledge of budgeting, revenue streams, and technology. Personnel with unique skills and knowledge in engineering, healthcare, or information technology are required to support the simulation activities. Resources that manage inventory, supplies, equipment assets, and audiovisual requirements will increase efficiency and enhance fiscal responsibility. Technology assets such as high-fidelity human patient simulators can be used to enhance high-quality simulation, while audiovisual and data capturing software can be used for assessment, evaluation, and quality improvement. Simulation operations provides the infrastructure that supports the daily activities of simulation-based education.","4":"Simulation has been used in nursing education and training since Florence Nightingale's era. Over the past 20 years, simulation learning experiences (SLEs) have been used with increasing frequently to educate healthcare professionals, develop and increase the expertise of practicing professionals, and gain competency in key interprofessional skills. This chapter provides a brief overview of simulation evaluation history, beginning in the late 1990s, and the initial focus on learner self-report data. Using Kirkpatrick's Levels of Evaluation as an organizing model, four types of SLE evaluation are reviewed as well as suggestions for future research.","5":"Ongoing shifts in the healthcare system require practitioners who possess metacognitive skills to evaluate their decisions and the thinking and rationale guiding those decisions. In an effort to design learning activities that support metacognition in nursing education, undergraduate and graduate faculty, are embracing simulation-based education (SBE) as an effective teaching and learning strategy. SBE includes prebriefing, the simulation scenario, and debriefing, all of which are supported by psychological safety. Prebriefing precedes the entire learning process and is integral to engagement in the simulation and to the effectiveness of the debriefing. Debriefing provides educators with the opportunity to explore and develop those metacognitive skills with learners. In this chapter on evidence-based debriefing, the authors will explore the evidence and theories surrounding best practices in SBE, specifically the prebriefing and debriefing components of the learning experience. The chapter explores the theoretical foundation of SBE and theory-based debriefing; educational best practices of prebriefing as an integral part of an effective debriefing; theory-based debriefing models; research evidence of debriefing outcomes; evaluation of the prebriefing and debriefing process; and finally, provides recommendations on the priorities for further research in debriefing. Within this chapter, the term educator is inclusive of undergraduate, graduate, and professional development nurse educators and reflects the educator role in SBE.","6":"Interprofessional simulation (IPS), frequently referred to in the literature as simulation-enhanced interprofessional education (IPE), has been widely studied in nursing and medical education. For decades, the literature has suggested IPE as a valuable strategy for enhancing communication and collaboration among health professionals. Interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP) is foundational to developing high-functioning healthcare teams and can lead to reduced medical errors and increased patient safety. This chapter addresses IPS from both the academic and practice perspectives. The foundations of IPE and IPCP are reviewed, as well as the standards of best practice in simulation. Planning, development, and implementation will be discussed, including benefits, barriers, and possible solutions. Recommendations from relevant research on debriefing and evaluation of IPS are also reviewed. Outcomes from the growing body of research on IPS will be presented and include perceptions of interprofessional practice, better understanding of professional roles and responsibilities, development of communication and teamwork skills, and shared problem-solving and decision-making. Future implications and recommendations are provided based on the state of the science on IPS. Optimum design, implementation, and evaluation of IPS, along with a thorough understanding of the benefits, barriers, and opportunities, can help faculty and clinical educators prepare a collaborative healthcare workforce and reduce medical errors to ultimately improve patient outcomes.","7":"This chapter discusses the current state of hospital-based simulation, including the unprecedented events of 2020's global COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital-based simulation training requires a new approach. The realities of social distancing and the operational demands of hospital staffing ratios warrant creative adaptations of traditional simulation training methods. Hospitals used simulation to improve patient outcomes by training healthcare staff and students through telesimulation, and tested systems and equipment using in situ simulation (ISS). Latent safety threats (LSTs) were identified and corrected to improve patient outcomes. Hospital-based simulation has been incorporated into newly licensed registered nurses (NLRNs) residency programs to prepare them for competent practice. Simulations are also used for preparing staff for low-incidence, high-risk medical emergencies or disasters, such as active shooter events. Hospital-based simulation training adds value to healthcare systems, but requires more evidence of its quantitative and qualitative impacts.","8":"Although, human simulation methodology has its origins in medical education, nursing education has increased its use of simulated patient (SP) methodology to improve the education of nursing students across the curricula. This chapter will review the history of human simulation, introduce the human simulation continuum, and review different applications of SP methodology in undergraduate and graduate nursing education.","9":"Simulation is used in advanced practice nursing education for both formative learning experiences and summative competency testing. However, there has been a lack of cohesive data to support the use of simulation as a replacement for direct patient care hours. This chapter presents an overview of research designs and the leveled Kirkpatrick framework used in simulation research. Research articles evaluating the effect of simulation on advanced practice learners are presented by research design and Kirkpatrick level. There is evidence that simulation has a positive impact on Kirkpatrick Level 1 (Reactions) and Kirkpatrick Level 2 (Changes in Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes). However, there is a tremendous need for evidence that simulation can impact Kirkpatrick Level 3 (Behavior) and Level 4 (Results and Outcomes).","10":"Simulation is an integral component of undergraduate nursing education because it allows for a safe, timely, and prescriptive approach to meet learning objectives at the levels of individual simulations, courses, and academic programs. This review of the literature provides an overview of steps taken to move simulation forward in undergraduate nursing education, and it highlights educational theories, research, best practices, and policy statements underpinning modern nursing simulation. This chapter outlines simulation and curriculum integration approaches and provides examples of participant, course, and program outcomes.","11":"Climate change is a serious threat to human health. Nurses recognize vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by the consequences from climate change, especially the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Children with asthma and chronic health conditions are at the greatest risk for negative health outcomes and are the most important reason for climate advocacy. This descriptive correlational study seeks to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of school nurses related to the health impacts of climate change. School nurses are in a unique position to address the health impacts of climate change and become fierce advocates of climate justice because of population they serve. School-age and adolescent students are particularly vulnerable to the consequences climate change, which include poor air quality, increasing temperatures, and increasing pollen counts. School nurses were invited to participate in the study via email and provided information about the Nurses Climate Change Challenge. It was the goal of the study to assess these domains in school nurses' and later develop continuing education to support the care and advocacy of students. The results suggest more continuing education on climate change and climate conscious care is needed for school nurses. The current challenge is not only to be more prepared to treat a greater number of illnesses induced by climate change, it is also to maintain expertise and adapt to a changing environment. Nurses must address the impact of climate change on a local level by making changes in practice and engaging in research so that they are prepared with the knowledge, and skills to offer expertise in environmental health and the care of school-age populations.","12":"Healthcare contributes significant pollution to the natural environment. Nurses are obligated by professional commitment, to avoid causing harm in their care processes and decisions, including environmental harm. Nurse awareness of healthcare-generated pollution is growing but nurses may lack an understanding of how nursing contributes specifically to this pollution and what nurses can do within their scope and span to address it. This chapter introduces the concept \"Nurse-Sensitive Environmental Indicators\" as a proposal to identify, measure, and reduce the unintended harm of nursing practice that contributes to healthcare-generated pollution. It discusses the environmental problem, environmental health, and healthcare. The chapter explains what environmental stewardship has to do with nursing and describes nurse sensitive indicators. As has been the case with other quality outcomes measures, identifying agreed-upon environmental outcomes measures may give the nursing profession tools to measure and then address environmental impacts arising from nursing practice.","13":"The purpose of this chapter is to report the findings gathered in an author-designed survey of new nurse graduates in Connecticut of their confidence in the application of environmental health in their nursing practice. An invitation to the survey was included in newsletters of Connecticut Nurses Association sent to all practicing nurses in Connecticut. New nurse graduates' confidence level regarding incorporation of environmental health vary substantially among the aspects of environmental health and this confidence decreases as they progress through the steps of the nursing process.","14":"This chapter outlines the guiding theoretical framework of EcoJustice Education (EJE), research questions, semistructured interviews with nursing scholars that begin to question the perceptions that lead us to the crisis and recommendations of how sustainability efforts can help to address the vital relationality of human beings to water. It highlights the profession of nursing education in order for nurses to understand their roles within the context of the crises. The EJE theoretical framework will help nurse educators reimagine a new understanding and a powerful discovery that includes the awareness of a broad set of historically constructed and politically motivated power knowledge relations in nursing. The chapter provides examples and discussions of four dominant discourses predominant within the Flint Water Crisis and Detroit Water Shutoffs: anthropocentrism, ethnocentrism, individualism, and mechanism. These discourses are related to nursing education to further explain how they are pervaded in nursing.","15":"The health implications of food and agriculture production are not generally part of the nursing curriculum and yet nurses understand that vulnerable populations, such as farmworkers, may need special attention in terms of health education, disease prevention, and access to mental health and healthcare services. Nurses also learn about the social determinants of health and increasingly are applying this knowledge to health and wellness in their communities. This article will consider the health impacts of the social determinants and both environmental and occupational exposures experienced by farmworkers and the associated implications for the nursing profession. As health professionals one can help to give voice to this often-voiceless population. Working with farmworkers in partnership is key and working with the Migrant Clinicians Network and other advocacy organizations on state and federal policies that will improve working and living conditions for farmworkers and their families is crucial.","16":"Public health practice and ethics address both individual and environmental health, in order to optimize the well-being of an entire population. Consideration of environmental health equity (EHE) is an evolving component of environmental ethics and public health, with evidence of disparities in exposure to vulnerable communities. Related terms for studying EHE include elements of justice, social determinants of health (SDOH), disparities, and environmental racism. The unequal protection from environmental exposures, specifically considering vulnerable and marginalized populations is significant to science, society, and health. Analyzing the environmental impact includes examining equity principles to assist policy and decision-making in the public arena, in order to address unfair burdens placed on vulnerable populations. However, the lack of a common and precise term for the idea makes it to instruct and evaluate the experiences of inequities in diverse populations. The purpose of this research is to use a concept analysis to examine the idea, utility, and conditions surrounding \"EHE\" for use in public health, nursing, environmental ethics, policy development, and interprofessional collaboration. A concept analysis will be conducted following the eight-step method developed by Walker and Avant (2011) Data sources will include empirical and descriptive literature; and the results will identify defining attributes of the concept. A set of operationalized standards for EHE is established through this concept analysis. This study proposes an examination of the concept in order to assess and evaluate the ethics and experiences in EHE, and determine how this impacts population health outcomes.","17":"Concerns about the health impacts from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continue to grow as the science continues to emerge associating this chemical family with a wide range of health impacts. PFAS exposure may affect growth, learning, and behavior of infants and older children, and also impact reproductive health, cardiovascular health, and the immune system. PFAS exposure is widespread, with communities surrounding military bases at potentially greater risk of exposure from the use of fire fighting foam that may have entered the drinking water. As trusted health professionals, nurses have been in the frontlines communicating risks regarding PFAS to impacted communities. This chapter describes a large number of PFAS studies in blood and harmful health effects in people. The chapter discusses primary sources of exposure and risk reduction. It explains health advisory levels, minimal risk levels. The chapter provides medical testing and medical management.","18":"This chapter addresses the development and advancement of the Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Health (CCCCJH) in the School of Nursing at the MGH Institute of Health Professions, the first nurse-led center emerged from the overwhelming evidence of climate change and its associated deleterious health consequences. The Center steering committee developed a mission, vision, and core values as well as a logo to guide the first year of initiatives and galvanize the efforts for the future. Workshop and symposium development, implementation, and evaluation are discussed. Future directions and the importance of educational initiatives aimed at expanding nursing and interprofessional knowledge of the intersection of climate and health are discussed.","19":"Climate change has been labeled the greatest threat to public health and to global health in the 21st century. Addressing climate change has also been reframed as the greatest opportunity for global health in the 21st century, providing a more proactive lens through which to plan and implement actions. Significant climate change impacts to human health are numerous and mounting, including the direct effects of heatwaves, thermal stress and changed frequency or intensity of other extreme weather events. Climate change has been termed a complex public health issue affecting all areas of nursing practice dealing with individuals, families, communities, and the national health arena, and is therefore deserving of inclusion into nursing curricula throughout the entirety of prelicensure coursework. Nursing education programs that include this content will better prepare future nurses to face projected environmental challenges to human health.","20":"Asbestos refers to six fibrous minerals that occur naturally in the environment in the United States and throughout the world. Deposits may be found in soil, rocks, and deposits of other minerals such as vermiculite and talc. These naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) minerals belong to the serpentine and amphibole family of minerals. This chapter reports shared components of community-driven environmental concerns related to exposure to NOA in a rural Montana and a suburban Nevada community. The specific aim is to establish an understanding of the community and community member's primary concern(s) related to NOA in both communities. The knowledge that NOA is commonly found in areas across the United States supports the need for additional research into the health effects of environmental exposure and best-practices to reduce exposure risk while allowing communities to thrive economically.","21":"Climate change poses significant health risks. Nurses assess, treat, and educate patients about health risks. However, nurses' level of awareness, motivation, and behaviors related to climate change and health is not known. This study developed and tested a novel tool measuring these elements. Three hundred fifty-seven nurses responded to the overall survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) assessed the factor structure of the 22-item CHANT survey and Cronbach's alpha estimated internal consistency. A five-factor model was retained through the EFA, demonstrating good model fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = .95, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .04, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .09), and items were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha for each subscale &gt;.70). CHANT has been developed and psychometrically examined and is ready for further use and study.","22":"Exposure to unprecedented levels of wildfire smoke is increasing cardiopulmonary mortality and is especially catastrophic to people with preexisting respiratory conditions such as asthma. Wildfire smoke is a mixture of hazardous air pollutants and airborne particulate matter and wildfires are burning larger areas of land and lasting longer, extending the smoke season. The wildfire season is also expected to lengthen as a result of the changing climate. This scoping review examines publications related to wildfires and health in order to explore the ways in which nursing science contributes to research on the health effects of wildfires and strategies to decrease exposure to wildfires and\/or wildfire smoke. Nursing's contribution to wildfire research needs to increase to meet the demands of this rapidly growing, international problem. Nurses have an opportunity to protect the public's health through interventional research focused on preventing exposure and applying what is learned to practice.","23":"Approximately one in eight people in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma is associated with significant medical expenditure and has been implicated as a leading reason for chronic school absences. Environmental risk factors such as access to green space and exposure to poor air quality are patterned such that some vulnerable populations may be at higher risk. Using data from DC Health, the Washington, DC, department of public health, this study investigated associations between neighborhood social, built, and natural environments and rates of asthma-related healthcare encounters by ZIP code between 2014 and 2017. We found that significant differences in rates exist between ZIP codes and for different subpopulations. Black boys had the highest overall rate, with 58.49 visits per 1,000 population, ranging by ZIP code from 0 to 88.56 visits. We found that the ZIP code Social Vulnerability Index was consistently associated with rates of healthcare encounters, but not access to green\/open space or exposure to high traffic. However, we discuss how the ZIP code level may not be an appropriate level at which to investigate such built\/natural environment features because of the proportion of variability that is found within rather than between ZIP codes. We end with a short discussion of ways that nurses, in particular school nurses, could help to address neighborhood environmental risk factors.","24":"Nurse scientists are ideally positioned to perform environmental health research and it is critical that the role of omics in the complex relationships between environmental exposures and an individual's unique physiology in human health outcomes be appreciated. Importantly, omics can offer nurse scientists a tool to measure exposure, demonstrate molecular phenotypic changes associated with exposure, and potentially uncover mechanisms of exposure-related disease or negative health outcomes. The purpose of this summary is to serve as an overview of omics methodologies for nurse scientists conducting environmental health research and provides future directions of this work as well as exemplar funding opportunities that demonstrate the growing need and interest in this area. The intersection of nursing and exposure science will accelerate the work in environmental health and bring forth translation of research findings into clinical and community practice. Importantly, this information can better help us understand the variation in response to the environment and support environmental health policy change at the local, state, and federal level to improve community health and well-being.","25":null,"26":"The chemical composition of air changes from moment to moment. While the atmosphere may appear clear and cloudless to the human eye, gases, aerosols, and particulates are in constant interaction with Earth's surface under the influence of meteorological conditions. The recent emergence of low-cost, dense environmental air quality monitoring networks suggests growing interest in highly granular temporospatial exposure assessments by scientists and citizens. This chapter describes the utility of leveraging partnerships and resources to collocate a dense network of low-cost air quality sensors with meteorological sensors across a predominantly rural state located in the southeastern U.S. Construction of the network will improve knowledge on the daily, diurnal, and seasonal variations of pollutant exposures in rural and urban areas, the public health impact of extreme climatological and atmospheric events, and socioeconomic factors that heighten risk of exposures and health outcomes.","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"The field of pharmacogenomics seeks to identify the impact of genetic variants on drug dosing, response, metabolism, and safety outcomes. The narrow therapeutic indices for anesthesia drugs, variability of patient responses to anesthesia, and the risks associated with surgery make anesthetics and the perioperative period prime targets for pharmacogenetic research. Anesthesia providers strive to optimize anesthesia delivery and patient outcomes and to specifically reduce anesthesia-related risks and negative outcomes. Despite pharmacogenomics emerging from the field of anesthesia, the most significant advances to date in the understanding and application of genetics to pharmacology have occurred outside of anesthesiology. This chapter provides an overview of genetic concepts fundamental to understanding the pharmacogenetics of anesthesia practice and presents the current state of the science with respect to the genetic influence on the response to volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents and opioid receptor agonists commonly used in anesthesia practice. In addition, the chapter delineates U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling tenets for pharmacogenetics, discusses clinical implications of pharmacogenomics for family members, and highlights the potential for future paradigm shifts in pharmacogenomics of anesthesia practice.","48":"Fluid therapy has dramatically changed since its early inception nearly 200 years ago. Administration of intravenous fluid (IVF) has evolved from a \"drip\" technique to the algorithmic approach of the anesthetic fluid plan, and is now moving toward Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy. As the science and culture of fluid management evolves, anesthetists must remain focused on \"why\" anesthetic fluid matters. The purpose of IVF administration is to support tissue perfusion and maintain euvolemia. As the evidence underlying perioperative practice matures and the science of anesthesia races to meet the evolving demands of surgery, anesthetists must align knowledge generation with the individualized needs of the patient. The future of perioperative IVF therapy will be patient centric. In the near future, anesthetists will know the patient's blood volume before, during, and after the surgery. They will no longer depend on inaccurate surrogates to estimate, but have the knowledge to titrate fluids to maintain a zero balance. Practice will move away from algorithms and toward individualized fluid administration based on reproducible end points. Decisions about fluid selection, timing, and volume will be driven by patient- and case-specific requirements as specific as when a patient is typed and crossed for blood transfusion. The greatest challenge for the anesthetist in perioperative fluid therapy is to move beyond the dogmatic practices of the past and toward fluid therapy guided by patient centric evidence.","49":"A substantial body of research suggests that anesthetic exposure to patients who are very young or very old may impair cognitive, behavioral, and emotional development or recovery. In lower animal models of pre- and postnatal age, anesthetic exposure may impact inflammation, synaptogenesis, neuronal apoptosis, and glial cell development. To date, research in humans is inconclusive regarding the long-term cognitive and behavioral sequelae of general anesthesia in the young child. In older adults, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and cognitive delirium are identified as markers of anesthetic neurotoxicity. Existing neurological degenerative processes and other comorbidities in combination with the stress of surgery make evaluating the independent impact of anesthetic exposure difficult. Advances in research, imaging, and partnerships have enhanced the potential for understanding the impact of anesthetic exposure. In both populations, the resulting data and limitations faced in initial research efforts are catalysts for current prospective studies.","50":"The majority of the evidence indicates preventing inadvertent perioperative hypothermia reduces the incidence of many perioperative complications. Among the results of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia are increased bleeding, myocardial events, impaired wound healing, and diminished renal function. Most researchers agree there is an increased incidence of surgical site infections in patients who experience inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. Forced-air warming is effective in preventing inadvertent perioperative hypothermia. Paradoxically, forced-air warmers have been implicated in causing surgical site infections in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. The results of investigations suggest these devices harbor pathogens and cause unwanted airflow disturbances. However, no significant increases in bacterial counts were found when forced-air warmers were used according to the manufacturer's directions. The results of one study suggested the incidence of surgical site infections in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty was increased when using a forced-air warmer. However these researchers did not control for other factors affecting the incidence of surgical site infections in these patients. Current evidence does not support forced-air warmers causing surgical site infections in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty. Clinicians must use and maintain these devices as per the manufacturer's directions. They may consider using alternative warming methods. Well-conducted studies are needed to help determine the role of forced-air warmers in causing infections in these patients.","51":"Most anesthesia providers prefer to do a subarachnoid block (SAB) for cesarean section because of its rapid onset and reliability to provide adequate anesthesia. However an effect of the SAB is that it causes a spinal-induced hypotension (SIH) in up to 85% of the population. There have been multiple studies that assessed fluid administration, vasopressor administration, maternal positioning, or serotonin blockers given prophylactically to attenuate the SIH response. Despite these multiple studies, the method to prevent and treat SIH remains varied from one anesthesia practice to another. The purpose of this chapter is to review the evidence on the various methods used to prevent and treat SIH.","52":"Palliative care teams require multidisciplinary support. While this is an emerging area in anesthesia practice, there are many avenues for certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) to share their unrivaled clinical knowledge. CRNAs may become involved with or consult on palliative sedation, medical management, interventional pain management, terminal wean\/extubation, and organ donation. Additionally, CRNAs need to understand the unique needs of this patient population so that they can appropriately care for palliative care patients presenting to the operating room for palliative surgery. More research is needed to further explore CRNA involvement in palliative care. However, CRNAs have a specialized knowledge of pharmacology and physiology that perfectly complements the multidisciplinary palliative care team. Death is the wish of some, the relief of many, and the end of all. Lucius Annaeus Seneca (4 BCE65).","53":"According to National Institute of Health Pathways to Prevention Workshop (2014), chronic pain affects an estimated 100 million Americans, with approximately 25 million people experiencing moderate to severe chronic pain, which negatively impacts their ability to function leading to a diminished quality of life. Pain is the primary reason Americans are on disability, which adds to the economic and social burden of suffering for the nation. Chronic pain costs are estimated to be between 560 and 630 billion per year. An estimated 5 to 8 million Americans use opioids for long-term management of chronic pain, which can have deleterious effects on their lives including addiction. Recent evidence suggests that acupuncture, a treatment modality that has been used worldwide for over 2,000 years, may provide a useful pain management option for those who suffer from chronic pain. The investigation into its mechanism of action and efficacy remains elusive, but promising.","54":"Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is defined as a persistent pain state that exists more than 2 months postoperatively and cannot be explained by other causes such as recurrence of disease, apparent inflammation, or other nonsurgical related factors. CPSP is a type of persistent pain condition that often complicates recovery from surgical procedures. It is thought to be caused by surgical nerve injury, but the fact that an identifiable nerve injury can be found in only one-third of CPSP patients suggests that the problem may be far more complex than a simple surgically created nerve injury. Certain surgical procedures report a high incidence of CPSP, helping to isolate likely candidates for this problem, but instituting preventative measures and identifying a treatable source of pain continues to be elusive. Some progress has been made in the areas of prevention and treatment.","55":"Anesthesia information management systems (AIMS) are rapidly gaining widespread acceptance. Aggressively promoted as an improvement to manual-entry recordkeeping systems in the areas of accuracy, completeness, quality improvement, billing, and vigilance, these systems record all patient vital signs and parameters, providing a legible hard copy and permanent electronic record. With well-documented financial incentives, as well as government subsidies, AIMS are becoming adopted at an unprecedented rate. With the goals of the federal government to enhance the use of the electronic medical record, there is an emerging belief that AIMS may soon be mandated, with more limited choices than currently available. As assessed by, and often in spite of the published evidence, concerns of practitioners still reflect many of the same concerns expressed in the editorial comments of the past.","56":"Ideal and effective communication consists of a clear, audible, and focused message from a transmitter that is delivered to an attentive, undistracted receiver, and consists of both verbal and nonverbal types. Communication in the health care setting is highly complex and dynamic, involving multiple settings, participants, and unique challenges. Effective communication in the perioperative environment is a requirement for safe patient care delivery and an important element of teamwork. A message must be accurately delivered in a uniquely high-risk and time-sensitive location, beset with numerous distractions, barriers, and challenges. Surgical checklists and time-out procedures have promoted a standardized, \"all-hands\" approach to addressing some of the challenges to effective communication in the perioperative environment. Postoperative debriefing sessions have demonstrated effectiveness in improving team functioning in the simulated learning environment and hold promise as another strategy to address these challenges, but require further research and development. Other promising strategies to improve effective perioperative communication are focused on team building activities and minimizing distractions at critical time points within patient care delivery, but to date are not substantiated by evidence. Future research is necessary to examine these novel approaches to improving communication in the perioperative environment to influence the safety of patient care delivery in this highly challenging health care setting. Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something. Plato.","57":"Historically, mechanical ventilation of the lungs utilizing relatively large tidal volumes was common practice in the operating room and intensive care unit (ICU). The rationale behind this treatment strategy was to yield better patient outcomes, that is, fewer pulmonary complications, and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. As evidence-based practice has evolved, potential harmful effects of traditional, nonphysiological mechanical ventilation (ventilation with larger tidal volumes and the tolerance of high airway pressures) even in shortterm treatment have been shown to correlate with systemic inflammation and the development of ventilator-associated lung injury. Lung-protective ventilation principles using more physiological tidal volumes, avoiding high inspiratory plateau pressures, along with appropriate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure have been shown to decrease pulmonary complications and improve outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ongoing ventilatory support in the ICU. In addition, current research is beginning to validate the benefit of providing more physiologic ventilator support in the operating room, particularly for high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, in minimizing acute lung injury. A review of lung-protective ventilation measures including benefits and potential side effects is presented. Additional treatment modalities and therapeutic considerations are offered for inclusion in optimal patient management.","58":"The incidence of morbid obesity has tripled within the past 25 years in developed countries, with the highest rate of growth noted among people with body mass index (BMI) greater than 50. The physiologic derangements that accompany obesity affect almost every organ system leading to a vast array of comorbid conditions including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This review focuses on the unique perioperative management considerations that the nurse anesthetist must address when caring for these patients as well as the impact of obesity and OSA on postoperative complications and mortality rates. Current research is reviewed to highlight best practice recommendations for all phases of anesthetic management including implications for bariatric surgery and office-based practice.","59":"Cannot intubate\/cannot ventilate (CICV) situations during anesthesia are rare, potentially catastrophic to the patient, and difficult to predict. Widely adopted practice guidelines advocate an algorithmic approach to CICV situations in which the anesthetist: (a) recognizes the CICV situation, (b) calls for help, (c) steadily progresses through a variety of methods to ventilate the patient and secure the airway, (d) restores ventilation via an infraglottic airway if the patient cannot be safely awakened prior to becoming moribund. Despite widespread consensus that rapid progression to placement of an infraglottic airway is critical to the survival of the patient in a CICV situation, the rarity of CICV is a substantial barrier for anesthetists attempting to gain and maintain skill at placing infraglottic airways. Peer-reviewed literature reveals a number of themes relevant to training anesthetists in infraglottic airway placement. Specific training in infraglottic airway access consistently decreased the time required for anesthetists to decide to place an infraglottic airway. No one approach or method for placing an infraglottic airway was consistently faster or more successful. Model fidelity (i.e., the use of low-fidelity task trainers vs. high-fidelity simulated patients) during teaching did not affect the performance of anesthetists at placing infraglottic airways, and performance rapidly plateaued after five repetitions during teaching. Finally, skill at placing an infraglottic airway was sustained for 6 to 12 months after training. These findings have implications for how nurse anesthetists should learn and sustain the skill of infraglottic airway placement. Nurse anesthetists should undergo initial training that requires the repetitive placement of infraglottic airways, and receive sustainment training every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Although rarely used, the skill of an anesthetist in infraglottic airway placement can mean the difference between life and death for the patient in a CICV situation.","60":"","61":"Symptom management research is a core area of nursing science and one of the priorities for the National Institute of Nursing Research, which specifically focuses on understanding the biological and behavioral aspects of symptoms such as pain and fatigue, with the goal of developing new knowledge and new strategies for improving patient health and quality of life. The types and volume of data related to the symptom experience, symptom management strategies, and outcomes are increasingly accessible for research. Traditional data streams are now complemented by consumer-generated (i.e., quantified self) and \"omic\" data streams. Thus, the data available for symptom science can be considered big data. The purposes of this chapter are to (a) briefly summarize the current drivers for the use of big data in research; (b) describe the promise of big data and associated data science methods for advancing symptom management research; (c) explicate the potential perils of big data and data science from the perspective of the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice; and (d) illustrate strategies for balancing the promise and the perils of big data through a case study of a community at high risk for health disparities. Big data and associated data science methods offer the promise of multidimensional data sources and new methods to address significant research gaps in symptom management. If nurse scientists wish to apply big data and data science methods to advance symptom management research and promote health equity, they must carefully consider both the promise and perils. ","62":"Military nurses encounter similar issues as civilian nurses in daily practice situations; however, wartime and humanitarian missions may bring unique and difficult ethical dilemmas. While nursing has the American Nurses Association code of ethics to provide a framework to guide ethical practice decisions, conflicts may arise from the unique aspects of nursing within a wartime environment. Understanding those conflicts occuring within the military wartime scenario can provide nurses with experiential examples from which to derive strategies for personal coping and professional behavior and decision making. This chapter describes the research that has focused upon the identification of these issues, the effects from uresolved issues, and those directions for future research to better prepare miltiary nurses before and during deployment. ","63":"In 2014, the Institute of Medicine published a meta-analysis on current military reintegration programs, suggesting they have failed to improve postdeployment behavioral health. In this chapter, I explore some of the issues associated with the two paradigm reintegration programs supported by the Department of Defense (DoD), namely, BATTLEMIND postdeployment debriefings and Master Resilience Training. My discussion will be located within a subpopulation of military personnel I call warriors, particularly those men who have been exposed to combat. In performing a normative analysis of current reintegration programs, I rely on an ethics of embodied personal presence as a derivative focus of both nursing ethics and the just war tradition. Using an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate warriors' experiences of training across the military life cycle illustrates how reintegration challenges have been construed as potential pathology because disembodied reintegration programs do not consider the influence of military training and lifestyle in the development of certain health behaviors. When compared to the warrior's lived experience, a broader set of reintegration challenges emerge that cannot be fully captured by the symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Therefore, new reintegration programs need to be developed. Although I do not provide explicit details concerning what these reintegration programs should look at, I suggest that the DoD turn to something akin to the Healthy People campaign. ","64":"Emergency departments (EDs) serve a wide range of patient needs. A crucial aspect of safe and effective care in the ED is to appropriately transition patients to the next level of care. In most EDs, this disposition planning is done exclusively by physicians, which has the potential to result in unacceptable harm. A virtue ethics approach demonstrates the need for explicit inclusion of nurses in disposition planning. In utilizing this approach, it is necessary to examine four focal virtues as they relate to the work of disposition planning and the moral character of the nurse. The virtues of prudence, trustworthiness, vigilance, and courage show that interprofessional collaboration is needed during disposition planning to promote patient safety, facilitate interprofessional relationships, and prevent moral distress. The majority of literature on disposition planning is empirical in nature; this chapter adds a normative argument and a motive for policy reform. ","65":"With the wide adoption and use of smart home applications, there is a need for examining ethical issues regarding smart home use at the intersection of aging, technology, and home environment. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of ethical considerations and the evidence on these ethical issues based on an integrative literature review with regard to the utilization of smart home technologies by older adults and their family members. REVIEW DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an integrative literature review of the scientific literature from indexed databases (e. g., MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO). The framework guiding this review is derived from previous work on ethical considerations related to telehealth use for older adults and smart homes for palliative care. Key ethical issues of the framework include privacy, informed consent, autonomy, obtrusiveness, equal access, reduction in human touch, and usability. Six hundred and thirty-five candidate articles were identified between the years 1990 and 2014. Sixteen articles were included in the review. Privacy and obtrusiveness issues appear to be the most important factors that can affect smart home technology adoption. In addition, this article recommends that stigmatization and reliability and maintenance of the system are additional factors to consider. When smart home technology is used appropriately, it has the potential to improve quality of life and maintain safety among older adults, ultimately supporting the desire of older adults for aging in place. The ability to respond to potential ethical concerns will be critical to the future development and application of smart home technologies that aim to enhance safety and independence. ","66":"The purpose of this integrative review is to critically analyze the research literature regarding ethical principles that surround the integration of genetics and genomics in primary care clinical practice. Advanced practice nurses (APRNs) play an important role in the provision of primary care services, in the areas of obstetrics, pediatrics, family practice, and internal medicine. Advances in genetic and genomic science are infiltrating these day-to-day health-care systems and becoming an integral part of health-care delivery. It is imperative for primary care providers to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetics and genomics. A comprehensive multistep search of CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Premier, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted to identify primary research articles published from 2003 to 2015 that evaluated ethical issues related to genetics and genomics in U. S. primary care practice. A sample of 26 primary research articles met the inclusion criteria. Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) revised framework for integrative reviews was used to guide the analysis and assess the quality of the studies. Key findings from the studies are discussed according to Beauchamp and Childress's (2009) ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Research conducted to date is mainly qualitative and descriptive and the analysis revealed several ethical challenges to implementing genetics and genomics in primary care settings. The review suggests that there are several implications for research, education, and the development of primary care practice that support APRNs delivering genetic and genomic care while incorporating knowledge of ethical principles. More research needs to be conducted that evaluates the actual genetic\/genomic ethical issues encountered by primary care providers. ","67":"Since the onset of war in Iraq and Afghanistan in April 2002, much attention has been given to the effect of war on servicemen and servicewomen who have now been serving in combat for over thirteen years, the longest sustained war in American history. Many service members have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and suffered from the visible and invisible wounds of war. Much work has been done in the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense, and the civilian sector after observing the effects of multiple deployments and overall military service on the service member. A survey of the literature revealed that the ethics of conducting research on programs to assist these brave men and women is fraught with ethical concerns based on a military culture that often precludes autonomy and privacy. While strides have been made in developing strategies to assist service members deal with their military service issues, a serious lack of information exists on the impact of a parent's service on the health and well-being of military children. A discussion of current research on services for children is presented with an analysis of the ethical problems that have precluded adequate study of those who need society's help the most. ","68":"Self-neglect is a significant international public health issue. Estimates suggest that there may be over one million cases per year in the United States. Aging populations will put more people at risk of self-neglect. This chapter presents background literature, self-neglect definitions and policy context, risk factors, and a brief overview of research on perspectives of self-neglect from both clients and community health and social care professionals. A case study is presented from the perspective of an individual and is used to explore ethical issues therein. A person-centered assessment within a multidisciplinary team approach is required for building a therapeutic relationship with clients. Capacity is a central issue in the management of responses to self-neglect. Ethical considerations of importance for community health and social care professionals include beneficence and nonmaleficence, autonomy and capacity, and respect for people's rights and dignity. A model of ethical justification is presented to explain dilemmas, challenges, and actions. Competence of professionals, multidisciplinary team working, informed consent, privacy, confidentiality, and best interest are also critical considerations. Effective decision making by an interdisciplinary team of professionals needs to be person-centered and give due consideration to the best interest of self-neglecting clients. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an in-depth discussion and examination of ethical issues and challenges relating to self-neglecting clients. ","69":"The abstract consideration of ethical questions in family and informal caregiving might rightly be criticized for ignoring the lived experience of people. This chapter seeks to avoid such oversight by reflecting on ethical issues in family care in a way that is based on careful social scientific inquiry into the well-being of caregivers. The chapter draws on our research and experience in working with family caregivers, both professionally and personally. We step back from a practical concern with policies to support the well-being of caregivers to consider ethical issues associated with their typically hidden role. The chapter begins by noting the growing reliance on family care today. It proceeds to outline the dynamic experience of moving into and out of the caregiver role, before discussing key ethical issues associated with family care. Many of these stem from the risk that caregivers can come to share in the reduced circumstances and vulnerability of those for whom they care. Critical ethical issues are related to the typically \"unboundaried\" responsibility of family caregivers for the well-being of the cared-for person, something that can be contrasted with the more boundaried and intermittent responsibility of formal caregivers. Additionally, all too often, family caregivers encounter situations where their responsibilities exceed their capacities, but where a choice to not provide care will result in harm to the cared-for person. In discussing these issues, this chapter seeks to make the case for developing more responsive forms of support that promote positive benefits for both caregivers and care recipients. ","70":"Gaining in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons who have suffered traumatic events with physical and psychological sequelae is important for building effective interventions. However, qualitative research of this kind can be emotionally difficult for the researcher whose research interests derive from practice experiences with the population studied. It may be difficult for the researcher to separate the role of inquirer from that of practitioner. We explore this issue using ethical analysis to differentiate the responsibilities of the researcher from those of the clinician. In the first part of the chapter, we provide some background on the population studied and traumatic spinal cord injury and its aftermath as context for the issues raised by the narrative. Then, we describe briefly the first author's research exploring the meaning of bodily changes and embodiment in persons who have suffered a traumatic spinal cord injury. We provide the part of Jack's story that most troubled the researcher and led her to discuss the situation with an ethics colleague. Finally, we use the tools of moral reasoning, ethical analysis, and principles of research ethics to explore the pertinent excerpt of the narrative. The resulting clarifications are laid out for the reader with the intent of assisting other qualitative researchers in determining the extent and limits of their obligations to participants of qualitative studies, especially those that explore sensitive issues. ","71":"Our past lessons from war trauma have taught us that mental health-care stigma and other issues surrounding mental health-seeking behaviors can negatively impact the healing trajectory and long-term function for service members and their families. It can take years to decades before a service member seeks professional help for psychological distress, if he or she seeks it at all. Unfortunately, signs of personal and family problems can be subtle, and consequences, such as suicide, tragic. In this chapter, we consider the story one military health-care provider submitted in response to a study solicitation that read: Please provide your personal story telling me about any psychological distress you may have experienced after returning from deployment and your personal challenges accessing care and\/or remaining in treatment. This story is analyzed to explore the moral implications of his experience for the military and for other service members. The main points to be highlighted are that altruism can leave altruists more vulnerable, military mental health stigma may exacerbate this risk, and military families may profoundly be affected. ","72":"This chapter presents a case study of a 30-year-old female news reporter in Albuquerque, New Mexico, named Sharon Fullilove. The case is presented as a personal narrative by her mother, who is a critical care nurse, former chief nurse, Level I trauma unit commander, and colonel in the U.S. Air Force. The narrative is followed by excerpts from Sharon's chart that confirm a series of decisions made by both the hospital and the providers. The subsequent narrative is meant to give the reader an opportunity to reflect on the variety of clinical ethics questions that emerge when a patient enters into a contract with a physician and hospital for care. The goal is not to perform a thorough ethical analysis of the case but to let the reader experience what it is like when best practice standards, attention to patient care, and compassionate concern for family members are set aside. The case concludes with a set of broad questions that can be used for further discussion. Hopefully, this case will bring to the forefront the centrality of ethics in professional decision-making within the context of medical care. ","73":"Over the past 30 years, the health-care context as well as the roles and responsibilities of nurses have drastically changed. Leaders in nursing around the world recognize that the health-care system is stressed and the well-being of the nursing workforce plagued by the pressures and challenges it faces in everyday practice. We do not intend to make a strong normative argument for why nursing ethics education should be done in a certain way, but instead show from where we have come and to where we can go, so that educators are positioned to address some of the current shortcomings in ethics education. Our goal is to provide an illustration of ethics education as an interwoven, ongoing, and essential aspect of nursing education and professional development. By developing professional identity as character, we hope that professional nurses are given the skills to stand in the face of adversity and to act in a way that upholds the core competencies of nursing. Ultimately, health-care organizations will thrive because of the support they provide nurses and other health-care professionals. ","74":"Up to one-third of deployed military personnel sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBIs and the stress of deployment contribute to the vulnerability for chronic sleep disturbance, resulting in high rates of insomnia diagnoses as well as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and declines in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Inflammation is associated with insomnia; however, the impact of sleep changes on comorbid symptoms and inflammation in this population is unknown. In this study, we examined the relationship between reported sleep changes and the provision of the standard of care, which could include one or more of the following: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medications, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We compared the following: (a) the group with a decrease in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; restorative sleep) and (b) the group with no change or increase in PSQI (no change). Independent t tests and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups on demographic and clinical characteristics, and mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance tests were used to determine the effect of group differences on changes in comorbid symptoms. Linear regression models were used to examine the role of inflammation in changes in symptoms and HRQOL. The sample included 70 recently deployed military personnel with TBI, seeking care for sleep disturbances. Thirty-seven participants reported restorative sleep and 33 reported no sleep changes or worse sleep. The two groups did not differ in demographic characteristics or clinical symptoms at baseline. The TBI+restored sleep group had significant reductions in PTSD and depression over the 3-month period, whereas the TBI+no change group had a slight increase in both PTSD and depression. The TBI+restored sleep group also had significant changes in HRQOL, including the following HRQOL subcomponents: physical functioning, role limitations in physical health, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy\/fatigue, and general health perceptions. In a linear regression model using a forced entry method, the dependent variable of change in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations was significantly related to changes in PTSD symptoms and HRQOL in the TBI+restored sleep group, with R2=0.43, F33,3=8.31, p&lt;.01. Military personnel with TBIs who have a reduction in insomnia symptoms following a standard-of-care treatment report less severe symptoms of depression and PTSD and improved HRQOL, which relate to decreased plasma concentrations of CRP. These findings suggest that treatment for sleep disturbances in this TBI+military population is associated with improvements in health and decreases in inflammation. The contributions of inflammation-induced changes in PTSD and depression in sleep disturbances in TBI + military personnel require further study. ","75":"A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the association between coping (as measured by the Ways of Coping Questionnaire [WOCQ]) and psychological adjustment in caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). A search conducted using the CINAHL, Medline, and PsycINFO databases yielded 201 citations between 1974 and 2014. A total of seven articles met the inclusion criteria; namely, the respondents who completed the WOCQ were family caregivers of individuals with TBI (including 66-item, 42-item, or 21-item versions). Reviews were conducted in accordance with the American Academy of Neurology guidelines (2011) for classifying evidence. The results found no Class 1 or Class II studies but only four Class III and three Class IV studies. The major finding across the better-rated Class III studies was that the use of emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping was possibly associated with psychological adjustment in caregivers. The Class IV studies were determined to be inadequate or conflicting in determining the association between coping and psychological adjustment. Future studies need to employ carefully crafted designs, adhere to statistical procedure, apply advanced analytic techniques, and employ explicit models of coping, which will increase the accuracy and generalizability of the findings. ","76":"Our objective is to review the most widely used biomarkers and gene studies reported in pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature, to describe their findings, and to discuss the discoveries and gaps that advance the understanding of brain injury and its associated outcomes. Ultimately, we aim to inform the science for future research priorities. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for published English language studies conducted in the last 10 years to identify reviews and completed studies of biomarkers and gene associations in pediatric TBI. Of the 131 biomarker articles, only 16 were specific to pediatric TBI patients, whereas of the gene association studies in children with TBI, only four were included in this review. Biomarker and gene attributes are grossly understudied in pediatric TBI in comparison to adults. Although recent advances recognize the importance of biomarkers in the study of brain injury, the limited number of studies and genomic associations in the injured brain has shown the need for common data elements, larger sample sizes, heterogeneity, and common collection methods that allow for greater understanding of the injured pediatric brain. By building on to the consortium of interprofessional scientists, continued research priorities would lead to improved outcome prediction and treatment strategies for children who experience a TBI. Understanding recent advances in biomarker and genomic studies in pediatric TBI is important because these advances may guide future research, collaborations, and interventions. It is also important to ensure that nursing is a part of this evolving science to promote improved outcomes in children with TBIs. ","77":"Nearly 300,000 children and adults are hospitalized annually with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and monitored for many vital signs, including intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Nurses use these monitored values to infer the risk of secondary brain injury. The purpose of this chapter is to review nursing research on the monitoring of ICP and CPP in TBI. In this context, nursing research is defined as the research conducted by nurse investigators or research about the variables ICP and CPP that pertains to the nursing care of the TBI patient, adult or child. A modified systematic review of the literature indicated that, except for sharp head rotation and prone positioning, there are no body positions or nursing activities that uniformly or nearly uniformly result in clinically relevant ICP increase or decrease. In the smaller number of studies in which CPP is also measured, there are few changes in CPP since arterial blood pressure generally increases along with ICP. Considerable individual variation occurs in controlled studies, suggesting that clinicians need to pay close attention to the cerebrodynamic responses of each patient to any care maneuver. We recommend that future research regarding nursing care and ICP\/CPP in TBI patients needs to have a more integrated approach, examining comprehensive care in relation to short- and long-term outcomes and incorporating multimodality monitoring. Intervention trials of care aspects within nursing control, such as the reduction of environmental noise, early mobilization, and reduction of complications of immobility, are all sorely needed. ","78":"The long-term effects and significant impact of the full spectrum of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has received increased attention in recent years. Despite increased research efforts, there has been little movement toward improving outcomes for the survivors of TBI. TBI is a heterogeneous condition with a complex biological response, and significant variability in human recovery contributes to the difficulty in identifying therapeutics that improve outcomes. Personalized medicine, identifying the best course of treatment for a given individual based on individual characteristics, has great potential to improve recovery for TBI survivors. The advances in medical genetics and genomics over the past 20 years have increased our understanding of many biological processes. A substantial amount of research has focused on the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiles in many health and disease states, including recovery from TBI. The focus of this review chapter is to describe the current state of the science in genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic research in the TBI population. There have been some advancements toward understanding the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic processes in humans, but much of this work remains at the preclinical stage. This current evidence does improve our understanding of TBI recovery, but also serves as an excellent platform upon which to build further study toward improved outcomes for this population. ","79":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the younger population worldwide. Survivors of TBI often experience long-term disability in the form of cognitive, sensorimotor, and affective impairments. Despite the high prevalence in, and cost of TBI to, both individuals and society, some of its underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood. Animal models have been developed over the past few decades to closely replicate the different facets of TBI in humans to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and behavioral impairments and assess potential therapies that can promote neuroprotection. However, no effective treatment for TBI has been established to date in the clinical setting, despite promising results generated in preclinical studies in the use of neuroprotective strategies. The failure to translate results from preclinical studies to the clinical setting underscores a compelling need to revisit the current state of knowledge in the use of animal models in TBI. ","80":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in all of its forms--blast, concussive, and penetrating--has been an unfortunate sequela of warfare since ancient times. The continued evolution of military munitions and armor on the battlefield, as well as the insurgent use of improvised explosive devices, has led to blast-related TBI whose long-term effects on behavior and cognition are not yet known. Advances in medical care have greatly increased survival from these types of injuries. Therefore, an understanding of the potential health effects of TBI is essential. This review focuses on specific aspects of military-related TBI. There exists a large body of literature reporting the environmental conditions, forces, and staging of injury. Many of these studies are focused on the neuropathology of TBI, due to blast overpressure waves, and the emergence of large numbers of mild blast-related TBI cases.","81":"Despite increased attention to traumatic brain injury (TBI), there remains no specific treatment and available interventions focus rather on the prevention of secondary injury. One of the reasons posited for the lack of a successful therapy is the amalgamation of various types of injuries under the same severity category in clinical trials. Informatics approaches have been suggested as a means to develop an improved classification system for TBI. As a result of federal interagency efforts, common data elements (CDEs) for TBI have now been developed. Further, the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research Informatics System (FITBIR) has been created and is now available for TBI researchers to both add and retrieve data. This chapter will discuss the goals, development, and evolution of the CDEs and FITBIR and discuss how these tools can be used to support TBI research. A specific exemplar using the CDEs and lessons learned from working with the CDEs and FITBIR are included to aid future researchers. ","82":"","83":"","84":"The tourniquet is a simple device that has been used since the Middle Ages. Although different variations have been designed throughout its history, the simplicity of design has remained. The history of tourniquets follows two distinct paths--the operating room and the prehospital setting. From the earliest recorded history, tourniquets have been used for surgical procedures which were originally to amputate war-ravaged limbs and then to create a bloodless field for routine limb surgery. This history has continued uninterrupted since the early 1900s with continued research to foster advances in knowledge. The history of tourniquets in the prehospital setting, however, has not progressed as smoothly. The debate regarding the use of a tourniquet to save a life from excessive limb hemorrhage began in the 1600s, and continues to this day. This chapter will explore the prehospital use of tourniquets, which may shed some light on where this debate originated. The current state of the knowledge regarding tourniquets will then be discussed with a focus on prehospital use, using the operating room literature when needed to fill knowledge gaps. The chapter will conclude with recommendations for prehospital tourniquet use and some areas for future research. Tourniquets are used for operative procedures within accepted clinical guidelines throughout the world as the standard of care. Current science supports a similar stance for the use of prehospital tourniquets within clinical guidelines.","85":"In recent years, research on caregiving has grown in both quality and quantity. Caregivers play an important role in supporting and promoting the health and recovery of injured, disabled, and ill family members in their care. Although researchers have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of family caregiving, less is known about family caregivers of U.S. Veterans. The purpose of this review is to identify and evaluate the research surrounding caregivers of U.S. Veterans, particularly two populations of Veterans: those who returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and those who had suffered a stroke. A search of the available literature from 1987 to present day resulted in a review of 18 publications on Operation Enduring Freedom\/Operation Iraqi Freedom caregivers and 19 publications on caregivers of Veterans with stroke. We summarize empirical findings, critique the study methods, and provide our recommendations to improve the quality of care of Veterans and their caregivers. ","86":"Early research in malignant hyperthermia (MH) focused on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) as a primary trigger of the syndrome. This hypothesis was based on the initial signs and symptoms of MH such as tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and signs of increased metabolism in patients who developed MH. Supporting these early links between MH and the ANS were case reports from anesthesia providers who reported that patients who subsequently developed MH after a nontriggering previous anesthetic had appeared unusually stressed prior to the surgical procedure in which they triggered. There is no disagreement in the scientific community that a primary disorder in MH lies in the inability to control myoplasmic calcium levels in skeletal muscles. However, considering the variability in genetic and clinical presentation, the timing of intraoperative triggering, and the unexplained phenomenon of nonanesthetic triggering, the identification of cofactors in MH triggering remains paramount. A careful review of existing research supports the hypothesis that the autonomic nervous system plays a significant role as a cofactor in the triggering and progression of an MH episode. If a differentiation can be made and a link can be demonstrated between abnormalities in receptor sensitivity for or release, reuptake, or metabolism of catecholamines in malignant hyperthermia susceptible individuals, we may be able to use these as additional markers\/predictors of disease. ","87":"To date, approximately 300,000 families including 700,000 children have been affected by the increased and repeated number of deployments in support of the Global War on Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001. The purpose of this review is to discuss the impact of these deployments on family members of active duty and reserve\/guard personnel. A search of literature across the years of military conflicts reveals waves of studies emerging after World War II, the Vietnam conflict, Desert Storm\/Shield, and now the most recent wars. Study designs most frequently include qualitative exploratory, survey methods, and program evaluations. The field is limited by small scale projects, service- and facility-specific samples, and knowledge extracted from related topics. More research is needed to achieve a more comprehensive understanding across the trajectory of the deployment experience for both service personnel and family members as well as long-term outcomes. ","88":"Today in the digital age, with our advances in modern technology and communication, there are additional stressors for our military personnel and Veterans. Constant dangers exist both on and off the battlefield, unlike prior wars that had clearly-defined war zones. In addition, medical advances have assisted in saving the lives of many more gravely injured troops than ever previously possible. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan come to an end, large numbers of service men and women are returning home with multiple injuries. This group of Veterans has significantly higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury than ever before reported. Although existing PTSD therapies have been found to be highly effective for many Veterans, there is a substantial minority unsatisfactorily treated. Mantram repetition, an innovative, complementary, evidence-based treatment, is proving to be successful for these new Veterans. When used regularly it helps with \"road rage, impatience, anger, frustration, and being out of control.\" A mantram is a brief, sacred word or phrase that embodies divine power or the greatest positive energy one can imagine (Easwaran, 2008a). Mantram repetition is a simple, quick, personal, portable, and private complementary practice that may be used as an adjunct to current treatments for PTSD. Growing research evidence supports mantram repetition's value for dissemination and adoption in the 21st century. This chapter summarizes Mantram Program research conducted from 2003 to 2014. It describes the health-related benefits of the Mantram Program in various populations. The current research focuses on benefits for managing psychological distress and promoting quality of life in Veterans. Future areas for research are suggested. ","89":"The continued evolution of military munitions and armor on the battlefield, as well as the insurgent use of improvised explosive devices, has led to embedded fragment wounds containing metal and metal mixtures whose long-term toxicologic and carcinogenic properties are not as yet known. Advances in medical care have greatly increased the survival from these types of injuries. Standard surgical guidelines suggest leaving embedded fragments in place, thus individuals may carry these retained metal fragments for the rest of their lives. Nursing professionals will be at the forefront in caring for these wounded individuals, both immediately after the trauma and during the healing and rehabilitation process. Therefore, an understanding of the potential health effects of embedded metal fragment wounds is essential. This review will explore the history of embedded fragment wounds, current research in the field, and Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines for the identification and long-term monitoring of individuals with embedded fragments. ","90":"The en route care environment is dynamic and requires constant innovation to ensure appropriate nursing care for combat casualties. Building on experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, there have been tremendous innovations in the process of transporting patients, including the movement of patients with spinal injuries. Advances have also been made in pain management and noninvasive monitoring, particularly for trauma and surgical patients requiring close monitoring of their hemodynamic and perfusion status. In addition to institutionalizing these innovations, future efforts are needed to eliminate secondary insults to patients with traumatic brain injuries and technologies to provide closed-loop sedation and ventilation. ","91":"As the only burn center in the Department of Defense, the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research is the primary location for care of service members with burn injuries. The combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan during the past decade have caused an increase in burn patients. As a result of this increased need, advancements in care were developed. The speed and precision of transporting patients from the battlefield to the burn center has improved over previous conflicts. Technological advancements to support treating complications of burn wound healing were leveraged and are now integrated into daily practice. Clinical decision support systems were developed and deployed at the burn center as well as to combat support hospitals in combat zones. Technology advancements in rehabilitation have allowed more service members to return to active duty or live productive civilian lives. All of these advancements were developed in a patient-centered, interdisciplinary environment where the nurses are integrated throughout the research process and clinical practice with the end goal of healing combat burns in mind. ","92":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops following exposure to a traumatic event. The prevalence and symptom severity of PTSD is greater in military combat Veterans than the civilian population. Although PTSD is a psychiatric disorder, in Veterans, it is associated with several physical comorbidities, chronic pain, substance abuse, and worse self-reported health status which may predispose them to greater perioperative morbidity and mortality. At present, the effect of surgery on the severity of PTSD is largely unknown. However, the perioperative clinician should consider PTSD a chronic illness associated with the accumulation of risk factors across the life span. ","93":"","94":"The health of skeletal muscle is promoted by optimal nutrition and activity\/exercise through the activation of molecular signaling pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) have been shown to modulate numerous biochemical processes including glucose uptake, gene expression, calcium signaling, and contractility. In pathological conditions, ROS\/RNS signaling excess or dysfunction contributes to contractile dysfunction and myopathy in skeletal muscle. Here we provide a brief review of ROS\/RNS chemistry and discuss concepts of ROS\/RNS signaling and its role in physiological and pathophysiological processes within striated muscle. ","95":"There are an estimated 13.7 million cancer survivors in the United States. Persistent and late effects of cancer therapy have contributed to an increased risk for co-morbid illness and higher all-cause mortality. Physical exercise is a targeted rehabilitative intervention following cancer therapy and a health promotion risk reduction intervention for patients as they transition into survivorship. This chapter provides a brief overview of the research on exercise and cancer survivor outcomes with a specific focus on randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the effects of exercise on body composition and bone health. There were 17 RCT trials that were identified with body composition outcomes. There was no change in weight in 16\/17 trials, 4 reported decreases in percent fat mass and 2 reported increases in lean mass. Eight exercise trials were identified with bone outcomes, two of which had pharmacologic comparison arms. These trials demonstrated preservation of bone in the intervention group compared with loss in the usual care or placebo control group. The majority of trials were with breast cancer survivors, the largest survivor group. Many are overweight or obese at diagnosis; weight gain continues to increase after therapy; and treatment is associated with bone loss. The findings of the 25 trials reviewed suggest that exercise maintains weight and bone mass in a high risk population. However, differences in design, measurement of body composition and bone mass and lack of targeted exercise to the specific outcomes warrants additional research to improve the quality of life for survivors. ","96":"People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are very sedentary and this contributes to their health problems. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of interventions designed to increase physical activity (PA) in people with COPD. Studies were included when PA was the primary outcome and measured objectively. Six databases were searched and 15 studies with a total of 761 subjects were identified that met inclusion criteria. Nine of the studies were quasi-experimental (QE) and six were randomized controlled trials (RCT). Interventions included pulmonary rehabilitation (n = 7), exercise only (n = 2), behavioral only (n = 2) and a combination of both behavioral and pulmonary rehabilitation\/exercise interventions (n = 4). Methodological quality was evaluated using the Downs and Black checklist. The quality of the pulmonary rehabilitation studies was the lowest with a fair rating and the quality of exercise only studies was the highest with a good rating. Eight of the 15 studies demonstrated statistically significant increases in PA: two pulmonary rehabilitation (QE = 2), two exercise only (RCT = 2), two behavioral only (RCT = 1, QE = 1), and two combined behavioral and pulmonary rehabilitation\/exercise (RCT = 2). The magnitude of increase was modest in all but one study; and in many studies the increase in PA was not clinically meaningful. Longer interventions demonstrated a higher success rate and only three studies examined longer term effects of the interventions. Existing interventions are promising, but the small number of randomized controlled trials makes it difficult to draw conclusion. Further research is needed to identify a range of interventions that are effective and could be used to promote PA in people with COPD. ","97":"Poorly controlled HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy, especially the use of protease inhibitors, are among the causes that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV (PLWH). Poor lifestyle choices (smoking, lack of physical activity, poor diet) and individual factors such as high stress, physical or emotional trauma, depression, and so forth contribute to the overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate the more recent aerobic and resistance exercise studies and their impact on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in PLWH. ","98":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming a serious health problem throughout the world and is one of the most potent known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is considered the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this cohort of patients. Additional independent risk factors for poor health outcomes among many include diabetes, physical inactivity and physical dysfunction. Physical inactivity partly contributes to the accelerated deterioration of physical function in people in all stages of CKD, to levels that significantly impact on clinically and patient important outcomes such as morbidity, employment, quality of life (QoL) and ultimately survival. Ongoing research aims to determine the effectiveness and impact of exercise rehabilitation on reducing\/managing the risk of CVD, alleviating physical function limitations, preventing disability and enhancing QoL. Current research also aims to elucidate the mechanisms via which exercise therapy may contribute to clinically relevant benefits. ","99":"Hispanics\/Latinos represent the largest, fastest growing, and youngest minority group in the United States. Although data suggest that most Hispanics\/Latinos in the United States tend to be in better health than non-Hispanic Whites (the so-called \"Hispanic Paradox\"), these relative advantages in health status decrease markedly with the number of years of residence in the United States. Hispanic women or Latinas, in general, report less than recommended levels of physical activity (PA), putting them at greater risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic illnesses associated with sedentary lifestyles. ","100":"Despite the known benefits of physical activity for older adults, adherence to regular physical activity recommendations is poor. Less than half of adults in this country meet physical activity recommendations with reasons for lack of adherence including such things as access, motivation, pain, fear, comorbidities, among others. To overcome these challenges, function-focused care was developed. Function-focused care is a philosophy of care that focuses on evaluating the older adult's underlying capability with regard to function and physical activity and helping him or her optimize and maintain physical function and ability and continually increase time spent in physical activity. Examples of function-focused care include such things as using verbal cues during bathing, so the older individual performs the tasks rather than the caregiver bathing the individual; walking a resident or patient to the bathroom rather than using a urinal, or taking a resident to an exercise class. There are now over 20 studies supporting the benefits of function-focused care approaches across all settings and different types of patient groups (i.e, those with mild versus moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment). The approaches for implementation of function-focused care have also been well supported and have moved beyond establishing effectiveness to considering dissemination and implementation of this approach into real world clinical settings. The process of dissemination and implementation has likewise been articulated and supported, and ongoing work needs to continue in this venue across all care settings. ","101":"Physical activities provide women a way to improve their health and intervene in disease processes during pregnancy. This chapter briefly describes pathophysiological models and then examines current research on the effects of physical activity on prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. The chapter then reviews cognitive behavioral theories and current literature on the effects of behavioral interventions on physical activity in pregnancy. The literature helps to explain the pathophysiological mechanisms through which physical activity mediates disease processes and the behavioral interventions through which physical activity can be introduced and sustained during pregnancy. Throughout the chapter, both pathophysiological models and behavioral theories are viewed as part of a socioecologic model that encompasses pregnancy and physical activity. ","102":"Engaging in regular physical activity is a key component for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing overweight and obesity. Obesity continues to be a concern globally, especially for women, and women are less physically active than men. This systematic review examined current research on physical activity interventions designed for healthy community dwelling women and assessed the effects of those interventions on physical activity and body composition. Three author-developed data collection tools were used to extract and examine study variables. For studies with suitable data, effect sizes were obtained. The initial search identified 1,406 titles published between 2000 and 2012, of which 40 randomized clinical trials met inclusion criteria. Of these 40 studies, 16 had a physical activity intervention that did not have a diet component and 24 had a physical activity intervention along with a diet component. The overall weighted mean effect was d = .21, 95% CI [0.06, 0.36] for physical activity outcomes (n = 18 studies) and d = -.16, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.09] for body composition outcomes (n = 24 studies). Both physical activity interventions without and with a diet component were effective in promoting physical activity and improving body composition. Physical activity interventions without a diet component were more effective than physical activity interventions with a diet component at promoting physical activity. The most effective interventions need to be adapted for dissemination into practice. ","103":"Overweight and obesity in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is now prevalent and accounts for significant health consequences, including cardiovascular complications and dual diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity and lifestyle are modifiable and play an important role in the prevention and management of excessive weight, but it is unclear how these factors relate to overweight and obese youth with T1D. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to examine how physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, and diet are related to overweight\/obesity in youth with T1D. Seven observational and intervention studies published between 1990 and 2013 were included in the review. Prevalence of overweight ranged from 12.5% to 33.3%. Overweight in youth with T1D was associated with infrequent napping, increased screen time, and skipping breakfast and dinner but was not related to time engaged in physical activity. Weight-related interventions indicated modest weight loss along with improved glycemic control. In light of this review, there is a need for high quality research that examines all levels of activity in youth with T1D to identify lifestyle modification targets for weight prevention and management. ","104":"The study of fever has provided important models in understanding the cells, chemical messengers, and anatomic structures that are involved in inflammation and thermoregulation as a result of infection, stress, or trauma. After contact with a pathogen or an inflammatory stimulus, cells are activated to produce endogenous pyrogens called cytokines. Cytokine functions include a cascade of nonspecific immune responses by target leukocytes and reticuloendothelial cells inducing the synthesis of acute phase proteins by the liver, direct pyrogenic activities via the supraoptic nuclei and the hypothalamus to increase the thermoregulatory set-point (and, thus, induce fever), and a wide spectrum of additional immune effects. ","105":"Animal models have been invaluable in the conduct of nursing research for the past 40 years. This review will focus on specific animal models that can be used in nursing research to study the physiologic phenomena of exercise and obesity when the use of human subjects is either scientifically premature or inappropriate because of the need for sampling tissue or the conduct of longitudinal studies of aging. There exists an extensive body of literature reporting the experimental use of various animal models, in both exercise science and the study of the mechanisms of obesity. Many of these studies are focused on the molecular and genetic mechanisms of organ system adaptation and plasticity in response to exercise, obesity, or both. However, this review will narrowly focus on the models useful to nursing research in the study of exercise in the clinical context of increasing performance and mobility, atrophy and bedrest, fatigue, and aging. Animal models of obesity focus on those that best approximate clinical pathology. ","106":"Nurses participate in humanitarian assistance following disasters throughout the world. Many have limited training or experience in this type of humanitarian aid. This chapter provides an overview and foundation of international humanitarian assistance for nurses to build upon to strengthen their participation in and contribution to these efforts. There is a growing sophistication and coordination of humanitarian assistance across many organizations and governments. This chapter reviews the research and resources that promote nurse participation in international disaster humanitarian assistance. ","107":"Health care workers (HCWs) are a critical component of the emergency management cycle (prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery). The potential for large numbers of injured from either a man-made or natural disaster has resulted in the development of surge capacity plans and attempts to predict how many HCWs will be available to respond. Since 1991 (with the majority of the research published in 2002 and later), researchers have been conducting studies to learn about the willingness, ability, and intentions of HCWs to respond to disasters. Potential and real barriers to disaster response are being explored as well. This chapter focuses on research authored or coauthored by nurses. Nurse-authored research is just a portion of the growing body of knowledge in this area; however, the findings are consistent with other published works. HCWs are more likely to be willing and able to respond to natural disasters and less likely to be willing and able during infectious outbreaks or incidents with potential exposure to harmful agents (biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological). HCW concerns include safety of self and family, availability of protective equipment, medicines and vaccines, and caretaking responsibilities (children, elders, and pets). ","108":"The beginning of the 21st century has been marked by an increase in attention to the quality of emergency and disaster response, particularly the preparedness of health workers of all kinds. The increase in natural disasters, civil unrest, and dislocation of populations has seen health workers mobilized. These workers are moving, both within countries and across borders, as members of long- organized teams such as the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), volunteers joining through a nongovernmental organization (NGO) such as a Red Cross\/Red Crescent unit, or individuals self-deploying to the scene of the emergency. Postevent evaluations have consistently identified the need for those responding to be able to join in an organized response that includes taking on assigned roles, communication through established channels and minimization of the number of \"SUVs\" or \"spontaneous unrequested volunteers.\" Although bystanders and self-deployed helpers (some with professional qualifications) are the first at any disastrous event, the subsequent response efforts are expected to be organized, efficient, and effective. This requires advance training of the responders. ","109":"It is clear that technology and informatics are becoming increasingly important in disasters and humanitarian response. Technology is a critical tool to recording, analyzing, and predicting trends in data that could not be achieved prior to its implementation. Informatics is the translation of this data into information, knowledge, and wisdom. Combining technology and informatics applications with response efforts has resulted in various enhanced biosurveillance efforts, advanced communications, and information management during disasters. Although these efforts have been well described in the literature, research on the impact of technology and informatics during these efforts has been limited. As a result, this chapter will provide an overview of these technology and informatics solutions and present suggestions for further research in an era when disaster and humanitarian response efforts continue to increase as well. A literature search was performed using PubMed search tools with the National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms of \"disasters,\" \"disaster planning,\" \"disaster medicine,\" \"technology,\" \"informatics,\" and \"research.\" Search limitations were set for 5 years and in English. Because of the limited number of research articles in this field, the MeSH term research was deleted. ","110":"Meeting the \"special needs\" of at-risk populations affected by disasters is of the utmost importance. In the United States, there are 54 million people who fit into the special needs category who are defined as handicapped, disabled, vulnerable, challenged, or having special needs. The paramount importance for the special needs population is maintaining human dignity throughout the disaster management cycle. Government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy organizations have all worked together to attempt to address and ensure that the needs of all individuals are addressed throughout the disaster cycle. Each provider and emergency responder should be familiar with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, but this alone does not begin to address the needs of children, the elderly, or other individuals and their special needs. There are multiple theoretical frameworks that may be useful, but the most human approach may be to consider needs based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. ","111":"Disaster mental health is defined as \"community and individual mental and behavioral health preparedness and response as well as other psychosocial and cultural factors\" (Hoffman et al., 2005, p. S141). The research included in this review was published between 2000 and 2011, capturing a snapshot of the last decade of relevant research on the psychological impact of disaster. The conceptual framework used to examine the research involves a population-based approach based on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels. Aspects of conducting mental health research, to include evidence-based approaches and disaster mental health outcome measurements postdisaster, are also included. The authors conclude the review by presenting implications and future recommendations for nursing practice and research related to the psychological impact of disasters on communities. ","112":"During disasters, health care providers are faced with limited resources, harsh environments, and an increased amount of sick and injured patients. These conditions sometimes require health care providers to deviate from existing treatment protocols. Deviating from these protocols results in a perception of increased legal risk for health care providers. This has led to a national debate regarding the necessity of establishing altered standards of care for health care providers during crisis events. This chapter explores the development of disaster preparedness, the issue of health care provider liability, and national and local efforts to protect providers in disaster situations. ","113":"Health care professionals have always faced the threat of catastrophic disaster and pandemic infectious illness but have continued to practice without adequately considering the ethical consequences of many of the decision-making tools we currently have in place. Lack of research on these ethical decisions in the face of disasters regarding the 3Rs-rationing (triage and allocating scarce resources), restrictions (quarantine and the denial of care based on some criteria or the magnitude of the disaster), and responsibility (duty to treat and duty to report for work)-will leave nurses to make decisions in the throws of disaster rather than before the crisis occurs. This chapter focuses on conducting ethically sound nursing research in disasters. A survey of the literature on the topic to include current research on the 3Rs, frameworks, and methodological problems will be examined. This chapter concludes with a call to action for the nursing profession to accept their role as patient advocates and drive the research necessary to avoid the ethical pitfalls seen in recent disaster decisions and scenarios. ","114":"Nurses serve as leaders in disaster preparedness and response at multiple levels: within their own homes and neighborhoods, at disaster scenes, and the workplace, which can vary from a health care facility, in the community, or at the state, national, or international level. This chapter provides an overview on theories of leadership with a historical context for nursing leadership; setting the context for nursing leadership in disaster preparedness and response. Although few research studies exist, there are numerous examples of nurses who provide leadership for disaster preparedness and response. To define the current state of the science, the research studies cited in this chapter are supplemented with case studies from particular disasters. The major finding of this review is that nursing leadership in disaster preparedness and response is a field of study that needs to be developed. ","115":"The potential for man-made or natural disasters is a reality that exists within the confines of the global setting. Man-made and\/or natural disasters, although devastating to the human population, offers researchers the ability to explore and advance current preparedness, response, and recovery practices. When conducting research, consideration must be given to the ethical treatment of vulnerable populations and the protection of privacy for those affected by the disaster. ","116":"The beta-chain hemoglobinopathies affect the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11 and comprise some of the most prevalent genetic disorders in humans, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. The mutations associated with these diseases cause various symptoms and degrees of severity. Extensive research has sought to identify physiologic and genetic factors responsible for these variations, including the role of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and its importance in the alleviation of symptoms. This chapter on the genomics of hemoglobinopathies addresses the interests of both the researcher and the caregiver. The pathophysiology of SCD and thalassemia are reviewed, as well as the state of the science on the regulation of HbF, including newly identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and suggested genetic mechanisms. Studies on the current therapies of hemoglobinopathies, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic, are also reviewed. Research reviews relevant to the care of children include physical and psychological sequelae, genetic counseling, and effects on learning. With a thorough understanding of the normal physiology of hemoglobin, the pathophysiology of SCD and the thalassemias, and the associated physical and psychological sequela, nurses can improve the quality of life for children and families living with these diseases.","117":"Significant maternal, fetal, and newborn morbidity and mortality can be attributed to complications of pregnancy. There are direct links between perinatal complications and poor fetal\/newborn development and impaired cognitive function, as well as fetal, newborn, and maternal death. Many perinatal complications have pathophysiologic mechanisms with a genetic basis. The objective of this chapter is to focus on perinatal genomics and the occurrence of two specific complications: preterm birth and dysfunctional placental phenotype. This chapter includes discussions of genetic variation, mutation and inheritance, gene expression, and genetic biomarkers in relation to preterm birth, in addition to the impact of maternal tobacco smoke exposure on placental phenotype. The concept of epigenetics is also addressed, specifically the regulation of gene expression in the placenta and fetal origins of adult health and disease. There is great potential for nurse-researchers to make valuable contributions to perinatal genomics investigations, but this requires perseverance, increased genetics-based understanding and skills, as well as multidisciplinary mentorship.","118":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially life-shortening autosomal recessive genetic condition resulting in chronic progressive respiratory involvement, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, and male infertility It is the most common autosomal inherited condition in the white population, and its presence is recorded with varying prevalence across ethnicities. Since the 1989 discovery of the genetic variant F508del, the most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation, more than 1900 CF mutations have been identified. The 1997 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Statement on Cystic Fibrosis, along with 2001 and 2005 recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), provide the basis for population CF carrier screening in the prenatal setting. Recommendations for newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis were released in 2004, with NBS programs in the United States initiated thereafter. With the wide variety of CFTR mutations and mutation combinations, there is not a clear understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlations or of the anticipated clinical trajectory for an individual who has identified CFTR mutations. This ambiguity creates challenges for patients and families in decision making related to CFTR carrier screening during the prenatal period, understanding the results of newborn screening for CF, or coping with the new genetic knowledge obtained. This literature review examines research regarding genetic testing for CF as it related to population screening. Patient and family issues from both the prenatal period and newborn testing are reviewed. Opportunities for future nursing research and implication for nursing practice are discussed.","119":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an inherited, chronic disorder with long-term complications; including cardiovascular disease the leading cause of mortality in the United States. The prevalence of T2DM and its complications are on the rise in the United States, highlighting the need for improved individualized prevention and treatment strategies. Exciting advancements in the field of genomics has led to the recent discovery of numerous genetic markers for T2DM; completing a promising first step toward improved, individualized prevention and treatment strategies for T2DM. These genomic markers, identified using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), candidate gene, and rare variant methodology, identify new physiologic pathways underlying the development of T2DM. Much more work is needed to successfully translate the identification of genetic markers for T2DM into improved, individualized prevention and treatment strategies. As front line providers and leaders of prevention and treatment strategies for chronic disease, nurses, nurse practitioners, and nurse scientists must contribute to this translational effort. Thus, it is important for nurses at all levels to (a) be aware of the current science of genetics and T2DM and (b) participate in the translation of this genetic information into improved, personalized patient care. The aim of this review is to (a) provide an overview of the current state of the science of genetic markers and T2DM and (b) highlight essential next steps to successfully translate the identification of genetic markers for T2DM into improved prevention and treatment strategies; focusing particularly on the role of nursing in this process.","120":"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal discomfort\/pain, and heartburn are ubiquitous and as such are often the focus of nursing interventions. The etiologies of these symptoms include GI pathology (e.g., cancer, inflammation), dietary factors (e.g., lactose intolerance), infection, stress, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, medications, as well as a host of diseases outside the GI tract. This review focuses on a common condition (irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]) that is linked with both bowel pattern and abdominal discomfort\/pain symptoms. Family and twin studies give evidence for a role of genetic factors in IBS. Whether genes are directly associated with IBS or influence disease risk indirectly by modulating the response to environmental factors remains unknown at this time. Given the multifactorial nature of IBS, it is unlikely that a single genetic factor is responsible for IBS. In addition, gene-gene (epistatic) interactions are also likely to play a role. Four genes coding for proteins involved in neurotransmission (i.e., the serotonin reuptake transporter [SERT], tryptophan hydroxylase [TPH], alpha2-adrenergic receptor [alpha2-ADR], catechol-o-methyl transferase [COMT]) and their potential relevance to GI symptoms and IBS will be reviewed. Further research using genome-wide association approaches with samples well characterized by ethnicity and standardized symptom subgrouping is needed.","121":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and the prevalence of GDM is increasing worldwide. Short- and long-term complications of GDM on mothers and fetuses are well-recognized. These include more than seven-fold higher risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life in women with GDM than those without. Evidence supports that GDM shares several risk factors with T2DM, including genetic risks. This chapter reviewed studies on candidate genes shared by T2DM and GDM published from 1990 to 2011. At least 20 susceptible genes of T2DM have been studied in women with GDM in various races. Results from current association studies on T2DM susceptible genes in GDM have shown significant heterogeneity There may be primary evidence that polymorphisms of susceptible genes of T2DM such as transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene, potassium channel voltage-gate KQT-like subfamily member 1 (KCNQ1) gene, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) gene, may increase risk of GDM. Associations between GDM and many genetic variants have led to different findings across populations. Many genetic polymorphisms related to GDM were investigated in a single study or a single population. Replication studies to verify contributions of both common and rare genetic variants for GDM and T2DM in specific racial\/ethnic groups are needed.","122":"In the past 25 years, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of genomics and its influence on central nervous system diseases. In this chapter, common diseases of the central nervous system will be reviewed along with the genomics associated with these diseases. The diseases\/injuries that will be investigated include neurovascular disorders such as ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury. This chapter will also explore Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a 299-aminoacid protein encoded by the APOE gene, and its associations with many of the previously named diseases. APOE was first tied to the risk of Alzheimer's disease and has since then been investigated in traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic strokes. In addition, we will discuss the future of genomic research in central nervous system diseases.","123":"The regulation of hypertrophy or atrophy of skeletal muscle is highly regulated by genetic signals closely tied to function. This chapter focuses on the genetic alteration of structural and cytoskeletal proteins that influence exercise capacity, self-care, and activities of daily living by modulation of the physiologic cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle. In addition to a discussion of genetic mechanisms of atrophy and sarcopenia, the muscular dystrophies along with the laminopathies, both diseases of cytoskeletal proteins will be reviewed.","124":"Scientific advances in genetics and genomics are rapidly redefining our understanding of health and illness and creating a significant shift in practice for all health care disciplines. Nurses educated at the graduate level are well-prepared to assume clinical and leadership roles in health care systems and must also be prepared to assume similar roles related to genetic\/genomic health care. This chapter describes the processes used to create a consensus document identifying the genetic\/genomic competencies essential for nurses prepared at the graduate level. Three groups were involved in the competency development; a steering committee provided leadership and used qualitative methods to review and analyze pertinent source documents and create an initial competency draft; an advisory board evaluated and revised the draft, and a consensus panel refined and validated the final set of competencies. The concensus process resulted in 38 competencies organized under the following categories: risk assessment and interpretation; genetic education, counseling, testing and results interpretation; clinical management; ethical, legal, and social implications; professional role; leadership, and research. These competencies apply to all individuals functioning at the graduate level in nursing, including but not limited to advanced practice registered nurses, clinical nurse leaders, nurse educators, nurse administrators, and nurse scientists and are intended to inform and guide their practice.","125":"Discovery of the genetics\/genomics underpinnings of health, risk for disease, sickness, and treatment response have the prospects of improving recognition and management of at risk individuals; improving screening, prognostics, and therapeutic decision-making; expanding targeted therapies; and improving the accuracy of medication dosing and selection based on drug metabolism genetic variation. Thus, genetics\/genomics science, information, and technologies influence the entire health care continuum and are fundamental to the nursing profession. Translating the benefits of genetics and genomics into health care requires that nurses are knowledgeable about and able to integrate this information and technology into their practice. This chapter explores the development of essential nursing competences in genetics and genomics and outcome indicators. Included is an overview of projects aimed at measuring and\/or supporting adoption and integration of such competencies. Included as well is an update reviewing current evidence of the state of genomics nursing education in the United States and recommendations for next steps.","126":"The intersection of the genomic era and information age has created novel ethical, legal, and social issues that may be beyond the reach of existing guidelines for children and adolescents in research. By taking the opportunity to stop, to look, and to listen, nurses are in an ideal situation to help children, adolescents, and families understand these emerging and important issues. This chapter thus reviews and highlights the issues and challenges that arise when children and adolescents are involved in genomic research. First, we stop and review existing guidelines for the protection of individual children and adolescents in research and existing gaps and inconsistencies in their implementation. Then we take a closer look at the unique features of genetic and genomic research that create particular ethical challenges for completing the informed consent process when the research participant is a child or adolescent. Finally, we challenge nurses to listen more intently to what children and their families need to know before they are included in genetic and genomic research. We emphasize the changing context of children's lives today and the emergence of their decision-making skills.","127":"Newborn dried blood spot screening (NBS) is a core public health service and is the largest application of genetic testing in the United States. NBS is conducted by state public health departments to identify infants with certain genetic, metabolic, and endocrine disorders. Screening is performed in the first few days of life through blood testing. Several drops of blood are taken from the baby's heel and placed on a filter paper card. The dried blood, on the filter cards, is sent from the newborn nursery to the state health department laboratory, or a commercial partner, where the blood is analyzed. Scientific and technological advances have lead to a significant expansion in the number of tests-from an average of 6 to more than 50--and there is a national trend to further expand the NBS program. This rapid expansion has created significant ethical, legal, and social challenges for the health care system and opportunity for scholarly inquiry to address these issues. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the NBS programs and to provide an in-depth examination of two significant concerns raised from expanded newborn screening, specifically false-positives and lack of information for parents. Implications for nursing research in managing these ethical dilemmas are discussed.","128":"Animal models are a critical component of biomedical and biobehavioral research and have contributed to the exponential expansion of our understanding of human disease. Now, as we move onward into the era of genetics and genomics research, the importance of animal models to the research process will become even more acute as we explore the significance of genetic differences that are found in the presence and absence of disease. The decision to use an animal model is not one that can be taken lightly; but, rather, requires careful thought and consideration. In this review, we will address (a) why we should consider using animal models, (b) several caveats that are associated with using animals for research, and (c) some of the common genetic tools that are used in animal research.","129":"As the application of genomic information and technology crosses the horizon of health care into our everyday lives, expanding genomic knowledge continues to affect how health care services are defined and delivered. Genomic discoveries have led to enhanced clinical capabilities to predict susceptibility to common diseases and conditions such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Hundreds of genetic tests are now available that can identify individuals who carry one or more gene mutations that increase their risk of developing cancer or other common diseases. Increased availability and direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic testing is moving genetic testing away from trained genetics health professionals and into the hands of primary care providers and consumers. Genetic tests available on the Internet are being directly marketed to individuals, who can order these tests and receive a report of their risk for numerous health conditions and diseases. Health care providers are expected to interpret these test results, evaluate their accuracy, address the psychosocial consequences of those distressed by receiving their results, and translate genomic information into effective care. However, as we move two steps forward, we are also moving one step backward because many health care providers are unprepared for this genomic revolution. A number of international education, practice, and policy efforts are underway to address the challenges health care providers face in providing competent genomic health care in the context of unprecedented access to information, technology, and global communication. Efforts to integrate standard of care guidelines into electronic medical records increases health care providers' access to information for individuals at risk fo or diagnosed with a genomic condition. Development of genomic competencie for health care providers has led to increased genomic content in academic pro grams. These and other efforts will keep the state of genomic health care stepping forward as we face the challenges of health care in the genomic era.","130":"Using bioinformatics computational tools, network maps that integrate the complex interactions of genetics and diseases have been developed. The purpose of this review is to introduce the reader to new approaches in understanding disease-gene associations using network maps, with an emphasis on how the human disease network (HDN) map (or diseasome) was constructed. A search was conducted in PubMed using the years 1999-2011 and using key words diseasome, molecular interaction, interactome, protein-protein interaction, and gene. The information reviewed included journal reviews, open source and web-based databases, and open source computational tools. A review of the literature revealed the complexity of molecular, genetic, and protein structures that contribute to cellular function and possible disease, and how network mapping can help the clinician and scientist gain a better understanding of this complexity Using computational tools and databases of genetics, protein interactions, and diseases, scientists have developed a network map of human genes and human diseases referred to as a diseasome. The diseasome is composed of 22 disease classes represented in different colored circular nodes. Lines connecting nodes indicate shared genes among diseases. Thus, the diseasome map provides a colorfully visual display that helps the user conceptualize gene-disease relationships. This review provides an overview of the use of network maps to understand the interrrelationships of genomics and disease. One such map, the diseasome, could be used as a reference for biomedical researchers and multidiscipline health care providers, including nurse practitioners and genetic counselors, to enhance their conceptualization and understanding of the genetic origins of disease.","131":"Scientific advances in genetics and genomics will be incorporated into health care soon. The tailoring of treatment to an individual's genetic make up has been termed personalized medicine. These advances are promising and are receiving significant attention; however, many nurses are caught in the gap between technologic advances and clinical diffusion and uptake. Aiming to reduce this gap, this chapter provides an overview of the science driving personalized medicine, outlines areas of research and clinical translation where nurses may expect to see its fruits, and briefly identifies obstacles preventing its full realization. Four scientific elements of personalized medicine are described: (1) discovery of novel biology that guides clinical translation mechanisms, (2) genetic risk assessment, (3) molecular diagnostic technology, and (4) pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Successful design and implementation of Personalized Medicine will hinge on the roles of nurses conducting or participating in collaborative initiatives that are furthering genetic\/genomic applications within these contexts.","132":"Genetic and genomic research approaches have the capability to expand our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of disease susceptibility, susceptibility to complications related to disease, trajectory of recovery from acquired injuries and infections, patient response to interventions and therapeutics, as well as informing diagnoses and prognoses. Nurse scientists are actively involved in all of these fields of inquiry, and the goal of this chapter is to assist with incorporation of genetic and genomic trajectories into their research and facilitate the design and execution of these studies. New studies that are going to embark on recruitment, phenotyping, and sample collection will benefit from forethought about research design to ensure that it addresses the research questions or hypotheses being tested. Studies that will use existing data or samples will also benefit from forethought about research design for the same reason but will also address the fact that some designs may not be feasible with the available data or samples. This chapter discusses candidate gene association, genome-wide association, candidate gene expression, global gene expression, and epigenetic\/epigenomic study designs. Information provided includes rationale for selecting an appropriate study design, important methodology considerations for each design, key technologies available to accomplish each type of study, and online resources available to assist in executing each type of study design.","133":"","134":"The purpose of this chapter is to present an analysis of selected published nursing workforce studies published between the years of 2005 and 2010. Thirteen nursing workforce studies were reviewed and analyzed using a modification of the method suggested by Ganong (1987). Nursing workforce studies were selected based on the following criteria: (1) the date of publication was between the years of 2005 and 2010; (2) the primary focus was on nurses working in practice; or, as students or faculty in nursing educational programs. When reviewed, the 13 studies (1) lacked uniform measures among databases; (2) lacked longitudinal studies that followed the respondent over time from the beginning of their career to retirement; (3) had response rates that contributed to small sample sizes or sampling frame that did not take into consideration all characteristics of interest; (4) lacked attention to an interdisciplinary mix of providers; and (5) implied the need for future study on intergenerational characteristics due to shifting demographics in the profession and nursing workforce.","135":"This chapter presents the findings of an integrative review of the literature to identify current practices related to patient classification systems (PCSs). We sought to determine if there was a \"gold standard\" PCS that could be adopted or adapted for use by nurse leaders in practice. Sixty-three articles reporting studies related to PCS, Patient Acuity Systems or Workload Management Systems from 1983 to 2010 and applicable for inpatient medical\/surgical settings were reviewed. Generally, we found that many of the criticisms of earlier PCSs are still evident: (1) difficulties with measuring workload remain an overarching theme throughout the literature; (2) definitions and descriptions of nursing work continue to be deemed inadequate; (3) there is insufficient evidence of reliability and validity testing of PCSs; and (4) there is still a need to identify nursing sensitive performance indicators and outcomes. We identified characteristics of promising PCSs, but concluded that no consensus exists about PCSs. We suggest that any approach to predicting staffing should seek to be parsimonious, minimize additional workload, be based on expert nurse judgment, be a true reflection of nursing work, and include indicators that measure patient complexity, required nursing care, available resources, and relevant organizational attributes.","136":"The evolution of standardized nursing languages (SNLs) has been occurring for more than four decades. The importance of this work continues to be acknowledged as an effective strategy to delineate professional nursing practice. In today's health care environment, the demand to deliver cost-effective, safe, quality patient care is an essential mandate embedded in all health reform policies. Communicating the contributions of professional nursing practice to other nurses, health providers, and other members of the health care team requires the articulation of nursing's focus of concern and responses to these concerns to improve patient outcomes. The visibility of the electronic health record (EHR) in practice settings has accelerated the need for nursing to communicate its practice within the structure of the electronic format. The integration of SNLs into the patient record offers nurses an opportunity to describe the focus of their practice through the identification of nursing diagnosis, interventions and outcomes (IOM, 2010). Continued development, testing, and refinement of SNLs offers nursing an accurate and reliable way to use data elements across populations and settings to communicate nursing practice, enable nursing administrators and leaders in health care to delineate needed resources, cost out nursing care with greater precision, and design new models of care that reflect nurse-patient ratios and patient acuity that are data driven (Pesut &amp; Herman, 1998). The continued use of nursing languages and acceleration of nursing research using this data can provide the needed evidence to help link nursing knowledge to evidence-driven, cost-effective, quality outcomes that more accurately reflect nursing's impact on patient care as well as the health care system of which they are a part. The evaluation of research to support the development, use, and continued refinement of nursing language is critical to research and the transformation of patient care by nurses on a global level.","137":"The focus of this chapter is to highlight practice exemplars and research findings related to the five components of the new Magnet Model. A brief overview of the historical development and professional evolution of the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Magnet Recognition Program is presented followed by a brief overview of the original fourteen forces of magnetism. Content related to empirical practice-based research framed under the components of transformational leadership; structural empowerment; exemplary professional practice; new knowledge, innovation, and improvement; and empirical outcomes is presented and discussed. The authors provide key findings from scholarly publications and describe how the findings contribute to the creation of work environments based on the tenets of magnetism. The chapter concludes with a brief over of the ANCC Pathway to Excellence Program.","138":"Nurses' working conditions are inextricably linked to the quality of care that is provided to patients and patients' safety. These same working conditions are associated with health and safety outcomes for nurses and other health care providers. This chapter describes aspects of the nursing work environment that have been linked to hazards and adverse exposures for nurses, as well as the most common health and safety outcomes of nursing work. We include studies from 2000 to the present by nurse researchers, studies of nurses as subjects, and studies of workers under similar working conditions that could translate to nurses' work environment. We explore a number of work organization factors including shift work and extended work hours, safety climate and culture, teamwork, and communication. We also describe environmental hazards, including chemical hazards (e.g., waste anesthetics, hazardous drugs, cleaning compounds) and airborne and bloodborne pathogen exposure. Nurses' health and safety outcomes include physical (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal, slips, trips and falls, physical assault) and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., burnout, work-family conflict). Finally, we present recommendations for future research to further protect nurses and all health care workers from a range of hazardous working conditions.","139":"Interdisciplinary collaboration is critical to excellence in patient care delivery. There is a growing consensus that the basic education for all clinical professionals should include the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to effectively participate in interdisciplinary teams, and that health care organizations should continue this education in the practice setting. The authors examine the large and growing evidence base regarding interdisciplinary collaboration and teamwork and explore the relationship between interdisciplinary collaboration and patient, workforce, and organizational outcomes. Antecedents and attributes of the construct are presented, as well as structures, models, and programs that are being implemented by health care organizations and academic settings to facilitate and advance interdisciplinary collaboration in clinical practice.","140":"In the complex health care workplace of nurses, intra\/interprofessional ideals intersect with the expectations of patients, families, students, and coworkers in a context of managed care environments, academia, and other health care enterprises. Integral to quality assessment, management, and assurance is collegial and respectful communication. Decades of reported descriptive and anecdotal data on intra\/inter professional and on client communication, describe the antithesis of these ideals. Specifically, increasing frequency and rates of persistent bullying, harassment, or horizontal violence (BHHV) have shown to yield detrimental effects on workplace satisfaction, workforce retention, and the psychological and physical health of nurses as well as implied effects on quality of patient care and risk of poor health outcomes. Persistent BHHV among nurses is a serious concern. In advancing the science of description and explanation to a level of prevention intervention, explanatory models from biology, developmental psychology, intra\/interpersonal interactionism are described along with theoretical explanations for the prevalence of BHHV in nurse workplaces. Making the connection between explanatory models and creative solutions to address BHHV through multiple levels of behavioral influence such as individual, environmental, interpersonal, and cultural contexts is key to advancing the science of the relationship between professional behavior and client\/family\/community health care outcomes.","141":"Migration has been a way of life since the beginning of time, with migrants seeking other lands for personal and professional betterment. Today, in an era of globalization, trade agreements and technological advances, an increase in migration is inevitable. All professions have been affected, but the migration of health professionals, particularly nurses, has been the most dramatic. However, the migration of nurses across national and international borders comes with many challenges: systematic tracking of migration flows, harmonization of standards, recognition of professional credentials, fair and equitable distribution of the global health care workforce, and the effect of migration on the health care infrastructure of both source and destination countries. The international migration of nurses to address shortages in developed countries has, in some instances, left source countries with insufficient resources to address their own health care needs. The increasing complexity of health care delivery, aging of the population and the nursing workforce, and the escalating global demand for nurses create on-going challenges for policy makers. Strategically addressing global nursing workforce issues is paramount to sustaining the health of nations.","142":"The purpose of this chapter is to examine to and synthesize nursing workforce research and policy initiatives at the state level. An integrative literature review was systematically conducted using Ganong's Stages of an Integrative Research Review (1987). Searches were limited to English-language publications in the years from 2000 to 2010 which focused on workforce issues in the United States. A total of 155 published articles were included in this review. Overall, the literature indicated that significant research is examining nursing workforce issues and that states are actively engaged in policy initiatives to address nursing workforce issues, particularly those related to a shortage of nurses and faculty. The findings also indicated a major disconnect between nursing workforce research and patient outcomes research. Recommendations include connecting research and policy links between nursing workforce research and patient outcomes research and creating clear correlations to system-level determinants of quality Additional implications for further research are provided which include the important role of nurse researchers in connecting nursing care and nurse staffing to processes and outcome measures, which demonstrate the financial impact upon health care.","143":"Health workforce researchers routinely conduct studies to determine whether a profession is currently in short supply and whether future shortages are likely. This is particularly important for registered nursing since the profession has experienced periodic shortages over the past three decades. Registered nurse (RN) forecast studies can be valuable in quantifying supply and demand gaps and identifying the most appropriate strategies to avert future shortages. In order to quantify RN supply\/demand gaps, it is important to have accurate data on RNs, including the number of active RNs as well as their demographic, education, and practice characteristics, and work location(s). A lack of relevant and timely data on the nursing workforce is a significant barrier to identifying where nursing shortages exist, where they are most severe, and determining the factors that contribute to them. This lack of understanding impedes the development of effective health workforce programs and policies to mitigate shortages and the ability to evaluate these programs and policies for effectiveness. This study describes the national data sources available to nursing researchers to study the supply and distribution of the RN workforce and assesses the sources' strengths and limitations. This study also explores the potential for using state-level data for nursing workforce research.","144":"Job satisfaction is an extremely important concept that influences a nurse's decision to stay in an organization, as well as the cost of turnover and the nursing shortage. The purpose of this review is to identify published research studies that have assessed job satisfaction and retention (intent to stay) in military nurses serving in the Army, Navy, or Air Force. The available literature was searched from 1980 to 2010 and the review resulted in 21 studies. The majority of the studies used 2 descriptive correlational design and was specific to one particular service. The researchers reported several satisfiers such as strong sense of teamwork, favorable work environments, pay and benefits, promotional opportunities, leadership and management experiences offered to junior officers. One of the major dissatisfiers was the lack of support from leadership. Nurse researchers must expand the retention science with robust longitudinal interventional studies. Nurse researchers are well positioned to provide military nurse leaders with the best possible evidence to address issues and make decisions regarding nurse retention.","145":"In 1977, the federal government launched the nation's largest and most significant program to collect data on the registered nurse (RN) workforce of the United States-the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN). This survey is conducted by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration, first in 1977 and then every 4 years since 1980. This article offers the history of the NSSRN and a review of the ways in which the NSSRN data have been used to examine education, demographics, employment, shortages, and other aspects of the RN workforce. The influence this body of research has had on policymaking is explored. Recommendations for future research are offered, in the hope that future waves of the NSSRN will continue to be used to their fullest potential.","146":"Nurse scientists have made important contributions to evidence-based practice in tobacco control. This chapter will discuss recent tobacco control developments in the United States and globally, such as legislation giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory authority over tobacco products manufacturing, marketing and sales, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and a brief review of research that has guided policy advances and nursing research in tobacco control. Suggestions for future research based on the update of the U.S. Public Health Services Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence clinical practice guideline will be explored. These developments offer nursing researchers a wealth of opportunities and challenges to advance nursing and tobacco control knowledge, address research gaps, and bring a unique nursing perspective to tobacco use prevention, reduction of exposure to secondhand smoke, tobacco dependence treatment, and tobacco control policies. Additionally, we will address how nursing scholarship can and should be supported by academic and organizational leadership to support nurses in realizing their full potential in mitigating the global epidemic of tobacco-caused death and disease.","147":"Secondhand smoke (SHS) is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States and a major source of indoor air pollution, accounting for an estimated 53,000 deaths per year among nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke exposure varies by gender, race\/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The most effective public health intervention to reduce SHS exposure is to implement and enforce smoke-free workplace policies that protect entire populations including all workers regardless of occupation, race\/ethnicity, gender, age, and socioeconomic status. This chapter summarizes community and population-based nursing research to reduce SHS exposure. Most of the nursing research in this area has been policy outcome studies, documenting improvement in indoor air quality, worker's health, public opinion, and reduction in Emergency Department visits for asthma, acute myocardial infarction among women, and adult smoking prevalence. These findings suggest a differential health effect by strength of law. Further, smoke-free laws do not harm business or employee turnover, nor are revenues from charitable gaming affected. Additionally, smoke-free laws may eventually have a positive effect on cessation among adults. There is emerging nursing science exploring the link between SHS exposure to nicotine and tobacco dependence, suggesting one reason that SHS reduction is a quit smoking strategy. Other nursing research studies address community readiness for smoke-free policy, and examine factors that build capacity for smoke-free policy. Emerging trends in the field include tobacco free health care and college campuses. A growing body of nursing research provides an excellent opportunity to conduct and participate in community and population-based research to reduce SHS exposure for both vulnerable populations and society at large.","148":"Nurses have been at the forefront of initiatives to improve patient outcomes through systems change. Nursing research addressing systems approaches to treatment of tobacco dependence has demonstrated increased implementation of evidence-based practice guidelines. Existing health system research conducted by nurse scientists has focused on four strategies: tobacco use identification systems, education and training of nursing staff to deliver tobacco intervention, dedicated staff for tobacco dependence treatment in both acute and primary care settings, and institutional policies to support tobacco intervention. Nursing involvement in multidisciplinary health services research focusing on tobacco treatment has lagged behind advances in clinical nursing research of individual-focused smoking cessation interventions. Health information technology shows promise as part of an integrated approach to systems changes to support tobacco intervention, particularly in light of the current national emphasis on adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records. Future directions for translational research present unprecedented opportunity for nurse scientists to respond to the call for policy and systems changes to support tobacco treatment.","149":"Smoking is responsible for approximately one in five deaths in the United States per year. The Surgeon General's 1964 report first linked smoking as a cause of cancer. Since then cigarette smoking has had a steady decline to its current estimate of 19.8%. There are, however, some special populations where smoking continues to occur at a higher prevalence than the general population. This chapter discusses tobacco dependence among the following special populations: low socioeconomic status including Medicaid, hard-core smokers, rural, and homeless; immigrants; and persons living with HIV. For each population, there is an overview of the disparities in tobacco use, special challenges unique to that population, and exploration of current research on tailoring of tobacco dependence treatment. Each of the special populations discussed present unique challenges with tobacco dependence treatment that will require careful examination before disparities will ultimately decrease. Eliminating disparities has been marked as an important research agenda item as noted in Healthy People 2010. Nurse researchers are well positioned to combine their clinical expertise and knowledge of patient psychosocial needs with investigation of patient-focused research questions in each of these special populations.","150":"The prevalence of tobacco use and dependence among those with psychiatric and\/or substance use disorders is exceptionally high, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the findings conducted by nurses regarding smoking and mental health. A search of the available literature since 1950 resulted in a review of 17 studies authored or coauthored by nurses. Most study designs were descriptive with only one investigator reporting the results of a small clinical trial. In addition to documenting smoking patterns in this population, investigators found that many psychiatric nurses assessed their clients for tobacco use and advised them to stop smoking but few intervened intensively to aid cessation. Psychiatric nurses reported low efficacy for delivering interventions and considerable doubt about their clients' abilities and motivation to stop smoking. Although some desired additional training in tobacco dependence interventions, nurses reported feeling ethically conflicted about, and were inconsistently supportive of, system level interventions such as tobacco free health care settings. It is likely that these findings, as well as the paucity of tobacco dependence studies, reflect the relatively small number of psychiatric nurses conducting research as well as the inattention, until recently, of mental health leaders, policy makers, and funders to the importance of tobacco dependence research in this clinical population. As tobacco dependence treatment for those with mental illnesses and\/or addictive disorders becomes more of a public health priority, opportunities abound for nurse researchers to contribute to the growing evidence in this often neglected area.","151":"Worldwide, tobacco use continues to be the most significant preventable cause of death and hospital admissions, particularly related to respiratory diseases. Acute respiratory illnesses requiring hospitalization provide an opportunity for nurses to intervene and help smokers quit. Of the three top hospital admissions related to respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the one that continues to have increased mortality whereas community acquired pneumonia and asthma have decreased over the past 5 years. The course of all three can be caused or exacerbated by continued smoking. This review describes the state of the science of nursing research focused on tobacco cessation interventions for hospitalized patients with COPD, asthma, or community acquired pneumonia. Additionally, we describe two evidence-based, nurse-driven, hospital protocols to treat tobacco dependence that can serve as models of care. Recommendations are made as to how to effectively promote nursing interventions for tobacco cessation in the acute care setting.","152":"Smoking cessation is essential after the diagnosis of cancer to improve clinical outcomes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a systematic review of research on smoking cessation in the context of cancer care with an emphasis on nursing contributions to the field. Data sources included research reports of smoking cessation interventions conducted in people with cancer. Nineteen primary studies were reviewed. High intensity interventions, targeting multiple behaviors, and\/or using a multicomponent intervention that included pharmacotherapy, behavioral counseling, and social support were characteristics of the most successful treatments for tobacco dependence. The majority of interventions were conducted in adults with smoking-related malignancies during acute phases of illness. The most striking finding was that more than one half of the studies tested the efficacy of nurse-delivered interventions. Conceptual and methodological issues that can be improved in future studies include: using theoretical frameworks to specify how the intervention will affect outcomes, ensuring adequate sample sizes, using biochemical verification to monitor smoking outcomes, and using standardized outcome measures of abstinence. Although effective interventions are available for healthy populations, further research is needed to determine if tailored cessation interventions are needed for patients with cancer. To provide optimal quality care it is imperative that delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions be integrated into the cancer treatment trajectory. Multiple barriers, including patient and nurse attitudes toward smoking and lack of knowledge related to tobacco treatment, prevent translating evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment into clinical practice. Further nursing research is needed to address these barriers.","153":"Smoking is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This chapter provides an overview of a program of nursing research relevant to tobacco use in patients with CVD. The Women's Initiative for Nonsmoking (WINS) provides a rich demonstration of a key randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the efficacy of smoking cessation in women. The National Institutes of Health priority for data mining of existing RCTs is demonstrated in the numerous presentations of findings from secondary papers from WINS that answer additional research questions relevant to smoking cessation, including the influence of depression on smoking, myths about and underuse of nicotine replacement therapy. The methodological and logistical challenges inherent in tobacco intervention studies are presented, including a discussion of research needed in the measurement of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, the role and contributions of nurses serving on the federal guideline development process are highlighted. International research activities of the coauthors from Jordan and Korea are also presented, including a discussion of the need for research in waterpipe use.","154":"Tobacco use during pregnancy and postpartum is a leading cause of preventable morbidities for women and their infants. Over the past two decades, nursing research has addressed this recalcitrant clinical problem from a variety of conceptual and methodological perspectives. The 64 published studies (1988-2009) that met inclusion criteria for this systematic review represent the full research trajectory from concept development to intervention testing. Meta-analysis demonstrated an overall significant trend in nursing intervention efficacy (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08-1.2) for studies that examined comparable prenatal and postpartum smoking cessation outcomes. Implications for future nursing research and evidence-based policy are presented.","155":"The childhood years represent a critical time for tobacco experimentation and addiction. This chapter presents risk factors for youth smoking, state of the science of nurse-led primary and secondary tobacco prevention research in youth, and implications for future research, policy, and practice. Nursing research on both primary and secondary tobacco prevention efforts that are school-based, family-based, and community-based are presented. Interventions, including both state and community approaches, and media and policy endeavors to prevent tobacco use and foster successful cessation are discussed. The nursing profession has made an impact on primary and secondary prevention in youth regarding tobacco; however, much remains to be accomplished. As one of the largest health care professions, nurses should seize the important opportunity of positively impacting the health of children and youth through comprehensive and effective primary and secondary tobacco prevention efforts.","156":"The purpose of this chapter on biological models for studying and assessing tobacco use is to provide an introduction to some of the common concepts and biomarkers in this arena to ultimately inform intervention research by nurse scientists. An overview of selected biomarkers of tobacco exposure in individuals includes exhaled carbon monoxide, cotinine (the proximate metabolite of nicotine), and measurement of an individual's puffing pattern termed smoking topography. Common tobacco contents discussed include tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) some of which increase disease risk including cancer. Exemplars of additives to cigarettes by the tobacco industry will be described including menthol, one additive marketed by the industry. Genetics and tobacco addiction has emerged as a rapidly expanding field. Illustrative of this area are twin studies, nicotinic receptors, CYP2A6 polymorphisms, and genes that impact dopamine receptors. The cadre of nurse scientists conducting research in this much needed area is small. The opportunity for nurse scientists educated in biological inquiry in tobacco-related research is great. Nurse scientists actively involved in multidisciplinary translational teams to address nicotine addition are needed.","157":"Qualitative research methods are increasingly used by nurse scientists to explore a wide variety of topics relevant to practice and\/or health policy issues. The purpose of this chapter is to review the contributions of nurse scientists to the field of tobacco control through the use of qualitative research methods. A systematic literature search strategy was used to identify 51 articles published between 1980 and 2008. The majority (84%) of reviewed articles were authored by North American nurse scientists. Cessation was the most commonly (85%) studied aspect of tobacco control. Six qualitative research approaches were used: qualitative descriptive (55%), narrative analysis (8%), phenomenology (6%), grounded theory (14%), ethnography (12%), and case study (6%). Qualitative descriptive methods were primarily one-off studies to address practical problems or issues encountered in practice, and often validated current understandings related to tobacco. Researchers who used other types of qualitative methods and who conducted qualitative studies as part of programs of research were more likely to make more substantive contributions to the evolving field of tobacco control. These contributions related to how smoking intertwines with personal and social identities, the influence of social context on tobacco use, and nurses' involvement in tobacco control (both of their own tobacco use and in assisting others). Nurse scientists interested in exploring tobacco-related issues are encouraged to consider the full range of qualitative research approaches. Qualitative research methods contribute to our understanding of tobacco use arising from nursing practice, health care and policy, along with the field of tobacco control in general.","158":"Tobacco use (primarily cigarette smoking) continues to be the most preventable health risk in the United States and the second greatest health threat around the world. In 2020 the global burden is expected to exceed nine million deaths annually. Nursing, with the largest numbers of health care professionals has an opportunity to make a significant reduction in tobacco use through its research and client-focused care. This chapter addresses why and how monitoring the tobacco epidemic with population-based databases and meta-analyses is important for nurse researchers and for evidence-based nursing practice. Population-based surveys permit an examination of trends in tobacco use and the progress in tobacco control with some confidence across time, places (i.e., states, nations, communities, etc.), and large numbers of participants. Included in this review are a description of the numerous national and international databases and other resources that nurse researchers can use to build the science of tobacco use. Additionally, research reviews and meta-analyses are described as other vehicles for providing a basis for making evidence-based decisions about nursing intervention. Nurse scientists have an obligation to use and evaluate these diverse resources to determine the gaps in knowledge, provide a foundation for clinical practice, and identify the needs and directions for future research in the field.","159":"Context matters in addressing tobacco as a global nursing issue. The tobacco epidemic and its resulting health consequences are in great measure the result of industrial decisions over the past century that included deliberately enhancing the addictiveness of cigarettes, marketing them aggressively to vulnerable groups, hiding or manipulating knowledge about the products' harmfulness, and undermining public health efforts. The efforts of the tobacco industry to perpetuate the idea that smoking is solely a problem of individual behavior, or even a \"right,\" still creates barriers to understanding the larger social and political context within which individuals use and attempt to quit tobacco. Nurses have been among the researchers worldwide who are studying tobacco industry activities and their role in policy and public health. This chapter reviews data sources, methods, and analytic approaches for conducting research using documents from the tobacco industry, and provides an overview of research conducted by nurses on this topic. Much of the nursing research to date on the tobacco industry focuses in four broad areas: (1) tobacco industry influence on policy; (2) tobacco industry strategic responses to public health efforts, including use of front groups and attempts to divide and conquer public health advocates; (3) tobacco industry targeting of marginalized groups; and (4) tobacco industry influence on science. Implications of this work for nursing practice, research, and policy intervention are discussed.","160":"Theories tell how and why things work; how and why one variable is related to another. Research findings that are theory based can be placed in a framework that advances science further than findings that are unconnected to formal theory. However, much of the research in smoking cessation is atheoretical. This review of nursing research on smoking cessation published from 1989 through 2008 revealed that nearly half of the studies were based on explicit formal theories. The transtheoretical model and self-efficacy theory were the most frequently used explicit theories with most theories emanating from psychology. Five nursing theories were identified in this review. Studies that used implicit rather than explicit theories dealt with five major concepts: nicotine dependence, social support, high-risk situations, mood-affect, and the influence of clinical diagnosis. Largely missing from this set of studies were investigations based on biobehavioral models, including genetics and neuroscience. The relevance of the theories and concepts identified in this review to current clinical guidelines on smoking cessation is discussed. With their grounding in theory and their expert knowledge of clinical issues, nurses are in an excellent position to develop theories that will help researchers in every discipline make sense of smoking cessation.","161":"Tobacco use is an epidemic of overwhelming proportions affecting survival, causing millions of deaths every year, causing untold human suffering worldwide, and contributing to escalating health care costs. Nursing research is vital to advancing knowledge in the field and to the translation of science to evidence-based practice. As the largest group of health care professionals (17 million worldwide), nurses have the capacity for an enormous impact on this leading cause of preventable death. This chapter thus provides a historical overview of the tobacco epidemic, health risks of smoking and benefits of quitting, nicotine addiction, and recommendations of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment as a backdrop for understanding the importance and need for nursing scholarship. Also examined are nursing science efforts and leadership in removing two barriers to mounting programs of nursing research in tobacco control: (1) lack of nursing education and training in tobacco control, and (2) limited research funding and mentorship. The chapter also addresses the issue of smoking in the profession as it impacts nurses' health, clinical practice, and, potentially, scholarship efforts.","162":"","163":"The CINAHL and MEDLINE databases were used to conduct a review of international rural nursing research published between 2003 and 2007. In total, 41 articles were reviewed and organized based on the United Nations Human Development Index, which categorizes countries based on development status. Critical review of international rural nursing research yielded three major organizational themes: clinical issues, aspects of nursing practice, and nursing and health policy research. Despite the variety in international locale of the research, these themes and other common findings emerged. The need for increased access to specialized nursing knowledge, resources, and support is an ongoing issue facing nurses in rural and remote settings.","164":"This chapter describes the contextual nature of contemporary rural America to provide the background for the case example of a 4-year community-based participatory research project to enhance community capacity building in a rural New England community with a large Latino\/Hispanic population. The changing nature of rural populations and implications for rural health care and nursing research are discussed.","165":"The face of America is changing. In efforts to provide services to and meet the needs of consumers of different ethnicities and cultures, cultural competence has become a driving force not only in health care but also in business, education, and research. Lack of cultural competence among caregivers has been linked to health disparities, decreased client satisfaction, and decreased client adherence to recommended medical regimens. The depth of rural research in general, and by nurse researchers focusing on rural cultural groups in particular, is limited. This chapter focuses on conducting rural nursing research with rural cultural groups, highlights methodological issues that are commonly encountered with rural populations, and proposes strategies to address them. Addressing methodological challenges will contribute to the limited knowledge base related to culture and ethnicity in rural nursing research.","166":"Adverse events occur in virtually all health care arenas, and while rural health care settings are no exception, these facilities often face unique financial burdens and personnel shortages. That may hamper patient safety efforts. Many of the interventions recommended to improve patient safety have largely been based on research conducted in urban hospitals. This chapter demonstrates the extent and type of nursing research being conducted to advance rural-specific patient safety research. The studies were conducted in various settings, with topics ranging from error reporting in hospitals to safety screening in the community. Limitations of these works are discussed, and the chapter offers guidance for a future nursing research agenda to include the need for interdisciplinary research; cross-national and international collaboration; and, at a minimum, the necessity for nurse researchers to sample rural hospitals in larger studies of patient safety.","167":"The purpose of this chapter is to review the literature on quality of care in rural areas. Keywords related to rural quality of care were used to search CINAHL and MEDLINE databases for articles published between 2005 and 2007 (limited to studies occurring in the United States). The review consisted of a total of 46 articles. Limitations include inconsistent definitions of rural, the use of only articles available to the reviewers, an unclear understanding of the context of many of the studies, and lack of a clear operational definition of quality. The studies were grouped and discussed according to quality of workforce, practice, treatment, interventions, and technology in rural areas. Each study's contribution to the understanding of quality health care in rural areas and to determining what was effective in improving staff, patient, or organizational outcomes in rural areas was considered. This chapter also offers a discussion of ethical issues and data quality in rural research. Issues for future research include a focus on patient safety, mental health issues, and the use of technology to improve quality of care in rural areas. Future research should also focus on demonstration studies of model applications. The nursing profession has a unique opportunity to conduct research that will contribute to the development of knowledge that will ultimately improve the quality of health and health care for individuals in rural communities.","168":"About 20% of Americans live in rural America, yet the rural mental health infrastructure has yet to be firmly established. This is due in part to a pervasive belief about the tranquility of rural places and the relatively stress-free environment that they produce. In this chapter an adaptation of the Rural De Facto Mental Health Systems Model produced by Fox and her associates at the Southeastern Rural Mental Health Research Center is presented and used to organize the scientific state of the field of rural mental health services research. As many nurses have stood at the forefront of that research, the research of several prominent rural mental health nurse researchers and the innovative research they have produced are reviewed. The chapter concludes with a discussion of research that is needed to move the science of rural mental health services research forward, as well as a discussion of policy initiatives that may be necessary to foster the development and implementation of that research agenda.","169":"In 2006, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a series of reports that highlighted the urgent need for improvements in the nation's emergency health services. This news has provided new energy to a growing body of research about the development and implementation of best practices in emergency care. Despite evidence of geographical disparities in health services, relatively little attention has been focused on rural emergency services to identify environmental differences. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the contributions of nursing research to the rural emergency services literature. The research resembles a so-called shotgun effect as the exploratory and interventional studies cover a wide range of topics without consistency or justification. Emergency nursing research has been conducted primarily in urban settings, with small samples and insufficient methodological rigor. This chapter will discuss the limitations of the research and set forth an agenda of critical topics that need to be explored related to emergency nursing in rural settings.","170":"The purpose of this chapter is to review nursing and other research related to rural intimate partner violence. The author presents a review of research in the area of intimate partner violence in the rural setting. The findings indicate that there is limited nursing research related to intimate partner violence in rural communities. The review describes the prevalence and types of abuse, the rural service issues, and the consequences of battering. The chapter also discusses the health implications of violence in the rural setting. The author concludes with a presentation of a research agenda for nursing research in rural environments.","171":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and around the world. Most of the work done on CVD among rural populations uses mortality versus prevalence rates because prevalence data for rural populations is difficult, if not impossible, to find in national data sets as currently published. Cardiovascular disease is a significant threat to rural dwellers and those in rural nursing need evidence on which to base their practice. This chapter provides an examination of the CVD literature as it relates to rural populations with an emphasis on studies that include or are limited to rural women as subjects. Topics reviewed included: awareness and symptoms of heart disease among women, heart failure (HF) in rural women, hypertension (HTN) in rural areas, stroke in rural populations, quality care in acute myocardial infarction (MI) in rural facilities, mortality and CVD, and CVD risk factors in rural populations. The authors reviewed 134 research articles published between 2000 and 2007. Overall, the CVD research literature in rural populations has small sample sizes, except for epidemiologic studies, and tends to be descriptive in nature. There is a dearth of literature on prevalence among rural populations from a national perspective and little is written on interventions to reduce CVD risks and physiological markers that include large samples from rural populations. Future nursing research on CVD in rural populations needs to move beyond the descriptive to intervention studies, which need to be robust in power to guard against Type II errors.","172":"The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is higher among those living in rural\/ nonmetropolitan statistical areas than in urban centers. Managing this complex chronic illness is complicated by factors such as limited access to care, low socioeconomic status, aging, and membership in a racial or ethnic minority group. A review of the literature was conducted focusing on research about rural Americans with diabetes by searching databases of CINAHL, PubMed, and MEDLINE, and selecting articles in English that were published between 2000 and 2007. Search terms included: nursing, research, rural, rural nursing, rural health services\/programs, and diabetes care. Additional search strategies included journal hand searching and networking. Twenty-six research reports were found and included qualitative and quantitative methods and program evaluations. All regions of the United States were represented except the Northwest. The vast majority of research reports were of descriptive studies (n = 16), with program evaluation reports (n = 7) and studies testing an intervention (n = 3) also represented. The quality of each study is examined and summarized.","173":"","174":"Thailand was the first Asian country hit by the AIDS epidemic, and in the 1990s reported the fastest spread of HIV\/AIDS in the world. According to Thailand's Ministry of Public Health, women, primarily between the child-bearing ages of 15 and 49, are increasingly becoming infected with HIV. A number of factors contribute to the increasing AIDS epidemic, including the rise of the commercial sex industry in Thailand; social disparities that have existed between men and women throughout Thailand's history; and the gender-expectations faced by Thai women toward family and society. Thailand enjoys one of the oldest, reputedly successful primary health care delivery systems in the world; one that relies on community health workers to reach the most rural of populations. In the mid-1990s, day care centers were established at district hospitals by the Thai government to provide medical, psychological, and social care to people living with HIV\/AIDS (PWA). Buddhist temples also provide a source of alternative care for PWAs. However, the AIDS policy of the Thai government relies on families to care for the country's sick. Although poor women are a vulnerable population in Thailand, they are changing the paradigm of AIDS stigma while providing a significant cost-savings to the Thai government in their caregiving activities. Based on existing nursing studies on Thailand, this chapter gives voice to poor Thai women living with HIV\/AIDS, and examines how they make sense of their gendered contract with society and religion while being HIV\/AIDS caregivers, patients, or both.","175":"Community-academic research partnerships have evolved as a multidisciplinary approach to involve those communities experiencing health disparities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions. Community-academic partnerships are intended to bring together academic researchers and communities to share power, establish trust, foster colearning, enhance strengths and resources, build community capacity, and address community-identified needs and health problems. The purpose of this chapter is to review the current state of community-academic research partnerships in the United States and Canada. We discuss contextual issues; present a review of the current literature; identify the major strengths, challenges, and lessons learned that have emerged during the course of these research collaborations; and explore implications for future research and policy.","176":"Evidence-based practice is critical for the improvement of interventions for culturally diverse and disadvantaged groups in the community. Nurses are strategically located in the line of patient care and must be grounded in knowledge related to the delivery of culturally appropriate intervention strategies. Although many of the health care disciplines have failed to conduct or disseminate culturally competent interventions among vulnerable populations, it is important to note that nursing has long been engaged in such activities. Clearly, all health care professionals must be provided with the tools that they need to give appropriate and effective care to patients and to conduct and disseminate relevant research about vulnerable populations. This chapter focuses on culturally competent interventions for ethnic and racial minority groups, women, and the mentally ill.","177":"People with HIV\/AIDS are a vulnerable group whose symptoms can seriously affect their quality of life. HIV\/AIDS symptoms can result from the disease itself, from secondary complications of the disease, or from side-effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and other medications related to comorbidities. HIV symptoms are the single most important indicators for patients and practitioners. Symptoms prompt patients to seek medical attention and provide health care providers with essential clues about changes in health status and quality of life. Despite increased recognition of the importance of addressing symptoms among people with HIV\/AIDS, few studies have examined the management of HIV symptoms. This chapter introduces HIV symptoms, reports on the methods of review, provides an overview of contextual issues including the literature on symptoms, issues related to symptom measures, theoretical foundations on symptom management, HIV-specific measures, non-HIV-specific measures, translation of findings into practice, and implications for future research and policy.","178":"The nervous system as well as the endocrine system maintain extensive communication with the immune system through the influence of hormones and neurotransmitters and also by way of the hardwiring of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to the lymphoid organs. There is now convincing evidence that the communication between these three body systems is bidirectional. This chapter will provide a succinct review of how neuroendocrine and immune functions are affected in factors that impact vulnerability, such as aging, acute infection, and central nervous system injury. Given that the relevant literature on these topics is vast, the presentation in this chapter will serve to highlight primary references that reflect state of the science in these systems of focus.","179":"This chapter describes common genomic and proteomic methods and their application to the study of vulnerable population groups. The International HapMap project is discussed in relation to unique Haplotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) in population groups. In addition, studies, which have used these methods to investigate aging, ethnic, and racial specific conditions, as well as psychiatric diseases, are reviewed. Advantages and limitations of various genomic and proteomic approaches are discussed in relation to population admixture and sample selection.","180":"This chapter focuses on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) T32 National Research Service Award (NRSA) funding mechanism, designed to enhance the development of nurse scientists. The general history and principles underlying NIH funding for T32s as well as the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) involvement in the NRSA program is described, highlighting the University of California Los Angeles School of Nursing's T32 training program in vulnerable populations research and the program and career trajectory data from close to two-thirds of NINR-funded T32s directors. Recommendations for the improvement of NINR-funded T32 training programs are identified. Findings include the need for increased collaboration between institutions receiving T32 funding from the NINR.","181":"This chapter focuses on promoting cultural competence in research and the care of vulnerable populations by establishing inter-university nursing partnership centers for health disparities research between historically Black universities and minority-serving institutions and research-intensive majority institutions. The Hampton-Penn Center to Reduce Health Disparities (HPC), an inter-university collaborative center funded through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) P20 funding mechanism, is discussed as the exemplar. The mission of the Hampton-Penn Center is to promote culturally competent research on health promotion and disease prevention and the examination of how culture, race and ethnicity and their interactions with the health care system and the larger society influence health outcomes and the occurrence of health disparities. The history, goals, and conceptual model underlying this collaborative effort between the University of Pennsylvania and Hampton University Schools of Nursing are described as are the accomplishments and lessons learned to date. Based upon the Hampton-Penn experience, recommendations for similar collaborations to reduce health disparities among vulnerable populations are made in three major areas: (a) increasing the study of the multi-system level factors that contribute to health disparities among vulnerable populations, (b) promoting the development of culturally competent research on health disparities, and (c) promoting the recruitment and training of health researchers who are themselves members of vulnerable populations.","182":"Racial and ethnic minorities, women and infants, youth, and other special needs populations have been found to be disproportionately affected by infectious disease morbidity and mortality, particularly Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome\/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV\/AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Being a vital component of the health care delivery system, nurses play an important role in improving the health of these vulnerable populations. Twenty-six studies reporting results from evaluations of prevention strategies targeting HIV\/AIDS and other STDs among vulnerable populations were reviewed. The more effective interventions appeared to be those that tailored their program content to the specific risk factors of their target population and included skills training in their curriculum. Although nurses have contributed significantly in understanding the risk factors of vulnerable groups in the United States through cross-sectional research studies, more research is needed in the evaluation of intervention programs that use this knowledge to develop and implement prevention programs, particularly at a population-based level.","183":"Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and account for 7 of every 10 deaths. While the etiology of chronic diseases is multifactorial, individual modifiable behaviors play an important role in both risk and prevention. Hispanics are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases and are a growing and significant population. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze and critique behavioral lifestyle interventions conducted with adolescent and adult Hispanics. Specific recommendations for continued research and policy are provided.","184":"This study examined measurement practices of researchers in relation to vulnerable population research published in four general nursing research journals in 2004. The purpose was to identify issues and imperatives in the measurement of research variables with vulnerable populations that warrant attention. A total of 133 articles were eligible for inclusion in the study, and 428 measurement instruments were used in the studies. A content analysis of the 133 eligible articles indicated that most samples included to a greater extent more Whites than predominantly minority populations, and more adults than children. Most of the articles did not specify socioeconomic status of samples. Of the 133 eligible articles, 83 (62.4%) included samples that were comprised of a majority of racial and ethnic minorities; however, percentages of studies that focused predominately on a specific minority group were below 10% in more than 80% of studies. Major findings related to measurement practices indicated inadequate specification of the measurement framework employed; lack of adequate specification of the conceptual base of measurement tools; and, a heavy reliance on the use of self-report data, attitudinal and perceptual measures, and the use of questionnaires and rating scales. There was also inadequate attention to the metric qualities of laboratory physiological measures, and to reliability and validity in general. It was concluded that inadequate attention is given to measurement practices by researchers when studying vulnerable populations.","185":"Inequalities with respect to the distribution of societal resources can predispose people to vulnerability, which has led to a growing concern across America. The Federal Government has taken a leadership role and has launched several initiatives to combat health inequalities experienced by vulnerable populations. The National Institute of Health and all of its institutes, including the National Institute of Nursing Research, have written strategic plans to reduce, and ultimately, eliminate such health disparities. Nursing research has been conducted in the setting of vulnerable populations; several theoretical models for studying vulnerability have been created; and interventional studies designed to reduce health disparities have been implemented. This introduction includes the following: (a) a definition of the concept of vulnerability and health disparities; (b) a discussion of the conceptual models of vulnerability and health disparity and their applications; (c) a description of the impact of federal funding on vulnerable populations research; (d) a synopsis of the contributions made by nurse researchers in the field of vulnerable populations research; and (e) an overview of the volume.","186":"This review presents an analysis of research published by Irish nurses during the period 1990-2005. The analysis is the first effort made to identify the main characteristics of Irish nursing research. Overall, 213 published studies were identified for consideration, from which, 152 were included in the review. The studies were published in 60 journals, 4 books, and 8 research reports. Journal articles selected from 6 journals accounted for 52%. Inclusion criteria were quality of research design, sampling (including sample size), data analysis, scientific merit, and authorship. Each article was analyzed based on this schema. The major areas of research identified included clinical practice (56%) (e.g., medical surgical, mental health, intellectual disability, and maternal and child), nursing management and professional issues (19%), and nursing education (25%).","187":"Nursing research studies of patient safety for 2002-2005 were reviewed to determine methods used and methodological challenges within this field of research. Methods used in traditional clinical research and in health services research were often combined or adapted in innovative research designs to advance knowledge regarding nursing care and patient safety outcomes. This relatively new focus of complex research posed methodological challenges in areas such as measurement and the availability and analysis of data. The most frequent methods used included survey research, analysis of secondary data, and observational studies. This review points to the need to increase the incorporation of complex methodological training, including health services research, the analysis of secondary data and complex survey design in our doctoral programs, and to provide opportunities for researchers to gain further methodological training. Increased use of multi-site and multi-level studies is also needed.","188":"Nurses and others have expressed a great deal of interest in the potential for incorporating notions about organizational culture and climate in research and practice aiming to improve health care safety. In this review, definitions and measures of these terms are explored, the state of the research literature connecting culture and climate with safety is reviewed, and directions for future research and leadership practice are outlined.","189":"In Crossing the Quality Chasm, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in America identified the critical role of information technology in designing a health system that produces care that is \"safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable\" (Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, 2001, p. 164). A subsequent IOM report contends that improved information systems are essential to a new health care delivery system that \"both prevents errors and learns from them when they occur\" (Committee on Data Standards for Patient Safety, 2004, p. 1). This review specifically highlights the role of informatics processes and information technology in promoting patient safety and summarizes relevant nursing research. First, the components of an informatics infrastructure for patient safety are described within the context of the national framework for delivering consumer-centric and information-rich health care and using the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) (Thompson &amp; Brailer, 2004). Second, relevant nursing research is summarized; this includes research studies that contributed to the development of selected infrastructure components as well as studies specifically focused on patient safety. Third, knowledge gaps and opportunities for nursing research are identified for each main topic. The health information technologies deployed as part of the national framework must support nursing practice in a manner that enables prevention of medical errors and promotion of patient safety and contributes to the development of practice-based nursing knowledge as well as best practices for patient safety. The seminal work that has been completed to date is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve this objective.","190":"The number of older persons in the United States is rapidly growing and, based on this growth projection, the number of consumers needing nursing home (NH) care will likely triple in the next 10 years. Although NHs have been bombarded and scrutinized about the care that they provide, the concept of safety (specifically, error prevention) remains at the margin of most quality improvement efforts. The purpose of this review is to explore what has recently been written (2000-2005) about the evolution of the NH as an organization focused on safety and the most critical clinical processes that must be closely monitored for a safe NH environment to occur. After a thorough review of both organizational and clinical NH literature, 30 organizational studies and 39 clinically based studies were reviewed. The review revealed that, organizationally, teamwork, communication, and leadership all were critical in resident and staff outcomes and clinically, assessment was an important missing process at critical points in the residents' care for prevention and timely treatment of potentially dangerous conditions. The value of the registered nurse (RN) in this setting was clear in the many assessment issues noted and the lack of RN guidance for adherence to recognized practice guidelines. To explicate the role of the RN, first, better outcome measures must be developed that are nurse sensitive. A second clear agenda for NH research is the explication of the role of leadership, particularly nursing leadership, to create an environment where open and accurate communication can be accomplished among all of the diverse NH roles. This will help all members of the team to identify care improvement opportunities. Finally, a new frontier for the NH setting is the use of technology and the need to harness the information that has set in the NH system for years. Information mastery for staff and leadership is a necessary aspect of the organization that must be developed to provide sound information for strategic and focused change to occur.","191":"Nurses are the largest professional provider of health care services in the home setting. However, nurse home visit programs are diverse. The purpose of this review was to examine the many factors that influence the effectiveness of nurse home visit programs for older adults. Donebedian's Quality Assessment Model was used to organize the review using the components of structure, process, and outcome. A total of 60 home visit studies were identified that met the following criteria: (1) nurses were a major or only provider of the intervention, (2) the intervention was delivered by home visits, and (3) the study included a comparison group. This review demonstrates the complexity of variables that determine the effectiveness of home visit interventions. Many studies demonstrated lower overall health care costs for the intervention group with either improved or at least no change in clinical outcomes.","192":"With the widespread patient safety movement comes an increased public awareness of the risks inherent within the health care setting. More specifically, the highly publicized medication error cases that hit the media demonstrate the effect mediation errors have on patient safety within the perioperative environment. This awareness, however, has triggered limited research across the continuum of care within this complex environment. A current review of the state of the science related to medication safety within this setting reveals research primarily focused on the anesthesia domain of practice. Although application to the perioperative environment can be extrapolated from this research, there is a notable lack of nursing-initiated research that focuses on improved systems or processes related to medication safety within the perioperative continuum of care. This knowledge gap in the literature presents an excellent opportunity for nursing to grow a research program to improve medication safety within the perioperative environment in support of evidence-based practice.","193":"The most visible threats to patient safety associated with nursing care occur on hospital inpatient units. Patient safety research is a new phenomenon, but it builds on the knowledge provided by quality-of-care research done previously. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the current state of the science in the area of nurse staffing and patient safety. The results of research studies published since the last round of reviews (1996-2005) are described by level of analysis, measures of nurse staffing and patient outcomes. Although research linking nurse staffing to the quality of patient care has increased markedly since 1996, the results of recent research projects do not yet provide a thorough and consistent foundation for producing solutions to the crisis in hospital nursing care. The inconsistencies are largely due to differing units of analysis (hospital, patient, care unit), variability in measures of nurse staffing, the variety of quality indicators chosen, the difficulty finding accurate measures of these indicators, and the difficulty creating risk-adjustment strategies for the indicators most sensitive to nursing care. Nursing administration and policy most urgently need research conducted with standardized data collected at the patient care unit level.","194":"Transmission of infection in the hospital has been identified as a patient safety problem adversely affecting patients, visitors, and health care workers. Prevention of infection should not be limited to the hospital epidemiology staff but also must involve the entire multidisciplinary team, including nurses. This chapter reviews the literature related to patient safety of nursing-authored studies of infection control in the hospital. The review indicated that there were key areas of research interest including drug resistance; hand hygiene products, procedures, and surveillance; preoperative skin preparations; health care worker transmission of infection; common procedures associated with an increased risk of transmission; and organizational issues.","195":"Falls and related injuries are increasingly being recognized as a nursing-sensitive quality indicator, and they continue to be an unsolved patient safety problem in inpatient and outpatient care areas as well as in the community at large. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current research related to fall and injury prevention. The chapter is organized presenting research in (1) the community and (2) acute and long-term care settings. For each setting, the research that addresses risk factors, risk assessment instruments, and fall and injury prevention efforts are reviewed. There is a large body of research that investigates fall and injury prevention across the care continuum. In the community setting, targeted risk evaluation in the emergency department and management of vitamin D deficiency appear to be promising preventive methods. However, further research needs to explore staffing ratios, automated methods of assessing and communicating fall risk, improved methods and timing of risk evaluation and methods by which existing and new evidence might be translated into practice.","196":"Patient safety has become a major concern for both society and policymakers. Since nurses are intimately involved in the delivery of medications and are ultimately responsible during the medication administration phase, it is important for nursing to understand factors contributing to medication administration errors. The purpose of this chapter is to identify the incidence of these errors and the associated factors in an attempt to better understand the problem and lessen future error occurrence. Literature review revealed both active failures and latent conditions established in Reason's theory remain prevalent in current literature where active failures often display themselves in the form of incorrect drug calculations, lack of individual knowledge, and failure to follow established protocol. Latent conditions are evidenced as time pressures, fatigue, understaffing, inexperience, design deficiencies, and inadequate equipment and may lie dormant within a system until combined with active failures to create opportunity for error. Although medication error research has shifted in emphasis toward identification of system problems inherent in error occurrence, no one force emerges as a clear antecedent, reinforcing the need for further research and replication of existing studies with emphasis placed on more dependable reporting measures through which nurses are not threatened by reprisal.","197":"The individual and collective discussions of the patient safety issue in the United States have mounted from a low roar to a deafening din in the past 10 years. In this chapter the authors (1) discuss the context of patient safety over the past decade and the federal response to the problem, (2) briefly present Reason's theory of human error, which frames much of the safety research, and (3) provide a glossary of terms.","198":"While a substantial amount is known about some of the risk factors for alcohol-related problems among lesbians and gay men, major gaps in knowledge exist. Epidemiological studies focusing on alcohol use rarely ask about sexual orientation, and broad-based studies of sexual minority population groups have only occasionally assessed alcohol use. Although the AIDS crisis has stimulated substantial research on alcohol and other substance use among gay men, only a handful of studies have systematically explored lesbians' use of alcohol. Further, existing research on sexual orientation and alcohol use is characterized by a plethora of methodological problems. Nevertheless, when viewed as a whole, this research suggests that lesbians and gay men are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to drink alcohol and to report alcohol-related problems; differences based on sexual orientation are more pronounced for women than for men. Risks related to alcohol use do not stem from sexual orientation per se, but are more likely a consequence of cultural and environmental factors associated with being part of a stigmatized and marginalized population. Much of the research on alcohol use among sexual minorities has focused on White, middle-class, and well-educated lesbians and gay men. There is a clear need for more research with bisexual women and men and with sexual minority members of color. Longitudinal studies, including those that focus on treatment effectiveness, are particularly lacking.","199":"A large proportion of Americans report binge or heavy drinking. The human and economic costs of alcohol misuse are extensive, with hundreds of thousands of lives lost or disrupted and billions of dollars spent due to impaired productivity, crime, and adverse health consequences. In an effort to reduce costs such as these, scientists and clinicians have developed brief interventions, characterized by their low intensity and short (5-60 minutes) duration, as well as by their intent to provide early intervention before drinkers develop alcohol abuse or dependence. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to analyze research studies related to brief intervention and critically analyze and critique their findings. In addition, both prospective randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses will be used to discuss the implications for clinical practice and make recommendations for future research.","200":"The purpose of this chapter is to review and critique the literature on risky drinking, driving, and sexual behaviors. To complete this review, electronic searches using databases from the disciplines of nursing, medicine, and psychology were used with keywords alcohol and risky behavior, risky drinking, risky driving, risky sex, and sexual aggression, as well as other relevant terms. The basic tenets of contemporary theoretical models of risky behaviors are used as a framework for reviewing the literature. Most relevant to the discussion are the relationships among the behaviors, risk and protective factors, and major unresolved theoretical and methodological issues. In the literature, sensation seeking was differentially associated with risky drinking, driving, and sex, but causal assertions are premature. Important conceptual and physiological issues are clarified. First, unconventionality contributes to risky drinking, risky driving, and, among adolescents, risky sex. Second, the pharmacologic effects of alcohol on cognitive processing contribute to risky sex, but only among persons who feel conflicted about risky sex (e.g., condom use). This perception may be particularly true for men who have a belief that alcohol will enhance sex. Third, sexual aggression appears to stem from a variety of factors, including the pharmacologic effects of alcohol on aggression and stereotypes about drinking women. Exploration of risk and protective factors adds breadth and depth to the discussion of risk taking. Risk factors include (1) high tolerance for deviance, (2) unconventional attitudes and behaviors such as early alcohol use and precocious sex, (3) peer norms for deviance, (4) high sensation seeking, and, to a lesser extent, (5) disturbed risk perception and positive beliefs about alcohol. Protective factors appear to mitigate risk and include (1) conventional attitudes and behaviors and (2) having peers that model conventional attitudes and behaviors. Although empirical evidence suggests that risky behaviors tend to covary, most intervention trials to date have focused on single behaviors, and often are based on clinical information rather than existing theoretical and empirical knowledge.","201":"Considerable research has focused on alcohol problems in older adults, but the clinical utilization of this knowledge has lagged at least 3 decades behind the scientific developments. This unfortunate situation takes on added significance as the \"baby boomer\" generation ages because more of them drink more often in larger quantities than previous generations. This chapter focuses more on the ramifications of use, misuse, and abuse than on chronic dependence because the prevalence in the former categories far outweighs the latter. Older alcohol misusers and abusers are at excess risk for myriad physical problems and premature death because alcohol interacts with the natural aging process in negative ways to increase risks for injuries, hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmic events, cancers, gastrointestinal problems, neurocognitive deficits, bone loss, and emotional challenges, most notably depression. Low volume and less than daily alcohol consumption appear to be protective against blood clots in the coronary and brain vessels, bone loss and falls, and cognitive decline compared with current abstainers. At higher levels, alcohol has the opposite effect. Research findings strongly support positive outcomes of case finding, referral, and treatment of older adults who are misusing or abusing alcohol. However, there is ample evidence that health care providers across the spectrum of primary, acute, and long-term care ignore the signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse and abuse in their older patients and treat symptoms and sequelae of the abuse rather than confronting the abuse itself. Recommendations for changes in practice are made together with ideas for additional research in several areas where the current state of knowledge is inadequate, conflicting, or based on narrowly homogeneous samples.","202":"This chapter reviews research on alcohol misuse, abuse, and addiction in young and middle adulthood. Young adulthood is defined as ages 21 to 35 and middle adulthood as ages 36 to 65. The authors searched the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and other databases for the years 1992 through 2004 using the terms alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and alcohol dependence, then hand-searched for the inclusion of age as a variable. The search was limited to research and English-language publications. Unpublished dissertation studies were excluded, as were topics that were reviewed in other chapters of this volume. When possible, articles for review were limited to alcohol only, as compared with other drugs of abuse. Research articles were selected for review if they contained the variables alcohol misuse, abuse, or alcohol addiction or dependence and age. The review included both nurse- and non-nurse-investigators and was comprised of 50 studies. The results are in four content areas across the global area of alcohol misuse, abuse, and dependence in young and middle adulthood: incidence and prevalence, developmental changes, the work setting, and the family setting. Few articles used a developmental framework, although in some studies, the framework was implicit. Nurse-investigators were more likely to produce qualitative studies, although the studies varied dramatically in size of sample, research design, and variables. Overall, there was greater breadth than depth. The use of adult developmental theory was limited despite its potential explanatory potential in this field. There is a need for more nurse-researchers to explore adult developmental theory and pay increased attention to age and developmental stage as explanatory variables.","203":"This integrative review of college students' alcohol use covers research papers as well as review and theoretical papers published between 1990 and 2004. To conduct this review, abstracts were identified by searching Medline (PubMed), Ingenta, ERIC, PsycInfo, and Health Reference Center Academic using the following words: alcohol and college drinking, binge drinking, college students and undergraduates and the years 1990 to 2004. From an initial list of over 400 abstracts, 203 papers were identified and considered for this review. A developmental perspective of college drinking was assumed, and the chapter is organized within five domains: biology, identity, cognition, affiliation, and achievement. In addition, research pertaining to the harmful consequences of college drinking and the assessment of risky drinking is reviewed and discussed. The chapter concludes with the identification of gaps in knowledge and implications for future research.","204":"Alcohol use in children and adolescents continues to be a major health concern. There is a rich literature on correlates and antecedents of alcohol use in children and adolescents, and concerted efforts have been made to develop, implement, and evaluate intervention strategies. This chapter provides a review of the intervention studies to prevent alcohol use in these groups. The interventions are categorized by their primary focus: school, family, and community. The studies were limited to those with either an experimental or a quasi-experimental design and published results.","205":"Alcohol is a potent teratogen in humans, and prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities. The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) refers to a pattern of birth defects found in children of mothers who drank during pregnancy. FAS has four criteria: maternal drinking during pregnancy, a characteristic pattern of facial abnormalities, growth retardation, and brain damage (often manifested by intellectual difficulties or behavioral problems). As surveillance and research have progressed, it has become clear that FAS is but a rare example of a wide array of defects that can occur from exposure to alcohol in utero. At least 1 in 10 women will continue to consume alcohol during pregnancy, putting their fetuses at risk for the effects of alcohol exposure. Nurses are in a key position to provide care and conduct research that will contribute to the prevention of the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure during the preconception and perinatal periods, as well as deal with the negative outcomes of exposure in the developing infant. Many areas have yet to be evaluated. Screening tools and interventions have been developed and tested, mostly in majority cultures. Culturally sensitive instruments must be generated and validated for high-risk groups such as Native Americans. Fetal alcohol biomarkers and genetic research are new and need considerably more work. Effective \"no drinking during pregnancy\" campaigns for high-risk groups must be created and tested. Nurses are well placed to conduct research that will describe the effects at social, behavioral, and biological levels; develop middle-range theories targeted at preventing the drinking behavior and optimizing care of affected children after birth; and generate and test effective interventions that enhance prevention strategies in the 21st century.","206":"The adverse consequences of heavy alcohol use are well known. However, recent media reports of a possible cardiovascular benefit associated with moderate drinking have revived public interest in the use of alcohol for \"medicinal purposes.\" Knowledge development regarding guidelines for moderate alcohol use has lagged behind public interest in the possible health benefits of moderate alcohol use. At this time, evidence-based primary health promotion interventions related to the risks and benefits of moderate alcohol use are lacking in the health care literature. This chapter reviews 22 reports describing the relationship between moderate drinking and cardiovascular disease. The reports are classified by the level of evidence and critiqued on seven aspects of method. Conclusions related to the strength of the evidence that moderate drinking is a useful primary health promotion intervention are presented.","207":"In both the clinical and research settings, nurses assess patterns of alcohol consumption to screen for risk of adverse events or to determine the health consequences of drinking. The purposes of this critical review are to explore issues and controversies surrounding the measurement of alcohol consumption and to critique the existing literature relevant to the research and clinical arenas. An electronic literature search was completed to identify research articles addressing human studies from 1995 through 2004 related to alcohol consumption. Key words included alcohol drinking (subheadings blood, metabolism, psychology, and urine), standard drink, problem drinking, heavy drinking, and ethanol analysis (subheadings blood, urine, and chemistry). The results were in two primary content areas: self-reported alcohol consumption and assessment of consumption by using biological markers. Self-reported alcohol consumption can be quantified in a variety of ways, such as ounces of ethanol per day, standard drinks per day, drinking occurrences per month, heavy drinking occasions per month, and frequency of perceived drunkenness. The choice of measure depends on setting (clinical vs. research), the role of the variable under study, the capabilities and demographics of the study population, the study design, and the resources available to collect alcohol consumption data. A variety of biologic instruments are used to assess alcohol consumption, each with sensitivities and specificities that vary by age, gender, and possibly by ethnicity\/race. Previous work has focused on the white, male, alcohol-dependent population and non-alcohol-dependent male controls. Some urgency exists to expand the biometrics of alcohol use to minority and older populations as well as to women across the life span.","208":"Sixty percent of the U.S. population drinks alcohol. Although numerous investigators have shown that low-volume alcohol intake has positive influences on cardiovascular health, bone density, and cognition, there is a fine line between positive, neutral, and negative ramifications of alcohol consumption on health. Alcohol accounts for 7% of the global burden of disease and injury from all causes and for 10% to 11% of all illnesses and death each year worldwide. So alcohol use is a two-edged sword. Psychiatric nurses have a long history of involvement with alcoholic patients, and alcohol users, misusers, and abusers comprise a significant percentage of the patient load in every specialty and subspecialty of nursing. Yet nursing education has neglected this important area of content in general nursing curricula, staff development has not trained mainstream nurses to routinely assess for alcohol problems among hospital patients, and primary care providers have failed to do case finding. During the past 25 years, the federal government has funded curricular and faculty development programs to bring alcohol information into the core of health provider training. The process has been halting and minimally successful at best. One ramification of the inattention to alcohol-related education is the dearth of nurse-scientists engaged in programs of research in the field of alcohol abuse. A federally funded faculty development program in the 1990s focused attention on this issue, and a small cadre of nurses were trained to do related research. Several of the authors in this volume are members of that group. A brief overview of the focus of each of the remaining chapters in this volume is presented. A rationale is provided for the importance of this area of research for nursing knowledge and quality patient care in essentially all areas of nursing practice. Finally, several burning research questions are posed that would most appropriately be answered through nursing research.","209":"Community partnerships have been recognized as the cornerstone of community research. The recent Institute of Medicine report, Unequal Treatment, puts forth the idea of creating community partnerships as a strategy to address racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Community-based research is frequently reported in the literature as a study conducted in the community versus with the community. The objective of this review is to examine models of community partnerships, to consider their implications for community-based research, and to identify directions for future nursing research.","210":"This chapter provides a review of research literature and describes the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among racial and ethnic minority populations. The relevance of CAM to health disparities is also discussed. Complementary and alternative medicines are terms used to describe methods of health care beyond the usual Western biomedical model. These treatments are prevalent and increasing in the United States. Many CAM therapies are ancient therapies among certain racial and ethnic minorities. Thus, it seems that complementary and alternative medicine is being used and\/or could be used to decrease health disparities among these populations. A review of 26 research articles shows that we are at the beginning stages of examining this phenomenon and that CAM use by any population is only now being described. Of the reviewed studies, 19 studies documented use of CAM among racial and ethnic minorities; 7 revealed that CAM is not used more among ethnic groups than among White (non-Hispanic) populations. Although it is known that racial and ethnic people utilize CAM, the vast array of research questions and aims, CAM definitions, CAM practitioners, and diverse research methodologies result in mixed research findings and conclusions. In some instances, utilization of CAM modalities is stated to be a result of culture among particular groups. Even so, there is currently no evidence that scientifically supports the notion that CAM can be used to reduce health disparities within racial and ethnic minority populations.","211":"The recognition that children and adolescents suffer from mental health problems and disabilities is a recent phenomenon, not arising until the late 19th century. Because of the increasing numbers and importance of ethnic minority children and youth to the vitality of the United States, their mental health and disabilities can no longer be overlooked. Mental health is paramount for fostering social integration, unity, and inclusiveness within and between ethnic groups. Thus the significance of changing demographics and the disparity in mental health indicators make this a key issue for the future. Nursing research in this area has been limited, in spite of the fact that mental health problems and disabilities exert a disproportionate negative effect on racial and ethnic minority children (NIMH, 2001a). The purpose of this chapter is to critique the available nursing research on mental health and disabilities in racial and ethnic minority children, including how such research has been conceptualized, conducted, and interpreted.","212":"Discoveries, breakthroughs, and advances made in the area of cancer prevention and cancer control over the last 2 decades have led to declines in the rates of cancer incidence and mortality and increases in life expectancy and survival for many cancer patients. However, although the trends relative to cancer incidence, mortality, and 5-year survival for the nation as a whole have significantly improved, data reveal that there are significant disparities in the degree to which the burden of cancer that remains is borne by racial and ethnic minority population groups. As a practice-oriented discipline grounded in research, nursing could have a dominant role in efforts aimed toward eliminating the cancer disparities experienced by racial and ethnic population groups. Several reports of nursing studies have been published in the peer-reviewed literature that address factors associated with the cancer disparities experienced between and among U.S. racial and ethnic minority groups. However, given that few efforts have been undertaken to comprehensively review and critique this body of research, little is known about the scope, quality, and potential impact of this body of nursing science. This report presents the results of one of the first comprehensive reviews of nursing research undertaken to explore and address factors associated with the evolution of the cancer-related health disparities in ethnic and racial minority population groups within the United States. The findings reveal that, while the body of nursing research has contributed much to the identification and understanding of factors associated with the excess cancer morbidity and mortality of minority populations, in order for the profession to more fully contribute to the elimination of cancer-related disparities, there is a need for nurses to further expand and strengthen this base of knowledge.","213":"By 2030, ethnic minority elders are expected to increase by 12%. Research about this highly diverse population is gaining momentum. This chapter summarizes selected research articles published after 1996 on access and utilization of services and resources by African American and Asian American elders. Computerized searches were made using PubMed and CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature) with the following terms used individually or combined: health care, aging, older adults, ethnicity, access, disparities, chronic illness, community health care, health beliefs, health practices, and ethnogeriatrics. Citations for 456 articles on two ethnic groups were retrieved; 155 were reviewed, and 84 citations were used for this chapter. The publications focus on African Americans (45%), Asian Americans (41%), and both groups (14%). Descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional studies dominate the research effort, identifying unmet needs, and a limited number are on culturally appropriate and acceptable interventions. Results are discussed in the context of ethnogeriatrics, and recommendations for future studies are proposed.","214":"The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) group is the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. AAPIs have been touted in the literature as the \"model minority\" because of their achievements in the socioeconomic and educational spheres, which in certain categories are beyond the average levels of the dominant majority. However, generalizations such as these are very misleading, because they mask the glaring health disparities that are experienced by subgroups within the AAPI population. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the literature dealing with health disparities among AAPIs. Twenty-eight usable research reports were reviewed after a thorough review of the literature that spanned the years between 1990 and 2003. The review has revealed that the predominant psychosocial and cultural variables studied in research dealing with AAPI are acculturation, family and social networks, help-seeking behaviors, and cultural brokering. In general, research conducted on this group tended to be at the descriptive and comparative-correlational levels; more studies that investigate the effects of interventions to reduce or eliminate health disparities on this group are needed. The challenge is to build a body of knowledge on which to base future action.","215":"The purpose of this integrated review was to examine research on the relationships between immigration and health. The review was limited to studies of immigration into North America published since 1994. The results suggested that, although recent research has furthered the understanding of immigration and health, the multiple health effects of the various social and cultural processes immigrants undergo are still not clearly understood. In addition, research on acculturation has not clarified the positive or negative effects of acculturation on health. The incorporation of transnational perspectives and contemporary concepts and frameworks such as biculturalism, undocumentedness, and transitions was noted as a significant contribution from recent research. The results of this integrative review indicate that interdisciplinary research on immigration and health is moving in new directions. The reviewers provide suggestions for future research on health disparities as well as on possible health protective factors among diverse immigrant populations.","216":"The purpose of this chapter is to review empirical nursing literature on the health care of racial and ethnic minority men, specifically African American\/Black, Hispanic\/Latino, American Indian\/Alaskan Native, and Asian\/Pacific Islander men. CINAHL and MEDLINE computer databases were searched from their earliest online date until 2003 using a combination of manual and computer-based methods to identify the nursing literature with samples that included minority men. Articles were selected according to their relevance to the four areas of adult health disparities targeted by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS): heart disease, malignant neoplasms (cancer), diabetes, and HIV\/AIDS. A total of 52 empirical articles were selected. Findings were categorized as addressing disease prevention, disease screening, or disease management of the targeted conditions. This review demonstrates that some important work has already been accomplished in nursing research to address the four adult health disparities targeted by DHHS. Future research should be based on gaps identified in existing literature and should be guided by culturally appropriate theories and constructs.","217":"The purpose of this chapter is to examine how language barriers contribute to health disparities among ethnic and racial minorities in the United States. A literature search was systematically conducted using selected computer databases (MEDLINE and CINAHL). Searches were limited to English-language-published research in the years from 1985 to 2003. A total of 47 published articles were included in this review. Overall these studies indicate that language barriers are associated with longer visit time per clinic visit, less frequent clinic visits, less understanding of physician's explanation, more lab tests, more emergency room visits, less follow-up, and less satisfaction with health services. The results also indicate that people who are older, poorer, and female tend to have severe language barriers compared to those who are younger, wealthier, and male. Improvement of communication between patients and providers in relation to health disparity consists of cultural competency and communication skills. Implications of these studies for practice and further research are outlined.","218":"Limited access to health care and a system fraught with discriminatory practices inhibit some racial and ethnic minorities from gaining access to health care and assurance of equal treatment once they enter the health care system. The purpose of this chapter is to critically and systematically analyze the research literature to determine what impact individual and institutional racism has had on the prevailing health disparities across racial and ethnic minority groups. The chapter includes the following: (1) a review of the term racism and a brief overview of the history of racism in health care; (2) a review of the research literature analyzing the impact of racism on health disparities; and (3) recommendations to end the systematic institutional racism in scientific research, which is necessary to end health disparities.","219":"Nursing research on race and racism began in the 1970s. However, because these concepts were seen as cultural attitudes, race and racism were obscured. The evidence on the presence of negative attitudes, biases, and stereotypes about different racial and ethnic groups is inconsistent. During the past two decades, research on race and racism has grown, but there is still an urgent need for more high-quality research on this subject. The major recommendations from this review are to conduct observational research on racism in clinical and practice settings, not as an intellectual end in itself; to assist in eliminating of the historically based disparities among members of racial and ethnic groups; and to conduct research about racism as it affects mobility in educational and practice settings.","220":"Numerous policy, research, and practice recommendations have been developed to address the persistent disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Although nurse researchers have made significant contributions in addressing health disparities, there are significant gaps that remain to be addressed. Racial and ethnic minority nurses and nurse researchers have played a significant role in addressing health disparities. The individual and collective contributions of this group of nurses in addressing health disparities is included in this Introduction. Recommendations from chapters presented in this volume of the Annual Review of Nursing Research are highlighted.","221":"This chapter includes a review of the second decade of Annual Review of Nursing Research, Volumes 11-20. The authors analyze the content of these volumes and summarize the significant changes in the nursing scientific community. Also described are the contextual changes related to the development of nursing research.","222":"Maternal mental health is a key factor affecting the quality of parenting and, ultimately, a child's developmental outcomes. Thus, the persistence of mental health problems such as chronic depressive symptoms or addiction in low-income mother-child dyads may be the critical determinant of their collective future. This review examines the research conducted by nurses that focuses on maternal mental health, mothering, and child outcomes in the context of rearing children in poverty. Multiple methods were used for the search. Four programs showed evidence of sustained, related studies focused on the mental health of low-income mothers and their parenting. Two of these programs included intervention studies aimed at improving the mental health of mothers and developmental outcomes for their children. There were four newer programs of research in which the research teams had begun to focus on mothers rearing children in poverty and five other researchers who conducted single studies of maternal mental health. Additionally, two investigators focused on mothers who were prisoners, one team focused on homeless mothers, and another on mothers with HIV. Studies were critiqued using a developmental science framework. Studies varied widely in the degree to which they used developmentally based conceptual frameworks, designs, and measures. While nurse scientists have made progress in conducting research with mothers rearing children in poverty, there is an urgent need for more developmentally sensitive research aimed at strengthening maternal mental health and assisting mothers to be more effective parents in the midst of the challenges of poverty and welfare reform. By doing so, nursing interventions can improve the child's developmental outcomes.","223":"The main purpose of this integrative review is to summarize existing nursing research on the sibling experience of living in a family that includes a child with a chronic illness or disability, specifically highlighting nurse researchers who have conducted more than two studies concerning the sibling experience. A secondary purpose is to determine to what extent nurse researchers interested in the sibling experience have used or been informed by a developmental science perspective. A final purpose is to discuss future research needed to further develop the existing knowledge base concerning the sibling experience of living with childhood chronic illness and disability. Forty of 86 published research articles were authored or co-authored by nurses. There were four nurse researchers with programs of research. Most studies used a categorical approach and were descriptive, cross-sectional designs; there were few longitudinal studies. Multiple factors were identified that affect how siblings respond to childhood chronic illness and disability. Future research needs to focus on siblings and families from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, and outcomes need to be assessed at multiple levels. Furthermore, intervention studies building on the descriptive research are needed.","224":"This review identified nurse researchers and research teams that have current programs of research focused on parents and parenting of children with chronic health problems. Researchers were included if they had at least five publications since 1990, with at least three of these articles first-authored. These programs of research were critiqued from a developmental science perspective. Multiple methods were used for the search, including examination of previous review articles, hand search of journals, online computer searches, and review of the curriculum vitae of authors. Seven programs of research were identified. Two programs of research focused on childhood cancer--Ida M. Martinson et al. and Marsha H. Cohen. Three programs of research used a noncategorical approach encompassing a variety of childhood chronic conditions--Katherine A. Knafl and Janet A. Deatrick, Sharon O. Burke, and Ann Garwick. One program focused primarily on parents of children with Down syndrome and disabilities--Marsha Van Riper--and another on parents of infants with a variety of chronic health problems--Margaret S. Miles and Diane Holditch-Davis. Diverse theories and conceptual frameworks were used, and most had some focus on ecological systems that might affect parents and parenting. Many used a family perspective and included fathers. Still broader aspects of the family and community ecology and the health care were not generally included. Few examined the bidirectionality of the relationship between the child and aspects of the child's illness and parental responses. There was variability in the extent to which ethnicity and socioeconomic status were considered. Studies provide important insight into the responses of parents and their parenting of children with chronic health problems. The studies provide a sound base for continuing to build a developmentally sensitive body of knowledge related to parents and parenting of the child with chronic health problems.","225":"This chapter reviews nursing research from the last decade on children and adolescents coping with chronic illnesses. Studies were identified by searches of MEDLINE and CINAHL and were included if at least one primary author was a nurse, the primary informants were children, and the focus of the study was on children's responses to illness and\/or developmental stressors. Synthesis of the reviewed studies yielded typologies of illness-related and developmental stressors faced by chronically ill children, the coping strategies they commonly employed, and indices of their adjustment to illness. Although there was considerable agreement across illnesses, age ranges, and methodologies, the lack of explicitly employed developmental models or other theoretical perspectives means that very little is known about the processes by which individual characteristics, stressors, coping strategies, and outcomes are related. Recommendations for future research include the development and testing of conceptual models that will promote our understanding of how children's medical, psychosocial, and developmental outcomes can be improved, and a more systematic approach to understanding how children's maturing cognitive abilities affect their appraisal of stress and utilization of coping strategies in response to the demands of chronic illness.","226":"The data-based literature addressing children's psychological responses to hospitalization was reviewed using methods outlined by Cooper (1989). Using a developmental science perspective, early research was reviewed and a model of variables that contribute to children's responses was constructed. This model consists of three major foci, including maturational and cognitive variables (developmental level, experience, coping style), ecological variables (family and hospital milieu), and biological variables (inborn factors and pathophysiology). Coping serves as the overarching framework for examining these variables and their contributions to children's responses to hospitalization. A variety of theoretical perspectives from the social sciences have been used, with psychoanalytic and stress and adaptation theories predominating. The majority of the research used simple case study, descriptive, or pre- and post-test designs. Methodologic issues were common. Little qualitative work has been done. Future research directions call for studies to adopt new theoretical and empirical models that are methodologically rigorous and clinically relevant and that embrace the precepts of developmental science.","227":"This chapter reviews the published research from 1980 through 2001 on the psychosocial adjustment of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. The inclusion criteria were that research was conducted by nurses and researchers from related disciplines that focused on the psychosocial adjustment of children (6 to 12 years) and\/or adolescents (13 to 22 years) with cystic fibrosis (CF). Three computerized databases were used for retrieval: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, and PsycINFO. Of the 74 citations published from 1980 through 2001, only 20 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 7 nursing research studies and 13 studies published by non-nurses in related disciplines. Key findings from this review were that the focus of nursing research was on the social consequences of chronic illness, while the non-nursing research focused on self-concept, self-worth, and psychiatric symptoms of anxiety, worry, and behavior problems. Only two programs of research were identified. Developmental science was used as a guiding framework for the critique of the research. Recommendations for future research include developmentally sensitive longitudinal studies to track developmental change and stability over time, as well as research that captures individual developmental differences.","228":"This paper examines nursing research focused on the symptom experiences of children and adolescents with cancer, and the extent to which the perspective and methods of developmental science have been used in this research. CINALH, MEDLINE, and PSYCHLIT were searched for publications between 1990 and 2002. The researcher or research team had to include a nurse or developmentally oriented researchers from other disciplines. Studies focused exclusively on pain were excluded because of recent published reviews. While nurse researchers have contributed influential knowledge related to symptom experiences and symptom distress in children and adolescents with cancer, this research is still in a formative but exciting stage. Two nurse researchers and their teams laid the foundation for this research through their individual studies and collaborative multisite studies. In general, children and adolescents from 10 through 18 years of age were primarily studied; few studies focused on preschool children. Given the fact that these are rare populations, sample sizes were generally small, limiting power and generalizability. Gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were rarely considered in analyses. Most studies used cross-sectional designs, although several included short-term longitudinal or repeated measure designs. To date, longitudinal designs focused on long-term outcomes have not been conducted. There were only a few qualitative studies. There was limited use of conceptual models or theories, and inadequate attention was paid to broader ecological perspectives in the children's lives. Studies included a focus on global symptoms and on individual symptoms, particularly pain and fatigue. Few focused on nausea and vomiting. Operationalization of symptom distress generally involved adapting instruments designed for adults. A more explicit employment of a developmental science perspective in future studies would call for more longitudinal designs that conceptualize the symptom experience from the perspective of the child and that view their responses as complex and multidimensional in nature. This would necessitate measuring clusters of symptoms at multiple levels (e.g., emotional, behavioral, and biophysiological) using developmental data collection methods. Furthermore, attention needs to be paid in conceptualizing studies to ecological factors related to families, social networks, communities, and ethnicity, as well as to the ecology of the health care system, which likely influences the symptom experience of children.","229":"This chapter summarizes and critiques research on physical symptoms in children and adolescents from a developmental science perspective. Studies conducted by researchers from various disciplines, primarily after 1990, were identified through searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Psyc INFO. This review focuses on two areas: the prevalence of common physical symptoms--headache, abdominal pain or discomfort, musculoskeletal pain and fatigue--in pediatric populations and the developmental issues associated with these symptom experiences. Developmental factors were organized into two overarching categories, individual and environmental factors. Findings indicate that demographic factors, including age, pubertal development, gender, and race or ethnicity; psychological factors, particularly self-esteem, depression, and anxiety; and behavioral factors have varying relationships to the report of physical symptoms in children and youth. In addition, family and parents, peers, and the broader school and community ecology of children have an influence on physical symptom complaints. There is a need for further studies that are strengthened by the use of developmentally sensitive theoretical frameworks and methodologies that address complicated developmental issues.","230":"The development of early oral feeding skills in the preterm infant is an active and complex area of nursing research. This integrative review summarizes the accumulated nursing research since 1990 that describes feeding the preterm infant during the transition from gavage to full oral feeding. Literature was identified through searches of databases covering the fields of nursing and medicine and of journals and nurse researchers who publish in this area of study. Four main areas of research were identified: development of infant feeding skills, descriptive studies on the transition period, studies that focus on identifying infant readiness to begin oral feeding, and studies that explore optimal ways to advance oral feeding as the infant moves toward full oral feeding. Research studies were critiqued from a developmental science perspective, which conceptualizes feeding skill as an emergent property of multiple systems, both within and outside the infant, that are interacting and working together to promote optimal functioning. Through this analysis, areas for future research are identified.","231":"The purpose of this review was to examine the topics covered in current programs of nursing research on the care of the preterm infant and to determine the extent to which this research is informed by developmental science. A researcher was considered to have a current program of research if he or she had at least five publications published since 1990 and was the first author on at least three of them. The infants in a study could be any age from birth throughout childhood; studies focusing on parenting, nursing, or other populations of infants were not included. Seventeen nurse researchers had current programs of research in this area. These programs had four themes. Those of Becker, Evans, Pridham, Shiao, and Zahr focused on infant responses to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment and treatments. Franck, Johnston, and Stevens focused on pain management. Harrison, Ludington-Hoe, and White-Traut's research focused on infant stimulation. Holditch-Davis, McCain, McGrath, Medoff-Cooper, Schraeder, and Youngblut studied infant behavior and development. These research programs had many strengths, including strong interdisciplinary focus and clinical relevance. However, additional emphasis is needed on the care of the critically ill infant. Also, despite the fact that the preterm infant's neurological system develops rapidly over the first year, only three of these researchers used a developmental science perspective. Only research on infant behavior and development focused on the developmental changes that the infants were experiencing. Most of the studies were longitudinal, but many did not use statistics appropriate for identifying stability and change over time. The response of individual infants and the broader ecological context as evidenced by factors such as gender, ethnic group, culture, and intergenerational effects were rarely examined. Thus research on the care of preterm infants could be expanded if the developmental science perspective formed the basis of more studies.","232":"Nursing scholarship on children and their families has increased rapidly over the past decades. This research focuses on infants, children, and adolescents and their families facing acute or chronic illness, as well as on promoting health and preventing disease in children. While the amount and scope of research in pediatric nursing has increased, the methods and theories used are diverse and are often not based on the most recent science in the broader fields of developmental research. Developmental science, which evolved over the past two decades into a new interdisciplinary framework for the study of human development, involves an integrated holistic, developmental, and systems-oriented perspective. According to this view, the individual functions and develops through dynamic and complex processes involving the integration of many systems within the individual, including mental, biological, and behavioral systems. In addition, individuals function and develop in a continuously ongoing, reciprocal process of interaction with their environment and, as such, have an influence on that environment. These nonlinear, dynamic processes demand complex conceptualizations and research designs if one is to truly understand human development, including health and illness. Key aspects of developmental science important in conceptualization, design, measurement, and data analysis are identified. By providing a framework for critiquing research and presenting recommendations for future research based on developmental science, we hope to move nursing research with children forward toward more developmentally sound knowledge of nursing practice.","233":"This chapter provides an overview and critique of the theoretical and research literature by nurse researchers and researchers in other disciplines regarding interventions for persons with dementia (PWD). Reports were included if published in English between 1990 and 2000 and if a descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, or intervention design was used. Case studies and narrative descriptions were not included. No specific age criteria for study participants were applied; however, PWD are generally over age 55. The theoretical literature and various disease stages were reviewed, including clinical and behavioral indicators for disease progression. Using a variety of approaches to survey the extant literature (review of computer databases, contacts with experts in the field, ancestry method, and manual searches of key gerontology journals), over 1,200 citations were initially reviewed, allowing for approximately 375 publications undergoing thorough analysis with 157 research publications being included in this synthesis. Key findings include the identification of well-supported cognitive-behavioral interventions to enhance cognitive functioning and memory, and to relieve depression in the early disease stages; multiple environmental and behavioral approaches for improvement in functioning, maintenance of activities, and alleviation of behavioral symptoms in the middle disease stages; and behavioral, interactive, and staff support and education interventions for adequate nutritional intake, urinary incontinence, and management of problematic vocalizations and other behavioral symptoms in the later disease stages. Recommendations for future studies include the need for development of operational definitions of behavioral symptoms, inclusion of the perspective of PWD, evaluation of long-term outcomes, adequate sample size, community rather than institutional-based studies, and increased intervention testing at various stages of the disease.","234":"This chapter reviews 80 published research reports of pain and pain problems in older adults by nurse researchers and researchers from other disciplines. Reports were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) using the search terms pain, older adult, aged and pain, and dementia. Reports were included if published between 1985 to 2001, if conducted on samples age 60 or older, if conducted by nurses or relevant to nursing research, and if published in English. Descriptive, qualitative, correlational, longitudinal, and intervention studies were included. Key findings include the following: pain is widely prevalent in older adult populations; few studies have included minority groups; under-identification and undertreatment of pain in older adults is a consistent interpretation of research findings; pain intensity rating scales are as valid and reliable in older populations as in younger populations; current observational methods of assessing pain in cognitively impaired older adults must be used with caution; nursing intervention studies demonstrate the beneficial effects of education and interventions aimed at improved pain assessment. The main recommendations are: careful attention should be given to the conceptualization and definition of pain; examination of pain should include physiological, motivational, cognitive, and affective factors; studies evaluating undertreatment of pain should include measures of pain self-report; standardized pain measures should be used; studies of persons over the age of 85 and studies of ethnic minorities are needed; more attention should be given to nursing intervention studies and should include both pharmacological and nonpharmacological, psychosocial interventions.","235":"Elder mistreatment (EM) is a serious and prevalent syndrome that is estimated to affect between 500,000 to 1.2 million older adults in the United States annually (Pillemer &amp; Finkelhor, 1988). This chapter reviews both the state of the published science and limitations in the knowledge base on the topic. The literature for this review was obtained through computer-assisted searches of PubMed (878 citations), the Cumulative Index of Nursing Research (CINAHL) (593 citations) and Psych-Info databases (443 citations). The search terms used were elder mistreatment, elder neglect, elder abuse, or domestic abuse of the elderly. No limit was placed on the age of publications because of the relative scarcity of research on the subject. Nonnursing articles were included because there are so few nurse researchers addressing this topic. The age limit for subjects in these studies was 65 years and older. Studies were limited to those conducted in the United States, and descriptive studies were included as they form the majority of the research to date. Findings indicate that frail, very old (over 75 years), older adults who have a diagnosis of depression or dementia are more likely to be mistreated (Dyer, Pavlik, Murphy, &amp; Hyman, 2000; Coyne, Reichman, &amp; Berbig, 1993; Fulmer &amp; Gurland, 1996; Lachs &amp; Pillemer, 1995; Lachs et al., 1997; Lachs, Williams, O'Brien, Pillemer, &amp; Charlson, 1998; Lachs &amp; Fulmer, 1993; Lachs, Berkman, Fulmer, &amp; Horwitz, 1994). Those older adults who required assistance with activities of daily living had poor social networks and were at higher risk for EM (Lachs &amp; Pillemer, 1995; Lachs et al., 1997; Lachs et al., 1998; Lachs &amp; Fulmer, 1993; Lachs et al., 1994). Neglect, as a subcategory of EM, accounts for the majority of cases (Fulmer, Paveza, Abraham, &amp; Fairchild, 2000; Pavlik, Hyman, Festa, &amp; Bitondo Dyer, 2001; Fulmer &amp; Gurland, 1996). There is still debate regarding the role of minority status, abuse in childhood, and the persons most likely to mistreat older adults. There is a critical need for replication studies and new research on this important topic. Problems with measurement, funding challenges, and the paucity of investigators conducting research on EM have left the field with several unanswered questions and some conflicting findings. This chapter summarizes the interdisciplinary literature and makes recommendations for future nursing research programs.","236":"This chapter reviews 218 published and unpublished research reports of pressure ulcer prevention and management by nurse researchers and researchers from other disciplines. The electronic databases MEDLINE (1966-July 2001), CINAHL (1982-June 2001), AMED (1985-July 2001), and EI Compedex Plus (1980-June 2001) were selected for the searches because of their focus on health and applied research. Moreover, evaluations of previous review articles and seminal studies that were published before 1966 are also included. Research conducted worldwide and published in English between 1930 and 2001 was included for review. Studies using descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, and randomized control trials were included. This review found that numerous gaps remain in our understanding of effective pressure ulcer prevention and management. Moreover, the majority of pressure ulcer care is derived from expert opinion rather than empirical evidence. Thus, additional research is needed to investigate pressure ulcer risk factors of ethnic minorities. Further studies are needed that examine the impact of specific preventive interventions (e.g., turning intervals based on risk stratification) and the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive prevention programs to prevent pressure ulcers. Finally, an evaluation is needed of various aspects of pressure ulcer management (e.g., use of support surfaces, use of adjunctive therapies) and healing of pressure ulcers.","237":"The purpose of this chapter is to review the literature on hearing impairment, specifically the impact of hearing impairment on the functioning of elders, interventions that minimize the impact of hearing loss on functioning, and identification of issues raised by the review for nursing research. Computerized (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL) and manual searches were used to obtain research reports from a range of disciplines. Research articles including elders (&gt; or = 60) and published between 1989 and 2001 were included. Twenty-five articles were selected for critical review, four written by nurses. The diversity of methodologies, the criteria used to define hearing impairment, the range of sample characteristics, and the assessment measures make comparisons across studies difficult. Most studies, however, support the negative impact of hearing impairment, especially on psychosocial functioning. Measures that are condition specific are generally more effective in capturing the impact of hearing loss than generic measures. Findings related to physical disability are less consistent. The results of intervention studies suggest that hearing devices can improve psychosocial and communication outcomes, but behavioral interventions have not shown long lasting benefit. For nurses to assist elders and their families manage the impact of hearing impairment, further research is needed in several areas that have been poorly explored. These include the dyadic experience of hearing impairment, the way in which culture influences the experience of hearing loss, the needs of hearing impaired individuals across settings, the long-term impact of ototoxic medications, and strategies to assist elders in coping with hearing impairment and utilizing available technologies.","238":"The purpose of this chapter is to discuss how genetics will affect gerontological nursing. The chapter will answer two questions: (1) Which aspects of genetics will be most relevant to future gerontological nursing practice? and (2) What will be the impact of genetics on the future of gerontological nursing education and research? MEDLINE was searched for relevant articles from 1995 to 2001 using the key words aging, genetics, geriatrics, nursing education, research, and gerontology. CRISP was searched using the thesaurus terms education\/planning, genetics, health education, model design\/development, psychological model, pubic health curriculum, behavioral\/social science research, and research nursing\/genetics. A total of 101 nursing and nonnursing articles were reviewed. Research reports were selected if they focused on issues related to gerontological nursing. Articles were reviewed that had application to genetic nursing, complex diseases, and genetics. The evolution of the science of genetics will revolutionize gerontological nursing and affect future nursing education and research as the concepts of genetic science and the technology they generate are translated into everyday clinical practice. Genetic discoveries in common complex diseases will affect care provided by gerontological nurses in the 21st century. Gerontological nurses must move quickly to recognize this genetic paradigm shift and to incorporate genetics issues into their nursing practice.","239":"This chapter reviews 60 published research reports about maintaining and improving physical function in elders. Reports were identified through searches of MEDLINE and CINAHL using the following search terms: Activities of Daily Living, aged, nursing care, nurse-patient relations, geriatric nursing, nursing assessment, geriatric assessment, behavior therapy, disability evaluation, exercise, and physical. Reports were included if published in English between 1985 and 2000, if conducted in adults over age 60, and if the first author was a nurse or the reported intervention was implemented by nurses. Descriptive and experimental studies of physical function in elders were included. The results of this synthesis showed that nurse scientists have developed new instruments to measure physical function, including scales sensitive to changes in physical function caused by dementia. Nursing studies have described many of the physical and psychological factors associated with poor physical function in elders, though environmental factors and ethnic differences in physical function merit further study. Many nurse scientists are currently investigating behavioral interventions, exercise interventions, and changes in nursing care that could improve the physical function of both community-dwelling elders and those who live in residential facilities.","240":"This chapter reviews reports of research conducted worldwide from 1966 to January 2001 on telehealth interventions in clinical nursing for elders. Reports were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ERIC, and ACM using the search terms Telemedicine or Health Information Networks, Nursing, and Research, and were restricted to those published in English. Reports of research using interactive computer technology to assess or intervene with nursing problems commonly observed in persons age 65 and older were sought. Only published reports presenting the findings of an exploratory or experimental study and exploring the association between one intervention variable and technology were included. The search resulted in 18 research reports describing eight research projects. Due to the preponderance of demonstrations and feasibility reports, the dearth of experimental investigations, and the heterogeneous nature of the few studies identified, statistical summarization was not attempted. Telehealth interventions have the potential to improve the clinical nursing care of elders because they provide alternative, equivalent approaches to assess key indicators of the physical and psychological state of elders; are acceptable to nurses, elders, and family caregivers; and may prove less costly than face-to-face interventions. Telehealth approaches provide not only acceptable substitutes for discrete nursing actions but also can serve as a context within which a large range of professional gerontological nursing services can be delivered in a manner that is timely and convenient for elders.","241":"This chapter reviews 69 published research reports of home health care from a health services perspective by nurse researchers and researchers from other disciplines. Reports were identified through searches of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Social Sciences Citation Index using the following search terms: home health care, health services research, and elders. Within the major areas identified, the following additional terms were specified: resource use and outcomes. Reports were included if published between 1995 and 2001, used samples age 65 and older, performed in the U.S., and published in English. Studies of all types were included. The key findings follow: (a) Most studies were a theoretical. If a theoretical model was used, it was most often the Andersen Behavioral Model. (b) Few conclusions can be drawn about resource use--increasing age and higher severity of health related problems are associated with higher numbers of home visits. The variety of measures of resource use and the study approaches (large national data sets versus single or several agency samples) limits the ability to draw conclusions on resource use. (c) There is a growing body of evidence on rehospitalization of home health care patients which indicates rehospitalization is prevalent but largely not predictable. (d) Patient outcomes research is inconclusive at this point, primarily because there are few studies that examine patient outcomes using a consistent set of measures. The main recommendations are: to study rehospitalization using a more profile-based approach to determine visit patterns that may be effective, to further specify the kinds of outcomes that may be achieved as a result of home health care and which patients might be expected to achieve positive outcomes, and to examine the integration of home health care with the broader community-based services.","242":"This chapter reviews the state of knowledge about nursing homes and assisted living facilities as places for dying. Reviewed are 25 published and unpublished research reports by nurse researchers and researchers from other disciplines that address the following questions: (a) What is known about how communication and shared decision-making about end-of-life care preferences occur? (b) How are symptoms assessed and managed at end-of-life? and (c) What are facility characteristics that influence end-of-life care services delivery? Reports were identified through searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Health Star, PsychLit, Ageline, Ebsco, and PubMed. The following terms guided the search: advance directives, geriatric assessment or nursing, health services for the aged, hospice, residential facilities, palliative care, symptom management, and terminal care. Reports were included if published between 1990 and 2000, if relevant to nursing research on end-of-life care, if conducted on samples age 65 or older and living in nursing home or residential care settings, and if published in English. The studies reviewed were primarily descriptive. The findings indicate that little is known about end-of-life care in these settings, and that family and staff perspectives differ on the nature and quality of the services provided. Both external and internal factors influence the ability of facilities to provide end-of-life care. Recommendations are provided for further research related to nursing homes and assisted living facilities as places for dying.","243":"This review was undertaken to present and critique the most recent (1990-2000) empirical evidence about end-of-life care for older adult patients in ICUs, their families, and care providers. The studies (including descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, and intervention) were found using a combination of these terms: (a) intensive care (units) or critical care (units), and (b) critical illness, critically ill patients, terminally ill, terminal care, life support care, or palliative care. The computerized databases searched were CINAHL and MEDLINE. Only published studies of persons 44 years of age or older, written in English, and conducted in the U.S. or Canada were included. Research was not limited to studies conducted by or written by nurses. Excluded were articles focused on physiology, for example, studies of treatment for specific conditions, and articles focused on predictors of ICU outcomes.","244":"This chapter reviews 73 published and unpublished research reports of interventions for family members caring for an elder with dementia by nurse researchers and researchers from other disciplines. Reports were identified through searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Social Science Index, PsycINFO, ERIC, Social Work Abstracts, American Association of Retired Persons database, CRISP index of the National Institutes of Health, Cochrane Center database, and Dissertation Abstracts using the following search terms: caregiver, caregiving, dementia, Alzheimer's, intervention study, evaluation study, experimental, and quasi-experimental design. Additional keywords were used to narrow or expand the search as necessary. All nursing research was included in the review and nonnursing research was included if published between 1991 and 2001. Studies were included if they used a design that included a treatment and control group or a one-group, pretest-posttest design (ex post facto designs were included if they used a comparison group). Key findings show that approximately 32% of the study outcomes (e.g., burden, depression, knowledge) were changed after intervention in the desired direction. In addition, several problematic issues were identified including small, diverse samples; lack of intervention specificity; diversity in the length, duration, and intensity of the intervention strategies; and problematic outcome measures.","245":"This chapter reviews 94 published research reports on transitional care of older adults by nurse researchers and researchers from other disciplines. Reports were identified through searches of MEDLINE, CINAHL, HealthSTAR, Sociological Abstracts and PsycINFO using combinations of the following search terms: transitional care, discharge planning, care coordination, case management, continuity of care, referrals, postdischarge follow-up, patient assessment, patient needs, interventions, and evaluation. Reports were included if published between 1985 and 2001, if conducted on samples age 55 and older, if relevant to nursing research, and if published in English. Intervention studies had to have a control or comparison group and a test for statistical significance. Four key findings from this review were identified. A high proportion of elders and their caregivers report substantial unmet transitional care needs, with the need for information and increased access to services consistently among the top priorities. Differences in expectations between and among patients, families, and health care providers, and the need for increased patient and family involvement in decision making, are common themes in discharge planning studies. Gaps in communication have been identified through the discharge planning process. Evidence about the effects of innovations in transitional care on quality and cost outcomes is sparse. Four main recommendations are made. Differences in older adults' transitional care needs based on race, ethnicity, and educational level, with attention to potential disparities, require further study. Studies of strategies to promote effective involvement of patients and families in decision making throughout discharge planning are needed. The development and testing of referral and other information systems designed to promote the transfer of accurate and complete information across sites of care should be a research focus. A priority for future research should be continued study of strategies to improve transitional care outcomes of older adults and their caregivers.","246":"Contemporary women fulfill multiple social roles: wife or partner, parent and caregiver to elders, worker in the labor force. This chapter focuses on women and employment. Nursing research from the past decade on women and their role in the work force, with emphasis on the relationships between paid work and women's other social roles and their health is reviewed. Major categories of nursing research contributions are summarized, including populations studied, methodological approaches, and major findings. Suggestions for emphases in future research are included.","247":"This chapter analyzes the literature on women as mothers; research reports published between January 1985 and December 1999 were reviewed. As in the past, almost all of the extant studies analyzed the experience of mothers in their children's first year of life. Although therapeutic suggestions were made in many studies, relatively few interventions have been implemented and evaluated. More studies are needed that go beyond traditional family forms and that explore mothers' role development over the full course of their children's growth and development. Additional longitudinal research that views maternal role development as a process is indicated.","248":"The National Institute for Nursing Research (NINR) has been active in developing a research portfolio of investigator-initiated studies in addressing the cause and consequences of menstrual cycle and menopause-related health problems. This chapter provides an overview of the nature and level of research activity funded by NINR since its inception in 1986, major findings generated by the most successful award recipients, the impact on the broader field of women's reproductive health and directions for future research. Presented here is an analysis of research designs and methodologies framed within the context of 4 stages of scientific development in the field: exploratory, descriptive studies in well women; illness as a biobehavioral phenomenon; knowledge generation in understudied populations; and the development and testing of clinical therapeutics for symptom management and health promotion strategies. Nursing science contributions to the NINR portfolio of women's health research has been focused primarily on the definition and management of the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and menopause. The increasing numbers of intervention studies suggests a coming-of-age in nursing science with respect to the development of evidence-based outcome data for the management of menstrual cycle and menopause-related symptoms. Clearly, the range and diversity of NINR grant-funded activity suggest that menstrual cycle research is a strong area of interest in nursing science.","249":"Women are more likely to live longer with chronic illness and have a long-term relationship with their health care provider; this requires a situation in which patients and providers have a role in managing illness. In this chapter, the authors provide a conceptual overview of decision making along with key issues: historical concepts related to patients and providers, consumerism, informed choice\/consent, patient rights, shared decision making, patient involvement, as well as an overview of models of patient\/provider partnerships. This review builds on the work of O'Connor et al. (1999), which resulted in a Cochrane review of decision aids and focuses the examination of patient decision aids that support women's decisions regarding health treatment or screening. The authors conclude with a look to the future and recommendations for research in the area of shared decision making and health care decision aids.","250":"In this first chapter, we trace the historical roots of nursing research and scholarship focused on protecting and promoting women's health. Beginning with Florence Nightingale, modern nursing's first researcher, who focused on the health impact of women's daily lives through her detailed observations of human behavior. More recently, nursing's contributions to women's health over the past 30 years have redefined women's health, proposed new frameworks for understanding women's health; provided reviews of the women's health literature across disciplines; developed communities of nurse scholars and researchers focused on new areas of women's health research; generated and expanded the knowledge base for women's health practice and education; promoted a global view of women's health; and proposed new models for women's health care delivery. Clearly, a community of nursing scholars, developed over the past 25 years, has contributed to advancing women's health knowledge and improving the health and well-being of women. Without the benefit of a crystal ball, we suggest that nursing will continue to provide leadership in the conduct and the application of research to improve women's health and women's lives.","251":"An examination of women's transition through menopause provides a remarkable example of nursing's contributions to feminist scholarship. The predominant biomedical model perpetuates the idea that menopause is a deficiency disease, whereas feminist and nurse scholars have deconstructed this paradigm and have reclaimed menopause as a part of midlife women's developmental stage. We begin this chapter with a review of the birth of women's health scholarship as it is the foundation for theory that undergirds feminist nursing research. We then discuss the tenets of feminist scholarship. The historical context of menopause is reviewed briefly to highlight the ways in which menopause was transformed from a normal physiological event to a disease. Using this as a backdrop, we reviewed nursing studies in two emerging bodies of knowledge. We reviewed 10 studies in the area of \"women reclaiming menopause\" and found that over all women believe the menopausal transition is a normal developmental stage. The second area of new research looks at \"menopause across cultures.\" The studies of Korean, Indian, and Thai women reviewed demonstrate that similar to other health issues, the experience of Western women cannot be universalized, and most important, researchers must take into consideration the social, political, economic, and cultural forces that impact women's experience of the menopause transition.","252":"Intimate partner violence against women has received considerable attention from nurse-researchers over the past 10 years. Although the amount and sophistication of both quantitative and qualitative research have changed over time, nursing research on intimate partner violence against women has not lost its perspective; nurse-researchers have continued to address women survivors' full range of human responses to violence. Research into violence during pregnancy and battered women's psychological responses to abuse have received considerable attention. Research into violence during pregnancy and battered women's psychological responses to abuse have received considerable attention. Research into violence during pregnancy accounts for fully 20% of all the reviewed nursing research. The largely qualitative research into women's psychological responses to violence is particularly rich and remarkably similar across multiple studies. International studies on intimate partner violence are beginning to appear in the literature and research that addresses the unique experience of ethnically diverse women is occurring with greater frequency. The purpose of this chapter is to review nursing research on intimate partner violence against women in the past decade. Future directions for nursing research, practice, and education are included.","253":"This chapter provides a review and synthesis of research on women's sleep and fatigue from a nursing perspective. Most of the research involves four primary issues for women: menstrual cycles, childbearing, chronic mental or physical illness, and oncology. Research with healthy women focused on diurnal fluctuations in fatigue and relationships to sleep, without regard for exercise or level of daytime activity. Research on chronic illness and cancer fatigue focused on general fatigue and its impact on activity, without regard for sleep or therapeutic use of rest and naps. A comparison of these two areas highlights gaps in nursing knowledge about sleep and fatigue. Further research is needed to understand relationships between nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and symptoms related to poor quality of life. From a synthesis of these studies, nonpharmacologic interventions that could be prove useful in promoting a higher quality of life for those with either acute or chronic fatigue are then proposed.","254":"This review focused on published research reports that explored the association between stress and women's health and illness. Because of the vastness of the literature, the review was limited to three conceptual areas. The first included those studying the association between stress and illness. Most were correlational in design, thus lacking the power to support assertions of a cause-and-effect relationship. The second focused on studies of the psychophysiology of stress. These studies provide nurse scientists and clinicians with insights into the underlying pathology of stress. When paired with behavioral measures, these studies provide a window into brain mechanisms involved in mind\/body interactions. The third conceptual area included those studies of stress reduction therapies to influence health and illness. These studies have yielded a mighty arsenal of interventions that may be used to reduce distress.","255":"Immigrant women's health is a relatively new research area. At the beginning of the 1990s, nurse scholars concluded that there was insufficient research on this topic. They recommended broadening the overly narrow research foci on immigrant women's childbearing and on select populations, developing national data bases, identifying high-risk groups, and developing population-specific interventions. This chapter reviews 292 research articles published in journals during the 1990s about adult immigrant women's health. It: (1) summarizes research findings on topics that were the major foci of research conducted in the 1990s, (2) evaluates progress over the last decade in the research agenda proposed above, and (3) makes recommendations for research in the new millennium.","256":"Research on lesbian health and health care is very limited, but is beginning to increase. Evidence of limited access to care, homophobic attitudes of health care professionals, and expected or actual negative experiences in interactions with health care professionals help to explain why lesbians are less likely than other women to seek health care. Lesbians have many of the same physical health needs that other women do, but the most prevalent topics on which research could be found were screening for breast and cervical cancer, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV. More research has been conducted in areas related to mental health, such as stress, use of therapy, alcohol abuse and recovery, and violence. The chief conclusion from this review is that there is a need for all types of research in all areas of lesbian health.","257":"Family caregivers are the mainstay of long-term care, as they enable chronically ill elders and children to remain at home. The majority of family caregivers are women and historically their caregiving role has been viewed as an extension of their roles as wife and mother. Although numerous studies report the stresses associated with family caregiving and are predictors of burden, less attention has been given to interventions for family caregivers. The objective of this review is to examine reports of interventions to reduce family caregiver burden, to consider their implications for nursing practice, and to identify directions for future nursing research.","258":"The period of 1960 to 1999 was an era of evolution and rapid growth of scientific research in the discipline of nursing during which specific knowledge realms, or subfields of the discipline, emerged and scientific breakthroughs occurred. This review presents the milestones or scientific breakthroughs of the era in the context of the prevailing thinking within and beyond the discipline of nursing. The nature of each scientific breakthrough in nursing is characterized as to the transdisciplinary change in thinking brought about by the work. The pathfinders for each scientific breakthrough are identified as well as their pathfinding modes. Opportunities for future scientific breakthroughs in nursing are presented.","259":"The purposes of this review were to analyze and evaluate the results of school-based studies that have used population-wide approaches for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and to assess the extent to which strategies tested to date have been effective for minority populations in the United States. The literature included in the review was restricted to studies published between 1986 and August 1999; they sampled elementary, middle, or high school students and incorporated a control or comparison group. There were no consistent effects of school-based interventions on blood pressure, lipid profiles, or measures of body mass and obesity. There was evidence that changes in knowledge and health behaviors occurred. Findings are interpreted within the context of population-wide approaches to prevention, and recommendations for future research directions are discussed.","260":"Substance abuse often begins in adolescence and is a major factor determining health outcomes for adolescents and adults; thus, it is an important focus for prevention strategies. The use of drugs, especially alcohol, can lead to chronic addiction to substances as well as contribute to a number of common chronic conditions. These conditions include cancer, cardiovascular disease, disability from accidents or violence, and unplanned pregnancy and are major causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescents and adults. As the major social unit responsible for socialization of children and stabilization of adult personalities, the family has been the target of prevention efforts. In this chapter the empirical literature on family interventions to prevent substance use in adolescents is critically reviewed, generalizations and implications for practice identified, and directions for future research projected.","261":"During the past decade, research on urinary incontinence and its management has grown significantly. Behavioral therapy is now viewed as an important first line of treatment for stress, urge, and mixed urinary incontinence. This chapter provides a critical review of the intervention studies on lifestyle modifications, bladder training, and pelvic floor muscle training conducted in adult ambulatory care populations that were published in 1988 through 1999. Recommendations for future research are provided.","262":"The purpose of this review is to examine the research literature on interventions for children with type 1 diabetes and their families, with a specific focus on three types of intervention (educational and psychosocial\/behavioral interventions that focus on individuals with diabetes and family interventions for families, usually parents, of individuals with diabetes). The aim of the review is to determine what interventions produce what outcomes in what populations of children and families. The review includes articles that met the following criteria: (a) empirical study reporting the impact of an intervention on such outcomes as knowledge, behavior, self-care, and metabolic control; (b) children with type 1 diabetes and\/or their families as primary subjects; (c) publication between 1980 and January 1, 1999; and (d) publication in English. A total of 41 published papers were included. On the basis of this review, conclusions are as follows: (a) Educational interventions are useful in improving diabetes knowledge but not consistently helpful in improving metabolic control; (b) psychosocial interventions, especially coping skills training and peer support, assist primarily adolescents to improve adjustment and sometimes metabolic control; and (c) family interventions may be helpful in reducing parent-child conflict about diabetes management and care.","263":"The purpose of this review is to examine the research literature on interventions aimed at caregivers who, in the current health care environment, are assuming increasing responsibility for the complex care of significant others experiencing cancer. The general aim of the review is to synthesize the literature on interventions targeted to cancer caregivers and to summarize outcomes associated with the various intervention strategies described. Three broad categories of interventions were described in the literature: (1) educational, (2) counseling\/psychotherapeutic, and (3) hospice and palliative home care. The review included studies that met the following criteria: data-based studies that described an intervention aimed at assisting caregivers to care for patients with cancer, studies published between 1975 and January 1999, and studies published in English. A total of 29 published papers was included. Although the original intent was to limit the review to studies that associated interventions with outcomes, a lack of well-delineated outcome variables was revealed as a major gap in the literature. Thus, some studies that did not include outcome variables were reviewed and the following conclusions made: (1) there is a dearth of data-based literature describing interventions aimed at caregivers; interventions that are described often lack well-defined effects due to a lack of or poor operationalization of outcomes; (2) of the small number of studies in this area, many used small samples and lacked randomization; and (3) studies often revealed selection bias to well-adjusted caregivers who were accepting of support, able to obtain respite care in order to participate, and often willing to avail themselves of a group-style intervention.","264":"Heart failure is the single most costly health care expenditure in the United States. The major proportion of these costs is attributable to rehospitalizations, and by many estimates the majority of rehospitalizations might be preventable with better health care delivery. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the number of heart failure disease management programs put in place across the country to try to decrease the economic burden of heart failure and improve patient outcomes. Yet few of these are based on programs tested by researchers, let alone tested in randomized, controlled trials. This chapter summarizes findings from studies of heart failure disease management programs from 1980 to the present, critiques those studies, and offers suggestions for future research in this area.","265":"Nonadherence to treatment regimen is a prevalent problem of patients with chronic disorders. Approximately half of the patients with a chronic disease have problems following their prescribed regimen to the extent that they are unable to obtain optimum clinical benefit. This chapter reviews the state of knowledge regarding adherence to chronic disease regimens across the life span and demonstrates that the extent and nature of the adherence problems are similar across diseases, across regimens, and across age groups. Adherence to the commonly prescribed regimens is addressed, including pharmacological therapies, therapeutic diets, and therapeutic exercise. Randomized, controlled studies focusing on various educational, behavioral, cognitive, and affective interventions to improve adherence are included. Based on this review, further work is needed to better understand and improve adherence. New strategies for analysis and measurement will support these needed advances in the field of adherence.","266":"In this chapter, research related to quality of life in children with epilepsy and their psychosocial needs is reviewed. Nursing and nonnursing research reports and descriptions of instruments developed between January 1994 and February 1999 are included. Most research reports described quality-of-life problems, especially psychological functioning in school-age children. Less attention was devoted to psychosocial needs. Major gaps included intervention studies and research on infants and young children. Conclusions include recommendations for future research.","267":"Chronic illness in a general sense and certain chronic diseases in particular have attracted considerable attention from qualitative researchers in nursing as well as in other health and social sciences. This review critically examines the body of available research about the experience of living with a chronic illness from an \"insider\" perspective. From this foundation the authors interpret the manner in which this large body of writing both contributes to and complicates our theoretical understanding of what it is like to live with a chronic disease. In so doing they illuminate themes within the knowledge that can be gleaned from qualitative inquiry into the chronic illness experience, as well as inherent limitations that must be taken into consideration when applying such knowledge to practice.","268":"This chapter reviews psychoeducational and\/or psychosocial interventions designed to improve cognitive function in adults without cognitive impairment. Included are sections on (a) meta-analyses and other reviews; (b) cognitive aging and cognitive improvement; (c) memory training; (d) depression and memory improvement; (e) self-efficacy and aging memory; (f) maintenance of gains and subject retention; (g) comprehensive memory improvement program; and (h) future research. Several aspects of memory training now known to influence outcomes, i.e., memory performance, need to be considered in future studies. First, follow-up instruction (booster sessions) facilitates the use of these newly learned memory strategies in elders' everyday lives. Second, elders' memory self-efficacy (beliefs and confidence) impacts performance. Third, the inclusion of subjective measures in memory training is recommended. Fourth, greater emphasis needs to be placed on the modification of participants' attitudes toward aging-related memory loss. Fifth, designs must emphasize the long-term outcomes of the memory training. Sixth, establishing a relationship between a memory intervention and functional ability (IADLs) is the next step in assisting older adults to remain independent. If early failure in cognitive ability can be improved through intervention, perhaps early decline in functional independence and the need for formal services, e.g., nursing home placement, can be delayed.","269":"Nursing in Italy is achieving a higher academic status as a result of decades of efforts in scientific knowledge development. Beginning in the 1980s, Italian nurses, supported by researchers from allied disciplines, have begun to design and implement research at the local, regional, and national level. This study is the first effort ever made to identify the main characteristics of Italian nursing research published in Italian journals. The review covers 14 years (1983-1997). Overall, 240 studies from 11 journals, research reports from books, and several conference proceedings have been considered. Inclusion criteria were based on quality of research design, considering components such as sampling, sample size, and method of data analysis. Each article was analyzed according to an interpretive scheme focusing on method of analysis, scientific merit, and authorship. Of the 240 studies reviewed, journal articles selected from ten Italian journals accounted for 175 (73%), or the majority, of reviewed sources. Sixty-five (26%) research reports complete the remaining number. The major areas of research identified include nursing practice (43%), nursing education (6%), nursing administration and professional issues (34%), and knowledge and perceptions in society and nursing (17%). The majority of the research studies utilized survey models (47%), including several retrospective and longitudinal studies, followed by exploratory or descriptive (36%) and quasi-experimental (17%) designs. Many reports failed to identify the method of sampling used in the research design. However, of those that did, convenience samples were most often used. Random sampling was rarely reported. The majority of studies employed only descriptive statistics (i.e., frequency distribution, central tendency, variability, contingency tables, and correlation). Only few studies made use of advanced statistics for testing hypotheses (parametric and non-parametric tests) among which only a low percentage cited reliability testing. In 42% of the studies, the authors were represented by a group of nurses. Nurses and physicians worked together to author another 30% of the studies. The remaining studies were authored by either individual nurses (24%) or nurses and nonmedical professionals (4%). Much of the reviewed research has been carried out by nurses who have little or no research training.","270":"In this chapter, the research on uncertainty in chronic illness is reviewed and critiqued. Two theoretical perspectives of uncertainty that can be applied across the range of chronic illness are presented. Research on the causes and consequences of uncertainty in chronic illness are considered and critiqued. The review addresses research on adults and on parents of chronically ill children. Conclusions include the areas requiring further investigation.","271":"Primary Health Care (PHC) has been promulgated for over two decades as a global strategy for ensuring basic health care for all people. PHC is characterized by equity, accessibility, availability of resources, social participation, intersectoral community action, and cultural sensitivity. While PHC can be discussed as philosophy or a process, it is critical that PHC be understood as a community focus in health care that differs from a primary care focus on individuals. Capturing PHC components in community-based interventions in order to advance the development of a rigorous research base requires a shift in thinking about what constitutes acceptable methods and evidence for evaluating changes in health care. To this end, the authors of this review discuss perspectives and available research that inform practice within multidisciplinary teams, highlight the importance of social discourse, and review participatory evaluation issues for achieving a working relationship with communities. Particular attention is focused on education for nurses' roles in PHC activities within implementation models fostering community mobilization and development. An action plan is suggested as a means for situating discrete research activity within a PHC framework.","272":"In this paper, published research studies addressing the phenomenon of wandering in dementia are reviewed. Empirical findings of 108 studies are categorized and summarized to reveal dimensions of wandering behavior, significance of wandering as a clinical phenomenon, correlates of wandering, and tested intervention strategies. Implications for improving methodological rigor of future studies are offered and gaps in the current knowledge base are identified.","273":"Low back pain is a common and costly social problem. Many of the long term outcomes of chronic low back pain (CLBP), such as those related to occupational and social function or patient and family coping, are sensitive to nursing intervention. To identify potentially productive areas for nursing intervention research, studies from 1990 to 1998 were reviewed that investigated (a) potential early indicators that acute or subchronic low back pain would result in chronic pain and disability, (b) patient perspectives on adaptation to chronic pain, and (c) the value of interventions undertaken during the acute and subchronic phases of back pain to modify long-term outcomes. Sixteen quantitative studies were identified that prospectively investigated the natural history and outcomes of low back pain. Six qualitative studies that investigated the perspectives of patients with back pain were also identified. Ten randomized clinical trials were identified that investigated interventions undertaken during the acute or subchronic stages of back pain. Clinical interventions that included advice to re-engage in activity, support to develop personalized goals, reinforcement for healthy gains and appropriate functional activities, and physical conditioning exercises tended to be successful in returning patients to work or limiting their self-reported disability and pain. Interventions that promoted communication at the work-site or modified the patient's job were also successful in promoting a faster return to work. Nonetheless, this is a nascent area of research in need of improvements related to the selection of appropriate subjects and controls, the timing and duration of interventions, and the reliability with which interventions are implemented. Furthermore, patients with back pain are most likely to benefit when nursing theories about chronic pain are linked to clinical intervention research.","274":"Data for this review of chronobiology, chronopharmacology, chronotherapeutics and pain were derived from electronic searches of the medical literature (Medline) utilizing both Silver Platter and OVID search engines. Further information was obtained from personal conversations with members of the International Society for Chronobiology involved in chronopharmacology and pain research and reviews of non-Medline-referenced materials and journals such as Chronobiologia and the Annual Review of Chronopharmacology. A variety of data from proceedings were available, but was not utilized because of their nonreferred status and the relative unavailability of such sources; however, peer-reviewed, published proceedings have been included in this review. A total of 62 studies were identified as relevant to this review of biological rhythms and pain; of these, only 6 were conducted by nurses. Studies were broadly categorized by purpose as experimental chronobiology in humans (9), experimental chronobiology in animals (12), clinical chronobiology (25), chronopharmacology in animals (6), chronopharmacology in humans (6), and chronotherapeutic interventions (4). All statistically significant findings were reported at the p &lt; 0.05 level.","275":"The review of acute pain describes the problem of unresolved pain and its effects on the neural, autonomic, and immune systems. Conceptualizations and mechanisms of pain are reviewed as well as theories of pain management. Descriptive studies of patient and nurse factors that inhibit effective pain management are discussed, followed by studies of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. Critical analysis reveals that most studies were atheoretical, and therefore, this proliferation of information lacked conceptual coherence and organization. Furthermore, the nature and extent of barriers to pain management were described, but few intervention studies have been devised, as yet, to modify the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of nurses and patients that are barriers to pain management. Although some of the complementary therapies have sufficient research support to be used in clinical pain management, the physiological mechanisms and outcomes need to be studied. It is critical at this time to design studies of interventions to improve assessment, decision making, attentive care, and patient teaching.","276":"The term patient-centered communication (PCC) has been used to describe a group of communication strategies and behaviors that promote mutuality, shared understandings, and shared decision making in health care encounters. There is evidence to suggest that advanced practice nurse and patients use these strategies to co-produce highly individualized clinical discourse. Although the communication behaviors associated with PCC have been studied separately, their impact as an integrated communications strategy has not been studied. Suggestions for developing PCC as a mid-range theory of health care communication encompassing other more specific communication concepts are offered.","277":"For the past several decades, papers in the nursing literature have advocated the use of cognitive interventions in clinical practice. Increasing consumer use of complementary therapies, a cost-driven health care system, and the need for evidence-based practice all lend urgency to the validation of the efficacy of these interventions. This review focuses specifically on guided imagery intervention studies identified in the nursing, medical and psychological literature published between 1966 and 1998. Included were 46 studies of the use of guided imagery for management of psychological and physiological symptoms. There is preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of guided imagery in the management of stress, anxiety and depression, and for the reduction of blood pressure, pain and the side effects of chemotherapy. Overall, results of this review demonstrated a need for systematic, well-designed studies, which explore several unanswered questions regarding the use of guided imagery. These include the effects of different imagery language, symptoms for which guided imagery is effective, appropriate and sensitive outcome measures, method of delivery of the intervention and optimum dose and duration of the intervention, and individual factors that influence its effectiveness.","278":"Insomnia is among the most frequent health complaints brought to the attention of primary care providers. The prevalence estimates are highest in women, older adults, and patients with medical or psychiatric disorders. Clinical researchers have studied many barriers to sleep as well as some sleep promotion interventions for the ill and aging adult. Environmental, personal, and person-environment rhythm factors have been identified as correlates of poor sleep. All interventions studied by nurse researchers are non-pharmacological and have been classified as interventions that (a) create an environment more conductive to sleep, (b) relax the sleeper, or (c) entrain the circadian sleep-wake rhythm. This chapter summarizes results of published research on correlates of poor sleep and interventions to promote sleep. The chapter includes the relevant studies conducted by researchers in related disciplines as well as nurses' research. The arcs software package was used to facilitate summarization of intervention studies. It was concluded that correlates of poor sleep are well described, but theories of sleep promotion are not well explicated. Also, the research base for sleep promotion interventions for use with clinical populations other than those with chronic insomnia is sparse. Gaps in knowledge are identified and conceptual and methodological issues are discussed as the basis for future directions in sleep promotion research.","279":"Nurses have used music as an intervention for many years. A sizeable number of investigations to determine the efficacy of music in managing pain, in decreasing anxiety and aggressive behaviors, and in improving performance and well-being have been conducted by nurses and other health professionals. Nursing and non-nursing research reports published between the years 1980-1997 were reviewed. Great variation existed in the type of musical selection used, the dose of the intervention (number of sessions and length exposure), the populations studied, and the methodologies used. Overall, music was found to be effective in producing positive outcomes.","280":"Psychiatric nursing research has historically focused on psychosocial phenomena characteristic of personal experience or symptomatology associated with mental illness. The current climate of the mental health service system and basic science knowledge proliferation require nurse researchers to develop and evaluate interventions based on biological understanding of symptoms. This review examines psychiatric nursing and the broader psychiatric literature from 1990 to 1996 to provide a synthesis of the current research knowledge about important components of the field of schizophrenia research including causal processes, course and outcome, symptoms, treatment, relapse prevention, and consumer providers, followed by a discussion of directions for future research.","281":"People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience deterioration in functional status, therefore improving functional status is a major goal of treatment. We reviewed interventions to improve functional status in people with COPD published from 1980 through September 1996. Randomized controlled clinical trials were reviewed to document outcomes in terms of functional capacity and functional performance for the following interventions: pharmacologic therapy including theophylline, inhaled bronchodilators, steroids, antianxiolytics and antidepressants; general exercise strategies including exercise training, exercise and comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation, and upper extremity training; inspiratory muscle therapy including inspiratory muscle training and inspiratory muscle rest; nutritional therapy; oxygen therapy; and specialized nursing care. Improvements for functional capacity were documented in terms of strength of the inspiratory muscles and upper extremities, walking tests, and peak oxygen uptake. Most interventions were targeted to enhance functional capacity, and few were aimed at enhancing functional performance. Further research is needed to examine the relationship between functional capacity and functional performance and to design and test interventions to improve functional performance.","282":"Adolescence is a time of risk taking and exploration. The adolescent's exploration of the developmental and physical changes taking place often puts the adolescent at greater risk than at any other time in life. The risk-taking behaviors involve sexual activity, experimentation with substances including cigarettes and alcohol, rebellion against paternal norms, suicidal behavior, and violence. This chapter focuses on the potential outcome of one of these risky behaviors: sexual activity. The intent is to summarize the findings of the research community on the pregnancy and parenting programs for adolescents. A summary of some of the recent research and demonstration projects for pregnant and parenting adolescents is provided. Published and unpublished articles from a variety of disciplines are included. These articles vary by method, type of program, location, and outcome measurement. Methodological issues related to the preponderance of quasi-experimental designs with small samples and demonstration projects are addressed. The lack of theoretically driven, longitudinal research that is specific to the developmental level of the population is discussed, and directions are suggested for future research. This chapter in a volume of the Annual Review of Nursing Research devoted to health issues in pediatric nursing summarizes research findings on pregnancy and parenting programs for adolescents in the US.  The introduction, which describes the risk factors associated with adolescence and the particular risk of unintended pregnancy and acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases that have accompanied decreasing ages of sexual initiation and increasing numbers of sexual partners among adolescents, points out that many intervention programs that seek to address the needs of developing adolescents lack an evaluative component and a theoretical base.  The next section presents the scope of this review, which focuses on programs for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents.  The chapter continues by reviewing 1) three pregnancy prevention programs not included in a 1995 compendium prepared by Moore, Sugarland, et al. and 2) prenatal and parenting programs.  A look at programs deemed most effective at changing maternal or fetal outcomes is accomplished through a review of research on comprehensive programs, other types of programs, programs that consider differences in parenting among ethnic or racial groups, program location, development of practice models, intervention studies, and the adolescent father.  The chapter ends with a summary that indicates the need for application of a more rigorous and systematic approach to this research in order to create a body of knowledge with a strong theoretical base and conceptual clarity. ","283":"Previous research has focused almost exclusively on the burden and the negative effects of caregiving on the primary caregivers of the chronically ill. This prior research has provided a backdrop for understanding the psychological and physical challenges that caregiving incurs. Missing from past research, however, is any focus on the health promotion strategies of this caregiving population. Although some literature focuses on the psychological well-being, few articles deal with the physical health status of caregivers. Fewer yet describe the health promotion strategies that caregivers use to maintain their health. The chapter reviews existing literature regarding health promotion activities of primary caregivers in the context of articles focused on the psychological and physical health status of caregivers. Health promotion strategies will be discussed, as will recommendations for future research in this topic area.","284":"The empirical literature on health promotion in old age was reviewed. A developmental perspective was used to examine 42 studies: studies relating health behaviors to health outcomes, descriptive studies of health promotion in old age, studies of the outcomes of health promotion programs in old age, and studies of factors related to older adults' participation in health promotion activities. In general, elderly adults perceived health promotion activities as beneficial, engaged in health behaviors more frequently than younger adults, and participated in community-based and other health promotion programs. There is little definitive evidence that health promotion activities result in better health outcomes for older adults, however. Identifying appropriate outcomes related to health promotion in old age is a critical need.","285":"Assisting children and adolescents in adopting physically active lifestyles is an integral part of the health education and health promotion services provide by nurses in school, family, community, and primary care settings. In order to effectively engage in physical activity counseling, the determinants of physical activity must be understood and integrated into effective interventions for youths. This review of research literature includes a critique of intervention studies aimed at helping children and adolescents adopt active lifestyles that will be sustained throughout life. Social cognitive theory provided the theoretical basis for most of the studies reviewed but specification of how theory concepts were operationalized in the interventions was often unclear. Suggestions for increasing the rigor of theoretically based intervention studies aimed at promoting physical activity are proposed. Models and variables are identified that need further testing to determine their relevance to the promotion of physical activity during childhood and adolescence.","286":"This chapter reviews literature from 1985 to the present that is focused on the development of sexual behaviors in adolescents, decision making about sexual behavior, and sexual risk-taking behaviors. Results show that sexual behavior is part of most people's lives from childhood through adulthood, and that the majority of adolescents begin to engage in sexual behaviors in their teenage years. Synthesis of this large body of research reveals a lack of theoretical frameworks to guide research in sexual risk taking, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the predictors of sexual risk-taking behavior in adolescents. New and broader approaches in the study of sexual risk taking are needed that include consideration of the social and developmental context from which adolescents make decisions about sexual behavior.","287":"Mental health problems in adolescence are noteworthy in that they are outside of the normative adolescent developmental experience. Twenty percent of adolescents in the United States experience significant and persistent mental disorders, which indicates the need for prevention and early intervention. The purpose of this chapter is to review research on the prevention of mental health problems in adolescence. Various sociocontextual factors that place an adolescent at risk for mental health problems are examined. In particular, studies that identify risk factors for problems common to adolescence, including depression, suicide, and disorders of conduct and eating are reviewed. Evaluative research on prevention and early intervention programs in this substantive area are also critically reviewed. A summative report and critique on the state of research in this area is given along with suggestions for future research. A call for the active involvement of nursing in this research agenda is made.","288":"The major emphasis of behavioral research related to childhood diabetes has been on the child's physical and emotional outcomes, the family's response, and adherence issues. This research review focuses on adherence and related youth and family functioning. Descriptive and intervention studies are critiqued. Common conceptual and methodological issues are discussed with recommendations for future research.","289":"The research related to health care for school-age children is reviewed. Two major categories are considered, namely, health-risk behavior and psychosocial health. Research related to the emerging issues of homelessness and AIDS is also reviewed. The research completed to date on school-age children's health care is critiqued with an emphasis on the state of the science in nursing. Recommendations for further research are provided.","290":"This review focuses on the research in normative nutrition for children aged 2 to 12, published from 1985 to 1996. The chapter uses a primary prevention framework and the Healthy People 2000 (Public Health Service, 1990) objectives to identify and review those areas relevant for childhood health promotion and nursing practice. Current research demonstrates that food intake in early childhood is causally linked to health-related problems later in life, therefore obesity and cardiovascular research are highlighted in this review. Environmental and societal factors affect the nutritional health of children, thus the contribution of the media, poverty, cultural, and family practices are also reviewed. The chapter concludes with a summary of strengths and weaknesses of the body of research and suggestions for a nursing agenda in the area of childhood nutrition.","291":"Nursing research in Taiwan has evolved over the past 30 years. This review focused on refereed publications, research published in English, and specifically the 27 studies produced by doctorally prepared first authors. Most investigators used surveys and interviews. Designs were at the levels of description, association, and evaluation, not at the level of experiment. Problems are identified for this body of research. Further evolution of nursing science in Taiwan needs to incorporate the scientific and technologic resources of the world to develop nursing knowledge.","292":"Introduced in the 1970s, long-term vascular access devices are used in both adults and children, with about 500,000 devices placed annually. This integrative review of research on dressings to minimize infectious catheter-related complications showed that current practices were adapted from knowledge derived from short-term central venous and peripheral catheters without thorough investigation. Summary and critique of recent, as well as older significant studies, provide guidance for future research. Specifically, future research should demonstrate greater confidence in outcome measures with attention to reliability of laboratory methods, diagnostic criteria, and interrater reliability. Continuing research efforts are needed to capture unique design features of various devices, qualify device performance across prolonged time, examine nuances within patient subgroups, and address underrepresented patients and settings. Confounding and interacting variables require greater attention in study design and analysis.","293":"From the first development of nursing research agendas, scholars have called for historical inquiries into nursing's heritage and the influences that have affected the development of the profession. Because war leaves an indelible and distinct mark on the era in which it occurs, periods of significant development and change in nursing's heritage can be linked to involvement in war. This review explores the published scholarship about American nurses in wartime, from the War for Independence through the Persian Gulf War and notes the most significant changes that have come as a result of this involvement. Although particular wars and wartime nursing is a popular topic for historical inquiry, there are still eras that need to be further explored for contributions to the profession of nursing as it is today.","294":"U.S. and Canadian research studies (n = 73) on health promotion\/disease prevention programs in the worksite reported from 1990 through 1994 were reviewed for this chapter. In those studies, diverse intervention foci were provided and outcomes specific to the foci, as well as numerous additional outcomes, cost and cost benefit being the most common, were measured. To aid future researchers, two appendices list reports by foci of intervention and by outcomes measured. Deficiencies and inadequacies in reports and studies are described. Nearly all (68 out of 73) of the published studies obtained positive results in terms of benefiting health or reducing costs. The Johnson &amp; Johnson LIVE FOR LIFE Program is presented as an exemplar of a comprehensive, multifaceted, worksite health promotion\/disease prevention program whose effects were consistently assessed. Although health promotion and prevention of disease has always been an important component of nursing practice, few reports included nurse scientists as authors or coauthors. Potential explanations for the limited involvement by nurse scientists and recommendations regarding future research directions are presented. The worksite remains the best place to promote improved health for adults and this area of research represents an opportunity for greater involvement by nurse scientists.","295":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, TB has undergone a resurgence and the appearance of multidrug-resistant TB has caused new concerns. A critical part of TB treatment is adherence to the prescribed therapy for a considerable time period. Treatment \"failure\" is often due to nonadherence. Many factors influence adherence to therapy in TB. This chapter reviews research in the area of adherence to the TB treatment plan in the United States and worldwide. It discusses adherence as an outcome related to treatment regimens such as directly observed therapy, patient characteristics, life and family circumstances, motivation, education, incentives, and combination strategies. Themes across studies are compared and suggestions for successful future studies are identified.","296":"The focus of this chapter is parent and adolescent communication in nondistressed families. Communication is the assertive and unoffensive expression and accurate and attentive receipt of opinions, feelings, and ideas. Aspects of adolescent and adult development have been shown to influence as well as be influenced by perceptions of family communication. Though recently subject to extensive scrutiny and criticism, the paradigm of parent and adolescent conflict dominates this research area. Nurses and other have demonstrated strategies to enhance communication between parent and adolescents, with promising results. Issues of subject participation are reviewed and recommendations for future directions in research and practice are made.","297":"Systematic development and testing of the efficacy of educational interventions to improve functioning, prevent disability, and reduce the impact of chronic disease has been limited, perhaps because many chronic diseases disable, do not kill, and because they are managed largely within home, work, and community environments and not within the medical care system. Until recently, these factors contributed to a paucity of arthritis educational interventions. But since the impetus provided by the establishment of the Multipurpose Arthritis Centers Program of the NIH (1977), a number of arthritis patient education programs have been established and evaluated. This chapter summarizes findings from community-based arthritis patient education studies conducted between 1980 and 1995, critiques the methods of these studies, and provides guidance for state-of-the-art community-based intervention research aimed at reducing the individual and social impact of arthritis and other chronic diseases.","298":"This integrative review of research on workplace violence in Canada and the United States showed that risk factors for homicide and nonfatal assault injuries differed significantly. In 1993, there were 1,063 work-related homicides in the United States (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1994). Workplace homicide was the second leading cause of fatal occupational injuries overall, but the primary cause for women. The highest risk for workplace homicide was observed among males, the self-employed, and those employed in grocery stores, eating and drinking establishments, gas service stations, taxicab services, and government service, including law enforcement. The majority of workplace homicides occurred during robberies. Unlike workplace homicide, the majority of nonfatal assaults that involved lost work time occurred to women, primarily employed in health care or other service sector work. The assault rates for residential care and nursing and personal care workers were more than ten times that of private non-health care industries. Minimal intervention research has been reported. In recent years, some governmental agencies and professional organizations have begun to address policy issues related to workplace violence.","299":"In this chapter, the research on uncertainty in acute illness is reviewed and critiqued. Both qualitative and quantitative studies are included. The review considers the cause and consequences of uncertainty from research on adults and from research on parents of acutely ill children.","300":"This synthesis of the research literature includes a discussion of selected neurobehavioral disturbances that accompany impairments in cognitive functioning in older adults. A combination of computerized and manual searches was used to access interdisciplinary and nursing research reports on the care and treatment of older adults who are cognitively impaired. The results demonstrated that protocols are needed that systematically integrate and evaluate extant working knowledge and evolving research bases for proactive preventive approaches to the care of cognitively impaired older adults with neurobehavioral disturbances.","301":"The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the findings of the nursing research on parenting the prematurely born child. This research focused on eight general areas: impact of the home environment on infant development status, the relationship between premature infants and their mothers during the first 2 years, parenting during hospitalization, maternal concerns about infant discharge, fathering, subpopulations of premature infants, parenting after the first 2 years, and interventions to improve parenting. There is a need to strengthen the design and conceptualization of these studies, to move toward more intervention research, and to do research that is more culturally sensitive, especially toward fathers, ethnic and cultural minority groups, and the poor.","302":"","303":"","304":"","305":"","306":"","307":"","308":"","309":"","310":"","311":"","312":"","313":"","314":"","315":"","316":"","317":"","318":"","319":"","320":"","321":"","322":"","323":"","324":"","325":"","326":"","327":"","328":"","329":"","330":"","331":"","332":"","333":"","334":"","335":"","336":"","337":"","338":"","339":"","340":"","341":"","342":"","343":"","344":"","345":"","346":"","347":"","348":"","349":"","350":"","351":"","352":"","353":"","354":"","355":"","356":"","357":"","358":"","359":"","360":"","361":"","362":"","363":"","364":"This chapter has included a review of nursing research in Alzheimer's disease. Much of what is in the literature regarding nursing of Alzheimer's disease patients and their families is anecdotal and has not been validated by systematic research and is atheoretical. The majority of nursing research on Alzheimer's disease has been focused on patient characteristics and problem behaviors or on the needs and experiences of family caregivers. Research should continue in these areas along with testing nursing interventions to maintain optimal cognitive, physical, social, and emotional function of Alzheimer's disease patients. Explanatory theories should be devised and tested to advance the development of nursing knowledge in the care of Alzheimer's disease patients and family caregivers. Finally, more evaluation research is needed to test the cost effectiveness of home-based and institutional programs, including effects on Alzheimer's disease patients, family members, and staff caregivers.","365":"","366":"","367":"","368":"","369":"","370":"","371":"","372":"","373":"","374":"","375":"","376":"","377":"","378":"","379":"","380":"","381":"","382":"","383":"","384":"","385":"","386":"","387":"","388":"","389":"","390":"","391":"","392":"","393":"The 120 studies included in this review were grouped in relation to five categories of variables basic to a theory of instruction in patient education. Findings in the studies related to the characteristics of the patient as learner support the following variables as significant for a theory of instruction: demographic characteristics including age, race, duration and type of illness, educational level, and family preparedness. Selected psychological variables are significant as they interact with teaching approaches. Given only two studies in which the characteristics of the nurse as teacher were the main variables, no inferences for a theory of instruction could be drawn. However, the findings from those studies combined with results from studies in which characteristics of the nurse were secondary variables support the importance of this category of variables. The educational preparation, motivation, values, and job description of the nurse implementing patient teaching appear to be significant variables for a theory of instruction. Investigators explored a wide range of teaching strategies in the studies of patient teaching. The setting for teaching, group and individual teaching, and a variety of instructional strategies all prove promising at the operational level. The instructional strategies were too diverse to allow analysis at a level of abstraction beyond the operational. Findings in this review also support characteristics of the health care setting as an important category of variables for a theory of instruction. The organizational structure, a quality assurance framework, and valuing patient teaching appear to be significant variables. Patient education research provides a rich data source for future developments in theory, practice, and research. The effectiveness of patient education as a nursing intervention is clearly established. Furthermore, positive learning outcomes are associated with a broad range of teaching strategies, content areas, and patient populations. Systematic explorations of the characteristics of the patient as learner, the nurse as teacher, and the health care setting as a learning environment are still necessary for developing a theory of instruction for patient education. Future researchers should attend to phenomena unique to patient education rather than to duplicating general educational research. Instead of the investigator-driven research approach that characterizes research to date, replication should be encouraged. Future research should be designed to link theory and research and thereby contribute to the further development of a theory of instruction in patient education.","394":"","395":"","396":"","397":"","398":"","399":"","400":"","401":"","402":"","403":"","404":"Clearly, there is not agreement among nurse researchers regarding a definitional orientation to stress that best fits nursing's orientation to human experiences. Varying theoretical orientations are used to explain stress or stress-related phenomena, for example, stress as a stimulus, stress as a response, and stress as a transaction. The studies are fairly evenly distributed among the four definitional categories. The various approaches do not represent expanding theoretical explanations of stress, but rather are incompatible approaches to explaining stress. More disconcerting than the lack of direction in research efforts, however, is that all too commonly the measurement of the variables and the methodology were not \"linked\" or consistent with the theoretical framework. For the most part the research efforts reviewed fell short of theory testing. Even for those studies that were designed to contribute to theory development, it was rare to find research reports that included implications regarding theory in the discussion sections. Additionally, discussion sections of the reports typically did not identify alternative explanations for the findings. Quasi-experimental, ex post facto, and causal comparative studies typically were flawed with validity problems. If nursing is to strengthen its contribution to knowledge in the area of stress, more emphasis will need to be placed on congruence between design and measurement, and on issues of statistical rigor, validity, and reliability. Although some might argue that it is too early to expect a coalescing of definitional orientations, it is important to point out that considerable confusion regarding stress phenomena results from a nonsystematic or nondeliberative mixture of incompatible orientations to or definitions of stress. It is little wonder that the vast number of opinion articles that appear in the nursing literature include varied definitions of stress, often making conflicting recommendations regarding the nursing assessment of stress and nursing intervention strategies to assist a person in stress management efforts.","405":"","406":"","407":"","408":"","409":"","410":"","411":"The research pertaining to the delivery of nursing care in the ICU was reviewed to describe: the impact of the unit structure and organization, including policies and procedures, on patients, nurses, and families; the process of critical care nursing; the outcomes of critical care nursing; some of the ethical issues germane to the care of the critically ill patient. Although these areas of inquiry are quite diverse, a number of similarities can be identified. The most obvious of the similarities was that, with few exceptions, the studies pertaining to delivery of nursing care were performed by researchers from a variety of disciplines other than nursing, including medicine, psychology, public health, and economics. In many instances, such as the studies of patients' stress experiences in ICUs, these efforts enhanced our knowledge of the phenomena and complemented or replicated the efforts of nurse researchers. Unfortunately, in some areas nurse researchers were quite absent, with the result that the studies lacked a nursing perspective. For example, the large body of knowledge related to the effects of critical care on patient outcome reflected medicine's orientation toward cure. While it is important to measure the effect of nursing care in the ICU on patient survival, the effect of nursing efforts on short- and long-term quality of life, functional status, and health maintenance is also critical and remains unknown. Nurse researchers need to build on the data base already acquired about critical care. Even more important, they need to fashion programs of research focused on the concepts central to the discipline of nursing. A second similarity relates to the increasing quality of the reported research over the past decade. In general, early descriptive studies were conducted in a single critical care unit with a small and often biased sample. These gave way to more carefully designed, multicenter studies, although lack of randomization procedures continued to be a significant problem. Increasing attention was paid to the psychometric properties of instruments, and the validity and reliability of these instruments were appropriately discussed by the researchers using them. However, the area of family stress is a remarkable exception to this positive trend. Investigators also began to address the problem of sample homogeneity in some of the areas of inquiry by replicating their work outside the often favored CCU. The third and final similarity lies with the preponderance of descriptive studies in all areas reviewed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","412":"","413":"","414":"","415":"","416":"","417":"","418":"","419":"","420":"","421":"","422":"","423":"","424":"","425":"","426":"","427":"","428":"","429":"","430":"","431":"","432":"","433":"","434":"","435":"","436":"","437":"","438":"","439":"","440":"","441":"","442":"","443":"","444":"","445":"","446":"","447":"","448":"","449":"","450":"","451":"","452":"","453":"","454":"","455":"","456":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Three-Dimensional Printing: Collaborative Nurse-Led Research.","1":"Virtual and Augmented Realities in Nursing Education: State of the Science.","2":"Professional Development for Simulation Education.","3":"Simulation-Based Operations.","4":"Evaluation of Simulation Outcomes.","5":"Evidence-Based Debriefing.","6":"Interprofessional Simulation: From the Classroom to Clinical Practice.","7":"Hospital-Based Simulation.","8":"Human Simulation in Nursing Education.","9":"State of Simulation Research in Advanced Practice Nursing Education.","10":"Simulation in Undergraduate Education.","11":"School Nurses and Climate Change.","12":"A Proposal: Nurse-Sensitive Environmental Indicators.","13":"The Confidence of New Nurse Graduates in the Application of Environmental Health in the Nursing Process.","14":"The Crisis and the Shutoffs: Reimagining Water in Detroit and Flint, Michigan, Through an EcoJustice Analysis.","15":"Farmworkers: Environmental Health and Social Determinants.","16":"Environmental Health Equity: A Concept Analysis.","17":"Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances: An Emerging Contaminant of Concern.","18":"Advancing a School of Nursing Center for Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Health.","19":"Environmental and Climate Change Initiatives in Nursing Education.","20":"A Comparison of Environmental Concerns in Two Disparate Montana and Nevada Communities.","21":"CHANT: Climate, Health, and Nursing Tool: Item Development and Exploratory Factor Analysis.","22":"A Scoping Review of Nurses' Contributions to Health-Related, Wildfire Research.","23":"Neighborhood Environment and Asthma Exacerbation in Washington, DC.","24":"Omics for Nurse Scientists Conducting Environmental Health Research.","25":"The Impact of Chronic Ambient Exposure to PM2.5 and Ozone on Asthma Prevalence and COPD Mortality Rates in the Southeastern United States.","26":"Utility of a Low-Cost, Dense Sensor Network for the Study of Air Quality Impact Upon Human Health in Urban and Rural Areas.","27":"The Lens of Culture and Forensic Nursing Practice.","28":"Cultural Factors Influencing Suicidal Ideation and Behaviors in Puerto Ricans: An Integrative Review.","29":"Culture and Consent in Clinical Care: A Critical Review of Nursing and Nursing Ethics Literature.","30":"The Current State of Transcultural Mental Health Nursing: A Synthesis of the Literature.","31":"The Impact of the Political and Policy Cultures of Washington, DC, on the Affordable Care Act.","32":"Prevention and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity Among African Immigrant Populations: A Systematic Review of the Literature.","33":"The Hispanic\/Latino Immigrant Cancer Survivor Experience in the United States: A Scoping Review.","34":"Evidence-Based Updates and Universal Utility of Jeffreys' Cultural Competence and Confidence Framework for Nursing Education (and Beyond) Through TIME.","35":"Current State of Transcultural Nursing Theories, Models, and Approaches.","36":"Leininger's Culture Care Diversity and Universality Theory: Classic and New Contributions.","37":"A Policy Apprenticeship in the Office of U.S. Senator Daniel K.
