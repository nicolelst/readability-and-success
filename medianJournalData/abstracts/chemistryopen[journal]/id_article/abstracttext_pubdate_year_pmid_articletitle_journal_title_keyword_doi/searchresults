recognition processes in water differ from those in organic solvents in that they are mediated to a much greater extent by solvent effects. The hydrophobic effect, for example, causes molecules that only weakly interact in organic solvents to stay together in water. Such water-mediated interactions can be very efficient as demonstrated by many of the synthetic receptors discussed in this review, some of which have substrate affinities matching or even surpassing those of natural binders. However, in spite of considerable success in designing such receptors, not all factors determining their binding properties in water are fully understood. Existing concepts still provide plausible explanations why the reorganization of water molecules often causes receptor-substrate interactions in water to be strongly exothermic rather than entropically favored as predicted by the classical view of the hydrophobic effect.","3":null,"4":null,"5":"Invited for this month's cover picture are the groups of Masahiro Ikeshita and Takashi Tsuno at Nihon University and Yoshitane Imai at Kindai University (Japan).

Plant proteases show comparable or even greater performance than animal or microbial proteases for by-product valorization through hydrolysis for, for example, cheese whey, bird feathers, collagen, keratinous materials, gelatin, fish protein, and soy protein. Active biopeptides can be obtained as high added value products, which have shown numerous beneficial effects on human health. Plant proteases can also be used for wastewater treatment. The production of new plant proteases is encouraged for the following advantages: low cost of isolation using simple procedures, remarkable stability over a wide range of operating conditions (temperature, pH, salinity, and organic solvents), substantial affinity to a broad variety of substrates, and possibility of immobilization. Vegetable proteases have enormous application potential for the valorization of industrial waste and its conversion into products with high added value through low-cost processes.","11":null,"12":"Selective separation of heavy metal ions from acidic aqueous solutions is of strong interest for certain industrial processes, such as electroplating, as well as environmental protection, for example battery recycling. Amino-functionalized adsorbents are often discussed as suitable material for this purpose. Herein, two silica-based adsorbents functionalized with 3-aminopropyl- and 3-[2-[2-aminoethylamino]-ethylamino]-propyl-ligands resulting in adsorbents MonoA and TriA, respectively, were investigated regarding their separation behavior with focus on nickel(II) and cobalt(II) in batch as well as continuous flow experiments in acidic aqueous solutions. For both adsorbents, pH shifts into the alkaline range were observed in the process solutions, causing precipitation of metal hydroxides mainly in the particle pores in case of adsorbent MonoA and a combination of precipitation and adsorption regarding adsorbent TriA. Contrary to prior studies, our findings evidence that amino-functionalized adsorbents are not applicable for nickel(II) and cobalt(II) in selective adsorption processes and additionally demonstrate that, besides batch investigations, continuous flow experiments are essential for well-founded adsorbent selections in process development.","13":"The substitution reaction of phosphinates with a binaphthyloxy group at the phosphorus atom with lithium alkoxides proceeded with good to high efficiencies to give P-chirogenic phosphinates with a high enantiomeric ratio. As alcohols, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols could be used, and the use of tert-butyl alcohol yielded the products with a higher enantiomeric ratio. A substrate with two different alkyl groups on the phosphorus atom could also participate in the substitution reaction to give the corresponding products in good yields with excellent selectivity. The molecular structures of one of the substrates and the corresponding products, determined by X-ray analyses, proved that the substitution reaction at the phosphorus atom proceeded with inversion of the absolute configuration. The usefulness of the reaction was demonstrated by using it to prepare a drug candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Finally, thionation of the resulting phosphinates was carried out to form P-chirogenic phosphinothioates.","14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":"We present a simulation scheme for path integral simulation of molecular liquids where a small open region is embedded in a large reservoir of non interacting point-particles. The scheme is based on the latest development of the adaptive resolution technique AdResS and allows for the space-dependent change of molecular resolution from a path integral representation with 120 degrees of freedom to a point particle that does not interact with other molecules and vice versa. The method is applied to liquid water and implies a sizable gain regarding the request of computational resources compared to full path integral simulations. Given the role of water as universal solvent with a specific hydrogen bonding network, the path integral treatment of water molecules is important to describe the quantum effects of hydrogen atoms' delocalization in space on the hydrogen bonding network. The method presented here implies feasible computational efforts compared to full path integral simulations of liquid water which, on large scales, are often prohibitive.","19":"The cytotoxicities of seven dimeric metal species of the general formula [M(arene)Cl2 ]2 , commonly used as precursors for complex synthesis and deemed biologically inactive, are investigated in seven commonly employed human cancer cell lines. Four of these complexes featured a ruthenium(II) core, where p-cymene, toluene, benzene and indane were used as arenes. Furthermore, the osmium(II) p-cymene dimer, as well as the Cp* dimers of rhodium(III) and its heavier analogue iridium(III) were included in this work (Cp*=1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienide). While the cytotoxic potencies of the ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) dimers are very low (or not even detectable at applicable concentrations), surprising activity, especially in cells from ovarian malignancies (with one or two-digit micromolar IC50 values), have been found for the rhodium(III) and iridium(III) representatives. This publication is aimed at all researchers using synthetic procedures based on functionalization of these dimeric starting materials to rationalize changes in biological properties, especially cytotoxicity in cancer cells.","20":"A computational study has been performed to investigate the mechanism of RhIII -catalyzed C-H bond activation using sulfoxonium ylides as a carbene precursor. The stepwise and concerted activation modes for sulfoxonium ylides were investigated. Detailed theoretical results showed that the favored stepwise pathway involves C-H bond activation, carbonization, carbene insertion, and protonation. The free energy profiles for dialkylation of 2-phenylpyridine were also calculated to account for the low yield of this reaction. Furthermore, the substituent effect was elucidated by comparing the energy barriers for the protonation of meta- and para-substituted sulfoxonium ylides calculated by density functional theory.","21":"All-solid-state lithium ion batteries (ASS-LIBs) are promising due to their safety and higher energy density as compared to that of conventional LIBs. Over the next few decades, tremendous amounts of spent ASS-LIBs will reach the end of their cycle life and would require recycling in order to address the waste management issue along with reduced exploitation of rare elements. So far, only very limited studies have been conducted on recycling of ASS-LIBS. Herein, we investigate the recycling of the Li7 La3 Zr2 O12 (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte in a LiFePO4 \/LLZO\/Li4 Ti5 O12 system using a hydrometallurgical approach. Our results show that different concentration of the leaching solutions can significantly influence the final product of the recycling process. However, it was possible to recover relatively pure La2 O3 and ZrO2 to re-synthesize the cubic LLZO phase, whose high purity was confirmed by XRD measurements.","22":null,"23":null,"24":"Biocatalytic production of both enantiomers of optically active alcohols with high enantiopurities is of great interest in industry.

However, the inherent variability of lignin and its complex physicochemical structure resulting from feedstock and pulping selection make the Process-Structure-Property-Performance (PSPP) relationships hard to define. In this work, radial distribution functions (RDFs) from synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering of lignin-based carbon composites (LBCCs) are investigated using the Hierarchical Decomposition of the Radial Distribution Function (HDRDF) modelling method to characterize the local atomic environment and develop quantitative PSPP relationships. PSPP relationships for LBCCs defined by this work include crystallite size dependence on lignin feedstock as well as increasing crystalline volume fraction, nanoscale composite density, and crystallite size with increasing reduction temperature.","27":"Inorganic metal halide perovskite system is considered as a promising candidate for applications from display to biomedical industry. Intrinsic inorganic lead halides possess small Stokes shift or self-absorption, providing negative impact for both photo voltaic and biomedical applications. Therefore, the development of an inorganic halide perovskite system with large Stokes shift is a significant venture. This review aims to provide an updated survey of the Stokes shift phenomena in the inorganic lead halide perovskites. The first section focuses about the mechanism, the second section gives different approaches in preparing inorganic perovskites with distinct Stokes shift, while the third section highlights the potential applications in both photovoltaic and biomedical areas. This review provides deep insight about the importance and usefulness of such phenomena in inorganic lead halides, essential for various applications.","28":null,"29":"Non-obstructive azoospermia is one of the most common causes of male infertility, but there is still no specific treatment drug. Given that the Oct4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4) has an important regulatory effect on spermatogenesis, activating it can effectively promote spermatogenesis, so it is of great value to develop Oct4-targeted drug design and elucidating its mechanism of action. Here, we screened out the Oct4-targeted drug molecule NBMA (N-benzyl-4-methoxy-2-(1-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)vinyl)aniline) by computer-assisted technology, and found that it has a significant promoting effect on spermatogenesis in the established mouse azoospermia model. Subsequently, through transcriptome sequencing and enrichment analysis, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot experiments revealed that NBMA promotes the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells by activating the Oct4 pathway, thereby promoting spermatogenesis. This study proves that NBMA is a molecule with great potential to be developed as a therapeutic drug for azoospermia. It also shows that computer-assisted, chemical and biological multidisciplinary methods play a very important role in innovative drug discovery.","30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":"In the current pandemic, finding an effective drug to prevent or treat the infection is the highest priority.

After in silico screening of drug space, we identified 44 drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors that we propose for further experimental testing.","38":"Since their first commercialization in the 1990s,lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become an indispensible part of our everyday life in particular for portable electronic devices. LIBs have been considered as the most promising sustainable high energy density storage device. In recent years, there is a strong demand of LIBs for hybrid electric and electric vehicles to lower carbon footprint and mitigate climate change. However, LIBs have several issues, for example, high cost and safety issues such as over discharge, intolerance to overcharge, high temperature operation etc. To address these issues several new types of electrodes are being studied. Traditional binder PVDF is costly, difficult to recyle, undergoes side reactions at high temperature and cannot stabilize high energy density electrodes. To overcome these challenges, diiferent binders have been introduced with these electrodes. This minireview is focused on the application of guar gum as a binder for different electrodes and separator. The electrochemical performance of electrodes with guar gum has been compared with other binders.","39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":"An electro-oxidative cyclization pathway in which hydrazones are selected as starting materials to generate amphiphiles by reacting with benzylamines and benzamides was reported.

To this end, we have investigated the structure and bonding of all 32 possible DNA duplexes with Watson-Crick base pairing, using dispersion-corrected DFT at the BLYP-D3(BJ)\/TZ2P level and COSMO for simulating aqueous solvation. We find enhanced stabilities for duplexes possessing a higher GC base pair content. Our activation strain analyses unexpectedly identify the loss of stacking interactions within individual strands as a destabilizing factor in the duplex formation, in addition to the better-known effects of partial desolvation. Furthermore, we show that the sequence-dependent differences in the interaction energy for duplexes of the same overall base pair composition result from the so-called \"diagonal interactions\" or \"cross terms\". Whether cross terms are stabilizing or destabilizing depends on the nature of the electrostatic interaction between polar functional groups in the pertinent nucleobases.","45":null,"46":null,"47":"Shining On!

We apply state-of-the-art ab initio quantum chemistry to quantitatively describe the optical properties of an inorganic complex system comprising ten atoms to form the chromophoric unit, which is further stabilized by surrounding ligands. Two different basis sets are used for the calculations to specifically identify two dominant peaks in the ground state. Furthermore, we theoretically propagate the compound's correlated many-body wavefunction under the influence of a laser pulse as well as relaxation processes and compare against the time-resolved absorption spectra. The experimental data can be described with a time constant of several hundreds of femtoseconds attributed to vibrational relaxation and trapping into states localized within the band gap. A second time constant is ascribed to the excited state while trap states show lifetimes on a longer timescale. The theoretical propagation is performed with the density-matrix formalism and the Lindblad superoperator, which couples the system to a thermal bath, allowing us to extract relaxation times from first principles.","50":"The co-crystallization approach has been used to enhance specific desirable properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) such as solubility, dissolution rate, and stability. Solubility is a fundamental property that affects the bioavailability and dosage of the API.

The amino groups' distribution on the mesoporous silica nanoparticles was evaluated considering the aggregation state of a grafted photosensitizer (Verteporfin) by using spectroscopic techniques. The homogeneous distribution of amino groups within the silica network is a key factor to avoid aggregation during further organic functionalization and to optimize the performance of functionalized silica nanoparticles in biomedical applications. In addition, the formation of a protein corona on the external surface of both bare and amino-functionalized mesoporous silica was also investigated by adsorbing Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a model protein. The adsorption of BSA was found to be favorable, reducing the aggregation phenomena for both bare and amino-modified nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the dispersant effect of BSA was much more evident in the case of amino-modified nanoparticles, which reached monodispersion after adsorption of the protein, thus suggesting that amino-modified nanoparticles can benefit from protein corona formation for preventing severe aggregation in biological media.","52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":"Waste plastics are non-degradable constituents that can stay in the environment for centuries. Their large land space consumption is unsafe to humans and animals. Concomitantly, the continuous engineering of plastics, which causes depletion of petroleum, poses another problem since they are petroleum-based materials. Therefore, energy recovering trough pyrolysis is an innovative and sustainable solution since it can be practiced without liberating toxic gases into the atmosphere. The most commonly used plastics, such as HDPE, LDPE (high- and low-density polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PS (polystyrene), and, to some extent, PC (polycarbonate), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), are used for fuel oil recovery through this process. The oils which are generated from the wastes showed caloric values almost comparable with conventional fuels. The main aim of the present review is to highlight and summarize the trends of thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic into valuable fuel products through manipulating the operational parameters that influence the quality or quantity of the recovered results. The properties and product distribution of the pyrolytic fuels and the depolymerization reaction mechanisms of each plastic and their byproduct composition are also discussed.","56":null,"57":"As very light fermions, electrons are governed by antisymmetric wave functions that lead to exchange integrals in the evaluation of the energy. Here we use the localized representation of orbitals to decompose the electronic energy in a fashion that isolates the enigmatic exchange contributions and characterizes their distinctive control over electron distributions. The key to this completely general analysis is considering the electrons in groups of three, drawing attention to the curvatures of pair potentials, rather than just their amplitudes and slopes. We show that a positive curvature at short distances is essential for the mutual distancing of electrons and a negative curvature at longer distances is essential to account for the influence of lone pairs on bond torsion. Neither curvature is available in the absence of the exchange contributions. Thus, although exchange energies are much shorter range than Coulomb energies, their influence on molecular geometry is profound and readily understood.","58":null,"59":"Imine reductases (IREDs) are NADPH-dependent enzymes (NADPH=nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) that catalyze the reduction of imines to amines. They exhibit high enantioselectivity for a broad range of substrates, making them of interest for biocatalytic applications. In this work, we have employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origins of enantioselectivity of IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis. Two substrates are considered, namely 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline and 2-propyl-piperideine. A model of the active site is built on the basis of the available crystal structure. For both substrates, different binding modes are first evaluated, followed by calculation of the hydride transfer transition states from each complex. We have also investigated the effect of mutations of certain important active site residues (Tyr179Ala and Asn241Ala) on the enantioselectivity. The calculated energies are consistent with the experimental observations and the analysis of transition states geometries provides insights into the origins of enantioselectivity of this enzyme.","60":null,"61":"Six bile acid alkyl amide derivatives were studied with respect to their gelation properties. The derivatives were composed of three different bile acids with hexyl or cyclohexyl side chains. The gelation behaviour of all six compounds were studied for 36 solvents with varying polarities. Gelation was observed mainly in aromatic solvents, which is characteristic for bile-acid-based low molecular weight gelators. Out of 108 bile acid-solvent combinations, a total of 44 gel systems were formed, 28 of which from lithocholic acid derivatives, only two from deoxycholic acid derivatives, and 14 from cholic acid derivatives. The majority of the gel systems were formed from bile acids with hexyl side chains, contrary to the cyclohexyl group, which seems to be a poor gelation moiety. These results indicate that the spatial demand of the side chain is the key feature for the gelation properties of the bile acid amides.","62":"Homophymines A-E and A1-E1 are bioactive natural cyclodepsipeptides with a complex molecular architecture. These molecules could have a potential use as antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer substances.

The analysis of the XANES region of the measured spectra shows that Zn binds to BST2, as well as to orf7a, thus resulting in the formation of BST2-orf7a complexes. This structural information confirms the the conjecture, recently put forward by some of the present Authors, according to which the accessory orf7a (and possibly also orf8) viral protein are capable of interfering with the BST2 antiviral activity. Our explanation for this behavior is that, when BST2 gets in contact with Zn bound to the orf7a Cys15 ligand, it has the ability of displacing the metal owing to the creation of a new disulfide bridge across the two proteins. The formation of this BST2-orf7a complex destabilizes BST2 dimerization, thus impairing the antiviral activity of the latter.","64":null,"65":null,"66":"Removing the template from the pores after the polycondensation of the silica precursor is a necessary step in the synthesis of mesoporous silica materials. In our previous work, we developed a method for the efficient and spatially controlled functionalization of SBA-15.

After extraction of the template, a pretreatment step in N2 converted the silanol groups to the single and geminal state. Afterwards, an azide functionality was introduced exclusively into the mesopores. This ensured that the catalyst could afterwards be immobilized unambiguously in the mesopores. The mechanical stability of a material functionalized in such a spatially controlled manner is studied and compared to other template removal methods. Even though several studies investigated the influence of the calcination temperature, the presence or the absence of oxygen during the template removal, the specific conditions used during the herein reported selective functionalization procedure have not been covered yet.","67":null,"68":"Invited for this month's cover is the group of Viktoria H.

It is believed that there is a structural-functional correlation between each protein and sugar sequences in the HS polysaccharides, however, the information in this regard is limited. In this study, we compared the binding of four inflammatory cytokines (CCL8, IL-1beta, IL-2 and IL-6) to immobilized heparin by an SPR analysis. To define the molecular base of the binding, we used a heparin pentasaccharide as representative structure to dock into the 3D-molecular structure of the cytokines. The results show a discrepancy in KD values obtained by SPR analysis and theoretical calculation, pointing to the importance to apply more than one method when describing affinity between proteins and HS. By cluster analysis of the complex formed between the pentasaccharide and cytokines, we have identified several groups in heparin forming strong hydrogen bonds with all four cytokines, which is a significant finding. This molecular and conformational information should be valuable for rational design of HS\/heparin-mimetics to interfere cytokine-HS interactions.","86":null,"87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":null,"93":"Marine mussels contain an abundant catechol moiety, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), in their interfacial foot proteins.

Although the substrate scope of CvFAP has been altered by protein engineering and decoy molecules, it is still limited to mono-fatty acids. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that long chain dicarboxylic acids can be converted by CvFAP. Notably, the conversion of dicarboxylic acids to alkanes still represents a chemically very challenging reaction. Herein, the light-driven enzymatic decarboxylation of dicarboxylic acids to the corresponding (C2-shortened) alkanes using CvFAP is described. A series of dicarboxylic acids is decarboxylated into alkanes in good yields by means of this approach, even for the preparative scales. Reaction pathway studies show that mono-fatty acids are formed as the intermediate products before the final release of C2-shortened alkanes. In addition, the thermostability, storage stability, and recyclability of CvFAP for decarboxylation of dicarboxylic acids are well evaluated.

Typically this involves iterations of synthesis, to modify the compound, and biophysical assay, to assess the outcomes. Selective targeting of the anti-cancer carbonic anhydrase isoform XII (CA XII), this process is challenging because the overall fold is very similar across the twelve CA isoforms. To enhance drug development for CA XII we used a reverse engineering approach where mutation of the key six amino acids in the active site of human CA XII into the CA II isoform was performed to provide a protein chimera (chCA XII) which is amenable to structure-based compound optimization. Through determination of structural detail and affinity measurement of the interaction with over 60 compounds we observed that the compounds that bound CA XII more strongly than CA II, switched their preference and bound more strongly to the engineered chimera, chCA XII, based on CA II, but containing the 6 key amino acids from CA XII, behaved as CA XII in its compound recognition profile. The structures of the compounds in the chimeric active site also resembled those determined for complexes with CA XII, hence validating this protein engineering approach in the development of new inhibitors.","140":null,"141":null,"142":null,"143":"The Cu(II)-diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) complex (ATSM-Cu(II)) has been suggested as a promising positron emission tomography (PET) agent for hypoxia imaging.

Although catalysts are often used, the study of the reactions without added catalysts provides the basis for a deeper understanding. For the non-catalytic urethane formation and cleavage reactions, the dominating reaction mechanism has long been debated. To our knowledge, the reaction kinetics have not been predicted quantitatively so far. Therefore, we report a new computational study of urethane formation and cleavage reactions. To analyze various potential reaction mechanisms and to predict the reaction rate constants quantum chemistry and transition state theory were employed. For validation, experimental data from literature and from own experiments were used. Quantitative agreement of experiments and predictions could be demonstrated. The calculations confirm earlier assumptions that urethane formation reactions proceed via mechanisms where alcohol molecules act as auto-catalysts. Our results show that it is essential to consider several transition states corresponding to different reaction orders to enable agreement with experimental observations. Urethane cleavage seems to be catalyzed by an isourethane, leading to an observed 2nd-order dependence of the reaction rate on the urethane concentration. The results of our study support a deeper understanding of the reactions as well as a better description of reaction kinetics and will therefore help in catalyst development and process optimization.","157":null,"158":"The controlled assembly of well-defined planar nanoclusters from molecular precursors is synthetically challenging and often plagued by the predominant formation of 3D-structures and nanoparticles.

In this work, we investigated the chemical stability of long-subchain hyperbranched polystyrenes with ester, aryl ether, and carbon-carbon bonds as branching linkages under a few most popular PPM conditions, including NaOH hydrolysis reaction, TFA-promoted hydrolysis reaction, BBr3-catalyzed methoxy-hydroxyl conversion reaction, and LiAlH4 carbonyl reduction reaction. Related results are summarized into a synthetic route map that can provide practical and intuitive guidance for preparing functional long-subchain hyperbranched polystyrenes and other type of polymers by PPM for future applications.","247":null,"248":null,"249":null,"250":"The refrigerant trans-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234ze) is used as a replacement for former cooling agents that have been phased-out due to their global warming potential or ozone depleting potential.

The cover picture shows the reaction of CO2 with a silyl derivative of the biogenic amine ethanolamine. The role of CO2 as a contributor to climate change makes \"carbon capture\" a desirable goal. However, in addition to simply capture CO2, aminosilanes form silylcarbamates, which represent starting materials for a variety of crucial chemicals. Thus, the entrapped CO2 represents a useful C1 building block. The ESF-funded Junior Research Group CO2-Sil at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg (represented by their Logo and location) pursues that kind of goals. CO2-Sil studies these key reactions of CO2 insertion in depth by syntheses, quantum chemical calculations and calorimetric experiments.

The framework allows a straightforward solution for simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters which can be, otherwise, time-consuming and lead to non-convergence. Model parameters are estimated by achieving a high correlation between the model prediction and the measured ECL intensity from the ECL sensor. The developed model is used to perform a sensitivity analysis (SA), which provides quantitative effects of the model parameters on the concentrations of chemical species involved in the system. The results demonstrate that the GA-based parameter estimation and the SA approaches are effective in analyzing the kinetics of the ECL mechanism. Therefore, these approaches can be incorporated as analysis tools in the ECL kinetics study with practical application in the calibration of mechanistic models for any required sensing condition.","258":"Bioorthogonal reactions including the bioorthogonal ligations and cleavages have become an active field of research in chemical biology, and they play important roles in chemical modification and functional regulation of biomolecules.

Since conversion to NSAID\/CUR by the previously developed decomplexation protocol showed limited success, a set of NSAID\/CUR conjugates were independently prepared by directly coupling the NSAIDs with parent curcumin. The bis-NSAID\/CUR-BF2 and bis-NSAID-CUR hybrids exhibited low cytotoxicity in NCI-60 assay, and in independent cell viability assay on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (HCT116, HT29, DLD-1, RKO, SW837, CaCo2) and in normal CR cells (CCD841CoN).

They all require a directional transmission across membranes, often realized by primary messenger docking onto external receptor units and subsequent internalization of the signal in form of a released second messenger. This in turn starts a cascade of events which ultimately control all functions of the living cell. Although signal transduction is a fundamental biological process realized by supramolecular recognition and multiplication events with small molecules, chemists have just begun to invent artificial models which allow to study the underlying rules, and one day perhaps to rescue damaged transduction systems in nature. This review summarizes the exciting pioneering efforts of chemists to create simple models for the basic principles of signal transduction across a membrane. It starts with first attempts to establish molecular recognition events on liposomes with embedded receptor amphiphiles and moves on to simple transmembrane signaling across lipid bilayers. More elaborated systems step by step incorporate more elements of cell signaling, such as primary and secondary messenger or a useful cellular response such as cargo release.","269":"The Diels-Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene with methyl acrylate catalyzed by AlCl3 has been theoretically investigated. M06-2X level DFT calculations have shown that the formation of two C-C bonds is asynchronous in the cycloaddition both in the endo path and in the exo path, thus making a good contrast to the well-known concept of [4+2] reactions based on the orbital symmetry arguments. It was found that the catalyst facilitates the cycloaddition and brings a higher endo selectivity in the highly asynchronous process, as compared with the reaction of the diene and the dienophile without the catalyst.","270":"In this work, we used Density Functional Theory calculations to assess the factors that control the reactivity of a chiral anthracene template with three sets of dienophiles including maleic anhydrides, maleimides and acetoxy lactones in the context of Diels-Alder cycloadditions. The results obtained here (at the M06-2X\/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory) suggest that the activation energies for maleic anhydrides and acetoxy lactones are dependent on the nature of the substituent in the dienophile. Among all studied substituents, only -CN reduces the energy barrier of the cycloaddition. For maleimides, the activation energies are independent of the heteroatom of the dienophile and the R group attached to it. The analysis of frontier molecular orbitals, charge transfer and the activation strain model (at the M06-2X\/TZVP level based on M06-2X\/6-311++G(d,p) geometries) suggest that the activation energies in maleic anhydrides are mainly controlled by the amount of charge transfer from the diene to the dienophile during cycloaddition. For maleimides, there is a dual control of interaction and strain energies on the activation energies, whereas for the acetoxy lactones the activation energies seem to be controlled by the degree of template distortion at the transition state. Finally, calculations show that considering a catalyst on the studied cycloadditions changes the reaction mechanism from concerted to stepwise and proceed with much lower activation energies.","271":"Efficient synthesis of 3-arylquinolin-2(1H)-ones and N-(2-carboxyaryl)-oxalamides from protic acid-catalyzed rearrangements of 3-aryloxirane-2-carboxamides was achieved recently but not well understood. In contrast to the classical Meinwald rearrangement, extensive DFT calculations reveal that the proximal aryl and amide groups have strong synergetic effects to control the amide-aided and aryl-directed oxirane-opening and further rearrangement sequences. The ortho-nitro substituent of the proximal aryl is directly involved in a nucleophilic oxirane ring-opening, the amide C=O is an important proton shuttle for facile H-shifts, while the N-aryl may act as a potential ring-closing site via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. The mechanistic insights are useful for rational design of novel synthesis by changing the aryl and amide functional groups proximal to the oxirane ring.","272":"One of the most common phenol-formaldehyde cyclic oligomers from hydroxyalkylation reactions that exhibit supramolecular chemistry are calixarenes.

However, this biomaterial starts to play a central role for the preparation of biofilms in the future. In the present study, hoof keratin was regenerated for the first time from an ionic liquid by experiment and characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). As 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate is strong enough to dissolve hooves, which have a lot of disulfide bonds, a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was performed with this ionic liquid and diphenyl disulfide. The MD simulation reveals that not only the cation as postulated after experiments were carried out, but also the anion is very important for the dissolution process. This complete picture was and is not accessible via experiments and is therefore valuable for future investigations. The anion always interacts with the disulfide bond, whereas the cation prefers in some situations a strong H-O interaction with the anion. If the cations and the anions are separated from each other so that the cation can not interact with the anion, both interact with the disulfide bond. The high solvation power of this solvent is shown by the fact that the cation interacts from the left and right side and the anion from above and below the disulfide bond.","279":null,"280":"Metal nanoparticles (NPs) have physicochemical properties which are distinct from both the bulk and molecular metal species, and provide opportunities in fields such as catalysis and sensing.

New insights into the setting mechanism were obtained concerning the structure of the aluminum metaphosphate and the SiO2\/K2O ratio of three different potassium silicate solutions. With increasing pH value aluminum tetrametaphosphate reacts rapidly and forms crystalline potassium tetrametaphosphate dihydrate by an ion-exchange-reaction. In parallel, a depolymerization of the cyclic metaphosphate structure occurs leading to potassium dihydrogen phosphate as final fragmentation product. With aluminum hexametaphosphate no ion-exchange reaction product was observed. Only potassium dihydrogen phosphate could be found in higher quantities compared to the reaction with aluminum tetrametaphosphate.","286":"Pectin extracted via hydrodynamic cavitation in water only from waste lemon peel and further isolated via freeze drying displays significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram positive pathogen which easily contaminates food.

In various solvents the cages behave differently. For instance, in dichloromethane the cage with smallest window size takes up NEt4 + but not NMe4 +, which is in contrast to the two cages with larger windows hosting both ions. To find out the reason for this, kinetic experiments were carried out to determine the velocity of uptake but also to deduce the activation barriers for these processes. To support the experimental results, calculations for the guest uptakes have been performed by molecular mechanics' simulations.

In order to control the ligand density at the interface, several approaches have been developed, and they concern the functionalization of a wide range of materials. Here, different methods employed in the modification of surfaces with controlled densities of ligands are being reviewed. Examples of such methods encompass the formation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and polymeric layers on surfaces. Particular emphasis is given to the methods employed in the study of different types of multivalent biological interactions occurring at the functionalized surfaces and their working principles.","351":"A new family of alkynylated, amphiphilic dendrimers consisting of amidoamine linkers connected to 5,5'-functionalized 2,2'-bipyridine cores has been developed and evaluated in the formation of metallodendrimers of different generations and in self-assembly protocols. A convergent synthetic strategy was applied to provide dumbbell-shaped amphiphilic dendrimers, where the 2,2'-bipyridine cores could be coordinated to FeII centers to afford corresponding metallodendrimers. The ability of the metallic- and non-metallic dendritic structures to self-assemble into functional supramolecular aggregates were furthermore evaluated in aqueous solution. Spherical aggregates with sizes of a few hundred nanometers were generally produced, where controlled disassembly of the metallodendrimers through decomplexation could be achieved.","352":null,"353":null,"354":null,"355":"Chalcogen-bonding cascade switching was introduced recently to produce the chemistry tools needed to image physical forces in biological systems. In the original flipper probe, one methyl group appeared to possibly interfere with the cascade switch. In this report, this questionable methyl group is replaced by a hydrogen. The deletion of this methyl group in planarizable push-pull probes was not trivial because it required the synthesis of dithienothiophenes with four different substituents on the four available carbons. The mechanosensitivity of the resulting demethylated flipper probe was nearly identical to that of the original. Thus methyl groups in the switching region are irrelevant for function, whereas those in the twisting region are essential. This result supports the chalcogen-bonding cascade switching concept and, most importantly, removes significant synthetic demands from future probe development.","356":null,"357":"The global adoption of biodegradable and compostable plastics obtained from biomass-derived monomers, we argue in this account, is now close to the inflection point.

Complementary experiments of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) using europium (Eu(III)) as an optical probe are used to analyse the hydration process of two cement systems in the absence and presence of different organic admixtures. We show that different analysed admixtures and the used sulphate carriers in each cement system have a significant influence on the hydration process, namely on the time-dependence in the formation of different hydrate phases of cement. Moreover, the effect of a particular admixture is related to the type of sulphate carrier used. The quantitative information on the amounts of the crystalline cement paste components is accessible via XRD analysis. Distinctly different morphologies of ettringite and calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) determined by SEM allow visual conclusions about formation of these phases at particular ageing times. The TRLFS data provides information about the admixture influence on the course of the silicate reaction. The dip in the dependence of the luminescence decay times on the hydration time indicates the change in the structure of C-S-H in the early hydration period.

The coordination of the metal cations and bis(pyridine-2,6-diimine), results in the formation of interlocked structures, leading to the most probably formation of interweaved structures with better mechanical properties than those formed in the absence of the metallic cations. Removal and addition of metal cations from solid films can be achieved via tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) complexing agent, which strongly binds the metal cations, followed by subsequent insertion of other metallic cations. It allows a ligand-modulated dynamic release of the metal cations from the solid films, together with colour transfer and change of mechanical strength at the interfaces between various solid films.","375":null,"376":"Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Professor David Bryce at the University of Ottawa.

To our surprise, single-crystal structure determination of one of the complexes of the latter type indicated an ReVO center with a second oxygen bridging the Re-C bond.

The first step is usually quasi-reversible while the second step is either quasi-reversible or irreversible. Some electrochemical properties such as the formal potentials and the ratio between the anodic and the cathodic current were determined from the cyclic voltammograms.

Adding molybdenum resulted in a pronounced dispersion effect on supported iron oxidic species. Increasing atomic ratio up to 0.21Mo\/1.0Fe was accompanied by decreasing species sizes. Strong interactions between iron and molybdenum during the synthesis resulted in the formation of Fe-O-Mo structure units, possibly Fe2(MoO4)3-like species. Reducibility of MoxOy_FexOy\/SBA-15 catalysts was investigated by temperature-programmed reduction experiments with hydrogen as reducing agent. The lower reducibility obtained when adding molybdenum was ascribed to both dispersion and electronic effect of molybdenum.

In this study, a process-systems modelling framework for comprehensively evaluating these approaches in terms of both economic and environmental impacts is developed. Applying this framework, treatment pathways are designed, simulated and analysed to determine the most suitable approaches for P removal and recovery. The purpose of this methodology is not only to assist with plant design, but also to identify the principal economic and environmental factors acting as barriers to implementing a given technology, incorporating the impact of waste recovery. The results suggest that the chemical and ion-exchange approaches studied deliver sustainable advantages over biological pathways, both economically and environmentally, with each possessing different strengths.

Synthesis of ettringite via mechanochemistry is an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional wet-chemical synthesis established in industry. This contribution explores the mechanism of a two-step mechanochemical synthesis of ettringite, which was previously found to greatly improve the reaction conversion as compared with one-pot synthesis. The crystallinity of Al(OH)3 was found to decrease during the first stage of this mechanochemical synthesis. This was correlated to a significant decrease in the particle size of Al(OH)3 in this stage. No other significant changes were found for the other components, suggesting that mechanochemical activation of Al(OH)3 is responsible for the enhanced formation of ettringite by the two-step approach.

The highly functionalized aminonaphthol derivatives were then tested in [4+2] cycloaddition with different cyclic imines. The reaction proved to be both regio- and diastereoselective. In all cases, only one reaction product was obtained. Detailed structural analyses of the new polyheterocycles as well as conformational studies including DFT modelling were performed. The relative stability of o-QMs\/aza-o-QM were also calculated, and the regioselectivity of the reactions could be explained only when the cycloaddition started from aminodiol 4. It was summarized that starting from diaminonaphthol 25, the regioselectivity of the reaction is driven by the higher nucleophilicity of the amino group compared with the hydroxy group. 12H-benzo[a]xanthen-12-one (11), formed via o-QM formation, was isolated as a side product. The proton NMR spectrum of 11 proved to be very unique from NMR point of view. The reason for the extreme low-field position of proton H-1 could be accounted for by theoretical calculation of structure and spatial magnetic properties of the compound in combination of ring current effects of the aromatic moieties and steric compression within the heavily hindered H(1)-C(1)-C(12b)-C(12a)-C(12)=O structural fragment.","424":null,"425":null,"426":null,"427":"Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have received attention as atomically thin post-silicon semiconducting materials.

Recently, a surface-charge transfer doping method was developed based on contacting molecules on TMDCs, and the method succeeded in achieving a large modulation of the electronic structures. The successful dopant is a neutral benzyl viologen (BV0); however, the problem remains of how to effectively prepare the BV0 molecules. A reduction process with NaBH4 in water has been proposed as a preparation method, but the NaBH4 simultaneously reacts vigorously with the water. Here, a simple method is developed, in which the reaction vial is placed on a hotplate and a fragment of air-stable metal is used instead of NaBH4 to prepare the BV0 dopant molecules. The prepared BV0 molecules show a strong doping ability in terms of achieving a degenerate situation of a TMDC, MoS2. A key finding in this preparation method is that a convection flow in the vial effectively transports the produced BV0 to a collection solvent. This method is simple and safe and facilitates the tuning of the optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials by the easily-handled dopant molecules.","428":null,"429":null,"430":"Graphene's maximized surface-to-volume ratio, high conductance, mechanical strength, and flexibility make it a promising nanomaterial.

The role of lipophilicity in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies of opioids is reviewed. The physicochemical properties and pharmacology of the main metabolites of morphine are also discussed. Recent studies indicate that the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) can contribute to the analgesic activity of systemically administered morphine. The unexpectedly high lipophilicity of M6G partly accounts for its analgesic activity. When administered parenterally, another suspected minor metabolite, morphine-6-sulfate (M6S) has superior antinociceptive effects to those of morphine. However, because sulfate esters of morphine derivatives cannot cross the blood-brain barrier these esters may be good candidates to develop peripheral analgesic drugs.","432":"Electrochemical glycosylation of a linear oligosaccharide with a protecting-group-free primary hydroxyl group afforded cyclic oligo-saccharides, up to hexasaccharides, in high yields.

The conformational analyses in the gas phase and implicitly modeled water medium, and magnetic parameters of electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were attained using density functional theory calculations. The apical CuII coordination and hydrogen bonding were analyzed. Predicted lower-energy structures enabled the confirmation and, for apical bonding, also the refinement of structural proposals from literature. Available experimental results were indecisive regarding the amido-group binding in the CuII equatorial plane in solutions, but the examination of the relative stability of Cu(l-Asn)2 conformers in 30 binding modes confirms the glycine-like mode as the most stable one. Previously reported experimental results for Cu(l-His)(l-Asn) were interpreted for l-His to have a tridentate histamine-like mode. However, the aqueous conformers with l-His in the glycinato mode are also predicted to have low energies, which does not contradict the tridentate l-His binding. The predicted magnetic parameters of conformers with an apical oxygen atom (intramolecular or from a water molecule) can reproduce the experimental data. An extent of conformational flexibility and abundance of l-His-containing ternary copper(II) amino acid complexes under physiological conditions may be related.","434":"Multiple approaches reveal the strong effects of a positive charge introduced by protonation or ionization on the conformation of o-heteroaromatic ethers and amides. The ethers and amides containing an ortho-N heteroatom are syn-preferring while those containing an ortho-O or ortho-S heteroatom are mostly anti-preferring. However, for all the monocyclic o-heteroaromatic ethers and amides, the protonated ones are all anti-preferring while the ionized ones are all syn-preferring. Interestingly, although both the protonation and ionization introduce a positive charge, they have such different effects on molecular conformation, very informative for understanding the origin of conformational preferences. Detailed analysis shows that the population of the introduced positive charge dictates the conformational preferences via electrostatic and orbital interactions. Compared to ortho-heteroatoms, meta-heteroatoms have weaker effect on conformational preference. Achieved by complete inductive method, the regularity of conformational preferences and switching provides easy ways to modulate conformers (by pH or redox), and makes this kind of ether or amide bond a conformational hinge applicable to design of functional molecules (drugs and materials) and modulation of molecular biological processes.","435":null,"436":null,"437":"Anatase nanowires were synthesized in solution by using a simple mixing of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), lactic acid and sodium hydroxide at room temperature.

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.","439":"Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Professor Patrik Schmuki.

Computational process design was integrated with a life cycle assessment to identify the sustainability improvement opportunities. PLC production was found to be economically viable, assuming sufficient citrus waste is supplied to the process, and environmentally preferable to polystyrene (PS) in various impact categories including climate change. However, it exhibited greater environmental burdens than PS across other impact categories, although the environmental performance could be improved with a waste recovery system, at the cost of a process design shift towards energy generation.

Native ligand binding and deviations from normal function can be monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using spin labeled fatty acids (FAs). Blood serum from healthy individuals is used to examine healthy HSA in its natural physiological conditions at different loading ratios of protein to FAs. Among the EPR spectroscopic parameters (like hyperfine coupling, line shape, rotational correlation time and population of different binding sites) the rotational correlation time is found to differ significantly between binding sites of the protein, especially at loading ratios of four FAs per HSA. Although differences are observed between individual samples, a general trend regarding the dynamics of healthy HSA at different loading ratios could be obtained and compared to a reference of purified commercially available HSA in buffer.","458":null,"459":null,"460":"The imino-Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most common strategies in organic chemistry and is an important tool for providing a broad spectrum of biologically active heterocyclic systems.

High-performance monoliths as catalyst supports and online coupled HPLC analysis allow for time-efficient data generation. We show that the two-step multicomponent domino reaction does not follow the kinetics of consecutive reaction steps proceeding independently from each other.

This insight was obtained using the modern energy partitioning method called interacting quantum atoms (IQA). This behaviour is consistent for all atoms except hydrogen, which can behave differently depending on its environment. Whilst all atoms experience charge transfer when they interact, the intra-atomic energy of the hydrogen atom is more vulnerable to these changes than larger atoms. The difference in behaviour is found to be due to hydrogen's lack of a core of electrons, which, in heavier atoms, consistently provide repulsion when compressed. As such, hydrogen atoms do not always provide steric hindrance. In accounting for hydrogen's unusual behaviour and demonstrating the exponential character of the intra-atomic energy in all other atoms, we provide evidence for IQA's intra-atomic energy as a quantitative description of steric energy.","469":null,"470":null,"471":"A computational analysis of a series of cationic and neutral gold imidazolylidene and benzimidizolylidene complexes is reported.

Here, we tested the ability of different isoxazoline-based electrophiles to up-regulate Nrf2\/HO-1. The potency of activation is dependent on the leaving group at the 3-position of the isoxazoline nucleus, and an additional ring on the molecule limits the Nrf2\/HO-1 activating properties. Among the synthetized compounds, we identified 3-bromo-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazole 1 as the derivative with best activating properties in THP-1 human monocytic cells. We have confirmed that the target of our compounds is the Cys151 of the BTB domain of Keap1 by using mass spectrometry analyses and X-ray crystallography.

Accordingly, Zn-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were grown in the presence of functionalized CNTs during urea hydrolysis. The presence of CNTs led to the formation of LDH nanoplatelets, and TEM images showed that the CNTs were coated with nanoplatelets. The nanoplatelets were thermally treated to form nanocomposite-coated CNTs. Raman spectra demonstrated the successful coating of CNTs with LDHs and nanocomposite. The coated CNTs were very effective in the photocatalytic degradation of industrial pollutants.

These catalysts feature easy recovery through simple filtration and could be reused at least six times without a marked loss in activity. Notably, they can be facilely reactivated by a combination of nitrolysis with co-precipitation.

On both tube types, by varying the number of ALD cycles, Pt nanoparticles of different sizes and areal densities are formed, uniformly decorating the inner and outer walls from tube top to tube bottom. The photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution strongly depends on the size and density of Pt nanoparticles, driven by the number of ALD cycles.

Cellulose is a superior green candidate and provides exceptional freedom in composite design as the free OH groups can be conveniently functionalized to give tailor-made materials. To obtain a high-performing carbon fiber reinforced cellulose propionate composite, we accurately tailored the interfacial adhesion by invoking click chemistry. The synthetic strategy involved grafting of a phenylacetylene structure onto the carbon fiber surface, onto which O-acylated 6-azido-6-deoxycellulose and a number of aromatic azides could be covalently attached. Single-fiber fragmentation tests indicated that the lipophilicity and size of the substituent on the deposited structure played a crucial role in determining molecular entanglement and mechanical interlocking effects, as penetration into the cellulose propionate matrix was of utmost importance. Enhanced interfacial shear strength was obtained for the carbon fiber covalently functionalized with the cellulose derivative. Nevertheless, the greatest increase was observed for the derivative substituted with a compact and highly lipophilic CF3 substituent.

The lignin exhibits an oxygen radical absorption capacity, even in its macromolecular nature. The non-deteriorated lignin nanoparticles never inhibit the biological activity of living things, despite their antioxidant nature. The oxygen radical absorption capacity of lignin is dependent on its botanical origin and monomeric structure. A stable organic radical in lignin is responsible for the antioxidant nature of non-deteriorated lignin. The organic radical of non-deteriorated lignin, which yields a distinct signal on electron spin resonance spectra, serves as a spin trap reagent that detects the emergence of short lifespan radicals as the change of radical concentration of the lignin. The presented discovery of non-deteriorated lignin will induce not only the industrial utilization of plant biomass polymers in pharmaceuticals and reagents, but also advance our scientific understanding of the antioxidant function of native lignin.","579":null,"580":null,"581":"The electronic and molecular structures of the lithium and sodium complexes of 1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4-diazabutadiene (Me2DADDipp) were fully characterized by using a multi-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy approach and crystallography, together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The fluorescence intensity of the chemosensor was increased significantly only in the presence of ZnII ion which provided a perceived color change for rapid visual sensing, while other metal ions showed fluorescence quenching or little changes. It was worth noting that the chemosensor L distinguished ZnII from CdII commonly having similar properties.

The cubic shape of CoFe-PBA is well-retained even after the removal of the silica cores, resulting in the formation of hollow CoFe-PBA cubes. The specific capacity of the hollow CoFe-PBA nanocubes electrodes is about two times higher than that of solid CoFe-PBA nanocubes as storage materials for sodium ions. Such an improvement in the electrochemical properties can be attributed to their hollow internal nanostructure.

It is found that Temoporfin participates as a hydrogen donor in strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the polar groups of the phospholipids.

However, the current theory on MRI contrast generation does not consider the ubiquitous presence of macromolecular crowders in biological systems, which poses the risk of inaccurate data interpretation and misdiagnosis. To address this issue, herein the macromolecular crowding effects on MRI contrast agent are investigated with the 1H relaxation rate of water in aqueous solutions of Dotarem with different concentrations of macromolecules. Two representative macromolecular crowder systems are used: polyethylene glycol (with no specific secondary structure) and bovine serum albumin (with compact secondary and tertiary structures). The water 1H relaxation rates in various solutions are measured in a fixed magnetic field and in variable magnetic fields. The results show significant crowding effects for both crowders. The relaxation rate is proportional to the concentration of the MRI contrast agent but shows conspicuous superlinearity with respect to the concentration of the crowder. The size of polyethylene glycol does not affect the relaxivity of water in Dotarem solutions. The above effects are verified with T1- and T2-weighted NMR microimages. These results highlight the importance of the effect of macromolecular crowding on the MRI contrast agent and are valuable for understanding the mechanism of MRI contrast agents and designing new-generation MRI contrast agents.","636":"We describe a universal wet-chemical shell-by-shell coating procedure resulting in colloidal titanium dioxide (TiO2) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles with dynamically and reversibly tunable surface energies.

This covalent functionalization sequence is extended towards a second noncovalent attachment of tailor-made nonionic amphiphilic molecules to the pristine coated core-shell nanoparticles via solvophobic (i.e. either hydrophobic, lipophobic, or fluorophobic) interactions. Thereby, orthogonal tuning of the surface energies of nanoparticles via noncovalent interactions is accomplished.

In the presence of CP, the conductivity of TBACl increases in various non-polar solvents, indicating that complexation with CP enhances the ionic dissociation of TBACl in such non-polar solvents. In other words, CP recognizes chloride as an ion-paired salt as well as a free anion in non-polar solvents. Additionally, the TBA(CP-Cl) complex exhibited a considerably lower ion-pairing constant (Kip) than TBACl in non-polar solvents, resulting in enhanced conductivity.

Selective dyes with green and red excitable chromophores can be used in biological environments, such as tissues and cells, and can be irradiated with visible light without cell damage. This critical review, covering a period of five years, provides an overview of the most-relevant results on the use of red and green fluorescent dyes in the fields of bio-, chemo- and nanoscience. The review focuses on fluorescent dyes containing chromophores such as fluorescein, rhodamine, cyanine, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY), 7-nitobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl, naphthalimide, acridine orange, perylene diimides, coumarins, rosamine, Nile red, naphthalene diimide, distyrylpyridinium, benzophosphole P-oxide, benzoresorufins, and tetrapyrrolic macrocycles.

The photoswitching elements in the dopants are azobenzene units on axially chiral binaphthyl cores. Owing to cis-trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene units, both closed- and open-type compounds showed higher solubility, larger helical twisting power (HTP), and larger changes in HTP than conventional chiral dopants in host LCs. Thus, even at very low dopant concentrations, we successfully controlled the chirality of the induced helical structure of the N*LCs. Consequently, the N*LCs reflected right- and left-handed circularly polarized light (CPL) under a light stimulus. In the N*LCs with closed-type chiral dopants, the RGB-color reflection was reversibly controlled within several seconds. Interestingly, the open-type chiral dopant reversibly inverted CPL with opposite handedness in the near and short-wave IR regions. These novel materials are expected to realize new applications and perspectives in color information and similar technologies.","677":"Fingermarks have, for a long time, been vital in the forensic community for the identification of individuals, and a possibility to non-destructively date the fingermarks would of course be beneficial. Raman spectroscopy is, herein, evaluated for the purpose of estimating the age of fingermarks deposits. Well-resolved spectra were non-destructively acquired to reveal spectral uniqueness, resembling those of epidermis, and several molecular markers were identified that showed different decay kinetics: carotenoids &gt; squalene &gt; unsaturated fatty acids &gt; proteins. The degradation rates were accelerated, less pronounced for proteins, when samples were stored under ambient light conditions, likely owing to photo-oxidation. It is hypothesized that fibrous proteins are present and that oxidation of amino acid side chains can be observed both through Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Clearly, Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique to non-destructively study the aging processes of fingermarks.","678":"Photocatalytic overall water splitting is realized by taking advantage of the semiconductive and porous properties of MIL-125(Ti).

A negligible isotope effect on bioluminescence provides further support for the belief that the emitting species is the keto-phenolate of oxyluciferin and rules out its excited-state tautomerization, one potential contribution to a bioluminescence quantum yield less than unity. A small isotope effect on dehydroluciferin formation supports a single-electron-transfer mechanism for reaction of the luciferyl adenylate enolate with oxygen to form the hydroperoxide or dehydroluciferin. Partitioning between the dioxetanone intermediate (en route to oxyluciferin) and dehydroluciferin is determined, not by the fate of the hydroperoxide, but by that of the radical formed from luciferyl adenylate, and the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) reflects H-atom abstraction by superoxide.","680":"Cellulose-based materials functionalized with fluorescence sensors are highly topical and are employed in many areas of functional materials, including the sensing of heavy-metal ions and anions as well as being widely used as chemical sensors and tools for environmental applications.

Of these metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Zn-DABCO exhibited very high activity and nearly complete selectivity under moderate reaction conditions. The other members of this MOF series (Co-DABCO, Ni-DABCO, and Cu-DABCO) displayed lower activity in the given sequence. Samples of Zn-DABCO, Co-DABCO, and Ni-DABCO were recycled at least three times without a noticeable loss in catalytic activity. The reaction mechanism can be attributed to structural defects along with the acid-base bifunctional characteristics of these MOFs. Moreover, we illustrate that the synthetic method of M-DABCO influences the yield of the reaction. In addition to the SV method, Zn-DABCO was synthesized by using spray drying due to its industrial attractiveness. It was found that the synthesis procedure clearly influenced the crystal growth and thus the physicochemical properties, such as surface area, pore volume, and gas adsorption, which in turn affected the catalytic performance. The results clarified that although different synthetic methods can produce isostructural MOFs, the application of MOFs, especially as catalysts, strongly depends on the crystal morphology and textural properties and, therefore, on the synthesis method.","684":null,"685":null,"686":null,"687":null,"688":"Herein, we developed a method to prepare monodisperse poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride)@Ag (PSMA@Ag) core-shell microspheres with high surface charge intensity by using an in situ reduction method.

The monodispersity of PSMA and PSMA@Ag and the ordered array of the photonic crystal films were characterized by using SEM. The formation of Ag nanoparticles was confirmed by using TEM, HR-TEM, and XRD characterizations.

The validity of this method was shown by comparison of structural and energetic properties with data obtained with a conventional density functional and the coupled cluster method. The stability of amine dimers was shown to depend on the size, the shape, and the relative orientation of the alkyl substituents, and it was shown that the stabilization energy for large substituents is dominated by dispersion interactions. In contrast to traditional chemical explanations that attribute stability and condensed matter properties solely to hydrogen bonding and, thus, to the properties of the atoms forming the hydrogen bridge, we show that without dispersion interactions not even the stability and structure of the ammonia dimer can be correctly described. The stability of amine dimers depends crucially on the interaction between the non-polar alkyl groups, which is dominated by dispersion interactions. This interaction is also responsible for the energetic part of the free energy interaction used to describe hydrophobic interactions in liquid alkanes. The entropic part has its origin in the high degeneracy of the interaction energy for complexes of alkane molecules, which exist in a great variety of conformers, having their origin in internal rotations of the alkane chains.","697":null,"698":null,"699":null,"700":null,"701":null,"702":"Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) has been carried out for a series of unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the corresponding ethynyl, 1,3-butadiynyl, and 1,3,5-hexatriynyl derivatives. Theoretical values of the isotropic polarizability and several polarity descriptors have been computed for each compound by using semiempirical models and density functional theory (DFT), with the aim of evaluating linear functions as quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRRs).

We envisaged that the incorporation of photoactive units in the calixarene skeleton could lead to the development of systems the working modes of which can be governed and monitored by means of light-activated processes. Here, we report on the synthesis, structural characterization, and spectroscopic, photophysical, and electrochemical investigation of two calix[6]arene wheels decorated with three naphthyl groups anchored to either the upper or lower rim of the phenylureido calixarene platform. We found that the naphthyl units interact mutually and with the calixarene skeleton in a different fashion in the two compounds, which thus exhibit a markedly distinct photophysical behavior. For both hosts, the inclusion of a 4,4'-bipyridinium guest activates energy- and\/or electron-transfer processes that lead to non-trivial luminescence changes.","768":"There is much interest in understanding the interfacial properties of carbon nanotubes, particularly at water\/oil interfaces. Here, the adsorption of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at the water\/1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) interface, and the subsequent investigation of the influence of the adsorbed nanotube layer on interfacial ion transfer, is studied by using the voltammetric transfer of tetramethylammonium (TMA+) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6-) as probe ions. The presence of the interfacial SWCNT layer significantly suppresses the transfer of both ions across the interface, with a greater degree of selectivity towards the PF6- ion. This effect was attributed both to the partial blocking of the interface by the SWCNTs and to the potential dependant adsorption of background electrolyte ions on the surface of the SWCNTs, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is caused by an electrostatic interaction between the interfacial SWCNTs and the transferring ion.","769":null,"770":null,"771":null,"772":"Thick films of polypyrrole\/polyvinylsulfate (PPy\/PVS) blends were electrogenerated on stainless-steel electrodes under potentiostatic conditions from aqueous solution. The best electropolymerization potential window was determined by cyclic voltammetry. After removing the film from the back metal, self-supported electrodes were obtained. Voltammetric, coulovoltammetric, and chronoamperometric responses from a LiClO4 aqueous solution indicated the formation of an energetically stable structure beyond a reduction threshold of the material. Its subsequent oxidation required higher anodic voltammetric overpotentials or longer chronoamperometric oxidation times. This structure was attributed to the formation of lamellar or vacuolar structures. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the films under different oxidations states revealed that the electrochemical reactions drive the reversible exchange of cations between the film and the electrolyte.

By increasing the length of the fatty acid, the temperature range of liquid crystallinity was tuned. Introducing double bonds in octadecanoic acid lowered the crystallization temperature and increased the temperature range of the mesophase. Surprisingly, dimerized linoleic acid also forms an LC phase. When using branched aliphatic acids with the branching point close to the acid moiety, the mesophase was lost, whereas phosphonic acid or benzenesulfonic acid derivatives did have a mesophase, showing that the generality of this approach extends beyond carboxylic acids as the hydrogen-bond donor. Furthermore, a polymerizable LC phase was obtained from mixtures of TBIB with a methacrylate-bearing fatty acid, providing an approach for the fabrication of nanoporous polymer films if the methacrylate groups are polymerized.

We attached a biotin linker and photoactivatable aryl diazirine group to 5'-I fuligocandin B (4), and employed a pull-down assay to identify valosin-containing protein (VCP\/p97), an AAA ATPase, as a 5'-I fuligocandin B (4) target protein. Knock-down of VCP by siRNA enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL in AGS cells. In addition, 4 enhanced CHOP and DR5 protein expression, and overall intracellular levels of ubiquitinated protein. These data suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress caused through VCP inhibition by 4 increases CHOP-mediated DR5 up-regulation, which enhances TRAIL-induced cell death in AGS cells.

Peptides and peptide mimetics can form stable helical conformations and further self-assemble into diverse aggregates in water, where it is difficult to isolate a single helix. In contrast, most \"abiotic\" foldamers may fold into helical structures in solution, but are difficult to assemble into tertiary ones. It remains a challenge to obtain \"abiotic\" species similar to peptides. In this paper, a novel foldamer scaffold, in which p-phenyleneethynylene units are linked by chiral carbon atoms, was designed and prepared. In very dilute solutions, these oligomers were random coils. The hexamer and octamers could form a hexagonal lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) in CH2Cl2 when the concentrations reached the critical values. The microscopic observations indicated that they could assemble into the nanofibers in the LC. Interestingly, after some LC phases were diluted at room temperature, the nanofibers could be preserved.

UV\/Vis and fluorescence emission spectra, zinc binding experiments, fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime measurements and pH titrations of the resultant bis-naphthalimide ligand elucidate a complex pattern of photophysical behaviour. Important differences arise from the inclusion of two fluorophores in the one probe and from the variation of triazole substitution pattern (dye at C4 vs. N1). Introducing a second fluorophore greatly extends fluorescence lifetimes, whereas the altered substitution pattern at the cyclam amines exerts a major influence on fluorescence output and metal binding. Crystal structures of two key zinc complexes evidence variations in triazole coordination that mirror the solution-phase behaviour of these systems.","826":"Three bilayer muscles [polypyrrole-paraphenolsulfonic acid\/polypyrrole-dodecylbenzensulfonic acid (PPy-HpPS\/PPy-DBS) asymmetric bilayer, PPy-HpPS\/tape, and PPy-DBS\/tape] were characterized during potential cycling in NaPF6 aqueous solutions. In parallel, the angular displacement of the muscle was video-recorded. The dynamo-voltammetric (angle-potential) and coulo-dynamic (charge-potential) results give the reaction-driven ionic exchanges in each PPy film. Electrochemical reactions drive the exchange of anions from the PPy-HpPS layer and cations from the PPy-DBS layer. This means that both layers from the asymmetric bilayer follow complementary volume changes (swelling\/shrinking or shrinking\/swelling), owing to complementary ionic exchanges (entrance\/expulsion) driven by the bilayer oxidation or reduction. The result is a cooperative actuation; the bending amplitude described by the asymmetric bilayer muscle is one order of magnitude larger than those attained from each of the conducting polymer\/tape muscles. The cooperative actuation almost eliminates creeping effects.

Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy is not subject to selection rules, and all the modes are allowed. We have obtained a new INS spectrum from a large sample recorded at the highest resolution available. An advantage of INS spectroscopy is that it is straightforward to calculate the spectral intensity from a model. We demonstrate that all previous assignments are incorrect in at least some respects and propose a new assignment based on periodic density functional theory (DFT) that successfully reproduces the INS, infrared, and Raman spectra.

The three different species of anions were found to have a varying degree of influence on silver oxidation with the order PO4 (3-)&gt;HPO4 (2-)&gt;H2PO4 (-). It was found that in the presence of phosphate anions, the silver oxidation potential shifts to a less positive value, which indicated the increasing ease of the oxidation reaction of silver. Given that the interplay between silver and its cation is crucial to its antibacterial properties and significant concentrations of the HPO4 (2-) anion are present at biological pH (near neutral), it is essential that the influence of the dibasic anion (HPO4 (2-)) on silver oxidation dynamics be considered for biological systems.

In this study, we synthesized a pentavalent version and compared the binding and potency of penta- and tetravalent cholera toxin inhibitors, based on the same scaffold, for the first time. The pentavalent geometry did not yield major benefits over the tetravalent species, but it was still a strong inhibitor, and no major steric clashes occurred when binding the toxin. Thus, systems which can adopt more geometries, such as those described here, can be equally potent, and this may possibly be due to their ability to form higher-order structures or simply due to more statistical options for binding.

Colour modulation is based on the combined reaction of phosphorylation of 1 and fluoride-induced hydrolysis of a silyl ether moiety. As fluoride is a specific reaction product of the reaction between DFP and the -OH group, the probe shows a selective colour modulation in the presence of this chemical. Other nerve agent simulants, certain anions, oxidant species and other organophosphorous compounds were unable to induce colour changes in 1.

Such systems are capable of maintaining their integrity and respond to external stimuli, processes intimately related to living organisms. These interactions, however, span a wide range of dissociation constants, from sub-nanomolar affinities in tight complexes to high-micromolar or even millimolar affinities in weak, transiently formed protein complexes. Herein, we demonstrate how novel NMR and EPR techniques can be used for the characterization of weak protein-protein (ligand) complexes. Applications to intrinsically disordered proteins and transiently formed protein complexes illustrate the potential of these novel techniques to study hitherto unobserved (and unobservable) higher-order structures of proteins.

The chainlike assemblies of AuNPs and AgNPs were structurally stable for a long period of time, during which their characteristic optical properties remained unchanged. The mechanism of AuNPs and AgNPs chain assembly associated with the induction of electric dipole-dipole interactions arising from the partial ligand exchange of surface-adsorbed citrate ions by (L (2-)) was investigated. UV\/Vis spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to determine timedependent structural changes associated with formation of the 1D nanoparticle structures.

Reactivity of the ammonium carbamate self-derivative salt is further illustrated by the observation of a series of derived products, including dehydroprolinamide, a methylene-bridged prolinamide, and a bicyclic derivative.

Optimized geometries with B-DNA conformation were obtained through the inclusion of implicit water solvent and, in the DNA models, of sodium counterions, to neutralize the negative charge of the phosphate groups. The results obtained allowed us to compare the relative stability of isomeric single and double strands. Moreover, the energy of the Watson-Crick pairing of complementary single strands to form double-helical structures was calculated. The latter furnished the following increasing stability trend of the double-helix formation energy: d(TpA)2 &lt;d(CpA)2 &lt;d(ApT)2 &lt;d(ApA)2 &lt;d(GpT)2 &lt;d(GpA)2 &lt;d(ApG)2 &lt;d(CpG)2 &lt;d(GpG)2 &lt;d(GpC)2, where the energy differences between the last four dimers, d(ApG)2, d(CpG)2, d(GpG)2 and d(GpC)2, is within 4.0 kcal mol(-1), and the energy between the most and the least stable isomers is 13.4 kcal mol(-1). This trend shows that the formation energy essentially increases with the number of hydrogen bonds per base pair, that is two between A and T and three between G and C.
