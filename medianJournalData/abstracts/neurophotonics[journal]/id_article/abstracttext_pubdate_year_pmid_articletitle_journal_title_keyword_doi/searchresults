Three-photon (3P) microscopy significantly increases the depth and resolution of in vivo imaging due to decreased scattering and nonlinear optical sectioning. Simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescent proteins is essential to studying multicellular interactions and dynamics in the intact brain. Aim: We characterized the excitation laser pulses at a range of wavelengths for 3P microscopy, and then explored the application of tdTomato or mScarlet and EGFP for dual-color single-excitation structural 3P imaging deep in the living mouse brain. Approach: We used frequency-resolved optical gating to measure the spectral intensity, phase, and retrieved pulse widths at a range of wavelengths. Then, we performed in vivo single wavelength-excitation 3P imaging in the 1225- to 1360-nm range deep in the mouse cerebral cortex to evaluate the performance of tdTomato or mScarlet in combination with EGFP. Results: We find that tdTomato and mScarlet, expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons respectively, have a high signal-to-background ratio in the 1300- to 1360-nm range, consistent with enhanced 3P cross-sections. Conclusions: These results suggest that a single excitation wavelength source is advantageous for multiple applications of dual-color brain imaging and highlight the importance of empirical characterization of individual fluorophores for 3P microscopy.","1":"Neurophotonics was launched in 2014 coinciding with the launch of the BRAIN Initiative focused on development of technologies for advancement of neuroscience. For the last seven years, Neurophotonics' agenda has been well aligned with this focus on neurotechnologies featuring new optical methods and tools applicable to brain studies. While the BRAIN Initiative 2.0 is pivoting towards applications of these novel tools in the quest to understand the brain, this status report reviews an extensive and diverse toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function that have emerged from the BRAIN Initiative and related large-scale efforts for measurement and manipulation of brain structure and function. Here, we focus on neurophotonic tools mostly applicable to animal studies. A companion report, scheduled to appear later this year, will cover diffuse optical imaging methods applicable to noninvasive human studies. For each domain, we outline the current state-of-the-art of the respective technologies, identify the areas where innovation is needed, and provide an outlook for the future directions.","2":null,"3":"Significance: Mesoscale neural imaging in vivo has gained extreme popularity in neuroscience for its capacity of recording large-scale neurons in action. Optical imaging with single-cell resolution and millimeter-level field of view in vivo has been providing an accumulated database of neuron-behavior correspondence. Meanwhile, optical detection of neuron signals is easily contaminated by noises, background, crosstalk, and motion artifacts, while neural-level signal processing and network-level coordinate are extremely complicated, leading to laborious and challenging signal processing demands. The existing data analysis procedure remains unstandardized, which could be daunting to neophytes or neuroscientists without computational background. Aim: We hope to provide a general data analysis pipeline of mesoscale neural imaging shared between imaging modalities and systems. Approach: We divide the pipeline into two main stages. The first stage focuses on extracting high-fidelity neural responses at single-cell level from raw images, including motion registration, image denoising, neuron segmentation, and signal extraction. The second stage focuses on data mining, including neural functional mapping, clustering, and brain-wide network deduction. Results: Here, we introduce the general pipeline of processing the mesoscale neural images. We explain the principles of these procedures and compare different approaches and their application scopes with detailed discussions about the shortcomings and remaining challenges.

Calcium transients differ in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and spatial confinement when extracted from volumes reconstructed by different algorithms. Aim: We evaluated the capabilities and limitations of two light-field reconstruction algorithms for calcium fluorescence imaging. Approach: We acquired light-field image series from neurons either bulk-labeled or filled intracellularly with the red-emitting calcium dye CaSiR-1 in acute mouse brain slices. We compared the tSNR and spatial confinement of calcium signals extracted from volumes reconstructed with synthetic refocusing and Richardson-Lucy three-dimensional deconvolution with and without total variation regularization. Results: Both synthetic refocusing and Richardson-Lucy deconvolution resolved calcium signals from single cells and neuronal dendrites in three dimensions. Increasing deconvolution iteration number improved spatial confinement but reduced tSNR compared with synthetic refocusing. Volumetric light-field imaging did not decrease calcium signal tSNR compared with interleaved, widefield image series acquired in matched planes. Conclusions: LFM enables high-volume rate, volumetric imaging of calcium transients in single cell somata (bulk-labeled) and dendrites (intracellularly loaded). The trade-offs identified for tSNR, spatial confinement, and computational cost indicate which of synthetic refocusing or deconvolution can better realize the scientific requirements of future LFM calcium imaging applications.","6":"The brain exists in a state of constant activity in the absence of any external sensory input. The spatiotemporal patterns of this spontaneous brain activity have been studied using various recording and imaging techniques. This has enabled considerable progress to be made in elucidating the cellular and network mechanisms that are involved in the observed spatiotemporal dynamics. This mini-review outlines different spatiotemporal dynamic patterns that have been identified in four commonly used modalities: electrophysiological recordings, optical imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalography. Signal sources for each modality, possible sources of the observed dynamics, and future directions are also discussed.","7":"Brain functional connectivity based on the measure of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals has become one of the most widely used measurements in human neuroimaging. However, the nature of the functional networks revealed by BOLD fMRI can be ambiguous, as highlighted by a recent series of experiments that have suggested that typical resting-state networks can be replicated from purely vascular or physiologically driven BOLD signals. After going through a brief review of the key concepts of brain network analysis, we explore how the vascular and neuronal systems interact to give rise to the brain functional networks measured with BOLD fMRI. This leads us to emphasize a view of the vascular network not only as a confounding element in fMRI but also as a functionally relevant system that is entangled with the neuronal network. To study the vascular and neuronal underpinnings of BOLD functional connectivity, we consider a combination of methodological avenues based on multiscale and multimodal optical imaging in mice, used in combination with computational models that allow the integration of vascular information to explain functional connectivity.","8":"Significance: The cerebrovasculature has become increasingly recognized as a major player in overall brain health and many brain disorders. Although there have been several landmark studies to understand details of these crucially important structures in an anatomically defined area, brain-wide examination of the whole cerebrovasculature, including microvessels, has been challenging. However, emerging techniques, including tissue processing and three-dimensional (3D) microscopy imaging, enable neuroscientists to examine the total vasculature in the entire mouse brain. Aim: Here, we aim to highlight advances in these high-resolution 3D mapping methods including block-face imaging and light sheet fluorescent microscopy. Approach: We summarize latest mapping tools to understand detailed anatomical arrangement of the cerebrovascular network and the organizing principles of the neurovascular unit (NVU) as a whole. Results: We discuss biological insights gained from studies using these imaging methods and how these tools can be used to advance our understanding of the cerebrovascular network and related cell types in the entire brain. Conclusions: This review article will help to understand recent advance in high-resolution NVU mapping in mice and provide perspective on future studies.","9":"Significance: Fibroblasts are found associated with blood vessels in various locations across the central nervous system (CNS): in the meninges, the choroid plexus, and in the parenchyma within perivascular spaces. CNS fibroblasts have been characterized using transcriptional profiling and a Col1a1-GFP mouse line used to identify CNS fibroblasts in vivo; however, we still know very little regarding their functions and identity. Aim: Current methods for visualizing CNS fibroblasts are lacking and, in particular, prevent adequate assessment of fibroblast-vessel interactions. We aimed to develop new ways to visualize CNS fibroblasts in greater detail. Approach: Here, we describe methods for whole mount visualization of meningeal and choroid plexus fibroblasts, and CUBIC optical tissue clearing methods for visualization of parenchymal vessel-associated fibroblasts. Results: We show that these methods can be used for visualization of vessel-fibroblast interactions in these CNS structures and provide significant improvement over traditional sectioning and staining methods. In addition, we can combine these techniques with immunohistochemistry methods for labeling different cell types in the meninges and blood vasculature as well as EdU-based cell proliferation assays. Conclusions: We expect these methods will advance studies of CNS fibroblast development and functions in homeostasis, injury, and disease.","10":null,"11":"Neurophotonics editor-in-chief Anna Devor discusses neuroethics topics related to rapidly advancing neurotechnology, in conversation with Institute of Neuroethics founder Karen Rommelfanger.","12":"David Kleinfeld, the Dr. George Feher Endowed Chair in Experimental Biophysics at UC San Diego, shares his views on training and best practices in neurophotonics, offering words of wisdom for building and strengthening our scientific community.","13":"Neuromodulation poses an invaluable role in deciphering neural circuits and exploring clinical treatment of neurological diseases.

Being inextricably interdisciplinary, multiscale imaging benefits substantially from incremental technology adoption, and a detailed overview of the state-of-the-art is vital to an informed application of imaging methods. Aim: In this article, we lay out the background and methodological aspects of multimodal approaches combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous optical measurement or stimulation. Approach: We focus on optical techniques as these allow, in conjunction with genetically encoded proteins (e.g. calcium indicators or optical signal transducers), unprecedented read-out and control specificity for individual cell-types during fMRI experiments, while leveraging non-interfering modalities. Results: A variety of different solutions for optical\/fMRI methods has been reported ranging from bulk fluorescence recordings via fiber photometry to high resolution microscopy. In particular, the plethora of optogenetic tools has enabled the transformation of stimulus-evoked fMRI into a cell biological interrogation method. We discuss the capabilities and limitations of these genetically encoded molecular tools in the study of brain phenomena of great methodological and neuropsychiatric interest-such as neurovascular coupling (NVC) and neuronal network mapping. We provide a methodological description of this interdisciplinary field of study, and focus in particular on the limitations of the widely used blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and how multimodal readouts can shed light on the contributions arising from neurons, astrocytes, or the vasculature. Conclusion: We conclude that information from multiple signaling pathways must be incorporated in future forward models of the BOLD response to prevent erroneous conclusions when using fMRI as a surrogate measure for neural activity. Further, we highlight the potential of direct neuronal stimulation via genetically defined brain networks towards advancing neurophysiological understanding and better estimating effective connectivity.","15":"Simultaneously manipulating and monitoring both microscopic and macroscopic brain activity in vivo and identifying the linkage to behavior are powerful tools in neuroscience research.

Therefore, there is a need for methods to achieve high differentiation power intraoperatively. Aim: The aim is to develop and corroborate a method of classifying normal brain tissue, glioblastoma, and lymphoma using optical coherence tomography with deep learning algorithm in an ex vivo experimental design. Approach: We collected tumor specimens from ordinal surgical operations and measured them with optical coherence tomography. An attention ResNet deep learning model was utilized to differentiate glioblastoma and lymphoma from normal brain tissues. Results: Our model demonstrated a robust classification power of detecting tumoral tissues from normal tissues and moderate discrimination between lymphoma and glioblastoma. Moreover, our results showed good consistency with the previous histological findings in the pathological manifestation of lymphoma, and this could be important from the aspect of future clinical practice. Conclusion: We proposed and demonstrated a quantitative approach to distinguish different brain tumor types. Using our method, both neoplasms can be identified and classified with high accuracy. Hopefully, the proposed method can finally assist surgeons with decision-making intraoperatively.","18":null,"19":"Significance: Insights into the cellular activity of each member of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is critical for understanding their contributions to neurovascular coupling (NVC)-one of the key control mechanisms in cerebral blood flow regulation. Advances in imaging and genetic tools have enhanced our ability to observe, manipulate and understand the cellular activity of NVU components, namely neurons, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes. However, there are still many unresolved questions. Since astrocytes are considered electrically unexcitable,  Ca 2 +    signaling is the main parameter used to monitor their activity. It is therefore imperative to study astrocytic  Ca 2 +    dynamics simultaneously with vascular activity using tools appropriate for the question of interest. Aim: To highlight currently available genetic and imaging tools for studying the NVU-and thus NVC-with a focus on astrocyte  Ca 2 +    dynamics and vascular activity, and discuss the utility, technical advantages, and limitations of these tools for elucidating NVC mechanisms. Approach: We draw attention to some outstanding questions regarding the mechanistic basis of NVC and emphasize the role of astrocytic  Ca 2 +    elevations in functional hyperemia. We further discuss commonly used genetic, and optical imaging tools, as well as some newly developed imaging modalities for studying NVC at the cellular level, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Results: We provide an overview of the current state of NVC research, focusing on the role of astrocytic  Ca 2 +    elevations in functional hyperemia; summarize recent advances in genetically engineered  Ca 2 +    indicators, fluorescence microscopy techniques for studying NVC; and discuss the unmet challenges for future imaging development. Conclusions: Advances in imaging techniques together with improvements in genetic tools have significantly contributed to our understanding of NVC.

Ultimately, optimizing NVC research will require a concerted effort to improve imaging techniques, available genetic tools, and analytical software.","20":"Significance: Resting-state functional connectivity imaging in mice with optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging could provide a powerful translational tool for developing imaging biomarkers in preclinical disease models. However, statistical interpretation of correlation coefficients is hampered by autocorrelations in the data. Aim: We sought to better understand temporal and spatial autocorrelations in optical resting-state data. We then adapted statistical methods from functional magnetic resonance imaging to improve statistical inference. Approach: Resting-state data were obtained from mice using a custom-built OSI system. The autocorrelation time was calculated at each pixel, and z  scores for correlation coefficients were calculated using Fisher transforms and variance derived from either Bartlett's method or xDF. The significance of each correlation coefficient was determined through control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Results: Autocorrelation was generally even across the cortex and parcellation reduced variance. Correcting variance with Bartlett's method resulted in a uniform reduction in z  scores, with xDF preserving high z  scores for highly correlated data. Control of the FDR resulted in reasonable thresholding of the correlation coefficient matrices. The use of Bartlett's method compared with xDF results in more conservative thresholding and fewer false positives under null hypothesis conditions. Conclusions: We developed streamlined methods for control of autocorrelation in OIS functional connectivity data in mice, and Bartlett's method is a reasonable compromise and simplification that allows for accurate autocorrelation correction. These results improve the rigor and reproducibility of functional neuroimaging in mice.","21":"Significance: Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has emerged as a promising tool for intraoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) monitoring because it produces real-time full-field blood flow maps noninvasively and label free. Aim: We aim to demonstrate the ability of LSCI to continuously visualize blood flow during neurovascular procedures. Approach: LSCI hardware was attached to the surgical microscope and did not interfere with the normal operation of the microscope. To more easily visualize CBF in real time, LSCI images were registered with the built-in microscope white light camera such that LSCI images were overlaid on the white light images and displayed to the neurosurgeon continuously in real time. Results: LSCI was performed throughout each surgery when the microscope was positioned over the patient, providing the surgeon with real-time visualization of blood flow changes before, during, and after aneurysm clipping or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) resection in humans. LSCI was also compared with indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) to assess CBF during aneurysm clipping and AVM surgery; integration of the LSCI hardware with the microscope enabled simultaneous acquisition of LSCI and ICGA. Conclusions: The results suggest that LSCI can provide continuous and real-time CBF visualization without affecting the surgeon workflow or requiring a contrast agent. The results also demonstrate that LSCI and ICGA provide different, yet complementary information about vessel perfusion.","22":null,"23":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.8.1.015001.].","24":null,"25":"Astrocytes integrate information from neurons and the microvasculature to coordinate brain activity and metabolism.

We briefly cover historical calcium measurements, followed by our current understanding of how calcium transients relate to the structure of astrocytes. We then explore newer photonics tools including super-resolution techniques and genetically encoded calcium indicators targeted to specific cellular compartments and how these have been applied to astrocyte biology.

Addressing the blood vessel tail artifacts issue will make OCTA to be a real 3D blood vessel structural imaging technique, which in combination with OCT-based blood flow velocity measurements will pave the way for a simpler and robust 3D imaging of the capillary transit time, one important parameter for the evaluation of micro circulation. Approach: We first described the basic principles of OCTA imaging, discussed the origin of blood vessel tail artifacts in an OCTA image, then reviewed the existing OCTA techniques for tail artifacts suppression, and at last we envisioned the potential solutions for effective OCTA tail artifacts suppression. Results: The origin of blood vessel tail artifacts is due to the multiple scattering of photons with flowing red blood cells, which elongates the light path of the dynamic signal from vessel lumen to the tail regions. High numerical aperture implementation, subtraction-based post-data processing, Hessian filtering, and high acquisition rate-based dynamic analysis methods have been proposed to address the blood vessel tail artifacts issue in OCTA. Conclusions: High acquisition rate-based dynamic analysis in combination with Hessian filtering have the potential to effectively suppress the blood vessel tail artifacts and in the meantime preserve flows in small vessels within the tail region, providing real 3D OCTA imaging of blood vessel structures.","28":null,"29":"Significance: Image reconstruction of fNIRS data is a useful technique for transforming channel-based fNIRS into a volumetric representation and managing spatial variance based on optode location. We present an innovative integrated pipeline for image reconstruction of fNIRS data using either MRI templates or individual anatomy. Aim: We demonstrate a pipeline with accompanying code to allow users to clean and prepare optode location information, prepare and standardize individual anatomical images, create the light model, run the 3D image reconstruction, and analyze data in group space. Approach: We synthesize a combination of new and existing software packages to create a complete pipeline, from raw data to analysis. Results: This pipeline has been tested using both templates and individual anatomy, and on data from different fNIRS data collection systems. We show high temporal correlations between channel-based and image-based fNIRS data. In addition, we demonstrate the reliability of this pipeline with a sample dataset that included 74 children as part of a longitudinal study taking place in Scotland. We demonstrate good correspondence between data in channel space and image reconstructed data.

We highlight further issues that may be of interest to future software developers in the field.","30":"Significance: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging tool that can measure resting-state functional connectivity; however, non-neuronal components present in fNIRS signals introduce false discoveries in connectivity, which can impact interpretation of functional networks. Aim: We investigated the effect of short channel correction on resting-state connectivity by removing non-neuronal signals from fNIRS long channel data. We hypothesized that false discoveries in connectivity can be reduced, hence improving the discriminability of functional networks of known, different connectivity strengths. Approach: A principal component analysis-based short channel correction technique was applied to resting-state data of 10 healthy adult subjects. Connectivity was analyzed using magnitude-squared coherence of channel pairs in connectivity groups of homologous and control brain regions, which are known to differ in connectivity. Results: By removing non-neuronal components using short channel correction, significant reduction of coherence was observed for oxy-hemoglobin concentration changes in frequency bands associated with resting-state connectivity that overlap with the Mayer wave frequencies. The results showed that short channel correction reduced spurious correlations in connectivity measures and improved the discriminability between homologous and control groups. Conclusions: Resting-state functional connectivity analysis with short channel correction performs better than without correction in its ability to distinguish functional networks with distinct connectivity characteristics.","31":null,"32":null,"33":"Forthcoming status report articles provide updates on microscopy and on diffuse optical imaging in neurophotonics.","34":null,"35":null,"36":"Significance: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that uses scalp-placed sensors to measure cerebral hemoglobin concentration.

Aim: We develop a modified FDISCO clearing method, termed FDISCO+, to change the preservation condition from low temperature to room temperature. Approach: Two alternative antioxidants were screened out to effectively inhibit the peroxide generation in the clearing agent at room temperature, enabling robust fluorescence preservation of cleared samples. Results: FDISCO+ achieves comparable fluorescence preservation with the original FDISCO protocol and allows long-time storage at room temperature, making it easier for researchers to image and preserve the samples.

Anatomical interpretations of NIRS data require accurate descriptions of the cranio-cerebral relations and DOT sensitivity to the underlying cortical structures.

Aim: We aim to investigate age-related differences in scalp-to-cortex distance and mapping between scalp locations and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) among infants (2 weeks to 24 months with narrow age bins), children (4 and 12 years), and adults (20 to 24 years). Approach: We used spatial scalp projection and photon propagation simulation methods with age-matched realistic head models based on MRIs.

Quantitative imaging of retinal neurovascular abnormalities may promise a new method for early diagnosis and treatment assessment of AD. Previous imaging studies of transgenic AD mouse models have been limited to the central part of the retina. Given that the pathological hallmarks of AD frequently appear in different peripheral quadrants, a comprehensive regional investigation is needed for a better understanding of the retinal degeneration associated with AD-like pathology. Aim: We aim to demonstrate concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) of retinal neuronal and vascular abnormalities in the 5XFAD mouse model and to investigate region-specific retinal degeneration. Approach: A custom-built OCT system was used for retinal imaging. Retinal thickness, vessel width, and vessel density were quantitatively measured. The artery and vein (AV) were classified for differential AV analysis, and trilaminar vascular plexuses were segmented for depth-resolved density measurement. Results: It was observed that inner and outer retinal thicknesses were explicitly reduced in the dorsal and temporal quadrants, respectively, in 5XFAD mice. A significant arterial narrowing in 5XFAD mice was also observed. Moreover, overall capillary density consistently showed a decreasing trend in 5XFAD mice, but regional specificity was not identified.

This becomes particularly relevant for fNIRS-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where developing robust systems with few optodes is crucial for clinical applications. Aim: Available resources often dictate the approach researchers use for optode-layout design. We investigated whether guiding optode layout design using different amounts of subject-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data affects the fNIRS signal quality and sensitivity to brain activation when healthy participants perform mental-imagery tasks typically used in fNIRS-BCI experiments. Approach: We compared four approaches that incrementally incorporated subject-specific MRI information while participants performed mental-calculation, mental-rotation, and inner-speech tasks. The literature-based approach (LIT) used a literature review to guide the optode layout design. The probabilistic approach (PROB) employed individual anatomical data and probabilistic maps of functional MRI (fMRI)-activation from an independent dataset. The individual fMRI (iFMRI) approach used individual anatomical and fMRI data, and the fourth approach used individual anatomical, functional, and vascular information of the same subject (fVASC). Results: The four approaches resulted in different optode layouts and the more informed approaches outperformed the minimally informed approach (LIT) in terms of signal quality and sensitivity. Further, PROB, iFMRI, and fVASC approaches resulted in a similar outcome. Conclusions: We conclude that additional individual MRI data lead to a better outcome, but that not all the modalities tested here are required to achieve a robust setup. Finally, we give preliminary advice to efficiently using resources for developing robust optode layouts for BCI and neurofeedback applications.","52":null,"53":"Significance: Early monolingual versus bilingual experience induces adaptations in the development of linguistic and cognitive processes, and it modulates functional activation patterns during the first months of life. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is a convenient approach to study the functional organization of the infant brain. RSFC can be measured in infants during natural sleep, and it allows to simultaneously investigate various functional systems. Adaptations have been observed in RSFC due to a lifelong bilingual experience. Investigating whether bilingualism-induced adaptations in RSFC begin to emerge early in development has important implications for our understanding of how the infant brain's organization can be shaped by early environmental factors. Aims: We attempt to describe RSFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and to examine whether it adapts to early monolingual versus bilingual environments. We also present an fNIRS data preprocessing and analysis pipeline that can be used to reliably characterize RSFC in development and to reduce false positives and flawed results interpretations. Methods: We measured spontaneous hemodynamic brain activity in a large cohort ( N = 99  ) of 4-month-old monolingual and bilingual infants using fNIRS. We implemented group-level approaches based on independent component analysis to examine RSFC, while providing proper control for physiological confounds and multiple comparisons. Results: At the group level, we describe the functional organization of the 4-month-old infant brain in large-scale cortical networks. Unbiased group-level comparisons revealed no differences in RSFC between monolingual and bilingual infants at this age. Conclusions: High-quality fNIRS data provide a means to reliably describe RSFC patterns in the infant brain. The proposed group-level RSFC analyses allow to assess differences in RSFC across experimental conditions. An effect of early bilingual experience in RSFC was not observed, suggesting that adaptations might only emerge during explicit linguistic tasks, or at a later point in development.","54":null,"55":null,"56":"Significance: There is an emerging need for convenient and continuous bedside monitoring of full-term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) to determine whether early intervention is required.

Aim: Our study aims to verify the feasibility of fNIRS-based resting-state brain networks for evaluating brain function in infants with HIBD to provide a new and effective means for clinical research in neonatal HIBD. Approach: Thirteen neonates with HIBD were scanned using fNIRS in the resting state. The brain network properties were explored to attempt to extract effective features as recognition indicators. Results: Compared with healthy controls, newborns with HIBD showed decreased brain functional connectivity. Specifically, there were severe losses of long-range functional connectivity of the contralateral parietal-temporal lobe, contralateral parietal-frontal lobe, and contralateral parietal lobe. The node degree showed a widespread decrease in the left frontal middle gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus dorsal, and right central posterior gyrus. However, newborns with HIBD showed a significantly higher local network efficiency (* p &lt; 0.05  ). Subsequently, network indicators based on small-worldness, local efficiency, modularity, and normalized clustering coefficient were extracted for HIBD identification with the accuracy observed as 79.17%.

Aim: To evaluate a wearable HD-DOT system that provides a comparable sampling density to large, fiber-based HD-DOT systems, but with vastly improved ergonomics. Approach: We investigated the performance of this system by replicating a series of classic visual stimulation paradigms, carried out in one highly sampled participant during 15 sessions to assess imaging performance and repeatability. Results: Hemodynamic response functions and cortical activation maps replicate the results obtained with larger fiber-based systems. Our results demonstrate focal activations in both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin with a high degree of repeatability observed across all sessions. A comparison with a simulated low-density array explicitly demonstrates the improvements in spatial localization, resolution, repeatability, and image contrast that can be obtained with this high-density technology.

For continuous wave, this is generally handled through linear regression of the shortest source-detector (SD) distance intensity measurement from all of the signals. Although phase measurements utilizing frequency domain (FD) provide deeper tissue sampling, the use of the shortest SD distance phase measurement for regression of superficial signal contamination can lead to misleading results, therefore suppressing cortical signals. Aim: An approach for FD fNIRS that utilizes a short-separation intensity signal directly to regress both intensity and phase measurements, providing a better regression of superficial signal contamination from both data-types, is proposed. Approach: Simulated data from realistic models of the human head are used, and signal regression using both intensity and phase-based components of the FD fNIRS is evaluated. Results: Intensity-based phase regression achieves a suppression of superficial signal contamination by 68% whereas phase-based phase regression is only by 13%.

Conclusions: Birefringence microscopy is a valuable tool for histopathology of myelin and for quantitative assessment of myelin structure. Compared to conventional methods, this label-free technique is sensitive to subtle changes in myelin structure, is fast, and enables more quantitative assessment, without the variability inherent in labeling procedures such as immunohistochemistry.","67":"Significance: Three-photon excitation microscopy has double-to-triple the penetration depth in biological tissue over two-photon imaging and thus has the potential to revolutionize the visualization of biological processes in vivo. However, unlike the plug-and-play operation and performance of lasers used in two-photon imaging, three-photon microscopy presents new technological challenges that require a closer look at the fidelity of laser pulses. Aim: We implemented state-of-the-art pulse measurements and developed innovative techniques for examining the performance of lasers used in three-photon microscopy. We then demonstrated how these techniques can be used to provide precise measurements of pulse shape, pulse energy, and pulse-to-pulse intensity variability, all of which ultimately impact imaging. Approach: We built inexpensive tools, e.g., a second harmonic generation frequency-resolved optical gating (SHG-FROG) device and a deep-memory diode imaging (DMDI) apparatus to examine laser pulse fidelity. Results: First, SHG-FROG revealed very large third-order dispersion (TOD). This extent of phase distortion prevents the efficient temporal compression of laser pulses to their theoretical limit. Furthermore, TOD cannot be quantified when using a conventional method of obtaining the laser pulse duration, e.g., when using an autocorrelator. Finally, DMDI showed the effectiveness of detecting pulse-to-pulse intensity fluctuations on timescales relevant to three-photon imaging, which were otherwise not captured using conventional instruments and statistics. Conclusions: The distortion of individual laser pulses caused by TOD poses significant challenges to three-photon imaging by preventing effective compression of laser pulses and decreasing the efficiency of nonlinear excitation. Moreover, an acceptably low pulse-to-pulse amplitude variability should not be assumed. Particularly for low repetition rate laser sources used in three-photon microscopy, pulse-to-pulse variability also degrades image quality. If three-photon imaging is to become mainstream, our diagnostics may be used by laser manufacturers to improve system design and by end-users to validate the performance of their current and future imaging systems.","68":"Neurophotonics Editor in Chief Anna Devor outlines a vision for the journal.","69":null,"70":null,"71":"Significance: This study is a preliminary step toward the identification of a noninvasive and reliable tool for monitoring the presence and progress of gaiting dysfunctions. Aim: We present the results of a pilot study for monitoring the motor cortex hemodynamic response function (HRF) in freely walking subjects, with time-domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TD fNIRS). Approach: A compact and wearable single-channel TD fNIRS oximeter was employed. The lower limb motor cortex area of three healthy subjects was monitored while performing two different freely moving gaiting tasks: forward and backward walking. Results: The time course of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin was measured during the different walking tasks. Brain motor cortex hemodynamic activations have been analyzed throughout an adaptive HRF fitting procedure, showing a greater involvement of motor area in the backward walking task. By comparison with the HRF obtained in a finger-tapping task performed in a still condition, we excluded any effect of motion artifacts in the gaiting tasks. Conclusions: For the first time to our knowledge, the hemodynamic motor cortex response was measured by TD fNIRS during natural, freely walking exercises. The cortical response during forward and backward walking shows differences, possibly related to the diverse involvement of the motor cortex in the two types of gaiting.","72":"Significance: Infrared (IR) inhibition can selectively block peripheral sensory nerve fibers, a potential treatment for autonomic-dysfunction-related diseases (e.g., neuropathic pain and interstitial cystitis). Lowering the IR inhibition threshold can increase its translational potentials. Aim: Infrared induces inhibition by enhancing potassium channel activation. We hypothesized that the IR dose threshold could be reduced by combining it with isotonic ion replacement. Approach: We tested the IR inhibition threshold on the pleural-abdominal connective of Aplysia californica. Using a customized chamber system, the IR inhibition was applied either in normal saline or in isotonic ion-replaced saline, which could be high glucose saline, high choline saline, or high glucose\/high choline saline. Each modified saline was at a subthreshold concentration for inhibiting neural conduction. Results: We showed that isotonically replacing ions in saline with glucose and\/or choline can reduce the IR threshold and temperature threshold of neural inhibition. Furthermore, the size selectivity of IR inhibition was preserved when combined with high glucose\/high choline saline. Conclusions: The present work of IR inhibition combined with isotonic ion replacement will guide further development of a more effective size-selective IR inhibition modality for future research and translational applications.","73":"Significance: With the increasing popularity of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the need to determine localization of the source and nature of the signals has grown. Aim: We compare strategies for removal of non-neural signals for a finger-thumb tapping task, which shows responses in contralateral motor cortex and a visual checkerboard viewing task that produces activity within the occipital lobe. Approach: We compare temporal regression strategies using short-channel separation to a spatial principal component (PC) filter that removes global signals present in all channels. For short-channel temporal regression, we compare non-neural signal removal using first and combined first and second PCs from a broad distribution of short channels to limited distribution on the forehead. Results: Temporal regression of non-neural information from broadly distributed short channels did not differ from forehead-only distribution. Spatial PC filtering provides results similar to short-channel separation using the temporal domain. Utilizing both first and second PCs from short channels removes additional non-neural information. Conclusions: We conclude that short-channel information in the temporal domain and spatial domain regression filtering methods remove similar non-neural components represented in scalp hemodynamics from fNIRS signals and that either technique is sufficient to remove non-neural components.","74":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.8.1.012101.].","75":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.7.4.040501.].","76":null,"77":"The application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in the neurosciences has been expanding over the last 40 years. Today, it is addressing a wide range of applications within different populations and utilizes a great variety of experimental paradigms. With the rapid growth and the diversification of research methods, some inconsistencies are appearing in the way in which methods are presented, which can make the interpretation and replication of studies unnecessarily challenging. The Society for Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy has thus been motivated to organize a representative (but not exhaustive) group of leaders in the field to build a consensus on the best practices for describing the methods utilized in fNIRS studies. Our paper has been designed to provide guidelines to help enhance the reliability, repeatability, and traceability of reported fNIRS studies and encourage best practices throughout the community. A checklist is provided to guide authors in the preparation of their manuscripts and to assist reviewers when evaluating fNIRS papers.","78":null,"79":null,"80":"Significance: Contamination of diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) due to systemic physiology remains a significant challenge in the clinical translation of DCS for neuromonitoring. Tunable, multi-layer Monte Carlo-based (MC) light transport models have the potential to remove extracerebral flow cross-talk in cerebral blood flow index (   CBF i    ) estimates. Aim: We explore the effectiveness of MC DCS models in recovering accurate   CBF i    changes in the presence of strong systemic physiology variations during a hypercapnia maneuver. Approach: Multi-layer slab and head-like realistic (curved) geometries were used to run MC simulations of photon propagation through the head. The simulation data were post-processed into models with variable extracerebral thicknesses and used to fit DCS multi-distance intensity autocorrelation measurements to estimate   CBF i    timecourses. The results of the MC   CBF i    values from a set of human subject hypercapnia sessions were compared with   CBF i    values estimated using a semi-infinite analytical model, as commonly used in the field. Results: Group averages indicate a gradual systemic increase in blood flow following a different temporal profile versus the expected rapid CBF response. Optimized MC models, guided by several intrinsic criteria and a pressure modulation maneuver, were able to more effectively separate   CBF i    changes from scalp blood flow influence than the analytical fitting, which assumed a homogeneous medium. Three-layer models performed better than two-layer ones; slab and curved models achieved largely similar results, though curved geometries were closer to physiological layer thicknesses. Conclusion: Three-layer, adjustable MC models can be useful in separating distinct changes in scalp and brain blood flow. Pressure modulation, along with reasonable estimates of physiological parameters, can help direct the choice of appropriate layer thicknesses in MC models.","81":"Significance: Transcranial photobiomodulation (PBM) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique capable of producing changes in the mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase (CCO) activity of neurons. Although the application of PBM in clinical practice and as a neurophysiological tool is increasing, less is known about how different treatment time intervals may result in different outcomes. Aim: We evaluated the effects of different PBM treatment intervals on brain metabolic activity through the CCO and proto-oncogene expression (c-Fos). Approach: We studied PBM effects on brain CCO and c-Fos expression in three groups of animals: Control (CN, n = 8  ), long interval PBM treatment (LI, n = 5  ), and short interval PBM treatment (SI, n = 5  ). Results: Increased CCO activity in the LI group, compared to the SI and CN groups, was found in the prefrontal cortices, dorsal and ventral striatum, and hippocampus. Regarding c-Fos expression, we found a significant increase in the SI group compared to LI and CN, whereas LI showed increased c-Fos expression compared to CN in the cingulate and infralimbic cortices. Conclusions: We show the effectiveness of different PBM interval schedules in increasing brain metabolic activity or proto-oncogene expression.","82":"Significance: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. With a worldwide incidence rate of 2 to 3 per 100,000 people, it accounts for more than 60% of all brain cancers; currently, its 5-year survival rate is &lt; 5 %  . GBM treatment relies mainly on surgical resection. In this framework, multimodal optical spectroscopy could provide a fast and label-free tool for improving tumor detection and guiding the removal of diseased tissues. Aim: Discriminating healthy brain from GBM tissues in an animal model through the combination of Raman and reflectance spectroscopies. Approach: EGFP-GL261 cells were injected into the brains of eight laboratory mice for inducing murine GBM in these animals. A multimodal optical fiber probe combining fluorescence, Raman, and reflectance spectroscopy was used to localize in vivo healthy and tumor brain areas and to collect their spectral information. Results: Tumor areas were localized through the detection of EGFP fluorescence emission. Then, Raman and reflectance spectra were collected from healthy and tumor tissues, and later analyzed through principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis in order to develop a classification algorithm. Raman and reflectance spectra resulted in 92% and 93% classification accuracy, respectively. Combining together these techniques allowed improving the discrimination between healthy and tumor tissues up to 97%. Conclusions: These preliminary results demonstrate the potential of multimodal fiber-probe spectroscopy for in vivo label-free detection and delineation of brain tumors, and thus represent an additional, encouraging step toward clinical translation and deployment of fiber-probe spectroscopy.","83":"Significance: Cellular layering is a hallmark of the mammalian neocortex with layer and cell type-specific connections within the cortical mantle and subcortical connections. A key challenge in studying circuit function within the neocortex is to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of information flow between different columns and layers. Aim: We aimed to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) layer- and area-specific interactions in mouse cortex in vivo. Approach: We applied a new promising neuroimaging method-fluorescence laminar optical tomography in combination with voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi). VSDi is a powerful technique for interrogating membrane potential dynamics in assemblies of cortical neurons, but it is traditionally used for two-dimensional (2D) imaging. Our mesoscopic technique allows visualization of neuronal activity in a 3D manner with high temporal resolution. Results: We first demonstrated the depth-resolved capability of 3D mesoscopic imaging technology in Thy1-ChR2-YFP transgenic mice. Next, we recorded the long-range functional projections between sensory cortex (S1) and motor cortex (M1) in mice, in vivo, following single whisker deflection. Conclusions: The results show that mesoscopic imaging technique has the potential to investigate the layer-specific neural connectivity in the mouse cortex in vivo. Combination of mesoscopic imaging technique with optogenetic control strategy is a promising platform for determining depth-resolved interactions between cortical circuit elements.","84":null,"85":"Significance: Speech processing tasks can be used to assess the integrity and health of many functional and structural aspects of the brain. Despite the potential merits of such behavioral tests as clinical assessment tools, however, the underlying neural substrates remain relatively unclear. Aim: We aimed to obtain a more in-depth portrait of hemispheric asymmetry during dichotic listening tasks at the level of the prefrontal cortex, where prior studies have reported inconsistent results. Approach: To avoid central confounds that limited previous studies, we used diffuse correlation spectroscopy to optically monitor cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during dichotic listening tasks in human subjects. Results: We found that dichotic listening tasks elicited hemispheric asymmetries in both amplitude as well as kinetics. When listening task blocks were repeated, there was an accommodative reduction in the response amplitude of the left, but not the right hemisphere. Conclusions: These heretofore unobserved trends depict a more nuanced portrait of the functional asymmetry that has been observed previously. To our knowledge, these results additionally represent the first direct measurements of CBF during a speech processing task recommended by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association for diagnosing auditory processing disorders.","86":null,"87":"Significance: Cerebral oxygenation changes in the superior, middle, and medial gyri were used to elucidate spatial impairments of autonomic hemodynamic recovery during the head-up tilt table test (HUTT) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with orthostatic intolerance (OI) symptoms. Aim: To analyze dynamic oxygenation changes during the HUTT and classify PD patients with OI symptoms using clinical and oxygenation features. Approach: Thirty-nine PD patients with OI symptoms [10: orthostatic hypotension (PD-OH); 29: normal HUTT results (PD-NOR)] and seven healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Prefrontal oxyhemoglobin (HbO) changes during the HUTT were reconstructed with diffuse optical tomography and segmented using the automated anatomical labeling system. Decision trees were used for classification. Results: HCs and PD-NOR patients with positive rates of HbO change (PD-POS) showed the greatest HbO recovery in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) during tilt. PD-OH and PD-NOR patients with negative rates of HbO change (PD-NEG) showed asymmetric reoxygenation. The classification accuracy was 89.4% for PD-POS versus PD-NEG, 71% for PD-NOR versus PD-OH, and 55.8% for PD-POS versus PD-NEG versus PD-OH. The oxygenation features were more discriminative than the clinical features. Conclusions: PD-OH showed decreased right SFG function, which may be associated with impaired compensatory autonomic responses to orthostatic stress.","88":"Significance: The optical properties of biological samples provide information about the structural characteristics of the tissue and any changes arising from pathological conditions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has proven to be capable of extracting tissue's optical properties using a model that combines the exponential decay due to tissue scattering and the axial point spread function that arises from the confocal nature of the detection system, particularly for higher numerical aperture (NA) measurements. A weakness in estimating the optical properties is the inter-parameter cross-talk between tissue scattering and the confocal parameters defined by the Rayleigh range and the focus depth. Aim: In this study, we develop a systematic method to improve the characterization of optical properties with high-NA OCT. Approach: We developed a method that spatially parameterizes the confocal parameters in a previously established model for estimating the optical properties from the depth profiles of high-NA OCT. Results: The proposed parametrization model was first evaluated on a set of intralipid phantoms and then validated using a low-NA objective in which cross-talk from the confocal parameters is negligible. We then utilize our spatially parameterized model to characterize optical property changes introduced by a tissue index matching process using a simple immersion agent, 2,2'-thiodiethonal. Conclusions: Our approach improves the confidence of parameter estimation by reducing the degrees of freedom in the non-linear fitting model.","89":"Significance: Dystonia is a dynamic and complex disorder. Real-time analysis of brain activity during motor tasks may increase our knowledge on its pathophysiology. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a noninvasive method that enables the measurement of cortical hemodynamic activity in unconstrained environments. Aim: We aimed to explore the feasibility of using fNIRS for the study of task-related brain activity in dystonia. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state functional connectivity were also analyzed. Approach: Patients with idiopathic right-upper limb dystonia and controls were assessed through nonsimultaneous fMRI and fNIRS during a finger-tapping task. Seed-based connectivity analysis of resting-state fMRI was performed in both groups. Results: The fMRI results suggest nonspecific activation of the cerebellum and occipital lobe in dystonia patients during the finger-tapping task with the affected hand. Moreover, fNIRS data show lower activation in terms of oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin in the frontal, ipsilateral cortex, and somatosensory areas during this task. In dystonia, both fMRI and fNIRS data resulted in hypoactivation of the frontal cortex during finger tapping with both hands simultaneously. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis suggests that the cerebellar somatomotor network in dystonia has an increased correlation with the medial prefrontal cortex and the paracingulate gyrus. Conclusions: These data suggest that unbalanced activation of the cerebellum, somatosensory, and frontal cortical areas are associated with dystonia. To our knowledge, this is the first study using fNIRS to explore the pathophysiology of dystonia. We show that fNIRS and fMRI are complementary methods and highlight the potential of fNIRS for the study of dystonia and other movement disorders as it can overcome movement restrictions, enabling experiments in more naturalistic conditions.","90":"Significance: Systematic studies of the physiological outputs induced by infrared (IR)-mediated inhibition of motor nerves can provide guidance for therapeutic applications and offer critical insights into IR light modulation of complex neural networks. Aim: We explore the IR-mediated inhibition of action potentials (APs) that either propagate along single axons or are initiated locally and their downstream synaptic transmission responses. Approach: APs were evoked locally by two-electrode current clamp or at a distance for propagating APs. The neuromuscular transmission was recorded with intracellular electrodes in muscle cells or macro-patch pipettes on terminal bouton clusters. Results: IR light pulses completely and reversibly terminate the locally initiated APs firing at low frequencies, which leads to blocking of the synaptic transmission. However, IR light pulses only suppress but do not block the amplitude and duration of propagating APs nor locally initiated APs firing at high frequencies. Such suppressed APs do not influence the postsynaptic responses at a distance. While the suppression of AP amplitude and duration is similar for propagating and locally evoked APs, only the former exhibits a 7% to 21% increase in the maximum time derivative of the AP rising phase. Conclusions: The suppressed APs of motor axons can resume their waveforms after passing the localized IR light illumination site, leaving the muscular and synaptic responses unchanged. IR-mediated modulation on propagating and locally evoked APs should be considered as two separate models for axonal and somatic modulations.","91":null,"92":null,"93":null,"94":"Significance: The reliability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements is reduced by systemic physiology. Short-channel regression algorithms aim at removing systemic \"noise\" by subtracting the signal measured at a short source-detector separation (mainly scalp hemodynamics) from the one of a long separation (brain and scalp hemodynamics). In literature, incongruent approaches on the selection of the optimal regressor signal are reported based on different assumptions on scalp hemodynamics properties. Aim: We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of scalp hemodynamics over the sensorimotor cortex and evaluated its influence on the effectiveness of short-channel regressions. Approach: We performed hand-grasping and resting-state experiments with five subjects, measuring with 16 optodes over sensorimotor areas, including eight 8-mm channels. We performed detailed correlation analyses of scalp hemodynamics and evaluated 180 hand-grasping and 270 simulated (overlaid on resting-state measurements) trials. Five short-channel regressor combinations were implemented with general linear models. Three were chosen according to literature, and two were proposed based on additional physiological assumptions [considering multiple short channels and their Mayer wave (MW) oscillations]. Results: We found heterogeneous hemodynamics in the scalp, coming on top of a global close-to-homogeneous behavior (correlation 0.69 to 0.92). The results further demonstrate that short-channel regression always improves brain activity estimates but that better results are obtained when heterogeneity is assumed. In particular, we highlight that short-channel regression is more effective when combining multiple scalp regressors and when MWs are additionally included. Conclusion: We shed light on the selection of optimal regressor signals for improving the removal of systemic physiological artifacts in fNIRS. We conclude that short-channel regression is most effective when assuming heterogeneous hemodynamics, in particular when combining spatial- and frequency-specific information. A better understanding of scalp hemodynamics and more effective short-channel regression will promote more accurate assessments of functional brain activity in clinical and research settings.","95":"Significance: Cerebral blood flow is an important biomarker of brain health and function as it regulates the delivery of oxygen and substrates to tissue and the removal of metabolic waste products. Moreover, blood flow changes in specific areas of the brain are correlated with neuronal activity in those areas. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a promising noninvasive optical technique for monitoring cerebral blood flow and for measuring cortex functional activation tasks. However, the current state-of-the-art DCS adoption is hindered by a trade-off between sensitivity to the cortex and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Aim: We aim to develop a scalable method that increases the sensitivity of DCS instruments. Approach: We report on a multispeckle DCS (mDCS) approach that is based on a 1024-pixel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) camera. Our approach is scalable to &gt; 100,000  independent speckle measurements since large-pixel-count SPAD cameras are becoming available, owing to the investments in LiDAR technology for automotive and augmented reality applications. Results: We demonstrated a 32-fold increase in SNR with respect to traditional single-speckle DCS. Conclusion: A mDCS system that is based on a SPAD camera serves as a scalable method toward high-sensitivity DCS measurements, thus enabling both high sensitivity to the cortex and high SNR.","96":"Significance: Isolating task-evoked brain signals from background physiological noise (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, and blood pressure fluctuations) poses a major challenge for the analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data. Aim: The performance of several analytic methods to separate background physiological noise from brain activity including spatial and temporal filtering, regression, component analysis, and the use of short-separation (SS) measurements were quantitatively compared. Approach: Using experimentally recorded background signals (breath-hold task), receiver operating characteristics simulations were performed by adding various levels of additive synthetic \"brain\" responses in order to examine the sensitivity and specificity of several previously proposed analytic approaches. Results: We found that the use of SS fNIRS channels as regressors of no-interest within a linear regression model was the best performing approach examined. Furthermore, we found that the addition of all available SS data, including all recorded channels and both hemoglobin species, improved the method performance despite the additional degrees-of-freedom of the models. When SS data were not available, we found that principal component filtering using a separate baseline scan was the best alternative. Conclusions: The use of multiple SS measurements as regressors of no interest implemented in a robust, iteratively prewhitened, general linear model has the best performance of the tested existing methods.","97":"Significance: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) uses surface-placed light sources and detectors to record underlying changes in the brain due to fluctuations in hemoglobin levels and oxygenation. Since these measurements are recorded from the surface of the scalp, the mapping from underlying regions-of-interest (ROIs) in the brain space to the fNIRS channel space measurements depends on the registration of the sensors, the anatomy of the head\/brain, and the sensitivity of these diffuse measurements through the tissue. However, small displacements in the probe position can change the distribution of recorded brain activity across the fNIRS measurements. Aim: We propose an approach using either individual or atlas-based brain-space anatomical information to define ROI-based statistical hypotheses to test the null involvement of specific regions, which allows us to test the analogous ROI across subjects while adjusting for fNIRS probe placement and sensitivity differences due to head size variations without a localizer task. Approach: We use the optical forward model to project the underlying brain-space ROI into a tapered contrast vector, which defines the relative weighting of the fNIRS channels contributing to the ROI and allows us to test the null hypothesis of no brain activity in this region during a functional task. We demonstrate this method through simulation and compare the sensitivity-specificity of this approach to other conventional methods. Results: We examine the performance of this method in the scenario where head size and probe registration are both an accurately known parameters and where this is subject to unknown experimental errors. This method is compared with the performance of the conventional method using 364 different simulation parameter combinations. Conclusion: The proposed method is always recommended in ROI-based analysis, since it significantly improves the analysis performance without a localizer task, wherever the fNIRS probe registration is known or unknown.","98":"Significance: Having a clear understanding of functional hyperemia is crucial for functional brain imaging and neurological disease research. Vasodilation induced by sensory stimulus propagates from the arterioles to the upstream pial arteries in a retrograde fashion. As retrograde vasodilation occurs briefly in the early stage of functional hyperemia, an imaging technique with a high temporal resolution is required for its measurement. Aim: We aimed to present an imaging method to measure stimulus-induced retrograde vasodilation in awake animals. Approach: An imaging method based on optical coherence tomography angiography, which enables a high-speed and label-free vessel diameter measurement, was developed and applied for the investigation. Results: The propagation speed of retrograde vasodilation of pial artery was measured in awake mice. Other characteristics of functional hyperemia such as temporal profile and amplitude of the vascular response were also investigated. Conclusions: Our results provide detailed information of stimulus-induced hemodynamic response in the brain of awake mice and suggest the potential utility of our imaging method for the study of functional hyperemia in normal and diseased brain.","99":"Significance: Deficits in sensorimotor function in persons with type II diabetes mellitus (PwDM) have traditionally been considered a result of peripheral nerve damage. Emerging evidence has suggested that factors outside of nerve damage due to type II diabetes mellitus, such as impaired hemodynamic function, contribute significantly to both sensory and motor deficits in PwDM. Aim: The focus of the current study was to evaluate functional cortical hemodynamic activity during sensory and motor tasks in PwDM. Approach: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) across the cortex during sensory and motor tasks involving the hands. Results: Decline in HbO across sensory and motor regions of interest was found in PwDM with simultaneous deficits in manual motor tasks, providing the first evidence of functional cortical hemodynamic activity deficits relating to motor dysfunction in PwDM. Similar deficits were neither specifically noted in HbR nor during evaluation of sensory function. Health state indices, such as   A 1 c    , blood pressure, body mass index, and cholesterol, were found to clarify group effects. Conclusions: Further work is needed to clarify potential sex-based differences in PwDM during motor tasks as well as the root of reduced cortical HbO indices but unchanged HbR indices in PwDM.","100":"Significance: Light-field microscopy (LFM) enables high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and light efficient volume imaging at fast frame rates. Voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) stands to particularly benefit from LFM's volumetric imaging capability due to high required sampling rates and limited probe brightness and functional sensitivity. Aim: We demonstrate subcellular resolution GEVI light-field imaging in acute mouse brain slices resolving dendritic voltage signals in three spatial dimensions. Approach: We imaged action potential-induced fluorescence transients in mouse brain slices sparsely expressing the GEVI VSFP-Butterfly 1.2 in wide-field microscopy (WFM) and LFM modes. We compared functional signal SNR and localization between different LFM reconstruction approaches and between LFM and WFM. Results: LFM enabled three-dimensional (3-D) localization of action potential-induced fluorescence transients in neuronal somata and dendrites. Nonregularized deconvolution decreased SNR with increased iteration number compared to synthetic refocusing but increased axial and lateral signal localization. SNR was unaffected for LFM compared to WFM. Conclusions: LFM enables 3-D localization of fluorescence transients, therefore eliminating the need for structures to lie in a single focal plane. These results demonstrate LFM's potential for studying dendritic integration and action potential propagation in three spatial dimensions.","101":"Significance: The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (   CMRO 2    ) is an important indicator of brain function and pathology. Knowledge about its magnitude is also required for proper interpretation of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured with functional MRI. Despite the need for estimating  CMRO 2   , no gold standard exists. Traditionally, the estimation of  CMRO 2   has been pursued with somewhat indirect approaches combining several different types of measurements with mathematical modeling of the underlying physiological processes. The recent ability to measure the level of oxygen (  pO 2   ) in cortex with two-photon resolution in in vivo conditions has provided a more direct way for estimating  CMRO 2   , but has so far only been used to estimate the average  CMRO 2   close to cortical penetrating arterioles in rats. Aim: The aim of this study was to propose a method to provide spatial maps of  CMRO 2   based on two-photon  pO 2   measurements. Approach: The method has two key steps. First, the  pO 2   maps are spatially smoothed to reduce the effects of noise in the measurements. Next, the Laplace operator (a double spatial derivative) in two spatial dimensions is applied on the smoothed  pO 2   maps to obtain spatially resolved  CMRO 2   estimates. Result: The smoothing introduces a bias, and a balance must be found where the effects of the noise are sufficiently reduced without introducing too much bias. In this model-based study, we explored this balance using synthetic model-based data, that is, data where the spatial maps of  CMRO 2   were preset and thus known. The corresponding  pO 2   maps were found by solving the Poisson equation, which relates  CMRO 2   and  pO 2   . MATLAB code for using the method is provided. Conclusion: Through this model-based study, we propose a method for estimating  CMRO 2   with high spatial resolution based on measurements of  pO 2   in cerebral cortex.","102":null,"103":"Significance: A major obstacle to studying resident microglia has been their similarity to infiltrating immune cell types and the lack of unique protein markers for identifying the functional state. Given the role of microglia in all neural diseases and insults, accurate tools for detecting their function beyond morphologic alterations are necessary. Aims: We hypothesized that microglia would have unique metabolic fluxes in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that would be detectable by relative changes in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) parameters, allowing for identification of their activation status. Fluorescence lifetime of NADH has been previously demonstrated to show differences in metabolic fluxes. Approach: Here, we investigate the use of the label-free method of FLIM-based detection of the endogenous metabolic cofactor NADH to identify microglia and characterize their activation status. To test whether microglial activation would also confer a unique NADH lifetime signature, murine primary microglial cultures and adult mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results: We found that LPS-induced microglia activation correlates with detected changes in NADH lifetime and its free-bound ratio. This indicates that NADH lifetime can be used to monitor microglia activation in a label-free fashion. Moreover, we found that there is an LPS dose-dependent change associated with reactive microglia lifetime fluxes, which is also replicated over time after LPS treatment. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a label-free way of monitoring microglia activation via quantifying lifetime of endogenous metabolic coenzyme NADH. Upon LPS-induced activation, there is a significant change in the fluorescence lifetime following activation. Together, these results indicate that NADH FLIM approaches can be used as a method to characterize microglia activation state, both in vitro and ex vivo.","104":null,"105":"Significance: Stem cell therapies are of interest for treating a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and injuries of the spinal cord. However, the lack of techniques for longitudinal monitoring of stem cell therapy progression is inhibiting clinical translation. Aim: The goal of this study is to demonstrate an intraoperative imaging approach to guide stem cell injection to the spinal cord in vivo. Results may ultimately support the development of an imaging tool that spans intra- or postoperative environments to guide therapy throughout treatment. Approach: Stem cells were labeled with Prussian blue nanocubes (PBNCs) to facilitate combined ultrasound and photoacoustic (US\/PA) imaging to visualize stem cell injection and delivery to the spinal cord in vivo. US\/PA results were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histology. Results: Real-time intraoperative US\/PA image-guided injection of PBNC-labeled stem cells and three-dimensional volumetric images of injection provided feedback necessary for successful delivery of therapeutics into the spinal cord. Postoperative MRI confirmed delivery of PBNC-labeled stem cells. Conclusions: The nanoparticle-augmented US\/PA approach successfully detected injection and delivery of stem cells into the spinal cord, confirmed by MRI. Our work demonstrated in vivo feasibility, which is a critical step toward the development of a US\/PA\/MRI platform to monitor regenerative spinal cord therapies.","106":"Significance: We propose a video-based, motion-resilient, and fast method for estimating the position of optodes on the scalp. Aim: Measuring the exact placement of probes (e.g., electrodes and optodes) on a participant's head is a notoriously difficult step in acquiring neuroimaging data from methods that rely on scalp recordings (e.g., electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and is particularly difficult for any clinical or developmental population. Existing methods of head measurements require the participant to remain still for a lengthy period of time, are laborious, and require extensive training. Therefore, a fast and motion-resilient method is required for estimating the scalp location of probes. Approach: We propose an innovative video-based method for estimating the probes' positions relative to the participant's head, which is fast, motion-resilient, and automatic. Our method builds on capitalizing the advantages and understanding the limitations of cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning tools. We validate our method on 10 adult subjects and provide proof of feasibility with infant subjects. Results: We show that our method is both reliable and valid compared to existing state-of-the-art methods by estimating probe positions in a single measurement and by tracking their translation and consistency across sessions. Finally, we show that our automatic method is able to estimate the position of probes on an infant head without lengthy offline procedures, a task that has been considered challenging until now. Conclusions: Our proposed method allows, for the first time, the use of automated spatial co-registration methods on developmental and clinical populations, where lengthy, motion-sensitive measurement methods routinely fail.","107":null,"108":"Significance: Combining transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a recent approach to exploring brain activation evoked by neurostimulation. Aim: To critically evaluate studies combining tDCS and fNIRS and provide a consolidated overview of cortical hemodynamic responses to neurostimulation. Approach: Key terms were searched in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) with cross-referencing and works from Google Scholar also evaluated. All studies reporting on fNIRS-derived hemoglobin changes evoked by tDCS were included. Results: Literature searches revealed 474 articles, of which 28 were included for final review (22 in healthy individuals: 9 involving rest and 13 with tasks; 6 in the clinical setting). At rest, an overall increase in cortical activation was observed in fNIRS responses at the site of stimulation, with evidence suggesting nonstimulated brain regions are also similarly affected. Conversely, during tasks, reduced cortical activation was observed during online stimulation. Offline and poststimulation effects were less consistent, as is the impact on clinical populations and their symptom correlation. Conclusion: This review explores the methodological frameworks for fNIRS-tDCS evaluations and summarizes hemodynamic responses associated with tDCS in all populations. Our findings provide further evidence of the impact of tDCS on neuronal activation within functionally connected networks.","109":null,"110":"Significance: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease causing chronic pain and functional alterations (stiffness and swelling) in the elderly population. OA is currently treated pharmacologically with analgesics, although neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently generated a growing interest as a safe side-effect free treatment alternative or a complement to medications for chronic pain conditions. Although a number of studies have shown that tDCS has a beneficial effect on behavioral measures of pain, the mechanistic action of neuromodulation on pain sensitivity and coping at the central nervous system is not well understood. Aim: We aimed at observing longitudinal changes of cortical hemodynamics in older adults with knee OA associated with a two-week-long tDCS self-treatment protocol. Approach: Hemodynamics was measured bilaterally in the motor and somatosensory cortices with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in response to thermal pain induced ipsilaterally to the knee primarily affected by OA. Results: We found that both oxyhemoglobin- and deoxyhemoglobin-related functional activations significantly increased during the course of the tDCS treatment, supporting the notion that tDCS yields an increased cortical excitability. Concurrently, clinical measures of pain decreased with tDCS treatment, hinting at a potential spatial dissociation between cortically mediated pain perception and suppression and the prevalence of neuromodulatory effects over cortical pain processing. Conclusions: fNIRS is a valid method for objectively tracking pain in an ambulatory setting and it could potentially be used to inform strategies for optimized tDCS treatment and to develop innovative tDCS protocols.","111":null,"112":null,"113":"Significance: The human brain is a highly complex system with nonlinear, dynamic behavior. A majority of brain imaging studies employing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), however, have considered only the spatial domain and have ignored the temporal properties of fNIRS recordings. Methods capable of revealing nonlinearities in fNIRS recordings can provide new insights about how the brain functions. Aim: The temporal characteristics of fNIRS signals are explored by comprehensively investigating their fractal properties. Approach: Fractality of fNIRS signals is analyzed using scaled windowed variance (SWV), as well as using visibility graph (VG), a method which converts a given time series into a graph. Additionally, the fractality of fNIRS signals obtained under resting-state and task-based conditions is compared, and the application of fractality in differentiating brain states is demonstrated for the first time via various classification approaches. Results: Results from SWV analysis show the existence of high fractality in fNIRS recordings. It is shown that differences in the temporal characteristics of fNIRS signals related to task-based and resting-state conditions can be revealed via the VGs constructed for each case. Conclusions: fNIRS recordings, regardless of the experimental conditions, exhibit high fractality. Furthermore, VG-based metrics can be employed to differentiate rest and task-execution brain states.","114":null,"115":null,"116":null,"117":null,"118":null,"119":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.5.4.045005.].","120":"Significance: Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects over 40 million U.S. adults in their lifetime. Transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) has been shown to be effective in treating MDD, but the current treatment dosage does not account for head and brain anatomical changes due to aging. Aim: We study effective t-PBM dosage and its variations across age groups using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations and age-dependent brain atlases ranging between 5 and 85 years of age. Approach: Age-dependent brain models are derived from 18 MRI brain atlases. Two extracranial source positions, F3-F4 and Fp1-Fpz-Fp2 in the EEG 10-20 system, are simulated at five selected wavelengths and energy depositions at two MDD-relevant cortical regions-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-are quantified. Results: An overall decrease of energy deposition was found with increasing age. A strong negative correlation between the thickness of extracerebral tissues (ECT) and energy deposition was observed, suggesting that increasing ECT thickness over age is primarily responsible for reduced energy delivery. The F3-F4 position appears to be more efficient in reaching dlPFC compared to treating vmPFC via the Fp1-Fpz-Fp2 position. Conclusions: Quantitative simulations revealed age-dependent light delivery across the lifespan of human brains, suggesting the need for personalized and age-adaptive t-PBM treatment planning.","121":"Significance: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has become an important research tool in studying human brains. Accurate quantification of brain activities via fNIRS relies upon solving computational models that simulate the transport of photons through complex anatomy. Aim: We aim to highlight the importance of accurate anatomical modeling in the context of fNIRS and propose a robust method for creating high-quality brain\/full-head tetrahedral mesh models for neuroimaging analysis. Approach: We have developed a surface-based brain meshing pipeline that can produce significantly better brain mesh models, compared to conventional meshing techniques. It can convert segmented volumetric brain scans into multilayered surfaces and tetrahedral mesh models, with typical processing times of only a few minutes and broad utilities, such as in Monte Carlo or finite-element-based photon simulations for fNIRS studies. Results: A variety of high-quality brain mesh models have been successfully generated by processing publicly available brain atlases. In addition, we compare three brain anatomical models-the voxel-based brain segmentation, tetrahedral brain mesh, and layered-slab brain model-and demonstrate noticeable discrepancies in brain partial pathlengths when using approximated brain anatomies, ranging between - 1.5 %  to 23% with the voxelated brain and 36% to 166% with the layered-slab brain. Conclusion: The generation and utility of high-quality brain meshes can lead to more accurate brain quantification in fNIRS studies.

The artificial manipulations can help investigate the role of synaptic strength in a specific brain circuit not only in various physiological phenomena like correlated neuronal firing and oscillations but also in behaviors. High- and low-frequency stimulation at presynaptic sites has been used widely to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression. This approach is effective in many brain areas but not in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) because the robust local GABAergic tone inside BLA restricts synaptic plasticity. Aim: We aimed at identifying the subclass of GABAergic neurons that gate LTP in the BLA afferents from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Approach: Chemogenetic or optogenetic suppression of specific GABAergic neurons in BLA was combined with high-frequency stimulation of the BLA afferents as a method for LTP induction. Results: Chemogenetic suppression of somatostatin-positive interneurons (Sst-INs) enabled the ex vivo LTP by high-frequency stimulation of the afferent but the suppression of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) did not. Moreover, optogenetic suppression of Sst-INs with Arch also enabled LTP of the dmPFC-BLA synapses, both ex vivo and in vivo. Conclusions: These findings reveal that Sst-INs but not PV-INs gate LTP in the dmPFC-BLA pathway and provide a method for artificial synaptic facilitation in BLA.","123":"Significance. Recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient studies have focused on retinal analysis, as the retina is the only part of the central nervous system that can be imaged noninvasively by optical methods. However, as this is a relatively new approach, the occurrence and role of retinal pathological features are still debated. Aim. The retina of an APP\/PS1 mouse model was investigated using multicontrast optical coherence tomography (OCT) in order to provide a documentation of what was observed in both transgenic and wild-type mice. Approach. Both eyes of 24 APP\/PS1 transgenic mice (age: 45 to 104 weeks) and 15 age-matched wild-type littermates were imaged by the custom-built OCT system. At the end of the experiment, retinas and brains were harvested from a subset of the mice (14 transgenic, 7 age-matched control) in order to compare the in vivo results to histological analysis and to quantify the cortical amyloid beta plaque load. Results. The system provided a combination of standard reflectivity data, polarization-sensitive data, and OCT angiograms. Qualitative and quantitative information from the resultant OCT images was extracted on retinal layer thickness and structure, presence of hyper-reflective foci, phase retardation abnormalities, and retinal vasculature. Conclusions. Although multicontrast OCT revealed abnormal structural properties and phase retardation signals in the retina of this APP\/PS1 mouse model, the observations were very similar in transgenic and control mice.","124":"Animal models of stroke are used extensively to study the mechanisms involved in the acute and chronic phases of recovery following stroke. A translatable animal model that closely mimics the mechanisms of a human stroke is essential in understanding recovery processes as well as developing therapies that improve functional outcomes. We describe a photothrombosis stroke model that is capable of targeting a single distal pial branch of the middle cerebral artery with minimal damage to the surrounding parenchyma in awake head-fixed mice. Mice are implanted with chronic cranial windows above one hemisphere of the brain that allow optical access to study recovery mechanisms for over a month following occlusion. Additionally, we study the effect of laser spot size used for occlusion and demonstrate that a spot size with small axial and lateral resolution has the advantage of minimizing unwanted photodamage while still monitoring macroscopic changes to cerebral blood flow during photothrombosis. We show that temporally guiding illumination using real-time feedback of blood flow dynamics also minimized unwanted photodamage to the vascular network. Finally, through quantifiable behavior deficits and chronic imaging we show that this model can be used to study recovery mechanisms or the effects of therapeutics longitudinally.","125":null,"126":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the gold standard for quantitative ophthalmic imaging. The majority of commercial and research systems require patients to fixate and be imaged in a seated upright position, which limits the ability to perform ophthalmic imaging in bedridden or pediatric patients. Handheld OCT devices overcome this limitation, but image quality often suffers due to a lack of real-time aiming and patient eye and photographer motion. We describe a handheld spectrally encoded coherence tomography and reflectometry (SECTR) system that enables simultaneous en face reflectance and cross-sectional OCT imaging. The handheld probe utilizes a custom double-pass scan lens for fully telecentric OCT scanning with a compact optomechanical design and a rapid-prototyped enclosure to reduce the overall system size and weight. We also introduce a variable velocity scan waveform that allows for simultaneous acquisition of densely sampled OCT angiography (OCTA) volumes and widefield reflectance images, which enables high-resolution vascular imaging with precision motion-tracking for volumetric motion correction and multivolumetric mosaicking. Finally, we demonstrate in vivo human retinal OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) imaging using handheld SECTR on a healthy volunteer. Clinical translation of handheld SECTR will allow for high-speed, motion-corrected widefield OCT and OCTA imaging in bedridden and pediatric patients who may benefit ophthalmic disease diagnosis and monitoring.","127":"Three-dimensional visualization of the innervation in skeletal muscles is helpful for understanding the morphological structure and function. iDISCO, a whole-mount immunolabeling and clearing technique, provides a valuable tool for volume imaging of intramuscular nerve fibers but suffers from the nonspecific staining caused by the anti-mouse secondary antibody when using the murine primary antibody. We developed a modified iDISCO method by introducing pretreatment of ScaleCUBIC-1 reagent, termed m-iDISCO. The m-iDISCO method could eliminate the nonspecific staining and achieve uniform and complete labeling of nerve fibers in various muscles with mouse anti-neurofilament primary antibody. Combining the m-iDISCO method with light-sheet microscopy enabled us to visualize the innervation of adult mouse tibialis anterior and trace the nerve fibers from extramuscular branches to intramuscular terminal branches. This method represents an effective alternative for studying the innervation of intact skeletal muscles in health and disease.","128":null,"129":"Monitoring speech tasks with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables investigation of speech production mechanisms and informs treatment strategies for speech-related disorders such as stuttering. Unfortunately, due to movement of the temporalis muscle, speech production can induce relative movement between probe optodes and skin. These movements generate motion artifacts during speech tasks. In practice, spurious hemodynamic responses in functional activation signals arise from lack of information about the consequences of speech-related motion artifacts, as well as from lack of standardized processing procedures for fNIRS signals during speech tasks. To this end, we characterize the effects of speech production on fNIRS signals, and we introduce a systematic analysis to ameliorate motion artifacts. The study measured 50 healthy subjects performing jaw movement (JM) tasks and found that JM produces two different patterns of motion artifacts in fNIRS. To remove these unwanted contributions, we validate a hybrid motion-correction algorithm based sequentially on spline interpolation and then wavelet filtering. We compared performance of the hybrid algorithm with standard algorithms based on spline interpolation only and wavelet decomposition only. The hybrid algorithm corrected 94% of the artifacts produced by JM, and it did not lead to spurious responses in the data. We also validated the hybrid algorithm during a reading task performed under two different conditions: reading aloud and reading silently. For both conditions, we observed significant cortical activation in brain regions related to reading. Moreover, when comparing the two conditions, good agreement of spatial and temporal activation patterns was found only when data were analyzed using the hybrid approach. Overall, the study demonstrates a standardized processing scheme for fNIRS data during speech protocols. The scheme decreases spurious responses and intersubject variability due to motion artifacts.","130":null,"131":"Cognitive flexibility and reward processing critically rely on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Dysregulations in these domains and orbitofrontal activation have been reported in major psychiatric disorders. Hemodynamic brain imaging-informed neurofeedback allows regional-specific control over brain activation and thus may represent an innovative intervention to regulate orbitofrontal dysfunctions. Against this background the present proof-of-concept study evaluates the feasibility and behavioral relevance of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-assisted neurofeedback training of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC). In a randomized sham-controlled between-subject design, 60 healthy participants have undergone four subsequent runs of training to enhance the lOFC activation. Training-induced changes in the lOFC, attentional set-shifting performance, and reward experience have served as primary outcomes. Feedback from the target channel significantly increases the regional-specific lOFC activation over the four training runs in comparison with sham neurofeedback. The real-time OFC neurofeedback group demonstrates a trend for faster responses during the set-shifting relative to the sham neurofeedback group. Within the real-time OFC neurofeedback group, stronger training-induced lOFC increases are associated with higher reward experience. The present results demonstrate that fNIRS-informed neurofeedback allows regional-specific regulation of lOFC activation and may have the potential to modulate the associated behavioral domains. As such fNIRS-informed neurofeedback may represent a promising strategy to regulate OFC dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders.","132":"Intraoperative optical imaging is a localization technique for the functional areas of the human brain cortex during neurosurgical procedures. However, it still lacks robustness to be used as a clinical standard. In particular, new biomarkers of brain functionality with improved sensitivity and specificity are needed.

We measure the quantitative oxy and deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes in the human brain cortex with the modified Beer-Lambert law and Monte Carlo simulations. A functional model has been implemented to evaluate the functional brain areas following neuronal activation by physiological stimuli. The results show a good correlation between the computed quantitative functional maps and the brain areas localized by electrical brain stimulation (EBS). We demonstrate that an RGB camera combined with a quantitative modeling of brain hemodynamics biomarkers can evaluate in a robust way the functional areas during neurosurgery and serve as a tool of choice to complement EBS.","133":null,"134":null,"135":null,"136":null,"137":"The guest editorial provides an introduction to the Special Section on Advanced Retinal Imaging: Instrumentation, Methods, and Applications.","138":null,"139":"The mechanosensitivity of the optic nerve head (ONH) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.

Optical coherence elastography (OCE) is an emerging technique that can detect tissue biomechanics noninvasively with both high temporal and spatial resolution compared with conventional ultrasonic elastography. We describe a confocal OCE system in measuring ONH elasticity in vitro, utilizing a pressure inflation setup in which IOP is controlled precisely. We further utilize the Lamb wave model to fit the phase dispersion curve during data postprocessing. We present a reconstruction of Young's modulus of the ONH by combining our OCE system with a Lamb wave model for the first time. This approach enables the quantification of Young's modulus of the ONH, which can be fit using a piecewise polynomial to the corresponding IOP.","140":null,"141":null,"142":null,"143":"Cerebral edema is a severe complication of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, which can lead to microcirculation compression resulting in additional ischemic damage. Real-time and continuous in vivo imaging techniques for edema detection are of great significance to basic research on cerebral edema. We attempted to monitor the cerebral edema status in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) over time, using a wide field-of-view swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system. Optical attenuation coefficients (OACs) were calculated by an optimized depth-resolved estimation method, and en face OAC maps covering the whole cortex were obtained. Then, the tissue affected by edema was segmented from the OAC maps, and the cortical area affected by edema was estimated. Both magnetic resonance image (MRI) and brain water content measurements were used to verify the presence of cerebral edema. The results showed that the average OAC of the ischemic area gradually decreased as cerebral edema progressed, and the edema area detected by SS-OCT had high similarity in position and shape to that obtained by MRI. This work extends the application of OCT and provides an option for detecting cerebral edema in vivo after ischemic stroke.","144":"We demonstrate the use of wide-field high-throughput second-harmonic (SH) microscopy for investigating cytoskeletal morphological changes on the single-cell level. The method allows for real-time, in vitro, label-free measurements of cytoskeletal changes that can, under certain conditions, be quantified in terms of orientational distribution or in terms of changes in the number of microtubules. As SH generation is intrinsically sensitive to noncentrosymmetrically structured microtubules, but not to isotropic or centrosymmetric materials, we use it to probe the microtubule structure in the cytoskeleton when it undergoes dynamic changes induced by the application of nocodazole, a well-known microtubule-destabilizing drug that reversibly depolymerizes microtubules. In addition, the orientational directionality of microtubules in neurites and cell bodies is determined label-free using SH polarimetry measurements. Finally, we use spatiotemporal SH imaging to show label-free, real-time nocodazole-induced morphological changes in neurons of different age and in a single axon.","145":null,"146":"Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy is a powerful bioimaging technique that theoretically provides molecular spatial resolution while preserving the most important assets of fluorescence microscopy. When combined with two-photon excitation (2PE) microscopy (2PE-STED), subdiffraction resolution may be achieved for thick biological samples. The most straightforward implementation of 2PE-STED microscopy entails introduction of an STED beam operating in continuous wave (CW) into a conventional Ti:sapphire-based 2PE microscope (2PE CW-STED). In this implementation, resolution enhancement is typically achieved using time-gated detection schemes, often resulting in drastic signal-to-noise\/-background ratio (SNR\/SBR) reductions. Herein, we employ a pixel-by-pixel phasor approach to discard fluorescence photons lacking super-resolution information to enhance image SNR\/SBR in 2PE CW-STED microscopy. We compare this separation of photons by lifetime tuning approach against other postprocessing algorithms and combine it with image deconvolution to further optimize image quality.","147":null,"148":null,"149":"We explore cortical microvasculature changes during the progression of atherosclerosis using young and old transgenic atherosclerotic (ATX) mice with thinned-skull cranial window. In awake animals, exploiting intrinsic signal optical imaging, Doppler optical coherence tomography, and two-photon microscopy, we investigate how the progression of atherosclerotic disease affects the morphology and function of cortical microvasculature as well as baseline cerebral tissue oxygenation. Results show that aged ATX mice exhibited weaker hemodynamic response in the somatosensory cortex to whisker stimulation and that the diameter of their descending arterioles and associated mean blood flow decreased significantly compared with the young ATX group. Data from two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy indicate that old ATX mice had lower and more heterogeneous partial pressure of oxygen (  PO 2   ) in cortical tissue than young ATX mice. In addition, hypoxic micropockets in cortical tissue were found in old, but not young, ATX mice. Capillary red blood cell (RBC) flux, RBC velocity, RBC velocity heterogeneity, hematocrit, and diameter were also measured using line scans with two-photon fluorescence microscopy. When compared with the young group, RBC flux, velocity, and hematocrit decreased and RBC velocity heterogeneity increased in old ATX mice, presumably due to disturbed blood supply from arterioles that were affected by atherosclerosis. Finally, dilation of capillaries in old ATX mice was observed, which suggests that capillaries play an active role in compensating for an oxygen deficit in brain tissue.","150":"Face-specific neural processes in the human brain have been localized to multiple anatomical structures and associated with diverse and dynamic social functions. The question of how various face-related systems and functions may be bound together remains an active area of investigation. We hypothesize that face processing may be associated with specific frequency band oscillations that serve to integrate distributed face processing systems. Using a multimodal imaging approach, including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), simultaneous signals were acquired during face and object picture viewing. As expected for face processing, hemodynamic activity in the right occipital face area (OFA) increased during face viewing compared to object viewing, and in a subset of participants, the expected N170 EEG response was observed for faces. Based on recently reported associations between the theta band and visual processing, we hypothesized that increased hemodynamic activity in a face processing area would also be associated with greater theta-band activity originating in the same area. Consistent with our hypothesis, theta-band oscillations were also localized to the right OFA for faces, whereas alpha- and beta-band oscillations were not. Together, these findings suggest that theta-band oscillations originating in the OFA may be part of the distributed face-specific processing mechanism.","151":"In the brain, the strength of each individual synapse is defined by the complement of proteins present or the \"local proteome.\" Activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength are the result of changes in this local proteome and posttranslational protein modifications. Although most synaptic proteins have been identified, we still know little about protein copy numbers in individual synapses and variations between synapses. We use DNA-point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography as a single-molecule super-resolution imaging technique to visualize and quantify protein copy numbers in single synapses. The imaging technique provides near-molecular spatial resolution, is unaffected by photobleaching, enables imaging of large field of views, and provides quantitative molecular information. We demonstrate these benefits by accessing copy numbers of surface AMPA-type receptors at single synapses of rat hippocampal neurons along dendritic segments.","152":"Noninvasive, three-dimensional, and longitudinal imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in small animal models and ultimately in humans has implications for fundamental research and clinical applications. It enables the study of phenomena such as brain development and learning and the effects of pathologies, with a clear vision for translation to humans. Speckle contrast optical tomography (SCOT) is an emerging optical method that aims to achieve this goal by directly measuring three-dimensional blood flow maps in deep tissue with a relatively inexpensive and simple system. High-density SCOT is developed to follow CBF changes in response to somatosensory cortex stimulation. Measurements are carried out through the intact skull on the rat brain. SCOT is able to follow individual trials in each brain hemisphere, where signal averaging resulted in comparable, cortical images to those of functional magnetic resonance images in spatial extent, location, and depth. Sham stimuli are utilized to demonstrate that the observed response is indeed due to local changes in the brain induced by forepaw stimulation. In developing and demonstrating the method, algorithms and analysis methods are developed. The results pave the way for longitudinal, nondestructive imaging in preclinical rodent models that can readily be translated to the human brain.","153":"Thermal block of unmyelinated axons may serve as a modality for control, suggesting a means for providing therapies for pain. Computational modeling predicted that potassium channels are necessary for mediating thermal block of propagating compound action potentials (CAPs) with infrared (IR) light.

Results suggest that potassium channel blockers disrupt the ability of IR to block propagating CAPs in Aplysia californica nerves, whereas sodium channel blockers appear to have no significant effect. These observations validate the modeling results and suggest potential applications of thermal block to many other unmyelinated axons.","154":"The development of effective therapies for cognitive impairment (CI), especially due to Alzheimer's disease, demands diagnosing the condition during the prodromal phase. The diagnosis of CI involves expensive and invasive methods, such as positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid assessment via spinal tap. Hence, a comparatively lower cost and noninvasive method of diagnosis is imperative. The human retina is an extension of the brain characterized by similarities in vascular and neural structures. The complications of CI are not only limited to the brain but also affect the retina for which the loss of retinal ganglion cells has been associated with neurodegeneration in the brain. The loss of retinal ganglion cells in individuals with CI may be related to reduced vascular demand and a potential remodeling of the retinal vascular branching complexity. Retinal imaging biomarkers may provide a low cost and noninvasive alternative for the diagnosis of CI. In this study, the retinal vascular branching complexity of patients with CI was characterized using the singularity spectrum multifractal dimension and lacunarity parameter. A reduced vascular branching complexity was observed in subjects with CI when compared to age- and sex-matched cognitively healthy controls. Significant associations were also found between retinal vascular and functional parameters.","155":"Accurate histopathological diagnosis is essential for facilitating the optimal surgical management of intracranial germinoma. Current intraoperative histological methods are time- and labor-intensive and often produce artifacts. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is a label-free imaging technique that can produce intraoperative histological images of fresh, unprocessed surgical specimens. We employ an MPM based on second-harmonic generation and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy to image fresh, unfixed, and unstained human germinoma specimens. We show that label-free MPM is not only capable of identifying various cells in human germinoma tissue but also capable of revealing the characteristics of germinoma such as granuloma, stromal fibrosis, calcification, as well as the abnormal and uneven structures of blood vessels. In conjunction with custom-developed image-processing algorithms, MPM can further quantify and characterize the extent of stromal fibrosis and calcification. Our results provide insight into how MPM can deliver rapid diagnostic histological data that could inform the surgical management of intracranial germinoma.","156":null,"157":"Large-scale, high-resolution imaging of cerebral hemodynamics is essential for brain research. Uniquely capable of comprehensive quantification of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in rodents based on the endogenous hemoglobin contrast, multiparametric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is ideally suited for this purpose. However, the out-of-focus issue due to the uneven surface of the rodent brain results in inaccurate PAM measurements and presents a significant challenge to cortex-wide multiparametric recording. We report a large-scale, high-resolution, multiparametric PAM system based on real-time surface contour extraction and scanning, which avoids the prescan and offline calculation of the contour map required by previously reported contour-scanning strategies. The performance of this system has been demonstrated in both phantoms and the live mouse brain through a thinned-skull window. Side-by-side comparison shows that the real-time contour scanning not only improves the quality of structural images by addressing the out-of-focus issue but also ensures accurate measurements of the concentration of hemoglobin (   C Hb    ), oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (  sO 2   ), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) over the entire mouse cortex. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals how the out-of-focus issue impairs the measurements of   C Hb    ,   sO 2    , and CBF.","158":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a vision-threatening disease that affects the outer retina and choroid of elderly adults. Because photoreceptors are found in the outer retina and rely primarily on the trophic support of the underlying choriocapillaris, imaging of flow or lack thereof in choriocapillaris by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has great clinical potential in AMD assessment. We introduce a metric using OCTA, named \"focal perfusion loss\" (FPL) to describe the effects of age and non-neovascular AMD on choriocapillaris flow. Because OCTA imaging of choriocapillaris is vulnerable to artifacts-namely motion, projections, segmentation errors, and shadows-they are removed by postprocessing software. The shadow detection software is a machine learning algorithm recently developed for the evaluation of the retinal circulation and here adapted for choriocapillaris analysis. It aims to exclude areas with unreliable flow signal due to blocking of the OCT beam by objects anterior to the choriocapillaris (e.g., drusen, retinal vessels, vitreous floaters, and iris). We found that both the FPL and the capillary density were able to detect changes in the choriocapillaris of AMD and healthy age-matched subjects with respect to young controls. The dominant cause of shadowing in AMD is drusen, and the shadow exclusion algorithm helps determine which areas under drusen retain sufficient signal for perfusion evaluation and which areas must be excluded. Such analysis allowed us to determine unambiguously that choriocapillaris density under drusen is indeed reduced.","159":null,"160":null,"161":null,"162":"We present a technique to reduce speckle in visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) that preserves fine structural details and is robust against sample motion. Specifically, we locally modulate B-scans orthogonally to their axis of acquisition. Such modulation enables acquisition of uncorrelated speckle patterns from similar anatomical locations, which can be averaged to reduce speckle. To verify the effectiveness of speckle reduction, we performed in-vivo retinal imaging using modulated raster and circular scans in both mice and humans. We compared speckle-reduced vis-OCT images with the images acquired with unmodulated B-scans from the same anatomical locations. We compared contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and equivalent number of looks (ENL) to quantify the image quality enhancement. Speckle-reduced images showed up to a 2.35-dB improvement in CNR and up to a 3.1-fold improvement in ENL with more discernable anatomical features using eight modulated A-line averages at a 25-kHz A-line rate.","163":"Retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of vision impairment, increasing in incidence worldwide due to an aging society. If diagnosed early, most cases could be prevented. In contrast to standard ophthalmic diagnostic tools, Raman spectroscopy can provide a comprehensive overview of the biochemical composition of the retina in a label-free manner. A proof of concept study of the applicability of nonresonant Raman spectroscopy for retinal investigations is presented. Raman imaging provides valuable insights into the molecular composition of an isolated ex vivo human retina sample by probing the entire molecular fingerprint, i.e., the lipid, protein, carotenoid, and nucleic acid content. The results are compared to morphological information obtained by optical coherence tomography of the sample. The challenges of in vivo Raman studies due to laser safety limitations and predefined optical parameters given by the eye itself are explored. An in-house built setup simulating the optical pathway in the human eye was developed and used to demonstrate that even under laser safety regulations and the above-mentioned optical restrictions, Raman spectra of isolated ex vivo human retinas can be recorded. The results strongly support that in vivo studies using nonresonant Raman spectroscopy are feasible and that these studies provide comprehensive molecular information of the human retina.","164":"Near-infrared radiation (NIR) has been described as one of the highest-resolution tools for neuromodulation. However, the poor tissue penetration depth of NIR has limited its further application on some of the deeper layer neurons in vivo. A 980-nm short-wavelength NIR (SW-NIR) with high penetration depth was employed, and its inhibitory effect on neurons was investigated in vivo. In experiments, SW-NIR was implemented on the rat's cochlear nucleus (CN), the auditory pathway was activated by pure-tones through the rat's external auditory canal, and the neural responses were recorded in the inferior colliculus by a multichannel electrode array. Neural firing rate (FR) and the first spike latency (FSL) were analyzed to evaluate the optically induced neural inhibition. Meanwhile, a two-layered finite element, consisting of a fluid layer and a gray matter layer, was established to model the optically induced temperature changes in CN; different stimulation paradigms were used to compare the inhibitory efficiency of SW-NIR. Results showed that SW-NIR could reversibly inhibit acoustically induced CN neural activities: with the increase of laser radiant exposures energy, neural FR decreased significantly and FSL lengthened steadily. Significant inhibition occurred when the optical pulse stimulated prior to the acoustic stimulus. Results indicated that the inhibition relies on the establishment time of the temperature field. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that short-wavelength infrared could regulate the activities of neurons beyond the neural tissues laser irradiated through neural networks and conduction in vivo. These findings may provide a method for accurate neuromodulation in vivo.","165":"Measurements of dynamic near-infrared (NIR) light attenuation across the human head together with model-based image reconstruction algorithms allow the recovery of three-dimensional spatial brain activation maps. Previous studies using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) systems have reported improved image quality over sparse arrays. These HD-DOT systems incorporated multidistance overlapping continuous wave measurements that only recover differential intensity attenuation. We investigate the potential improvement in reconstructed image quality due to the additional incorporation of phase shift measurements, which reflect the time-of-flight of the measured NIR light, within the tomographic reconstruction from high-density measurements. To evaluate image reconstruction with and without the additional phase information, we simulated point spread functions across a whole-scalp field of view in 24 subject-specific anatomical models using an experimentally derived noise model. The addition of phase information improves the image quality by reducing localization error by up to 59% and effective resolution by up to 21% as compared to using the intensity attenuation measurements alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phase data enable images to be resolved at deeper brain regions where intensity data fail, which is further supported by utilizing experimental data from a single subject measurement during a retinotopic experiment.","166":"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that has profound effects on the brain. Chronic anemia combined with both macro- and microvascular perfusion abnormalities that arise from stenosis or occlusion of blood vessels increased blood viscosity, adherence of red blood cells to the vascular endothelium, and impaired autoregulatory mechanisms in SCD patients all culminate in susceptibility to cerebral infarction. Indeed, the risk of stroke is 250 times higher in children with SCD than in the general population. Unfortunately, while transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) has been widely clinically adopted to longitudinally monitor macrovascular perfusion in these patients, routine clinical screening of microvascular perfusion abnormalities is challenging with current modalities (e.g., positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) given their high-cost, requirement for sedation in children &lt; 6  year, and need for trained personnel. We assess the feasibility of a low-cost, noninvasive optical technique known as diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to quantify an index of resting-state cortical cerebral blood flow (BFI) in 11 children with SCD along with 11 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. As expected, BFI was significantly higher in SCD subjects compared to healthy controls ( p &lt; 0.001  ). Within SCD subjects, BFI was inversely proportional to resting-state arterial hemoglobin levels ( p = 0.012  ), consistent with expected anemia-induced compensatory vasodilation that aims to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to the tissue. Further, in a subset of patients measured with TCD ( n = 7  ), DCS-measured blood flow was correlated with TCD-measured blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery (  R s = 0.68  ), although the trend was not statistically significant ( p = 0.11  ). These results are consistent with those of several previous studies using traditional neuroimaging techniques, suggesting that DCS may be a promising low-cost tool for assessment of tissue-level CBF in pediatric SCD.","167":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) estimates the functional oscillations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in the cortex through scalp-located multiwavelength recordings. Hemoglobin oscillations are inferred through temporal changes in continuous-wave (CW) light attenuation. However, because of the diffusive multilayered head tissue structures, the photon path is longer than the source-detector separation, complicating hemoglobin evaluation. This aspect is incorporated in the modified Beer-Lambert law where the source-detector distance is multiplied by the differential pathlength factor (DPF). Since DPF estimation requires photons' time-of-flight information, DPF is assumed a priori in CW-fNIRS. Importantly, errors in the DPF spectrum induce hemoglobin cross talk, which is detrimental for fNIRS. We propose to estimate subject-specific DPF spectral dependence relying on multidistance high-density measurements. The procedure estimates the effective attenuation coefficient (EAC), which is proportional to the geometric mean of absorption and reduced scattering. Since DPF depends on the scattering-to-absorption ratio, EAC limits the spectral dependence assumption to scattering. This approach was compared to a standard frequency-domain multidistance procedure. A good association between the two methods (   r 2  = 0.69  ) was obtained. This approach could estimate low-resolution maps of the DPF spectral dependence through large field of view, high-density systems, reducing hemoglobin cross talk, and increasing fNIRS sensitivity and specificity to brain activity without instrumentation modification.","168":"Calcium imaging is emerging as a popular technique in neuroscience. A major reason is that intracellular calcium transients are reflections of electrical events in neurons. For example, calcium influx in the soma and axonal boutons accompanies spiking activity, whereas elevations in dendrites and dendritic spines are associated with synaptic inputs and local regenerative events. However, calcium transients have complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and since most optical methods visualize only one of the somatic, axonal, and dendritic compartments, a straightforward inference of the underlying electrical event is typically challenging. We highlight experiments that have directly calibrated in vivo calcium signals recorded using fluorescent indicators against electrophysiological events. We address commonly asked questions such as: Can calcium imaging be used to characterize neurons with high firing rates? Can the fluorescent signal report a decrease in spiking activity? What is the evidence that calcium transients in subcellular compartments correspond to distinct presynaptic axonal and postsynaptic dendritic events? By reviewing the empirical evidence and limitations, we suggest that, despite some caveats, calcium imaging is a versatile method to characterize a variety of neuronal events in vivo.","169":"Optical coherence tomography provides volumetric reconstruction of brain structure with micrometer resolution. Gray matter and white matter can be highlighted using conventional and polarization-based contrasts; however, vasculature in ex-vivo fixed brain has not been investigated at large scale due to lack of intrinsic contrast. We present contrast enhancement to visualize the vasculature by perfusing titanium dioxide particles transcardially into the mouse vascular system. The brain, after dissection and fixation, is imaged by a serial optical coherence scanner. Accumulation of particles in blood vessels generates distinguishable optical signals. Among these, the cross-polarization images reveal the vasculature organization remarkably well. The conventional and polarization-based contrasts are still available for probing the gray matter and white matter structures. The segmentation and reconstruction of the vasculature are presented by using a deep learning algorithm. Axonal fiber pathways in the mouse brain are delineated by utilizing the retardance and optic axis orientation contrasts. This is a low-cost method that can be further developed to study neurovascular diseases and brain injury in animal models.","170":null,"171":"The retina, as part of the central nervous system, has distinct anatomical and structural properties for its visual function. Light scattering spectroscopy, while widely used for tissue structural characterization and disease diagnosis, has been relatively unexplored in the living retina. Recently, we have developed a fiber-based visible and near-infrared optical coherence tomography system (vnOCT) for in vivo retinal imaging, to uniquely measure a spectroscopic marker (VN ratio) sensitive to nanoscale pathological changes. In the present study, we applied vnOCT in an animal model of glaucoma (dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension mouse) and tested the capabilities of four optical markers, VN ratio, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, total retinal blood flow, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (   sO 2    ), for the detection of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) damage in association with ocular hypertension. We found that RNFL-RGC VN ratio and arteriovenous (A-V)   sO 2    are capable of detecting early retinal alteration in ocular hypertensive eyes, preceding measurable change of RNFL thickness. This study suggests a potential clinical application of vnOCT in early detection of glaucoma.","172":"The methods used for digital processing of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and crosspolarization (CP) OCT images are focused on improving the contrast ratio of native structural OCT images. Such advances are particularly important for the intraoperative detection of glioma margins where the visual assessment of OCT images can be difficult and lead to errors. The aim of the study was to investigate the application of optical coefficients obtained from CP OCT data for the differentiation of glial tumorous tissue from a normal brain. Pseudocolor en-face OCT maps based on two optical coefficients (the commonly used rate of attenuation in the cochannel, and in addition, the interchannel attenuation difference) were constructed for normal rat brain coronal cross sections and for brains with a 101.8 rat glioblastoma model. It was shown that the use of optical coefficients significantly increased the available information from the OCT data in comparison with unprocessed images. As a result, this allowed contrasting of the white matter from the gray matter and tumorous tissue ex vivo, and for this purpose, the interchannel attenuation difference worked better. The interchannel attenuation difference values of white matter were at least seven and two times higher than corresponding values of the cortex and tumorous tissue, whereas the same parameter for cochannel attenuation coefficient values of white matter are about 4 and 1.4. However, quantitative analysis shows that both coefficients are suitable for the purpose of glioblastoma detection from normal brain tissue regardless of whether a necrotic component was present (in all compared groups p &lt; 0.001  ).","173":"Time-domain diffuse correlation spectroscopy (TD-DCS) is an emerging noninvasive optical technique with the potential to resolve blood flow (BF) and optical coefficients (reduced scattering and absorption) in depth. Here, we study the effects of finite temporal resolution and gate width in a realistic TD-DCS experiment. We provide a model for retrieving the BF from gated intensity autocorrelations based on the instrument response function, which allows for the use of broad time gates. This, in turn, enables a higher signal-to-noise ratio that is critical for in vivo applications. In numerical simulations, the use of the proposed model reduces the error in the estimated late gate BF from 34% to 3%. Simulations are also performed for a wide set of optical properties and source-detector separations. In a homogeneous phantom experiment, the discrepancy between later gates BF index and ungated BF index is reduced from 37% to 2%. This work not only provides a tool for data analysis but also physical insights, which can be useful for studying and optimizing the system performance.","174":null,"175":"Directing attention to movement outcomes (external focus; EF), not body movements (internal focus; IF), is a better cognitive strategy for motor performance. However, EF is not effective in some healthy individuals or stroke patients. We aimed to identify the neurological basis reflecting the individual optimal attentional strategy using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Sixty-four participants (23 healthy young, 23 healthy elderly, and 18 acute stroke) performed a reaching movement task under IF and EF conditions. Of these, 13 healthy young participants, 11 healthy elderly participants, and 6 stroke patients showed better motor performance under EF conditions (EF-dominant), whereas the others showed IF-dominance. We then measured prefrontal activity during rhythmic hand movements under both attentional conditions. IF-dominant participants showed significantly higher left prefrontal activity than EF-dominant participants under IF condition. In addition, receiver operating characteristic analysis supported that the higher activity in the left frontopolar and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices could detect IF-dominance as an individual's optimal attentional strategy for preventing motor performance decline. Taken together, these results suggest that prefrontal activity during motor tasks reflects an individual's ability to process internal body information, thereby conferring IF-dominance. These findings could be applied for the development of individually optimized rehabilitation programs.","176":"Communication within the brain is highly dynamic. Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits dynamic progression corresponding to a decline in memory and cognition. However, little is known of whether brain dynamics are disrupted in AD and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For our study, we acquired high sampling rate functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging data at rest from the entire cortex of 23 patients with AD dementia, 25 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Sliding-window correlation and k-means clustering analyses were used to construct dynamic functional connectivity (FC) maps for each participant. We discovered that the brain's dynamic FC variability strength ( Q  ) significantly increased in both aMCI and AD group as compared to HCs. Using the Q  value as a measurement, the classification performance exhibited a good power in differentiating aMCI [area under the curve ( AUC = 82.5 %  )] or AD ( AUC = 86.4 %  ) from HCs. Furthermore, we identified two abnormal brain FC states in the AD group, of which the occurrence frequency ( F  ) exhibited a significant decrease for the first-level FC state (state 1) and a significant increase for the second-level FC state (state 2). We also found that the abnormal F  in these two states significantly correlated with the cognitive impairment in patients. These findings provide the first evidence to demonstrate the disruptions of dynamic brain connectivity in aMCI and AD and extend the traditional static (i.e., time-averaged) FC findings in the disease (i.e., disconnection syndrome) and thus provide insights into understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms occurring in aMCI and AD.","177":null,"178":"Executive functions (EFs) associated with the frontal lobe are vital for goal-orientated behavior. To date, limited efforts have been made to examine the relationships among the behavior, brain activation, and topological organization of functional networks in the frontal lobe underlying various EF tasks, including inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. In this study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging technique was used to systematically inspect the differences in the brain activation and the topological organization of brain networks between various EF tasks in the frontal lobe. In addition, the relationships between brain activation\/network properties and task performances and the relationships between brain activation and network properties were, respectively, examined for different EF tasks. Consequently, we have discovered that the nodal and global properties of the resting-state and task-evoked networks, respectively, exhibited significant correlations with the activation of various brain regions during various EF tasks. In particular, the measure that links the neural activation to the topological organization of the brain networks in the frontal lobe can serve as a synergistic indicator to examine the difference between various EF tasks, which paves a way toward a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanism underlying EFs.","179":"Cerebral asymmetry is considered an important marker of the successful development of the human brain. Recent studies have demonstrated topological asymmetries between structurally hemispheric networks in the human brain. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how the functionally topological asymmetries evolve from childhood to adulthood, a critical period that constitutes the primary peak of human brain and cognitive development. Here, we adopted resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy imaging data to construct hemispheric functional networks and then applied graph theory analysis to quantify the topological characteristics of the hemispheric networks. We found that the adult group exhibited consistent leftward hemispheric asymmetries in both global and local network efficiency, and the degree of leftward asymmetry in local network efficiency was significantly increased with development from childhood to adulthood. At the nodal level, the degree of leftward asymmetry in nodal efficiency, mainly involving the frontal, parietal-occipital junction, and occipital regions, increased with development. These developmental patterns of topological asymmetries suggest that the protracted maturation of functional segregation in the left hemisphere could underlie language development from childhood to adulthood and provide insight into the development of human brain functional networks.","180":"The BabyLux device is a hybrid diffuse optical neuromonitor that has been developed and built to be employed in neonatal intensive care unit for the noninvasive, cot-side monitoring of microvascular cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation. It integrates time-resolved near-infrared and diffuse correlation spectroscopies in a user-friendly device as a prototype for a future medical grade device. We present a thorough characterization of the device performance using test measurements in laboratory settings. Tests on solid phantoms report an accuracy of optical property estimation of about 10%, which is expected when using the photon diffusion equation as the model. The measurement of the optical and dynamic properties is stable during several hours of measurements within 3% of the average value. In addition, these measurements are repeatable between different days of measurement, showing a maximal variation of 5% in the optical properties and 8% for the particle diffusion coefficient on a liquid phantom. The variability over test\/retest evaluation is &lt; 3 %  . The integration of the two modalities is robust and without any cross talk between the two. We also perform in vivo measurements on the adult forearm during arterial cuff occlusion to show that the device can measure a wide range of tissue hemodynamic parameters. We suggest that this platform can form the basis of the next-generation neonatal neuromonitors to be developed for extensive, multicenter clinical testing.","181":"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is an optical imaging method that can be translated from the cell culture dish in vitro to cell tracking in small animal models in vivo. In contrast to the more widely used fluorescence imaging, which requires light excitation, in BLI the light is exclusively generated by the enzyme luciferase. The luciferase gene can be engineered to target and monitor almost every cell and biological process quantitatively in vitro and even from deep tissue in vivo. While initially used for tumor imaging, bioluminescence was recently optimized for mouse brain imaging of neural cells and monitoring of viability or differentiation of grafted stem cells. Here, we describe the use of bright color-shifted firefly luciferases (Flucs) based on the thermostable x5 Fluc that emit red and green for effective and quantitative unmixing of two human cell populations in vitro and after transplantation into the mouse brain in vivo. Spectral unmixing predicts the ratio of luciferases in vitro and a mixture of cells precisely for cortical grafts, however, with less accuracy for striatal grafts. This dual-color approach enables the simultaneous visualization and quantification of two cell populations on the whole brain scale, with particular relevance for translational studies of neurological disorders providing information on stem cell survival and differentiation in one imaging session in vivo.","182":"We offer a retrospective report on fNIRS 2018, along with news of the next meeting.","183":null,"184":null,"185":null,"186":"Multimodal imaging combining optoacoustic tomography (OAT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables spatiotemporal resolution complementarity, improves accurate quantification, and thus yields more insights into physiology and pathophysiology. However, only manual landmark based coregistration of OAT-MRI has been used so far. We developed a toolbox (RegOA), which frames an automated registration pipeline to align OAT with high-field MR images based on mutual information. We assessed the performance of the registration method using images acquired on one phantom with fiducial markers and in vivo\/ex vivo data of mouse heads\/brain. The accuracy and robustness of the registration are improved using a two-step registration method with preprocessing of OAT and MRI data. The major advantages of our approach are minimal user input and quantitative assessment of the registration error. The registration with MR and standard reference atlas enables regional information extraction, facilitating the accurate, objective, and rapid analysis of large groups of rodent OAT and MR images.","187":"Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a powerful tool for investigating model organisms including zebrafish. However, due to scattering and refractive index variations within the sample, the resulting image often suffers from low contrast. Structured illumination (SI) has been combined with scanned LSFM to remove out-of-focus and scattered light using square-law detection. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of LSFM with linear reconstruction SI can further increase resolution and contrast in the vertical and axial directions compared to the widely adopted root-mean square reconstruction method while using the same input images. We apply this approach to imaging neural activity in 7-day postfertilization zebrafish larvae. We imaged two-dimensional sections of the zebrafish central nervous system in two colors at an effective frame rate of 7 frames per second.","188":"Speckle contrast imaging allows in vivo imaging of relative blood flow changes. Multiple exposure speckle imaging (MESI) is more accurate than the standard single-exposure method since it allows separating the contribution of the static and moving scatters of the recorded speckle patterns. MESI requires experimental validation on phantoms prior to in vivo experiments to ensure the proper calibration of the system and the robustness of the model. The data analysis relies on the calculation of the speckle contrast for each exposure and a subsequent nonlinear fit to the MESI model to extract the scatterers correlation time and the relative contribution of moving scatters. We have designed two multichannel polydimethylsiloxane chips to study the influence of multiple and static scattering on the accuracy of MESI quantitation. We also propose a method based on standard C++ libraries to implement a computationally efficient analysis of the MESI data. Finally, the system was used to obtain in vivo hemodynamic data on two distinct sensory areas of the mice brain: the barrel cortex and the olfactory bulb.","189":"Optogenetics has revolutionized the study of circuit function in the brain, by allowing activation of specific ensembles of neurons by light. However, this technique has not yet been exploited extensively at the subcellular level. Here, we test the feasibility of a focal stimulation approach using stimulated emission depletion\/reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions-like illumination, whereby switchable light-gated channels are focally activated by a laser beam of one wavelength and deactivated by an overlapping donut-shaped beam of a different wavelength, confining activation to a center focal region. This method requires that activated channelrhodopsins are inactivated by overlapping illumination of a distinct wavelength and that photocurrents are large enough to be detected at the nanoscale. In tests of current optogenetic tools, we found that ChR2 C128A\/H134R\/T159C and CoChR C108S and C108S\/D136A-activated with 405-nm light and inactivated by coillumination with 594-nm light-and C1V1 E122T\/C167S-activated by 561-nm light and inactivated by 405-nm light-were most promising in terms of highest photocurrents and efficient inactivation with coillumination. Although further engineering of step-function channelrhodopsin variants with higher photoconductances will be required to employ this approach at the nanoscale, our findings provide a framework to guide future development of this technique.","190":null,"191":"Large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke might cause different degrees of hemodynamic impairment that affects microcirculation and contributes to metabolic derangement. Time-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-NIRS) estimates the oxygenation of microcirculation of cerebral outer layers. We measure hemoglobin species and tissue oxygen saturation (   StO 2    ) of anterior circulation stroke patients, classified as LVO or lacunar, and assess the differences compared with controls and according to LVO recanalization status. Fiducial markers categorize the brain region below each TD-NIRS probe as ischemic or nonstroke areas. The study includes 47 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients and 35 controls. The ischemic area has significantly higher deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) compared with controls in both recanalized and nonrecanalized patients but lower  StO 2   only in recanalized patients. Recanalized patients have significantly lower mean  StO 2   in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with nonrecanalized patients. This is the first study to report TD-NIRS measurements in acute ischemic stroke patients. TD-NIRS is able to detect significant differences in hemoglobin species in LVO stroke compared with controls and according to recanalization status. This preliminary data might suggest that  StO 2   can serve as a surrogate functional marker of the metabolic activity of rescued brain tissue.","192":null,"193":null,"194":null,"195":null,"196":null,"197":null,"198":null,"199":null,"200":null,"201":null,"202":"We summarize the available in vivo validation of cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) oximetry to inform future in vivo validation strategies. In particular, to establish a way forward in the assessment of NIRS instrumentation for future randomized trials, a systematic literature search is performed. The records are screened and abstracts are assessed to select studies fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Twenty-two pediatric and 28 adult studies are analyzed after exclusion of three articles in each group. All studies compare regional cerebral tissue oxygenation measured by cerebral NIRS to invasive measurement of central or jugular venous oxygen saturation. In studies without Bland-Altman plots, we extracted data from scatter plots enabling estimation of mean difference (MD), standard deviation (SD), and limits of agreement (LOA). To assess the agreement between   rStO 2    (regional cerebral tissue oxygenation) estimated by NIRS and by blood samples, weighted averages of the MDs and SDs from each study are calculated. We found a fair agreement between the overall mean of cerebral tissue oxygenation and the mean of a reference value measured by co-oximetry whatever NIRS instrument or site of blood sampling used. Cerebral oxygenation overestimates the reference at low values, some instruments apparently more than others. Thus, a high degree of scatter and a lack of a good reference method complicate in vivo validation of NIRS. It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions despite the large number of studies, and the result of this review leaves us questioning if more of such validation studies of cerebral NIRS oximetry are really needed. Furthermore, the combination of lack of validation and poor repeatability is an important issue when designing a randomized clinical trial of implementing cerebral NIRS oximetry into clinical care.","203":null,"204":null,"205":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.5.4.045001.].","206":null,"207":"Neurophotonics is an exploding field that spans the intersection of light and neurons for fundamental discovery and clinical translation.

The possible advantage of optical stimulation over electrical is attributable to its spatially selective activation of small neuron populations, which is promising in generating superior spatial resolution in neural interfaces. Two principal methods are explored for cochlear prostheses: direct stimulation of nerves with infrared light and optogenetics. This paper discusses basic requirements for developing a light delivery system (LDS) for the cochlea and provides examples for building such devices. The proposed device relies on small optical sources, which are assembled in an array to be inserted into the cochlea. The mechanical properties, the biocompatibility, and the efficacy of optrodes have been tested in animal models. The force required to insert optrodes into a model of the human scala tympani was comparable to insertion forces obtained for contemporary cochlear implant electrodes. Side-emitting diodes are powerful enough to evoke auditory responses in guinea pigs. Chronic implantation of the LDS did not elevate auditory brainstem responses over 26 weeks.","209":"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers the potential to characterize resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in populations that are not easily assessed otherwise, such as young infants. In addition to the advantages of NIRS, one should also consider that the RS-NIRS signal requires specific data preprocessing and analysis. In particular, the RS-NIRS signal shows a colored frequency spectrum, which can be observed as temporal autocorrelation, thereby introducing spurious correlations. To address this issue, prewhitening of the RS-NIRS signal has been recently proposed as a necessary step to remove the signal temporal autocorrelation and therefore reduce false-discovery rates. However, the impact of this step on the analysis of experimental RS-NIRS data has not been thoroughly assessed prior to the present study. Here, the results of a standard preprocessing pipeline in a RS-NIRS dataset acquired in infants are compared with the results after incorporating two different prewhitening algorithms. Our results with a standard preprocessing replicated previous studies. Prewhitening altered RSFC patterns and disrupted the antiphase relationship between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. We conclude that a better understanding of the effect of prewhitening on RS-NIRS data is still needed before directly considering its incorporation to the standard preprocessing pipeline.","210":null,"211":"The position of each source and detector \"optode\" on the scalp, and their relative separations, determines the sensitivity of each functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) channel to the underlying cortex. As a result, selecting appropriate scalp locations for the available sources and detectors is critical to every fNIRS experiment. At present, it is standard practice for the user to undertake this task manually; to select what they believe are the best locations on the scalp to place their optodes so as to sample a given cortical region-of-interest (ROI). This process is difficult, time-consuming, and highly subjective. Here, we propose a tool, Array Designer, that is able to automatically design optimized fNIRS arrays given a user-defined ROI and certain features of the available fNIRS device. Critically, the Array Designer methodology is generalizable and will be applicable to almost any subject population or fNIRS device. We describe and validate the algorithmic methodology that underpins Array Designer by running multiple simulations of array design problems in a realistic anatomical model. We believe that Array Designer has the potential to end the need for manual array design, and in doing so save researchers time, improve fNIRS data quality, and promote standardization across the field.","212":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social communication and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests. Executive function impairment is reportedly partially responsible for these symptoms. Executive function includes planning, flexibility, and inhibitory control. Although planning and flexibility in ASD have been consistently reported as atypical, the atypicality of inhibitory control remains controversial. As most previous studies have used nonsocial stimuli to investigate inhibitory control in ASD, the effects of socially relevant information on the inhibitory control system in individuals with ASD remain unclear. Therefore, we developed a go\/no-go task with gaze stimuli and measured hemodynamic responses in the right prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in inhibitory processing in both typically developing (TD) children and children with ASD, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Direct gaze induced commission errors to similar extents in both groups. Contrary to the behavioral responses, neural activation in the right PFC was modulated by gaze direction only in the TD group. These findings suggest that the gaze-processing mechanisms in the prefrontal region may be affected by atypical gaze processing in other brain regions during an inhibitory control task with socially relevant information in ASD.","213":"Recently, a variety of tissue optical clearing techniques have been developed to reduce light scattering for imaging deeper and three-dimensional reconstruction of tissue structures. Combined with optical imaging techniques and diverse labeling methods, these clearing methods have significantly promoted the development of neuroscience. Each of them has its own characteristics with certain advantages and disadvantages. Though there are some comparison results, the clearing methods covered are limited and the evaluation indices lack uniformity, which made it difficult to select a best-fit protocol from numerous methods for clearing in practical applications. Hence, it is necessary to systematically assess and compare these clearing methods. We evaluated the performance of seven typical clearing methods, including 3-D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (3DISCO), ultimate DISCO (uDISCO), see deep brain (SeeDB), ScaleS, ClearT2 , clear, unobstructed brain imaging cocktails and computational analysis, and passive CLARITY technique (PACT), on mouse brain samples. First, we compared the clearing effect and clearing time as well as size deformation on brain tissues. Further, we evaluated the fluorescence preservation and the increase of imaging depth induced by different methods. The results showed that 3DISCO, uDISCO, and PACT possessed excellent clearing capability on mouse brains, ScaleS and SeeDB rendered moderate transparency, whereas ClearT2 performed the worst. uDISCO and 3DISCO induced substantial size reduction on brain sections, and PACT expanded the mouse brain most seriously. Among those methods, ScaleS performed best on fluorescence retention, 3DISCO induced the biggest decline of the fluorescence. PACT achieved the highest increase of imaging depth, and SeeDB and ClearT2 possessed the shallowest imaging depth. This study is expected to provide important reference for users in choosing the most suitable brain optical clearing method.","214":null,"215":null,"216":"A good understanding of age-dependent changes and modifications in brain networks is crucial for fully exploring the effects of aging on the human brain. Few reports have been found in studies of functional brain networks using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Moreover, little is known about the feasibility of using fNIRS to assess age-related changes in brain connectomes. This study applied whole brain fNIRS measurement, combined with graph theory analysis, to assess the age-dependent changes in resting-state brain networks. Five to eight minutes of resting-state brain hemodynamic signals were recorded from 48 participants (18 young adults and 30 older adults) with 133 optical channels covering the majority of the cortical regions. Both local and global graph metrics were computed to identify the age-related changes of topographical brain networks. Older adults showed an overall decline of both global and local efficiency compared to young adults, as well as the decline of small-worldness. In addition, young adults showed the abundance of hubs in the prefrontal cortex, whereas older adults revealed the hub shifts to the sensorimotor cortex. These obvious shifts of hubs may potentially indicate decreases of the decision-making, memory, and other high-order functions as people age.

By targeting both excitation maxima of the oxygen-sensitive Oxyphor PtG4, we are able to examine the effects of excitation wavelength on the measured phosphorescence lifetime. We demonstrate the ability to measure the differences in pO2 between arteries and veins and large changes during a hyperoxic challenge. We dynamically monitor blood flow and pO2 during DMD-targeted photothrombotic occlusion of an arteriole and highlight the presence of an ischemia-induced depolarization. Chronic tracking of the ischemic lesion over eight days revealed a rapid recovery, with the targeted vessel fully reperfusing and pO2 returning to baseline values within five days. This system has broad applications for studying the acute and chronic pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and other vascular diseases of the brain.","218":null,"219":"Previous research has demonstrated changes in neurovascular activation of the prefrontal cortex to increased working memory load.

In study one, 30 participants (15 female, mean age = 21.09 years, s.d. = 2.9 years) performed a verbal version of the n -back working memory task under four levels of demand (easy, hard, very hard, and impossible). In contrast to the raw data, CBSI-transformed fNIRS data indicated that neurovascular coupling was highest at hard demand when the task was challenging but success was possible. The second study ( N=30 ; 15 female, mean age = 22.4 years, s.d. = 5.3) replicated the working memory manipulation with the addition of low versus high levels of financial reward. Analyses of CBSI-transformed levels of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin replicated the first study at right lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex (BA46). HHb_CBSI data were significantly reduced at impossible demand for participants receiving the higher level of financial reward. The study is the first to support predictions from the motivational intensity model using neurovascular data. In addition, the application of CBSI to fNIRS data was found to improve the sensitivity of HbO and Hbb to the independent variables.","220":null,"221":"This study examined the neural mechanism underlying two translation strategies associated with Chinese to English simultaneous interpreting (SI) targeting the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is generally involved in the control of interference and conflict resolution and has been identified as the brain area that plays a pivotal role in SI.

Fifteen TD children ([Formula: see text]) and 12 children with HCP ([Formula: see text]) were included. We assessed the PFC activation while performing an ecologically valid upper extremity shape-matching task of different complexities by measuring the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The motor task performance was assessed by quantifying the average number of shapes matched, reaction time (RT), task errors, nine-hole peg test (NHPT), and the box and block test (BBT). Overall, there was a systematic increase in the HbO in the PFC across the shape-matching complexity conditions. Our results also revealed that the children with HCP had an increased amount of PFC activation while performing all of the shape-matching tasks. The increased PFC activation paralleled the differences in the number of shapes matched, RT, task errors, NHPT, and BBT.

We tested the performance of conventional motion correction methods and compared probe motion and data quality metrics for data collected at different infant ages (5, 7, and 12 months) and during different methods of stimulus presentation (video versus live). While 5-month-olds had slower maximum head speed than 7- or 12-month-olds, data quality metrics and hemodynamic response recovery errors were similar across ages. Data quality was also similar between video and live stimulus presentation. Motion correction algorithms, such as wavelet filtering and targeted principal component analysis, performed well for infant data using infant-specific parameters, and parameters may be used without fine-tuning for infant age or method of stimulus presentation. We recommend using wavelet filtering with [Formula: see text]; however, a range of parameters seemed acceptable. We do not recommend using trial rejection alone, because it did not improve hemodynamic response recovery as compared to no correction at all.

Various motion correction algorithms have been used to alleviate the effect of motion artifacts on the estimation of the hemodynamic response function. While smoothing methods, such as wavelet filtering, are excellent in removing motion-induced sharp spikes, the baseline shifts in the signal remain after this type of filtering. Methods, such as spline interpolation, on the other hand, can properly correct baseline shifts; however, they leave residual high-frequency spikes. We propose a hybrid method that takes advantage of different correction algorithms. This method first identifies the baseline shifts and corrects them using a spline interpolation method or targeted principal component analysis. The remaining spikes, on the other hand, are corrected by smoothing methods: Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering or robust locally weighted regression and smoothing. We have compared our new approach with the existing correction algorithms in terms of hemodynamic response function estimation using the following metrics: mean-squared error, peak-to-peak error ([Formula: see text]), Pearson's correlation ([Formula: see text]), and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve.

Considering the importance of spatial WM in daily life and the well-known role of ventrolateral-PFC\/dorsolateral-PFC (VLPFC\/DLPFC) in WM processes, the present study was aimed at investigating, by a 20-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system (including four short-separation channels), the hemodynamic response of the VLPFC\/DLPFC during a computerized version of the CBT. Thirty-nine university students were asked to perform CBT standard version (CBTs), block-suppression CBT (CBTb), and control task (CBTc). A VLPFC activation during CBTs and a DLPFC activation during CBTb were hypothesized. The results of the Bayesian analysis have not shown a delineated specific activation of VLPFC\/DLPFC during either CBTs or CBTb. These results together with the related ones obtained by others using fMRI are not sufficient to definitively state the role of the PFC subregions during CBT execution.

We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recorded over the right temporal lobe of infants to assess the role of the superior temporal sulcus-temporoparietal junction (STS-TPJ) region during naturalistic social interactions. We observed increased cortical activation in the STS-TPJ region to live social stimuli in both socially engaging conditions compared to baseline during real life interaction, with greater activation evident for the joint attention (reading book) condition relative to the social nursery rhymes. These results supported the view that the STS-TPJ region, engaged in the cortical social brain network, is already specialized in infants for processing social signals and is sensitive to communicative situations.

However, when the target cortical region has multiple functions, our understanding of the effects is less clear. This is true in the supplementary motor area (SMA), which is involved both in postural control and upper-limb movement. To address this issue, we investigated the facilitatory effect of NIRS SMA neurofeedback on cortical activity and behavior, without any specific task. Twenty healthy individuals participated in real and sham neurofeedback. Balance and hand dexterity were assessed before and after each NIRS-NFB session. We found a significant interaction between assessment periods (pre\/post) and condition (real\/sham) with respect to balance as assessed by the center of the pressure path length but not for hand dexterity as assessed by the 9-hole peg test.

The present investigation sought to employ functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to derive two operationalizations of cerebral oxygenation, representing mean and variability [using standard deviation (SD)] in neural activity, and to specifically contrast these mean- and SD-oxyhemoglobin (HbO) estimates as predictors of cognitive function. a total of 25 older adults (71 to 81 years of age) completed a test of cognitive interference (Multisource Interference Task) while undergoing fNIRS recording using a multichannel continuous-wave optical imaging system (TechEn CW6) over bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Time-varying covariation models were employed to simultaneously estimate the within- and between-person effects of cerebral oxygenation on behavioral performance fluctuations. mean effects were predominantly observed at the between-person level and suggest that greater concentrations of HbO are associated with slower and less accurate performance. Greater HbO variability at the between-person level was associated with slower performance, but was associated with faster performance at the within-person level. these findings are in keeping with assertions that mean and variability confer complementary (as opposed to redundant) sources of information regarding the effective functioning of a neural system and suggest that fNIRS is a viable methodology for capturing meaningful variance in the hemodynamic response that is characteristic of adaptive CNS function.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) could be suited for such a purpose because of the fNIRS flexibility. We investigated whether the complexity, based on sample entropy and multiscale entropy metrics, of the fNIRS signal during FCSRT was correlated with memory deficit in early AD. fNIRS signals were recorded over the prefrontal cortex of healthy and early AD participants. Group differences were tested through Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test ([Formula: see text]). At group level, we found significant differences for Brodmann areas 9 and 46. The results, although preliminary, demonstrate the feasibility of performing ecological studies on early AD with fNIRS. This approach may provide a potential neuroimaging-based method for diagnosis of early AD, viable at the doctor's office level, improving test-based diagnosis.

Peripheral electrical stimulation has shed light on therapeutic interventions for ischemia by increasing cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the target region through collateral circulation, although the mechanism remains elusive. Here, a focal photothrombotic ischemic (PTI) stroke was induced in the right hemispheric primary somatosensory forelimb cortex (S1FL) of rat brains, and the therapeutic effects of forelimb and hindlimb stimulation were characterized at the contralesional S1FL.

First, we measured time-dependent temperature increases on forehead skin using clinical-grade thermometers following the TILS experimental protocol used in our previous study. Second, a subject-averaged, time-dependent temperature alteration curve was obtained, based on which a heat generator was controlled to induce the same temperature increase at the same forehead location that TILS was delivered on each participant. Third, the same bb-NIRS system was employed to monitor hemodynamic and metabolic changes of forehead tissue near the thermal stimulation site before, during, and after the heat stimulation. The results showed that cytochrome-c-oxidase of forehead tissue was not significantly modified by this heat stimulation. Significant differences in oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and differential hemoglobin concentrations were observed during the heat stimulation period versus the laser stimulation.

Beta values from the two tasks with the lowest and highest test-retest reliability, respectively, in the spatially filtered deoxyhemoglobin signal are reported as representative findings. Both test-retest and longitudinal methods confirmed that task and signal type influence reliability. Oxyhemoglobin signals were more reliable overall than deoxyhemoglobin, and removal of the global mean reduced reliability of both signals.

We studied overt picture naming and compared oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) and deoxyHb signals with and without global component removal using general linear model approaches. Activity in Broca's region and supplementary motor cortex was observed only when the filter was applied to the deoxyHb signal and was shown to be spatially comparable to fMRI data acquired using a similar task and to meta-analysis data. oxyHb signals did not yield expected activity in Broca's region with or without global component removal.

MCO1 is reliably delivered to specific retinal cells via intravitreal injection of adeno-associated virus (vMCO1), leading to significant improvement in visually guided behavior conducted using a radial arm water maze. The time to reach the platform and the number of error arms decreased significantly after delivery of MCO1. Notably, the improvement in visually guided behavior was observed even at light intensity levels orders of magnitude lower than that required for channelrhodopsin-2 opsin. Viability of vMCO1-treated retina is not compromised by chronic light exposure. Safe virus-mediated MCO1 delivery has potential for effective gene therapy of diverse retinal degenerations in patients.","281":"Multimodal monitoring has become particularly common in the study of human brain function. In this context, combined, synchronous measurements of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) are getting increased interest. Because of the absence of electro-optical interference, it is quite simple to integrate these two noninvasive recording procedures of brain activity. fNIRS and EEG are both scalp-located procedures. fNIRS estimates brain hemodynamic fluctuations relying on spectroscopic measurements, whereas EEG captures the macroscopic temporal dynamics of brain electrical activity through passive voltages evaluations. The \"orthogonal\" neurophysiological information provided by the two technologies and the increasing interest in the neurovascular coupling phenomenon further encourage their integration. This review provides, together with an introduction regarding the principles and future directions of the two technologies, an evaluation of major clinical and nonclinical applications of this flexible, low-cost combination of neuroimaging modalities. fNIRS-EEG systems exploit the ability of the two technologies to be conducted in an environment or experimental setting and\/or on subjects that are generally not suited for other neuroimaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and magnetoencephalography. fNIRS-EEG brain monitoring settles itself as a useful multimodal tool for brain electrical and hemodynamic activity investigation.","282":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-supporting therapy for critically ill patients with severe respiratory and\/or cardiovascular failure. Cerebrovascular impairment can result in hemorrhagic and ischemic complications commonly seen in the patients supported on ECMO. We investigated the degree of cerebral autoregulation impairment during ECMO as well as whether it is predictive of neuroimaging abnormalities. Spontaneous fluctuations of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation ([Formula: see text]) were continuously measured during the ECMO run. The dynamic relationship between the MAP and [Formula: see text] fluctuations was assessed based on wavelet transform coherence (WTC). Neuroimaging was conducted during and\/or after ECMO as standard of care, and the abnormalities were evaluated based on a scoring system that had been previously validated among ECMO patients. Of the 25 patients, 8 (32%) had normal neuroimaging, 7 (28%) had mild to moderate neuroimaging abnormalities, and the other 10 (40%) had severe neuroimaging abnormalities. The degrees of cerebral autoregulation impairment quantified based on WTC showed significant correlations with the neuroimaging scores ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]). Evidence that cerebral autoregulation impairment during ECMO was related to the patients' neurological outcomes was provided.","283":"Anesthesia monitoring currently needs a reliable method to evaluate the effects of the anesthetics on its primary target, the brain. This study focuses on investigating the clinical usability of a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived machine learning classifier to perform automated and real-time classification of maintenance and emergence states during sevoflurane anesthesia. For 19 surgical procedures, we examine the entire continuum of the maintenance-transition-emergence phases and evaluate the predictive capability of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier during these phases. We demonstrate the robustness of the predictions made by the SVM classifier and compare its performance with that of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and bispectral (BIS) index-based predictions. The fNIRS-SVM investigated in this study provides evidence to the usability of the fNIRS signal for anesthesia monitoring. The method presented enables classification of the signal as maintenance or emergence automatically as well as in real-time with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The features local mean HbTotal, std [Formula: see text], local min Hb and [Formula: see text], and range Hb and [Formula: see text] were found to be robust biomarkers of this binary classification task. Furthermore, fNIRS-SVM was capable of identifying emergence before movement in a larger number of patients than BIS and MAC.","284":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been proposed as an affordable, fast, and robust alternative to many neuroimaging modalities yet it still has long way to go to be adapted in the clinic. One request from the clinicians has been the delivery of a simple and straightforward metric (a so-called biomarker) from the vast amount of data a multichannel fNIRS system provides. We propose a simple-straightforward signal processing algorithm derived from [Formula: see text] data collected during a modified version of the color-word matching Stroop task that consists of three different conditions. The algorithm starts with a wavelet-transform-based preprocessing, then uses partial correlation analysis to compute the functional connectivity matrices at each condition and then computes the global efficiency values. To this end, a continuous wave 16 channels fNIRS device (ARGES Cerebro, Hemosoft Inc., Turkey) was used to measure the changes in [Formula: see text] concentrations from 12 healthy volunteers. We have considered 10% of strongest connections in each network. A strong Stroop interference effect was found between the incongruent against neutral condition ([Formula: see text]) while a similar significance was observed for the global efficiency values decreased from neutral to congruent to incongruent conditions [[Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]]. The findings bring us closer to delivering a biomarker derived from fNIRS data that can be reliably and easily adopted by the clinicians.","285":"Occupational noise frequently occurs in the work environment in military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. This impacts cognitive performance by acting as a stressor, potentially interfering with the analysts' decision-making process. We investigated the effects of different noise stimuli on analysts' performance and workload in anomaly detection by simulating a noisy work environment. We utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as behavioral measures, which include eye tracking, reaction time, and accuracy rate. We hypothesized that noisy environments would have a negative effect on the participant in terms of anomaly detection performance due to the increase in workload, which would be reflected by an increase in PFC activity. We found that HbO for some of the channels analyzed were significantly different across noise types ([Formula: see text]). Our results also indicated that HbO activation for short-intermittent noise stimuli was greater in the PFC compared to long-intermittent noises. These approaches using fNIRS in conjunction with an understanding of the impact on human analysts in anomaly detection could potentially lead to better performance by optimizing work environments.","286":null,"287":null,"288":"This article gives tribute to the neurophotonics pioneer Amiram Grinvald.","289":"Understanding how cortical networks interact in response to task demands is important both for providing insight into the brain's processing architecture and for managing neurological diseases and mental disorders. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) is a neuroimaging technique that offers the significant advantages of having a naturalistic, acoustically controllable environment and being compatible with metal implants, neither of which is possible with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used HD-DOT to study the effective connectivity and assess the modulatory effects of speech intelligibility and syntactic complexity on functional connections within the cortical speech network. To accomplish this, we extend the use of a generalized psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis framework. In particular, we apply PPI methods to event-related HD-DOT recordings of cortical oxyhemoglobin activity during auditory sentence processing. We evaluate multiple approaches for selecting cortical regions of interest and for modeling interactions among these regions. Our results show that using subject-based regions has minimal effect on group-level connectivity maps. We also demonstrate that incorporating an interaction model based on estimated neural activity results in significantly stronger effective connectivity. Taken together our findings support the use of HD-DOT with PPI methods for noninvasively studying task-related modulations of functional connectivity.","290":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.4.3.031212.].","291":null,"292":"An automated massive histology setup combined with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope was used to image a total of [Formula: see text] whole mouse brains.

In addition to the measured OCT optical reflectivity, a single scattering photon model was used to compute the attenuation coefficients within each tissue slice. Average mouse brain templates were generated for both the OCT reflectivity and attenuation contrasts and were used with an [Formula: see text]-tissue segmentation algorithm. To better understand the brain tissue OCT contrast origin, one of the mouse brains was acquired using dMRI and coregistered to its corresponding assembled brain. Our results indicate that the optical reflectivity in a fiber bundle varies with its orientation, its fiber density, and the number of fiber orientations it contains. The OCT mouse brain template generation and coregistration to dMRI data demonstrate the potential of this massive histology technique to pursue cross-sectional, multimodal, and multisubject investigations of small animal brains.","293":null,"294":"Task-related hemodynamic responses contribute prominently to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. They reflect behaviorally important brain states, such as arousal and attention, and can dominate stimulus-evoked responses, yet they remain poorly understood. To help characterize these responses, we present a method for parametrically estimating both stimulus-evoked and task-related components of hemodynamic responses from subjects engaged in temporally predictable tasks. The stimulus-evoked component is modeled by convolving a hemodynamic response function (HRF) kernel with spiking. The task-related component is modeled by convolving a Fourier-series task-related function (TRF) kernel with task timing. We fit this model with simultaneous electrode recordings and intrinsic-signal optical imaging from the primary visual cortex of alert, task-engaged monkeys. With high [Formula: see text], the model returns HRFs that are consistent across experiments and recording sites for a given animal and TRFs that entrain to task timing independent of stimulation or local spiking. When the task schedule conflicts with that of stimulation, the TRF remains locked to the task emphasizing its behavioral origins. The current approach is strikingly more robust to fluctuations than earlier ones and gives consistently, if modestly, better fits. This approach could help parse the distinct components of fMRI recordings made in the context of a task.","295":null,"296":"Neurofeedback is a method for using neural activity displayed on a computer to regulate one's own brain function and has been shown to be a promising technique for training individuals to interact with brain-machine interface applications such as neuroprosthetic limbs. The goal of this study was to develop a user-friendly functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback system to upregulate neural activity associated with motor imagery, which is frequently used in neuroprosthetic applications. We hypothesized that fNIRS neurofeedback would enhance activity in motor cortex during a motor imagery task. Twenty-two participants performed active and imaginary right-handed squeezing movements using an elastic ball while wearing a 98-channel fNIRS device. Neurofeedback traces representing localized cortical hemodynamic responses were graphically presented to participants in real time. Participants were instructed to observe this graphical representation and use the information to increase signal amplitude. Neural activity was compared during active and imaginary squeezing with and without neurofeedback. Active squeezing resulted in activity localized to the left premotor and supplementary motor cortex, and activity in the motor cortex was found to be modulated by neurofeedback. Activity in the motor cortex was also shown in the imaginary squeezing condition only in the presence of neurofeedback. These findings demonstrate that real-time fNIRS neurofeedback is a viable platform for brain-machine interface applications.","297":"","298":null,"299":"Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) within the first decade of its use in humans showed its capacity as a precise functional mapping tool. It is a powerful tool that can be used intraoperatively to help a surgeon to directly identify functional areas of the cerebral cortex. Its use is limited to the intraoperative setting as it requires a craniotomy and durotomy for direct visualization of the brain. It has been applied in humans to study language, somatosensory and visual cortices, cortical hemodynamics, epileptiform activity, and lesion delineation. Despite studies showing clear evidence of its usefulness in clinical care, its clinical use in humans has not grown. Impediments imposed by imaging in a human operating room setting have hindered such work. However, recent studies have been aimed at overcoming obstacles in clinical studies establishing the benefits of its use to patients. This review provides a description of ISOI and its use in human studies with an emphasis on the challenges that have hindered its widespread use and the recent studies that aim to overcome these hurdles. Clinical studies establishing the benefits of its use to patients would serve as the impetus for continued development and use in humans.","300":"The posterior medial barrel subfield (PMBSF) of a rat primary somatosensory cortex exquisitely demonstrates topography and columnar organization, defining features of sensory cortices in the mammalian brain. Optical imaging and neuronal recordings in rat PMBSF demonstrate how evoked cortical activity following single whisker stimulation also rapidly spreads laterally into surrounding cortices, disregarding columnar and modality boundaries. The current study quantifies the spatial prominence of such lateral activity spreads by demonstrating that functional connectivity between laterally spaced cortical locations is actually stronger than between vertically spaced cortical locations. Further, the total amount of evoked activity within and beyond single column boundaries was quantified based on intrinsic signal optical imaging, single units and local field potentials recordings, revealing that the vast majority of whisker evoked activity in PMBSF occurs beyond columnar boundaries. Finally, a simple two-layer artificial neural network model of PMBSF demonstrates the capacity of extracolumnar evoked activity spread to provide a foundation for accurate whisker stimulus classification that is robust to random scaling of inputs and local noise. Indeed, classification performance improved when more of the lateral spread was included in the model, providing further evidence for the relevance of the lateral spread.","301":"This review brings together a collection of studies that specifically use wide-field high-resolution mesoscopic level imaging techniques (intrinsic signal optical imaging; voltage-sensitive dye optical imaging) to image the cortical point spread (PS): the total spread of cortical activation comprising a large neuronal ensemble evoked by spatially restricted (point) stimulation of the sensory periphery (e.g., whisker, pure tone, point visual stimulation). The collective imaging findings, combined with supporting anatomical and electrophysiological findings, revealed some key aspects about the PS including its very large (radius of several mm) and relatively symmetrical spatial extent capable of crossing cytoarchitectural borders and trespassing into other cortical areas; its relationship with underlying evoked subthreshold activity and underlying anatomical system of long-range horizontal projections within gray matter, both also crossing borders; its contextual modulation and plasticity; the ability of its relative spatiotemporal profile to remain invariant to major changes in stimulation parameters; its potential role as a building block for integrative cortical activity; and its ubiquitous presence across various cortical areas and across mammalian species. Together, these findings advance our understanding about the neocortex at the mesoscopic level by underscoring that the cortical PS constitutes a fundamental motif of neocortical structure-function relationship.","302":null,"303":"Laser-scanning optical microscopes generally do not control the polarization of the exciting laser field. We show that laser polarization and imaging mode (confocal versus two photon) exert a profound influence on the ability to detect [Formula: see text] changes in both cultured neurons and living myelin. With two-photon excitation, increasing ellipticity resulted in a [Formula: see text] reduction in resting X-Rhod-1 fluorescence in homogeneous bulk solution, cell cytoplasm, and myelin. In contrast, varying the angle of a linearly polarized laser field only had appreciable effects on dyes that partitioned into myelin in an ordered manner. During injury-induced [Formula: see text] increases, larger ellipticities resulted in a significantly greater injury-induced signal increase in neurons, and particularly in myelin. Indeed, the traditional method of measuring [Formula: see text] changes using one-photon confocal mode with linearly polarized continuous wave laser illumination produced no appreciable X-Rhod-1 signal increase in ischemic myelin, compared to a robust [Formula: see text] fluorescence increase with two-photon excitation and optimized ellipticity with the identical injury paradigm. This underscores the differences in one- versus two-photon excitation and, in particular, the under-appreciated effects of laser polarization on the behavior of certain [Formula: see text] reporters, which may lead to substantial underestimates of the real [Formula: see text] fluctuations in various cellular compartments.","304":"Toward the goal of understanding cutaneous sensory integration during manual behavior, we used voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging to study the organization and dynamics of anesthetized monkey primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in response to single and multidigit tactile stimulation. We find that in both macaque and squirrel monkey SI, VSD reveals clear focal digit topography consistent with previous electrophysiological and intrinsic signal imaging studies. VSD also reveals interactions in SI in response to multidigit stimulation. With a tactile funneling paradigm in areas 3b and 1 in squirrel monkeys, VSD reveals two-digit induction of subthreshhold influences, consistent with lateral intracortical inhibition. In response to tactile apparent motion stimuli, VSD reveals preferential response to motion stimuli over static tactile stimuli in both areas 1 and 3b. Comparison of the response at different digit locations to \"toward digit\" stimuli suggests the presence of direction-selective response in area 1; however, further study is needed. These exciting results indicate that VSD constitutes a powerful tool for studying somatosensory cortical processing in nonhuman primates and should be further developed for future somatosensory studies in awake behaving monkeys.","305":"Functional specialization within the extrastriate areas of the ventral pathway associated with visual form analysis is poorly understood. Studies comparing the functional selectivities of neurons within the early visual areas have found that there are more similar than different between the areas. We simultaneously imaged visually evoked activation over regions of V2 and V4 and parametrically varied three visual attributes for which selectivity exists in both areas: color, orientation, and size. We found that color selective regions were observed in both areas and were of similar size and spatial distribution. However, two major areal distinctions were observed: V4 contained a greater number and diversity of color-specific regions than V2 and exhibited a higher degree of overlap between domains for different functional attributes. In V2, size and color regions were largely segregated from orientation domains, whereas in V4 both color and size regions overlapped considerably with orientation regions. Our results suggest that higher-order composite selectivities in the extrastriate cortex may arise organically from the interactions afforded by an overlap of functional domains for lower order selectivities.","306":"Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a key neurophysiological recording tool because it reaches brain scales that remain inaccessible to other techniques. The development of this technique from in vitro to the behaving nonhuman primate has only been made possible thanks to the long-lasting, visionary work of Amiram Grinvald. This work has opened new scientific perspectives to the great benefit to the neuroscience community. However, this unprecedented technique remains largely under-utilized, and many future possibilities await for VSDI to reveal new functional operations. One reason why this tool has not been used extensively is the inherent complexity of the signal. For instance, the signal reflects mainly the subthreshold neuronal population response and is not linked to spiking activity in a straightforward manner. Second, VSDI gives access to intracortical recurrent dynamics that are intrinsically complex and therefore nontrivial to process. Computational approaches are thus necessary to promote our understanding and optimal use of this powerful technique. Here, we review such approaches, from computational models to dissect the mechanisms and origin of the recorded signal, to advanced signal processing methods to unravel new neuronal interactions at mesoscopic scale. Only a stronger development of interdisciplinary approaches can bridge micro- to macroscales.","307":"Optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes enables the visualization of extensive yet highly transient coalitions of neurons (assemblies) operating throughout the brain on a subsecond time scale. We suggest that operating at the mesoscale level of brain organization, neuronal assemblies may provide a functional link between \"bottom-up\" cellular mechanisms and \"top-down\" cognitive ones within anatomically defined regions. We demonstrate in ex vivo rat brain slices how varying spatiotemporal dynamics of assemblies reveal differences not previously appreciated between: different stages of development in cortical versus subcortical brain areas, different sensory modalities (hearing versus vision), different classes of psychoactive drugs (anesthetics versus analgesics), different effects of anesthesia linked to hyperbaric conditions and, in vivo, depths of anesthesia. The strategy of voltage-sensitive dye imaging is therefore as powerful as it is versatile and as such can now be applied to the evaluation of neurochemical signaling systems and the screening of related new drugs, as well as to mathematical modeling and, eventually, even theories of consciousness.","308":null,"309":"In diffuse optical tomography (DOT), overlapping and multidistance measurements are required to reconstruct depth-resolved images of oxy- ([Formula: see text]) and deoxy- (HHb) hemoglobin concentration changes occurring in the brain.

Broadband systems also allow changes in the redox state of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO) to be measured, which can be an important biomarker when neurovascular coupling is impaired. We used DOT to reconstruct images of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] from data acquired with a broadband system.

This orientation map is characterized by domains and pinwheels where local circuitry is either more or less orientation selective, respectively. It has now been repeatedly demonstrated that neurons in pinwheels tend to be more broadly tuned to orientation, likely due to the broad range of orientation preference of the neighboring neurons forming pinwheels. However, certain stimulus conditions, such as a decrease in contrast or an increase in size, significantly sharpen tuning widths of V1 neurons. Here, we find that pinwheel neuron tuning widths are broader than domain neurons only for high contrast, optimally sized stimuli, conditions that maximize excitation through feedforward, and local cortical processing. When contrast was lowered or size increased, orientation tuning width sharpened and became equal. These latter conditions are conducive to less local excitation either through lower feedforward drive or by surround suppression arising from long-range cortical circuits. Tuning width differences between pinwheel and domain neurons likely arise through more local circuitry and are overcome through recruitment of longer-range cortical circuits.","312":"The pioneering work of Amiram Grinvald established voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in the mammalian cortex in the 1980s and inspired decades of cortical voltage imaging and the associated technological developments.

Nevertheless, optical microscopy only provides an image of the present structure of the cell, without any information on its long-temporal changes. These can be investigated by combining super-resolution optics with a nonoptical imaging technique, nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, which investigates the isotopic composition of the samples. The resulting technique, combined isotopic and optical nanoscopy, enables the investigation of both the structure and the \"history\" of the cellular elements. The age and the turnover of cellular organelles can be read by isotopic imaging, while the structure can be analyzed by optical (fluorescence) approaches.

The DOT series were processed using a method that is based on a Bayesian filter application on raw DOT data to remove physiological changes and minimum description length application index to select a number of singular values, which reduce the data dimensionality during image reconstruction and adaptation of DOT volume series to normalized standard space. Therefore, statistical analysis is performed with canonical SPM software in the same way as fMRI analysis is done, accepting DOT volumes as if they were fMRI volumes. The results show the reproducibility and ruggedness of the method to process DOT series on group analysis using cognitive paradigms on the prefrontal cortex. Difficulties such as the fact that scalp-brain distances vary between subjects or cerebral activations are difficult to reproduce due to strategies used by the subjects to solve arithmetic problems are considered.

A Z-BellSM test was performed on a participant to select optimal lenses. An EEG measurement was recorded before and after the participant wore the eyeglasses. Equivalent quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) analyses (statistical analysis on raw EEG recordings) were performed and compared with baseline findings. With glasses on, the participant's readings were found to be closer to the normed database. The original objective of our investigation was met, and additional findings were revealed. The Z-bellSM test identified lenses to influence neurotypical brain activity, supporting the paradigm that eyeglasses can be utilized as a therapeutic intervention.

The excitation wavelength of blue dyes has minimal overlap with the absorption of hemoglobin, and hence has minimal pulsation artifacts. This advantage leads to high signal-to-noise ratio optical recordings of cortical activity, with sensitivity as good as that of local field potential recordings. High sensitivity imaging allows for recording of spontaneous and evoked activity in single trials without spatial or temporal averaging, and has benefitted many scientists in their research projects. Single trial recording is particularly important for studying the cortex, because spontaneous and ongoing activities interact with sensory evoked events, creating rich dynamics in the wave patterns. Signal averaging in space and time would diminish the dynamic components in the patterns. Here, we discuss how the blue dyes help to achieve high-sensitivity voltage-sensitive dye imaging of spontaneous and evoked cortical activities. Spontaneous cortical activity has a constantly changing spatial pattern and temporal frequency, making it impossible to average in space and time. Amiran Grinvald's invention of blue dyes made it possible to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical dynamics, about 15 years before the first useful genetically coded voltage proteins became available.","327":"Wide-field voltage imaging is unique in its capability to capture snapshots of activity-across the full gradient of average changes in membrane potentials from subthreshold to suprathreshold levels-of hundreds of thousands of superficial cortical neurons that are simultaneously active.

In both examples, cortical spread is asymmetrically boosted, creating suprathreshold activity drawn out over primary visual cortex.

Recent imaging developments have revealed another distinct nonneovascular AMD phenotype, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). We develop an approach to semiautomatically quantify retinal surfaces associated with various AMD lesions (i.e., regular drusen, RPD, and GA) in spectral domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. More specifically, a graph-based algorithm was used to segment multiple retinal layers in SD-OCT volumes. Varying surface feasibility constraints based on the presegmentation were applied on the double-surface graph search to refine the surface segmentation. The thicknesses of these layers and their correlation with retinal functional measurements, including microperimetry (MP) sensitivity and visual acuity (VA), were investigated. The photoreceptor outer segment layer demonstrated significant thinning with a reduction in MP sensitivity and VA score when atrophic AMD lesions were present. Regular drusen and RPD were separately segmented on SD-OCT images to allow their characteristics and distribution to be studied separately. The mean thickness of regular drusen was found to significantly correlate with the VA score. RPD appeared to be distributed evenly throughout the macula and regular drusen appeared to be more concentrated centrally.","330":null,"331":"Surgical removal of tumor mass is a common approach in the management of brain tumors. However, the precise delineation of normal tissue from tumor tissue for a complete resection of tumor mass in brain tumor surgery remains a difficult task for neurosurgeons. Aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-mediated exgogenous fluorescence of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is a sensitive approach for tumor imaging. Recent studies suggest that the use of ALA\/PpIX-mediated fluorescence-guided resection (FGR) or fluorescence-guided surgery can enable more accurate and complete resection of brain tumors, especially when used in quantitative fashion. This review will highlight the current progress in PpIX-mediated FGR and discuss technical challenges in intraoperative quantification of intracellular PpIX fluorescence during FGR of brain tumor.","332":"Advances in image-guided therapy enable physicians to obtain real-time information on neurological disorders such as brain tumors to improve resection accuracy. Image guidance data include the location, size, shape, type, and extent of tumors. Recent technological advances in neurophotonic engineering have enabled the development of techniques for minimally invasive neurosurgery. Incorporation of these methods in intraoperative imaging decreases surgical procedure time and allows neurosurgeons to find remaining or hidden tumor or epileptic lesions. This facilitates more complete resection and improved topology information for postsurgical therapy (i.e., radiation). We review the clinical application of recent advances in neurophotonic technologies including Raman spectroscopy, thermal imaging, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescence spectroscopy, highlighting the importance of these technologies in live intraoperative tissue mapping during neurosurgery. While these technologies need further validation in larger clinical trials, they show remarkable promise in their ability to help surgeons to better visualize the areas of abnormality and enable safe and successful removal of malignancies.","333":"Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) has recently proved useful for detecting whole-brain oxygenation changes in preterm and term newborns' brains. The data recording phase in prior explorations was limited up to a maximum of a couple of hours, a time dictated by the need to minimize skin damage caused by the protracted contact with optode holders and interference with concomitant clinical\/nursing procedures. In an attempt to extend the data recording phase, we developed a new custom-made cap for multimodal DOT and electroencephalography acquisitions for the neonatal population. The cap was tested on a preterm neonate (28 weeks gestation) for a 7-day continuous monitoring period. The cap was well tolerated by the neonate, who did not suffer any evident discomfort and\/or skin damage. Montage and data acquisition using our cap was operated by an attending nurse with no difficulty. DOT data quality was remarkable, with an average of 92% of reliable channels, characterized by the clear presence of the heartbeat in most of them.","334":"","335":null,"336":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to examine hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during noxious thermal pain, induced by thermal stimulations over three different body sites over the right forearm, right temporomandibular joint, and left forearm. Functional NIRS measurements were obtained from three groups of healthy volunteers, one group for each body region. Each group was subjected to both low-pain stimulation (LPS) and high-pain stimulation (HPS) by a [Formula: see text] thermode of a temperature-controlled thermal stimulator over the respective three body sites. Our results showed that HPS given at three sites induced significant increases ([Formula: see text]) in oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([Formula: see text]) in the PFC with similar temporal patterns in relatively spread PFC areas. In contrast, LPS did not cause any significant [Formula: see text] in the PFC of any subject group. Our observed PFC activations induced by acute HPS were generally consistent with previous reports by fMRI studies. The study also found a peculiar global trend of postpain deactivation in the PFC, which is attributed to global vasoconstriction due to acute nocuous pain. Overall, these results indicate that hemodynamic activities in PFC exhibit consistent temporal and spatial patterns in response to acute thermal stimulation given across all three body sites.","337":null,"338":"Optogenetic methods developed over the past decade enable unprecedented optical activation and silencing of specific neuronal cell types. However, light scattering in neural tissue precludes illuminating areas deep within the brain via free-space optics; this has impeded employing optogenetics universally. Here, we report an approach surmounting this significant limitation. We realize implantable, ultranarrow, silicon-based photonic probes enabling the delivery of complex illumination patterns deep within brain tissue. Our approach combines methods from integrated nanophotonics and microelectromechanical systems, to yield photonic probes that are robust, scalable, and readily producible en masse. Their minute cross sections minimize tissue displacement upon probe implantation. We functionally validate one probe design in vivo with mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2. Highly local optogenetic neural activation is demonstrated by recording the induced response-both by extracellular electrical recordings in the hippocampus and by two-photon functional imaging in the cortex of mice coexpressing GCaMP6.","339":null,"340":"Optogenetics is one of the most important techniques in neurophysiology, with potential clinical applications. However, the strong light needed may cause harmful temperature rises. So far, there are no methods to reliably estimate brain heating and safe limits in actual optogenetic experiments. We used thermal imaging to directly measure such temperature rises at the surface of live mouse brains during laser illumination with wavelengths and intensities typical for optogenetics. We then modeled the temperature rise with a simple logarithmic model. Our results indicate that previous finite-element models can underestimate temperature increases by an order of magnitude. We validate our empirical model by predicting the temperature rise caused by pulsed stimulation paradigms. These predictions fit closely to the empirical data and constitute a better estimate of real temperature increases. Additionally, we provide a web-based app for easy calculation that can be used as a tool for safe design of optogenetic experiments.","341":null,"342":null,"343":"Sensorimotor processing occurs in a highly distributed manner in the mammalian neocortex. The spatiotemporal dynamics of electrical activity in the dorsal mouse neocortex can be imaged using voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) with near-millisecond temporal resolution and [Formula: see text] spatial resolution. Here, we trained mice to lick a water reward spout after a 1-ms deflection of the C2 whisker, and we imaged cortical dynamics during task execution with VSD RH1691. Responses to whisker deflection were highly dynamic and spatially highly distributed, exhibiting high variability from trial to trial in amplitude and spatiotemporal dynamics. We differentiated trials based on licking and whisking behavior. Hit trials, in which the mouse licked after the whisker stimulus, were accompanied by overall greater depolarization compared to miss trials, with the strongest hit versus miss differences being found in frontal cortex. Prestimulus whisking decreased behavioral performance by increasing the fraction of miss trials, and these miss trials had attenuated cortical sensorimotor responses. Our data suggest that the spatiotemporal dynamics of depolarization in mouse sensorimotor cortex evoked by a single brief whisker deflection are subject to important behavioral modulation during the execution of a simple, learned, goal-directed sensorimotor transformation.","344":"The spatial organization of mouse frontal cortex is poorly understood. Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye to image electrical activity in the dorsal cortex of awake head-restrained mice. Whisker-deflection evoked the earliest sensory response in a localized region of primary somatosensory cortex and visual stimulation evoked the earliest responses in a localized region of primary visual cortex. Over the next milliseconds, the initial sensory response spread within the respective primary sensory cortex and into the surrounding higher order sensory cortices. In addition, secondary hotspots in the frontal cortex were evoked by whisker and visual stimulation, with the frontal hotspot for whisker deflection being more anterior and lateral compared to the frontal hotspot evoked by visual stimulation. Investigating axonal projections, we found that the somatosensory whisker cortex and the visual cortex directly innervated frontal cortex, with visual cortex axons innervating a region medial and posterior to the innervation from somatosensory cortex, consistent with the location of sensory responses in frontal cortex. In turn, the axonal outputs of these two frontal cortical areas innervate distinct regions of striatum, superior colliculus, and brainstem. Sensory input, therefore, appears to map onto modality-specific regions of frontal cortex, perhaps participating in distinct sensorimotor transformations, and directing distinct motor outputs.","345":"The combination of voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) with multielectrode array (MEA) recordings in the rodent cerebral cortex in vivo allows the simultaneous analysis of large-scale network interactions and electrophysiological single-unit recordings. Using this approach, distinct patterns of spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity can be recorded in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor cortex (M1) of newborn rats. Already at the day of birth, gamma oscillations and spindle bursts in the barrel cortex synchronize the activity of a local columnar ensemble, thereby generating an early topographic representation of the sensory periphery. During the first postnatal week, both cortical activity patterns undergo developmental changes in their spatiotemporal properties and spread into neighboring cortical columns. Simultaneous VSDI and MEA recordings in S1 and M1 demonstrate that the immature motor cortex receives information from the somatosensory system and that M1 may trigger movements of the periphery, which subsequently evoke gamma oscillations and spindle bursts in S1. These early activity patterns not only play an important role in the development of the cortical columnar architecture, they also control the ratio of surviving versus dying neurons in an activity-dependent manner, making these processes most vulnerable to pathophysiological disturbances during early developmental stages.","346":"The advent of superresolution imaging has created a strong need for both optimized labeling strategies and analysis methods to probe the nanoscale organization of complex biological structures. We present a thorough description of the distribution of synaptic adhesion proteins at the nanoscopic scale, namely presynaptic neurexin-[Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]), and its two postsynaptic binding partners neuroligin-1 (Nlg1) and leucine-rich-repeat transmembrane protein 2 (LRRTM2). We monitored these proteins in the membrane of neurons by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, after live surface labeling with Alexa647-conjugated monomeric streptavidin. The small probe ([Formula: see text]) efficiently penetrates into crowded synaptic junctions and reduces the distance to target. We quantified the organization of the single-molecule localization data using a tesselation-based analysis technique. We show that Nlg1 exhibits a fairly disperse organization within dendritic spines, while LRRTM2 is organized in compact domains, and [Formula: see text] in presynaptic terminals displays a dual-organization pattern intermediate between that of Nlg1 and LRRTM2. These results suggest that part of [Formula: see text] interacts transsynaptically with Nlg1 and the other part with LRRTM2.","347":"High voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are composed of at least three subunits, one pore forming [Formula: see text]-subunit, an intracellular [Formula: see text]-variant, and a mostly extracellular [Formula: see text]-variant. Interactions between these subunits determine the kinetic properties of VGCCs. It is unclear whether these interactions are stable over time or rather transient. Here, we used single-molecule tracking to investigate the surface diffusion of [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-subunits at the cell surface. We found that [Formula: see text]-subunits show higher surface mobility than [Formula: see text]-subunits, and that they are only transiently confined together, suggesting a weak association between [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-subunits. Moreover, we observed that different [Formula: see text]-subunits engage in different degrees of association with the [Formula: see text]-subunit, revealing the tighter interaction of [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text]. These data indicate a distinct regulation of the [Formula: see text] interaction in VGCC subtypes. We modeled their membrane dynamics in a Monte Carlo simulation using experimentally determined diffusion constants. Our modeling predicts that the ratio of associated [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-subunits mainly depends on their expression density and confinement in the membrane. Based on the different motilities of particular [Formula: see text]-subunit combinations, we propose that their dynamic assembly and disassembly represent an important mechanism to regulate the signaling properties of VGCC.","348":"The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen ([Formula: see text]) is an essential parameter for evaluating brain function and pathophysiology. However, the currently available approaches for quantifying [Formula: see text] rely on complex multimodal imaging and mathematical modeling. Here, we introduce a method that allows estimation of [Formula: see text] based on a single measurement modality-two-photon imaging of the partial pressure of oxygen ([Formula: see text]) in cortical tissue. We employed two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM) and the oxygen-sensitive nanoprobe PtP-C343 to map the tissue [Formula: see text] distribution around cortical penetrating arterioles. [Formula: see text] is subsequently estimated by fitting the changes of tissue [Formula: see text] around arterioles with the Krogh cylinder model of oxygen diffusion. We measured the baseline [Formula: see text] in anesthetized rats and modulated tissue [Formula: see text] levels by manipulating the depth of anesthesia. This method provides [Formula: see text] measurements localized within [Formula: see text] and it may provide oxygen consumption measurements in individual cortical layers or within confined cortical regions, such as in ischemic penumbra and the foci of functional activation.","349":"High-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) imaging (stereo imaging) by endoscopes in minimally invasive surgery, especially in space-constrained applications such as brain surgery, is one of the most desired capabilities. Such capability exists at larger than 4-mm overall diameters. We report the development of a stereo imaging endoscope of 4-mm maximum diameter, called Multiangle, Rear-Viewing Endoscopic Tool (MARVEL) that uses a single-lens system with complementary multibandpass filter (CMBF) technology to achieve 3-D imaging. In addition, the system is endowed with the capability to pan from side-to-side over an angle of [Formula: see text], which is another unique aspect of MARVEL for such a class of endoscopes. The design and construction of a single-lens, CMBF aperture camera with integrated illumination to generate 3-D images, and the actuation mechanism built into it is summarized.","350":"We report the development of a compact probe for time-domain (TD) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based on a fast silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) that can be put directly in contact with the sample without the need of optical fibers for light collection. We directly integrated an avalanche signal amplification stage close to the SiPM, thus reducing the size of the detection channel and optimizing the signal immunity to electromagnetic interferences. The whole detection electronics was placed in a plastic screw holder compatible with the electroencephalography standard cap for measurement on brain or with custom probe holders. The SiPM is inserted into a transparent and insulating resin to avoid the direct contact of the scalp with the 100-V bias voltage. The probe was integrated in an instrument for TD fNIRS spectroscopy. The system was characterized on tissue phantoms in terms of temporal resolution, responsivity, linearity, and capability to detect deep absorption changes. Preliminary in vivo tests on adult volunteers were performed to monitor hemodynamic changes in the arm during a cuff occlusion and in the brain cortex during a motor task.","351":"Using light, we are able to visualize the hemodynamic behavior of the brain to better understand neurovascular coupling and cerebral metabolism. In vivo optical imaging of tissue using endogenous chromophores necessitates spectroscopic detection to ensure molecular specificity as well as sufficiently high imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio, to allow dynamic physiological changes to be captured, isolated, and used as surrogate of pathophysiological processes. An optical imaging system is introduced using a 16-bands on-chip hyperspectral camera. Using this system, we show that up to three dyes can be imaged and quantified in a tissue phantom at video-rate through the optics of a surgical microscope. In vivo human patient data are presented demonstrating brain hemodynamic response can be measured intraoperatively with molecular specificity at high speed.","352":"Atlas-guided diffuse optical tomography (atlas-DOT) is a computational means to image changes in cortical hemodynamic signals during human brain activities. Graph theory analysis (GTA) is a network analysis tool commonly used in functional neuroimaging to study brain networks. Atlas-DOT has not been analyzed with GTA to derive large-scale brain connectivity\/networks based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements. We introduced an automated voxel classification (AVC) method that facilitated the use of GTA with atlas-DOT images by grouping unequal-sized finite element voxels into anatomically meaningful regions of interest within the human brain. The overall approach included volume segmentation, AVC, and cross-correlation. To demonstrate the usefulness of AVC, we applied reproducibility analysis to resting-state functional connectivity measurements conducted from 15 young adults in a two-week period. We also quantified and compared changes in several brain network metrics between young and older adults, which were in agreement with those reported by a previous positron emission tomography study. Overall, this study demonstrated that AVC is a useful means for facilitating integration or combination of atlas-DOT with GTA and thus for quantifying NIRS-based, voxel-wise resting-state functional brain networks.","353":"Visualization of whole brain activity during epileptic seizures is essential for both fundamental research into the disease mechanisms and the development of efficient treatment strategies. It has been previously discussed that pathological synchronization originating from cortical areas may reinforce backpropagating signaling from the thalamic neurons, leading to massive seizures through enhancement of high frequency neural activity in the thalamocortical loop. However, the study of deep brain neural activity is challenging with the existing functional neuroimaging methods due to lack of adequate spatiotemporal resolution or otherwise insufficient penetration into subcortical areas. To investigate the role of thalamocortical activity during epileptic seizures, we developed a new functional neuroimaging framework based on spatiotemporal correlation of volumetric optoacoustic hemodynamic responses with the concurrent electroencephalogram recordings and anatomical brain landmarks. The method is shown to be capable of accurate three-dimensional mapping of the onset, spread, and termination of the epileptiform events in a 4-aminopyridine acute model of focal epilepsy. Our study is the first to demonstrate entirely noninvasive real-time visualization of synchronized epileptic foci in the whole mouse brain, including the neocortex and subcortical structures, thus opening new vistas in systematic studies toward the understanding of brain signaling and the origins of neurological disorders.","354":"We present the visualization of the mouse cerebellum and adjacent brainstem using a serial optical coherence scanner, which integrates a vibratome slicer and polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography for ex vivo imaging. The scanner provides intrinsic optical contrasts to distinguish the cerebellar cortical layers and white matter.

By incorporating a water-immersion microscope objective, we also present high-resolution tiled images that delineate fine structures in the cerebellum and brainstem.","355":"Monitoring the changes of cerebral hemodynamics and the state of consciousness during general anesthesia (GA) is clinically important. There is a great need for developing advanced detectors to investigate the physiological processes of the brain during GA. We developed a multichanneled, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system device and applied it to GA operation monitoring. The cerebral hemodynamic data from the forehead of 11 patients undergoing propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia were analyzed. The concentration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and cerebral tissue heart rate were determined from the raw optical information based on the discrete stationary wavelet transform. This custom-made device provides an easy-to-build solution for continuous wave-fNIRS system, with customized specifications. The developed device has a potential value in cerebral monitoring in clinical settings.","356":"","357":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1117\/1.NPh.4.1.011005.].

Our aims were to establish measurement feasibility in a clinical setting and to characterize changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbD) concentration in the bilateral frontoparietal cortex in unsedated neonates at the crib-side using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We hypothesized that bilateral concentration changes will occur upon somatic central and peripheral somatic stimulation. Thirteen preterm neonates (five males) underwent time 1, and six (two males) returned for time 2 (mean [Formula: see text] and 47.0 weeks, respectively). Signals from a total of 162 somatic stimuli responses were measured. Response amplitude, duration, and latency were log-transformed and compared between palmar, plantar, and oromotor stimuli using linear mixed models, adjusted for cap, electroencephalogram abnormality, time (1 versus 2), and Sarnat score, if necessary. The oromotor stimulus resulted in a 50% greater response than the palmar or plantar stimuli for HbO left and right hemisphere duration ([Formula: see text]). There were no other statistically significant differences between stimuli for any other outcome ([Formula: see text]). Utilizing fNIRS in conjunction with occupational and physical therapy maneuvers is efficacious to study modifiable and restorative neurophysiological mechanisms. ","360":"Impaired facial processing may contribute to social dysfunction in certain individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prior studies show that electroencephalogram-based and functional magnetic resonance imaging-based neurofeedback might help some individuals with ASD learn to modulate regional brain activity and thus reduce symptoms. Here, we report for the first time the feasibility of employing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback training in children with ASD. We developed a method to study physiological self-regulation of oxy-hemoglobin using real-time feedback. The paradigm is illustrated with initial data from four subjects who engaged in a facial-identity recognition training program during which an implicit reinforcement was given based on the participant's brain activity and behavioral performance. Two participants had a confirmed diagnosis of ASD, and the other two were typically developing (TD). One participant with ASD and one TD participant received real-feedback (real-FB) during the training, whereas the other two received sham-feedback (sham-FB). After five training sessions, the subjects who received real-FB showed more improvement in facial recognition performance compared with those receiving sham-FB, particularly in the participant with ASD. These results suggest fNIRS-based neurofeedback could enhance therapeutic intervention in children with ASD. ","361":"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) research to date has tended to publish group-averaged rather than individual infant data due to normative basic research goals. Acquisition of individual infant time courses holds interest, however, both for cognitive science and particularly for clinical applications. Infants are more difficult to study than adults as they cannot be instructed to remain still. In addressing this, upright infants pose several associated complications for the researcher. We identified and optimized the factors that affect the quality of fNIRS data from individual 6- to 9-month-old infants exposed to a visual stimulation paradigm. The fNIRS headpiece was reconfigured to reduce inertia, increase comfort, and improve conformity to the head, while preserving fiber density to avoid missing the visual cortex activation. The visual-stimulation protocol was modified to keep the attention of infants throughout the measurement, thus helping to reduce motion artifacts. Adequate optical contact was verified by checking power levels before each measurement. By revising our experimental process and our data rejection criteria to prioritize good optical contact, we report for the first time usable hemodynamic data from 83% of infants and that two-thirds of infants produced a statistically significant fNIRS response. ","362":"Burst suppression (BS) is an electroencephalographic state associated with a profound inactivation of the brain. BS and pathological discontinuous electroencephalography (EEG) are often observed in term-age infants with neurological injury and can be indicative of a poor outcome and lifelong disability. Little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms of BS or how the condition relates to the functional state of the neonatal brain. We used simultaneous EEG and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) to investigate whether bursts of EEG activity in infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy are associated with an observable cerebral hemodynamic response. We were able to identify significant changes in concentration of both oxy and deoxyhemoglobin that are temporally correlated with EEG bursts and present a relatively consistent morphology across six infants. Furthermore, DOT reveals patient-specific spatial distributions of this hemodynamic response that may be indicative of a complex pattern of cortical activation underlying discontinuous EEG activity that is not readily apparent in scalp EEG. ","363":"Recent developments in single-molecule imaging have revealed many biological mechanisms, providing high spatial and temporal resolution maps of molecular events. In neurobiology, these techniques unveiled that plasma membrane neurotransmitter receptors and transporters laterally diffuse at the surface of cultured brain cells. The photostability of bright nanoprobes, such as quantum dots (QDs), has given access to neurotransmitter receptor tracking over long periods of time with a high spatial resolution. However, our knowledge has been restricted to cultured systems, i.e., neurons and organotypic slices, therefore lacking several aspects of the intact brain rheology and connectivity. Here, we used QDs to track single glutamatergic [Formula: see text]-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) in acute brain slices. By delivering functionalized nanoparticles in vivo through intraventricular injections to rats expressing genetically engineered-tagged NMDAR, we successfully tracked the receptors in native brain tissue. Comparing NMDAR tracking to different classical brain preparations (acute brain slices, cultured organotypic brain slices, and cultured neurons) revealed that the surface diffusion properties shared several features and are also influenced by the nature of the extracellular environment. Together, we describe the experimental procedures to track plasma membrane NMDAR in dissociated and native brain tissue, paving the way for investigations aiming at characterizing receptor diffusion biophysics in intact tissue and exploring the physiopathological roles of receptor surface dynamics.

To exploit the full potential of optical stimulation, light must be delivered to specific cells or even parts of cells such as dendritic spines. This can be achieved with computer generated holography (CGH), which shapes light to arbitrary patterns by phase-only modulation. We demonstrate here in detail how CGH can be incorporated into a stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope for photostimulation of neurons and monitoring of nanoscale morphological changes. We implement an original optical system to allow simultaneous holographic photostimulation and superresolution STED imaging. We present how synapses can be clearly visualized in live cells using membrane stains either with lipophilic organic dyes or with fluorescent proteins.

We also review techniques for arterial blood pressure measurements as well as theoretical and experimental methods for the assessment of CA, including recent approaches based on optical techniques. The assessment of cerebral perfusion in the clinical practice is also presented. The comprehensive description of principles, methods, and clinical requirements of CBF and CA measurements highlights the potentially important role that noninvasive optical methods can play in the assessment of neurovascular health.

However, most existing studies are limited to functional imaging on the cortical surface and the deep brain structural imaging capability of PACT has never been demonstrated. Here, we explicitly studied the limiting factors of deep brain PACT imaging. We found that the skull distorted the acoustic signal and blood suppressed the structural contrast from other chromophores. When the two effects are mitigated, PACT can potentially provide high-resolution label-free imaging of structures in the entire mouse brain. With [Formula: see text] in-plane resolution, we can clearly identify major structures of the brain, which complements magnetic resonance microscopy for imaging small-animal brain structures. Spectral PACT studies indicate that structural contrasts mainly originate from cytochrome distribution and that the presence of lipid sharpens the image contrast; brain histology results provide further validation. The feasibility of imaging the structure of the brain in vivo is also discussed. Our results demonstrate that PACT is a promising modality for both structural and functional brain imaging.","370":"The ability to count molecules is essential to elucidating cellular mechanisms, as these often depend on the absolute numbers and concentrations of molecules within specific compartments.

NIRS signals in the prefrontal cortex were compared between high-functioning ASD subjects ([Formula: see text]) and typically developed (TD) subjects ([Formula: see text]). The brain activities of the TD subjects were related to experimental design. These results were not confirmed in brain activities of ASD subjects, although the task performance rate was almost equivalent. The brain activities of TD subjects and ASD subjects were evaluated using a weighted separability (WS) index obtained from the feature phase of oxy-hemoglobin and its differential value. Calculation of the [Formula: see text]-test (TD subject versus ASD subject) confirmed that WS was significant.

RBCs also experience shear-induced diffusion with a diffusion coefficient [Formula: see text] and an MSD of [Formula: see text]. Surprisingly, experimental data primarily reflect diffusive behavior. To provide quantitative estimates of the relative contributions of convective and diffusive movements, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of light scattering through tissue of varying vessel densities. We assumed laminar vessel flow profiles and accounted for shear-induced diffusion effects. In agreement with experimental data, we found that diffusive motion dominates the correlation decay for typical DCS measurement parameters. Furthermore, our model offers a quantitative relationship between the RBC diffusion coefficient and absolute tissue blood flow. We thus offer, for the first time, theoretical support for the empirically accepted ability of the DCS blood flow index ([Formula: see text]) to quantify tissue perfusion. We find [Formula: see text] to be linearly proportional to blood flow, but with a proportionality modulated by the hemoglobin concentration and the average blood vessel diameter.

Quantitatively, no statistically significant differences were discovered between the levels of activation for the two motor tasks ([Formula: see text]).

The percentage contribution of the classes of physiology to the fNIRS signals including low-frequency (LF) fluctuations, respiration, and cardiac oscillations was estimated using spectral domain classification methods. Our results show that LF oscillations accounted for 40% to 55% of total power of both the oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb signals. Respiration and its harmonics accounted for 10% to 30% of the power, and cardiac pulsations and cardio-respiratory components accounted for 10% to 30%. We describe this scICA method for decomposing fNIRS signals, which unlike other approaches to spatial covariance reduction is applicable to both single- or multiple-channel fNIRS signals and discuss how this approach allows functionally distinct sources of noise with disjoint spectral support to be separated from obscuring systemic physiology.

Because fNIRS can be applied to a wide range of populations, such as children or infants, and under a variety of study conditions, including those involving physical movement, gait, or balance, fNIRS data are often confounded by motion artifacts. Furthermore, the high sampling rate of fNIRS leads to high temporal autocorrelation due to systemic physiology. These two factors can reduce the sensitivity and specificity of detecting hemodynamic changes. In a previous work, we showed that these factors could be mitigated by autoregressive-based prewhitening followed by the application of an iterative reweighted least squares algorithm offline. This current work extends these same ideas to real-time analysis of brain signals by modifying the linear Kalman filter, resulting in an algorithm for online estimation that is robust to systemic physiology and motion artifacts. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method via simulations of evoked hemodynamics that were added to experimental resting-state data, which provided realistic fNIRS noise.

Hemodynamic brain responses attributed to epileptic events, such as seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), are routinely observed with a good degree of statistical significance and in concordance with clinical presentation. Recording done with over 100 channels allows sufficiently large coverage of the epileptic focus and other areas. Three types of seizures have been documented: frontal lobe seizures, temporal lobe seizures, and posterior seizures. Increased oxygenation was observed in the epileptic focus in most cases, while rapid but similar hemodynamic variations were identified in the contralateral homologous region. While investigating IEDs, it was shown that their hemodynamic effect is observable with fNIRS, that their response is associated with significant (inhibitive) nonlinearities, and that the sensitivity and specificity of fNIRS to localize the epileptic focus can be estimated in a sample of 40 patients.

We found that light leads to several artifacts that resemble genuine LFP features in animals with no opsin expression, such as stereotyped peaks at the power spectrum, phase shifts across different recording channels, coupling between low and high oscillation frequencies, and sharp signal deflections that are detected as spikes. Further, we tested how light stimulation affected hippocampal LFP recordings in mice expressing channelrhodopsin 2 in parvalbumin neurons (PV\/ChR2 mice). Genuine oscillatory activity at the frequency of light stimulation could not be separated from light-induced artifacts.

We demonstrate that such all-optical mapping can interrogate various circuits in somatosensory cortex by sequentially activating different layers and columns. Further, mapping in slices from whisker-deprived mice demonstrated that chronic sensory deprivation did not significantly alter feedforward inhibition driven by layer 5 pyramidal neurons.

Both linker length and amino acid composition affected the size and voltage sensitivity of the optical signal. The truncation mutants revealed a potential structural periodicity with a maximum signal three amino acids from the voltage-sensing domain and another maximum 11 amino acids from the voltage-sensing domain.

Using optical recording techniques, it is now possible to follow the functional organization of the embryonic CNS and image the spatiotemporal dynamics involved in the formation of this neural network.

However, efficient widefield epifluorescence detection of rapid voltage fluorescence transients necessitates that imaged cells and structures lie sufficiently far from other labeled structures to avoid contamination from out of focal plane and scattered light. We overcame this limitation by exciting dye fluorescence with one-photon computer-generated holography shapes contoured to axons or dendrites of interest, enabling widefield detection of voltage fluorescence with high spatial specificity. By shaping light onto neighboring axons and dendrites, we observed that dendritic back-propagating action potentials were broader and slowly rising compared with axonal action potentials, differences not measured in the same structures illuminated with a large \"pseudowidefield\" (pWF) spot of the same excitation density.

Traditionally, AP backpropagation was studied in the thick apical trunk.

Multisite optical recordings from neighboring dendrites revealed a clear dichotomy between two seemingly equal dendritic branches belonging to the same cell (\"sister branches\"). We documented the variable efficacy of AP invasion in basal and oblique branches by revealing their AP voltage waveforms. Using fast multisite calcium imaging, we found that trains of APs are filtered differently between two apical tuft branches. Although one dendritic branch passes all spikes in an AP train, another branch belonging to the same neuron, same cortical layer, and same path distance from the cell body, experiences only one spike. Our data indicate that the vast differences in dendritic voltage and calcium transients, detected in dendrites of pyramidal neurons, arise from a nonuniform distribution of A-type [Formula: see text] conductance, an aggregate number of branch points in the path of the AP propagation and minute differences in dendritic diameter.

In particular, PAT complements other brain imaging modalities by providing high-resolution functional and metabolic imaging. More importantly, PAT's unique scalability enables scrutinizing the brain at both microscopic and macroscopic scales, using the same imaging contrast. In this Review, we present the state-of-the-art PAT techniques for brain imaging, summarize representative neuroscience applications, outline the technical challenges in translating PAT to human brain imaging, and envision potential technological deliverables.","488":null},"articletitle":{"0":"Characterization of red fluorescent reporters for dual-color in vivo three-photon
