cancer patients undergo diagnostic surgeries to detect occult lymph node metastases missed by preoperative structural imaging techniques. Reducing these invasive procedures that are associated with considerable morbidity, requires better preoperative detection. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a rapidly evolving imaging technique that may improve preoperative detection of (early-stage) lymph node metastases, enabling the identification of molecular changes that often precede structural changes in tumorigenesis. Here, we characterize the optoacoustic properties of cetuximab-800CW, a tumor-specific fluorescent tracer showing several photophysical properties that benefit optoacoustic signal generation. In this first clinical proof-of-concept study, we explore its use as optoacoustic to differentiate between malignant and benign lymph nodes. We characterize the appearance of malignant lymph nodes and show differences in the distribution of intrinsic chromophores compared to benign lymph nodes. In addition, we suggest several approaches to improve the efficiency of follow-up studies.","1":"Although multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) significantly evolved over the last several years, there is a lack of quantitative methods for analysing this type of image data. Current analytical methods characterise the MSOT signal in manually defined regions of interest outlining selected tissue areas. These methods demand expert knowledge of the sample anatomy, are time consuming, highly subjective and prone to user bias. Here we present our fully automated open-source MSOT cluster analysis toolkit Mcat that was designed to overcome these shortcomings. It employs a deep learning-based approach for initial image segmentation followed by unsupervised machine learning to identify regions of similar signal kinetics. It provides an objective and automated approach to quantify the pharmacokinetics and extract the biodistribution of biomarkers from MSOT data. We exemplify our generally applicable analysis method by quantifying liver function in a preclinical sepsis model whilst highlighting the advantages of our new approach compared to the severe limitations of existing analysis procedures.","2":"Photoacoustic imaging has shown great potential for guiding minimally invasive procedures by accurate identification of critical tissue targets and invasive medical devices (such as metallic needles). The use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) as the excitation light sources accelerates its clinical translation owing to its high affordability and portability. However, needle visibility in LED-based photoacoustic imaging is compromised primarily due to its low optical fluence. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework based on U-Net to improve the visibility of clinical metallic needles with a LED-based photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system. To address the complexity of capturing ground truth for real data and the poor realism of purely simulated data, this framework included the generation of semi-synthetic training datasets combining both simulated data to represent features from the needles and in vivo measurements for tissue background. Evaluation of the trained neural network was performed with needle insertions into blood-vessel-mimicking phantoms, pork joint tissue ex vivo and measurements on human volunteers. This deep learning-based framework substantially improved the needle visibility in photoacoustic imaging in vivo compared to conventional reconstruction by suppressing background noise and image artefacts, achieving 5.8 and 4.5 times improvements in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and the modified Hausdorff distance, respectively. Thus, the proposed framework could be helpful for reducing complications during percutaneous needle insertions by accurate identification of clinical needles in photoacoustic imaging.","3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":"Deep-tissue optical imaging is a longstanding challenge limited by scattering. Both optical imaging and treatment can benefit from focusing light in deep tissue beyond one transport mean free path. Wavefront shaping based on time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRUE) optical focusing utilizes ultrasound focus, which is much less scattered than light in biological tissues as the 'guide star'. However, the traditional TRUE is limited by the ultrasound focusing area and pressure tagging efficiency, especially in acoustically heterogeneous medium. Even the improved version of iterative TRUE comes at a large time consumption, which limits the application of TRUE. To address this problem, we proposed a method called time-reversed photoacoustic wave guided time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRPA-TRUE) optical focusing by integrating accurate ultrasonic focusing through acoustically heterogeneous medium guided by time-reversing PA signals, and the ultrasound modulation of diffused coherent light with optical phase conjugation (OPC), achieving dynamic focusing of light into scattering medium. Simulation results show that the focusing accuracy of the proposed method has been significantly improved compared with conventional TRUE, which is more suitable for practical applications that suffers severe acoustic distortion, e.g. transcranial optical focusing.","8":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has the potential to revolutionize functional medical imaging in healthcare due to the valuable information on tissue physiology contained in multispectral photoacoustic measurements. Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.","9":"Standardized phantoms and test methods are needed to accelerate clinical translation of emerging photoacoustic imaging (PAI) devices. Evaluating object detectability in PAI is challenging due to variations in target morphology and artifacts including boundary buildup. Here we introduce breast fat and parenchyma tissue-mimicking materials based on emulsions of silicone oil and ethylene glycol in polyacrylamide hydrogel. 3D-printed molds were used to fabricate solid target inclusions that produced more filled-in appearance than traditional PAI phantoms. Phantoms were used to assess understudied image quality characteristics (IQCs) of three PAI systems. Object detectability was characterized vs. target diameter, absorption coefficient, and depth. Boundary buildup was quantified by target core\/boundary ratio, which was higher in transducers with lower center frequency. Target diameter measurement accuracy was also size-dependent and improved with increasing transducer frequency. These phantoms enable evaluation of multiple key IQCs and may support development of comprehensive standardized test methods for PAI devices.","10":null,"11":"Deep-located tumor specific imaging has broad clinical applications in improving the accuracy of tumor diagnosis. Microwave-induced thermoacoustic imaging (MTAI), combining the high-contrast of microwave imaging with the high-resolution of ultrasound imaging, is a potential candidate for noninvasive tumor detection. Herein, a deep-located tumor specific MTAI method by tumor microenvironment (TME) activated nanoprobe is reported. In principle, manganous-manganic oxide-based nanoprobe can be triggered by TME with overexpressed glutathione and weak acidity, causing to release manganese ions and increase conductivity. With pulsed microwaves, manganese ions move repeatedly in gigahertz alternating electric field, resulting in a transient heating and thermoelastic expansion through the Joule effect, which yields a strong thermoacoustic (TA) wave in tumor site. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that manganous-manganic oxide-based nanoprobe could high-selectively amplify the TA signal in deep-located tumor. Our proposed tumor-specific MTAI method based on TME activation provides a potential approach for deep-located tumor detection.","12":null,"13":"Since the initial breast transillumination almost a century ago, breast cancer imaging using light has been considered in different implementations aiming to improve diagnostics, minimize the number of available biopsies, or monitor treatment. However, due to strong photon scattering, conventional optical imaging yields low resolution images, challenging quantification and interpretation. Optoacoustic imaging addresses the scattering limitation and yields high-resolution visualization of optical contrast, offering great potential value for breast cancer imaging. Nevertheless, the image quality of experimental systems remains limited due to a number of factors, including signal attenuation with depth and partial view angle and motion effects, particularly in multi-wavelength measurements. We developed data analytics methods to improve the accuracy of handheld optoacoustic breast cancer imaging, yielding second-generation optoacoustic imaging performance operating in tandem with ultrasonography. We produced the most advanced images yet with handheld optoacoustic examinations of the human breast and breast cancer, in terms of resolution and contrast. Using these advances, we examined optoacoustic markers of malignancy, including vasculature abnormalities, hypoxia, and inflammation, on images obtained from breast cancer patients. We achieved a new level of quality for optoacoustic images from a handheld examination of the human breast, advancing the diagnostic and theranostic potential of the hybrid optoacoustic-ultrasound (OPUS) examination over routine ultrasonography.

Unfortunately, the current lack of uniformity in PAI data formats compromises inter-user data exchange and comparison, which impedes: technological progress; effective research collaboration; and efforts to deliver multi-centre clinical trials. To overcome this challenge, the International Photoacoustic Standardisation Consortium (IPASC) has established a data format with a defined consensus metadata structure and developed an open-source software application programming interface (API) to enable conversion from proprietary file formats into the IPASC format. The format is based on Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) and designed to store photoacoustic raw time series data. Internal quality control mechanisms are included to ensure completeness and consistency of the converted data. By unifying the variety of proprietary data and metadata definitions into a consensus format, IPASC hopes to facilitate the exchange and comparison of PAI data.","16":null,"17":"Acoustic-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM) is a promising imaging modality that renders images with ultrasound resolution and extends the imaging depth beyond the optical ballistic regime. To achieve a high lateral resolution, a large numerical aperture (NA) of a focused transducer is usually applied for AR-PAM. However, AR-PAM fails to hold its performance in the out-of-focus region. The lateral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degrade substantially, thereby leading to a significantly deteriorated image quality outside the focal area. Based on the concept of the synthetic-aperture focusing technique (SAFT), various strategies have been developed to address this challenge. These include 1D-SAFT, 2D-SAFT, adaptive-SAFT, spatial impulse response (SIR)-based schemes, and delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) strategies. These techniques have shown progress in achieving depth-independent lateral resolution, while several challenges remain. This review aims to introduce these developments in SAFT-based approaches, highlight their fundamental mechanisms, underline the advantages and limitations of each approach, and discuss the outlook of the remaining challenges for future advances.","18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":"Test-samples are necessary for the development of emerging imaging approaches such as optoacoustics (OA); these can be used to benchmark new labeling agents and instrumentation, or to characterize image analysis algorithms or the inversion required to form the three-dimensional reconstructions. Alginate beads (AlBes) loaded with labeled mammalian or bacterial cells provide a method of creating defined structures of controllable size and photophysical characteristics and are well-suited for both in vitro and in vivo use. Here we describe a simple and rapid method for efficient and reproducible production of AlBes with specific characteristics and show three example applications with multispectral OA tomography imaging. We show the advantage of AlBes for studying and eventually improving photo-switching OA imaging approaches. As highly defined, homogeneous, quasi point-like signal sources, AlBes might hold similar advantages for studying other agents, light-fluence models, or the impact of detection geometries on correct image formation in the near future.","26":"The investigation of neuronal activity in non-human primate models is of critical importance due to their genetic similarity to human brains. In this study, we tested the feasibility of using photoacoustic imaging for the detection of cortical and subcortical responses due to peripheral electrical stimulation in a squirrel monkey model. Photoacoustic computed tomography and photoacoustic microscopy were applied on squirrel monkeys for real-time deep subcortical imaging and optical-resolution cortical imaging, respectively. The electrically evoked hemodynamic changes in primary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortices, primary motor cortex, and underlying subcortical areas were measured. Hemodynamic responses were observed in both cortical and subcortical brain areas at the cortices during external stimulation, demonstrating the feasibility of photoacoustic technique for functional imaging of non-human primate brain.","27":null,"28":"Photoacoustic (PA) techniques are potential alternatives to histopathology. The physicochemical spectrogram (PCS) generated by the PA measurement at multiple wavelengths can presents the morphology and chemical composition target at multi-biomarkers simultaneously. In this work, via multi-wavelength PA measurements performed on rabbit bone models, we investigated the feasibility of using PCSs for bone health assessment. A comprehensive analysis of the PCSs, termed PA physicochemical analysis (PAPCA), was conducted. The \"slope\" and \"relative content\" were used as the PAPCA-quantified parameters to characterize the changes in the physical and chemical properties of bone tissue, respectively. The findings are consistent well with the gold-standard imaging results. It demonstrated that the PAPCA can be used to characterize both the microstructure and content of multi-biomarkers which highly related with bone health. Considering the PA technique is noninvasive and radiation-free, it has great potential in the implementation and monitoring of bone diseases progression.","29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a well-known cancer therapy that utilizes light to excite a photosensitizer and generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The efficacy of PDT primarily depends on the photosensitizer and oxygen concentration in the tumor. Hypoxia in solid tumors promotes treatment resistance, resulting in poor PDT outcomes. Hence, there is a need to combat hypoxia while delivering sufficient photosensitizer to the tumor for ROS generation. Here we showcase our unique theranostic perfluorocarbon nanodroplets as a triple agent carrier for oxygen, photosensitizer, and indocyanine green that enables light triggered spatiotemporal delivery of oxygen to the tumors. We evaluated the characteristics of the nanodroplets and validated their ability to deliver oxygen via photoacoustic monitoring of blood oxygen saturation and subsequent PDT efficacy in a murine subcutaneous tumor model. The imaging results were validated with an oxygen sensing probe, which showed a 9.1 fold increase in oxygen content inside the tumor, following systemic administration of the nanodroplets. These results were also confirmed with immunofluorescence. In vivo studies showed that nanodroplets held higher rates of treatment efficacy than a clinically available benzoporphyrin derivative formulation. Histological analysis showed higher necrotic area within the tumor with perfluoropentane nanodroplets. Overall, the photoacoustic nanodroplets can significantly enhance image-guided PDT and has demonstrated substantial potential as a valid theranostic option for patient-specific photodynamic therapy-based treatments.","37":"We report on the realization, calibration, and test outdoor of a 19-inches rack 3-units sized Quartz Enhanced Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (QEPAS) trace gas sensor designed for real-time carbon monoxide monitoring in ambient air. Since CO acts as a slow energy relaxer when excited in the mid-infrared spectral region, its QEPAS signal is affected by the presence of relaxation promoters, such as water vapor, or quenchers like molecular oxygen. We analyzed in detail all the CO relaxation processes with typical collisional partners in an ambient air matrix and used this information to evaluate oxygen and humidity-related effects, allowing the real CO concentration to be retrieved. The sensor was tested outdoor in a trafficked urban area for several hours providing results comparable with the daily averages reported by the local air inspection agency, with spikes in CO concentration correlated to the passages of heavy-duty vehicles.","38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":"Photoacoustic (PA) microscopy allows imaging of the soft biological tissue based on optical absorption contrast and spatial ultrasound resolution. One of the major applications of PA imaging is its characterization of microvasculature. However, the strong PA signal from skin layer overshadowed the subcutaneous blood vessels leading to indirectly reconstruct the PA images in human study. Addressing the present situation, we examined a deep learning (DL) automatic algorithm to achieve high-resolution and high-contrast segmentation for widening PA imaging applications. In this research, we propose a DL model based on modified U-Net for extracting the relationship features between amplitudes of the generated PA signal from skin and underlying vessels. This study illustrates the broader potential of hybrid complex network as an automatic segmentation tool for the in vivo PA imaging. With DL-infused solution, our result outperforms the previous studies with achieved real-time semantic segmentation on large-size high-resolution PA images.","42":"Ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (UV-PAM) has been investigated to provide label-free and registration-free volumetric histological images for whole organs, offering new insights into complex biological organs. However, because of the high UV absorption of lipids and pigments in tissue, UV-PAM suffers from low image contrast and shallow image depth, hindering its capability for revealing various microstructures in organs. To improve the UV-PAM imaging contrast and imaging depth, here we propose to implement a state-of-the-art optical clearing technique, CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain\/body imaging cocktails and computational analysis), to wash out the lipids and pigments from tissues. Our results show that the UV-PAM imaging contrast and quality can be significantly improved after tissue clearing. With the cleared tissue, multilayers of cell nuclei can also be extracted from time-resolved PA signals. Tissue clearing-enhanced UV-PAM can provide fine details for organ imaging.","43":"The photoacoustic (PA) technique is uniquely positioned for biomedical applications primarily due to its ability to visualize optical absorption contrast in deep tissue at ultrasound resolution. In this work, via both three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations and in vivo experiments on human subjects, we investigated the possibility of PA measurement of human calcaneus bones in vivo in a non-invasive manner, as well as its feasibility to differentiate osteoporosis patients from normal subjects. The results from the simulations and the experiments both demonstrated that, when one side of the heel is illuminated by laser with light fluence under the ANSI safety limit, the PA signal generated in the human calcaneus bone can be detected by an ultrasonic transducer at the other side of the heel (i.e. transmission mode). Quantitative power spectral analyses of the calcaneus bone PA signals were also conducted, demonstrating that the microarchitectural changes in calcaneus bone due to osteoporosis can be detected, as reflected by enhanced high frequency components in detected PA bone signal. Further statistical analysis of the experimental results from 10 osteoporosis patients and 10 healthy volunteers showed that the weighted frequency as a quantified PA spectral parameter can differentiate the two subject groups with statistical significance.","44":"Photoacoustic transmitter represents a promising substitute for conventional piezoelectric counterparts. However, lack of easy and effective method for dynamically manipulating the focused acoustic field is a common and tricky problem faced by current photoacoustic technology. In this paper, a new strategy for constructing focus tunable photoacoustic transmitter is proposed. Different from existed prevailing device architecture, a sandwich like photoacoustic conversion layer is innovatively designed into a suspending elastic membrane with clamped boundary and it can be deformed using integrated pneumatic actuator. Owing to the membrane deflection property, concave spherical contours with variable radius of curvature can be obtained. Considering the shape determined sound emission characteristic, continuous tuning on the axial focusing length of the acoustic field has been successfully demonstrated in the photoacoustic transmitter for the first time. Besides, acoustic signal with significantly improved negative pressure has also been achieved especially at the focus, bringing additional advantage for applications.","45":null,"46":"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays major roles in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and membrane protein cleavage, suggesting a high correlation with cancer cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Here, we present a contrast agent based on a DNA aptamer that can selectively target human MMP-9 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with high affinity and sensitivity. Surface modification of plasmonic gold nanospheres with the MMP-9 aptamer and its complementary sequences allows the nanospheres to aggregate in the presence of human MMP-9 through DNA displacement and hybridization. Aggregation of gold nanospheres enhances the optical absorption in the first near-infrared window (NIR-I) due to the plasmon coupling effect, thereby allowing us to detect the aggregated gold nanospheres within the TME via ultrasound-guided photoacoustic (US\/PA) imaging. Selective and sensitive detection of human MMP-9 via US\/PA imaging is demonstrated in solution of nanosensors with the pre-treatment of human MMP-9, in vitro in cell culture, and in vivo in a xenograft murine model of human breast cancer.","47":"Combined ultrasound and photoacoustic (USPA) imaging has attracted several pre-clinical and clinical applications due to its ability to simultaneously display structural, functional, and molecular information of deep biological tissue in real time. However, the depth and wavelength dependent optical attenuation and the unknown optical and acoustic heterogeneities limit the USPA imaging performance in deep tissue regions. Novel instrumentation, image reconstruction, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are currently being investigated to overcome these limitations and improve the USPA image quality. Effective implementation of these approaches requires a reliable USPA simulation tool capable of generating US based anatomical and PA based molecular contrasts of deep biological tissue. Here, we developed a hybrid USPA simulation platform by integrating finite element models of light (NIRFast) and ultrasound (k-Wave) propagations for co-simulation of B-mode US and PA images. The platform allows optimization of different design parameters for USPA devices, such as the aperture size and frequency of both light and ultrasound detector arrays. For designing tissue-realistic digital phantoms, a dictionary-based function has been added to k-Wave to generate various levels of ultrasound speckle contrast. The feasibility of modeling US imaging combined with optical fluence dependent multispectral PA imaging is demonstrated using homogeneous as well as heterogeneous tissue phantoms mimicking human organs (e.g., prostate and finger). In addition, we also demonstrate the potential of the simulation platform to generate large scale application-specific training and test datasets for AI enhanced USPA imaging. The complete USPA simulation codes together with the supplementary user guides have been posted to an open-source repository (https:\/\/github.com\/KothapalliLabPSU\/US-PA_simulation_codes).","48":null,"49":"Multiple objective assessments have been used to assess the activity of keloids to compare different therapeutic regimens and facilitate the best individual treatment choice for patients, but none of them are standardized. A multimodal photoacoustic\/ultrasonic (PA\/US) imaging system, including photoacoustic imaging, elastography, ultra-micro-angiography, and conventional US technologies (gray scale US, color Doppler US, and power Doppler US), was applied to evaluate keloids by a radiologist. Growing stages were defined by patients, and Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was assessed by a plastic surgeon. A comprehensive model based on multimodal ultrasound parameters (poor-echo pattern, high vascular density, decreased elasticity, and low SO2 within the keloid) and VSS might be a potential indicator of active keloids, comparing with VSS alone. The multimodal PA\/US imaging system could be a promising technique for keloids assessment.","50":"Light absorption induced thermoelastic and photoacoustic excitation, combined with laser Doppler vibrometry, was utilized to analyze the dynamic mechanical behavior of a microcantilever. The measured frequency response, modal shapes, and acoustic coupling effects were interpreted in the framework of a simple Bernouilli-Euler model and quantitative 3D finite element method (FEM) analysis. Three opto-mechanical generation mechanisms, each initiated by modulated optical absorption and heating, were identified both by an analytical and finite element model. In decreasing order of importance, optically induced cantilever bending is found to be caused by: (i) differences in photoacoustically induced pressure oscillations in the air adjacent to the illuminated and dark side of the cantilever, resulting from heat transfer from the illuminated cantilever to the nearby air, acting as a volume velocity piston, and (ii) thermoelastic stresses accompanying temperature and thermal expansion gradients in the cantilever, (iii) photoacoustically induced pressure oscillations in the air adjacent to the illuminated cantilever holder and frame.","51":"Measuring neuroactivity underlying complex behaviors facilitates understanding the microcircuitry that supports these behaviors. We have developed a functional and molecular photoacoustic tomography (F\/M-PAT) system which allows direct imaging of Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles in Fos-LacZ transgenic rats with a large field-of-view and high spatial resolution. F\/M-PAT measures the beta-galactosidase catalyzed enzymatic product of exogenous chromophore X-gal within ensemble neurons. We used an ex vivo imaging method in the Wistar Fos-LacZ transgenic rat, to detect neuronal ensembles in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) following cocaine administration or a shock-tone paired stimulus. Robust and selective F\/M-PAT signal was detected in mPFC neurons after both conditions (compare to naive controls) demonstrating successful and direct detection of Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles using this approach. The results of this study indicate that F\/M-PAT can be used in conjunction with Fos-LacZ rats to monitor neuronal ensembles that underlie a range of behavioral processes, such as fear learning or addiction.","52":"Collagen is an important biomarker of osteoporosis progression. Noninvasive, multispectral, photoacoustic (PA) techniques use pulsed laser light to induce PA signals to facilitate the visualization of chemical components that are strongly related to tissue health. In this study, the feasibility of multi-wavelength PA (MWPA) measurement of the collagen in bone, using the wavelength range of 1300-1800 nm, was investigated. First, the feasibility of this approach for detecting the collagen content of bone was demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Then, ex vivo experiments were conducted on both animal and human bone specimens with different bone densities using the MWPA method. The relative collagen content was extracted and compared with the results of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. The results showed that the \"relative collagen content\" parameter obtained using the MWPA approach correlated well with the bone volume ratio obtained from micro-CT images and histological analysis results. This study highlights the potential of the proposed PA technique for determining the collagen content of bones as a biomarker for bone health assessment.","53":"Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure, often guided by ultrasound (US) imaging, for treating venous insufficiencies. US imaging limitations in accurately visualizing the catheter and the lack of a temperature monitoring system can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. An integrated photoacoustic (PA)-guided EVLA system has been previously developed and reported to overcome the shortcomings of US-guided procedure. In this study, we further characterized the system and tested the in vivo utility. In addition, PA thermometry was further explored by compensating the variation of PA signal with temperature with respect to the temperature-dependent absorption of blood and water. In vivo imaging results indicated that the PA-guided EVLA system can provide high contrast and accurate images of the ablation catheter tip overlaid on US images of the background tissue. Additionally, absorption-compensated PA signal amplitudes over a relevant range of temperature were measured and demonstrated.","54":"In recent years, many methods have been investigated to improve imaging speed in photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). These methods mainly focused upon three critical factors contributing to fast PAM: laser pulse repetition rate, scanning speed, and computing power of the microprocessors. A high laser repetition rate is fundamentally the most crucial factor to increase the PAM speed. In this paper, we review methods adopted for fast PAM systems in detail, specifically with respect to light sources. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first review article analyzing the fundamental requirements for developing high-speed PAM and their limitations from the perspective of light sources.","55":null,"56":"Photoacoustic (PA) microscopy (PAM) has achieved remarkable progress in biomedicine in the past decade. It is a fast-rising imaging modality with diverse applications, such as hemodynamics, oncology, metabolism, and neuroimaging. Combining optical excitation and acoustic detection, the hybrid nature of PAM provides advantages of rich contrast and deep penetration. In recent years, high-speed PAM has flourished and enabled high-speed wide-field imaging of functional activity. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances in high-speed PAM technologies, including high-repetition-rate multi-wavelength laser development, fast scanning techniques, and novel PA signal acquisition strategies.","57":null,"58":null,"59":"The standard-of-care for evaluating lymph node status in breast cancers and melanoma metastasis is sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment performed with a handheld gamma probe and radioisotopes. However, this method inevitably exposes patients and physicians to radiation, and the special facilities required limit its accessibility. Here, we demonstrate a non-ionizing, cost-effective, handheld photoacoustic finder (PAF) fully integrated with a solid-state dye laser and transparent ultrasound transducer (TUT). The solid-state dye laser handpiece is coaxially aligned with the spherically focused TUT. The integrated finder readily detected photoacoustic signals from a tube filled with methylene blue (MB) beneath a 22 mm thick layer of chicken tissue. In live animals, we also photoacoustically detected both SLNs injected with MB and subcutaneously injected melanomas. We believe that our radiation-free and inexpensive PAF can play a vital role in SLN assessment.","60":"Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability after ischemic heart disease. However, there is lacking a non-invasive long-time monitoring technique for stroke diagnosis and therapy. The photoacoustic imaging approach reconstructs images of an object based on the energy excitation by optical absorption and its conversion to acoustic waves, due to corresponding thermoelastic expansion, which has optical resolution and acoustic propagation. This emerging functional imaging method is a non-invasive technique. Due to its precision, this method is particularly attractive for stroke monitoring purpose. In this paper, we review the achievements of this technology and its applications on stroke, as well as the development status in both animal and human applications. Also, various photoacoustic systems and multi-modality photoacoustic imaging are introduced as for potential clinical applications. Finally, the challenges of photoacoustic imaging for monitoring stroke are discussed.","61":"Photoacoustic excitation of a fluid sphere generates an outgoing ultrasonic wave whose time profile permits determination of the density, sound speed, and diameter of the sphere. Experiments with pulsed laser beams have confirmed the major predictions of existing theory. With regard to acoustic waves generated within spheres, although mathematical expressions for their properties are known, virtually no exploration of the waveforms in theory or experiment has taken place. Here, two cases for photoacoustic excitation of a droplet are discussed: first, absorption of radiation in a region of fluid external to the droplet, and, second, absorption of radiation by the droplet itself. Large amplitude transients, compressions in the former and rarefactions in the latter, are generated as the waves approach the center of the sphere. The high amplitudes of the waves suggest shock wave formation.","62":"Several imaging techniques aim at identifying features of carotid plaque instability but come with limitations, such as the use of contrast agents, long examination times and poor portability. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) employs light and sound to resolve lipid and hemoglobin content, both features associated with plaque instability, in a label-free, fast and highly portable way. Herein, 5 patients with carotid atherosclerosis, 5 healthy volunteers and 2 excised plaques, were scanned with handheld MSOT. Spectral unmixing allowed visualization of lipid and hemoglobin content within three ROIs: whole arterial cross-section, plaque and arterial lumen. Calculation of the fat-blood-ratio (FBR) value within the ROIs enabled the differentiation between patients and healthy volunteers (P = 0.001) and between plaque and lumen in patients (P = 0.04). Our results introduce MSOT as a tool for molecular imaging of human carotid atherosclerosis and open new possibilities for research and clinical assessment of carotid plaques.","63":null,"64":"Gold nanostars (GNSs) are promising contrast agents for simultaneous photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) owing to their excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. However, GNSs are easily reshaped under transient high-intensity laser pulses, which can cause a rapid shift in the light absorption peak, resulting in a decrease in both therapeutic and monitoring effects. In this work, we synthesized GNSs without toxic surfactants and coated them with a silica shell to retain their shape, thus maintaining their photostability. The excellent performance of these silica-coated GNSs was verified through both in vitro and in vivo PAI experiments. The silica-coated GNSs exhibited a threefold improvement in photoacoustic stability, as compared with the non-coated GNSs. The proposed silica coating method for GNSs was found to improve the photostability of GNSs, making them efficient, safe, and reliable nanoparticles for PAI.","65":"Functional imaging of microvascular dynamics in extremities delivers intuitive information for early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of vascular diseases. High-resolution and high-speed photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) visualizes and measures multiparametric information of microvessel networks in vivo such as morphology, flow, oxygen saturation, and metabolic rate. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution photoacoustic monitoring of vascular dynamics in human fingers. We photoacoustically monitored the position displacement of blood vessels associated with arterial pulsation in human fingers. Then, during and after arterial occlusion, we photoacoustically quantified oxygen consumption and blood perfusion in the fingertips. The results demonstrate that high-resolution functional PAM could be a vital tool in peripheral vascular examination for measuring heart rate, oxygen consumption, and\/or blood perfusion.","66":"Currently used imaging methods for diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) frequently come along with exposure to radiation and can often only show long-term effects of the disease. The aim of the study was to check the feasibility of a new optoacoustic imaging method to identify PsA. 22 psoriasis patients and 19 healthy volunteers underwent examination using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). The presence of arthritis was assessed via quantification of optoacoustic signal intensity of the endogenous chromophores oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. We conducted high-resolution real-time ultrasound images of the finger joints. The semi quantitative analysis of the optoacoustic signals for both hemoglobin species showed a significant higher blood content and oxygenation in PsA patients compared to healthy controls. Our results indicate that MSOT might allow detection of inflammation in an early stage. If the data is further confirmed, this technique might be a suitable tool to avoid delay of diagnosis of PsA.","67":"Plasmonic systems are becoming a favourable alternative to dye molecules in the generation of photoacoustic signals for spectroscopy and imaging. In particular, inorganic nanoparticles are appealing because of their versatility. In fact, as the shape, size and chemical composition of nanoparticles are directly correlated with their plasmonic properties, the excitation wavelength can be tuned to their plasmon resonance by adjusting such traits. This feature enables an extensive spectral range to be covered. In addition, surface chemical modifications can be performed to provide the nanoparticles with designed functionalities, e.g., selective affinity for specific macromolecules. The efficiency of the conversion of absorbed photon energy into heat, which is the physical basis of the photoacoustic signal, can be accurately determined by photoacoustic methods. This review contrasts studies that evaluate photoconversion in various kinds of nanomaterials by different methods, with the objective of facilitating the researchers' choice of suitable plasmonic nanoparticles for photoacoustic applications.","68":"Photoacoustic spectroscopy can generate abundant chemical and physical information about biological tissues. However, this abundance of information makes it difficult to compare these tissues directly. Data mining methods can circumvent this problem. We describe the application of machine-learning methods (including unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised classification) to the diagnosis of prostate cancer by photoacoustic spectrum analysis. We focus on the content and distribution of hemoglobin, collagen, and lipids, because these molecules change during the development of prostate cancer. A higher correlation among the ultrasonic power spectra of these chemical components is observed in cancerous than in normal tissues, indicating that the microstructural distributions in cancerous tissues are more consistent. Different classifiers applied in cancer-tissue diagnoses achieved an accuracy of 82 % (better than that of standard clinical methods). The technique thus exhibits great potential for painless early diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer.","69":null,"70":"","71":"In this work, photoacoustic spectroscopy was employed to distinguish real blood from fake blood rapidly, accurately, and recoverably. To achieve this goal, a photoacoustic detection system for blood was established in the forward mode. In the experiments, four kinds of animal blood and two kinds of fake blood in a total of 150 groups were used. The time-resolved photoacoustic signal and peak-to-peak values (PPVs) of all blood were captured in 700-1064 nm with intervals of 5 nm. Experimental results show that the amplitudes, profiles, peak-point time, and PPVs are different between real and fake blood. Although the PPVs of real blood are larger than those of the fake ones at 700-850 nm, the differences in PPVs are not obvious at 850-1064 nm, especially when there are spectral overlaps of PPVs. To accurately classify and discriminate real and fake blood, a wavelet neural network (WNN) was used to train 120 groups of blood and test 30 groups of blood. Moreover, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the weights and thresholds, as well as the translation and scale factors of the Morlet-liked wavelet basis function of the WNN. Under optimal parameters, the correct rate of the WNN-PSO algorithm was improved from 63.3% to 96.7%. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) was combined into the WNN-PSO algorithm to further improve the correct rate. The results indicate that the correct rate of the PCA-WNN-PSO algorithm with 10 principal components reaches 100 %. Therefore, photoacoustic spectroscopy combined with the PCA-WNN-PSO algorithm exhibits excellent performance in the classification and discrimination of real and fake blood.","72":null,"73":"In this report we present a novel photoacoustic (PA) modality using pulsed chirp excitation at a fixed wavelength and spectral analysis based on frequency-domain (FD) processing. We introduce Truncated Correlation Photoacoustic Coherence Tomography (TC-PACT), a PA axial resolution enhancement methodology, with an application to closely stacked subsurface multilayers of plexiglass coated with a thin layer of graphite acting as surface absorber. The experimental results demonstrated that the SNR and the axial resolution were higher in TC-PACT than in conventional FD photoacoustics. A ns pulsed laser was also used as PA excitation source with axial resolution results found to be commensurate with TC-PACT. However, the separation distance between adjacent absorbers when the latter approached the axial resolution limit of the transducer was only resolved in TC-PACT compared to pulsed laser PA owing to the lower uncertainty in the former modality involved in determining the location of the absorbers.","74":"Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging modality, capable of providing functional and molecular information of various pathologies, such as cancer. One limitation of PAT is the depth and wavelength dependent optical fluence, which results in reduced PA signal amplitude from deeper tissue regions. These factors can therefore introduce errors into quantitative measurements such as oxygen saturation (sO2) or the localization and concentration of various chromophores. The variation in the speed-of-sound between different tissues can also lead to distortions in object location and shape. Compensating for these effects allows PAT to be used more quantitatively. We have developed a proof-of-concept algorithm capable of compensating for the heterogeneity in speed-of-sound and depth dependent optical fluence. Speed-of-sound correction was done by using a straight ray-based algorithm for calculating the family of iso-time-of-flight contours between the transducers and every pixel in the imaging grid, while fluence compensation was done by utilizing the graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated software MCXCL for Monte Carlo modeling of optical fluence variation. This algorithm was tested on a polyvinyl chloride plastisol (PVCP) phantom, which contained cyst mimics and blood inclusions to test the algorithm under relatively heterogeneous conditions. Our results indicate that our PAT algorithm can compensate for the speed-of-sound variation and depth dependent fluence effects within a heterogeneous phantom. The results of this study will pave the way for further development and evaluation of the proposed method in more complex in-vitro and ex-vivo phantoms, as well as compensating for the wavelength-dependent optical fluence in spectroscopic PAT.","75":"Conventional reconstruction methods for photoacoustic images are not suitable for the scenario of sparse sensing and geometrical limitation. To overcome these challenges and enhance the quality of reconstruction, several learning-based methods have recently been introduced for photoacoustic tomography reconstruction. The goal of this study is to compare and systematically evaluate the recently proposed learning-based methods and modified networks for photoacoustic image reconstruction. Specifically, learning-based post-processing methods and model-based learned iterative reconstruction methods are investigated. In addition to comparing the differences inherently brought by the models, we also study the impact of different inputs on the reconstruction effect. Our results demonstrate that the reconstruction performance mainly stems from the effective amount of information carried by the input. The inherent difference of the models based on the learning-based post-processing method does not provide a significant difference in photoacoustic image reconstruction. Furthermore, the results indicate that the model-based learned iterative reconstruction method outperforms all other learning-based post-processing methods in terms of generalizability and robustness.","76":null,"77":"The photoacoustic measurement technique is a powerful yet underrepresented method to characterize the thermal transport properties of thin films. For the case of isotropic low thermal diffusivity samples, such as glasses or polymers, we demonstrate a general approach to extract the thermal conductivity with a high degree of significance. We discuss in particular the influence of thermal effusivity, thermal diffusivity, and sample layer thickness on the significance and accuracy of this measurement technique. These fundamental thermal properties guide sample and substrate selection to allow for a feasible thermal transport characterization. Furthermore, our data evaluation allows us to directly extract the thermal conductivity from this transient technique, without separate determination of the volumetric heat capacity, when appropriate boundary conditions are fulfilled. Using silica, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin films, and various substrates (quartz, steel, and silicon), we verify the quantitative correctness of our analytical approach.","78":"A gas sensing method based on quartz-enhanced photothermal spectroscopy (QEPTS) demodulated by quartz tuning fork (QTF) sensing acoustic wave is reported for the first time. Different from traditional QEPTS, the method proposed in this paper utilizes the second QTF to sense acoustic wave produced by the first QTF owing to the vibration resulted from photo-thermo-elastic effect. This indirect demodulation by acoustic wave sensing can avoid QTF being irradiated by laser beam and therefore get less noise and realize better detection sensitivity. Four different sensing configurations are designed and verified. Acetylene (C2H2) with a volume concentration of 1.95 % is selected as the target gas. A model of sound field produced by the first QTF vibrating is established by finite element method to explain the variation trend of signal and noise in the second QTF. The measured results indicate that this technique had an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1.36 times when compared to the traditional QEPTS. Further improvement methods for such technique is proposed.","79":"Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) combines the optical contrast of optical imaging and the penetrability of sonography. In this work, we develop a novel PACT system to provide real-time imaging, which is achieved by a 120-elements ultrasound array only using a single data acquisition (DAQ) channel. To reduce the channel number of DAQ, we superimpose 30 nearby channels' signals together in the analog domain, and shrinking to 4 channels of data (120\/30 = 4). Furthermore, a four-to-one delay-line module is designed to combine these four channels' data into one channel before entering the single-channel DAQ, followed by decoupling the signals after data acquisition. To reconstruct the image from four superimposed 30-channels' PA signals, we train a dedicated deep learning model to reconstruct the final PA image. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of phantom and in-vivo experiments, which manifests its robust real-time imaging performance. The significance of this novel PACT system is that it dramatically reduces the cost of multi-channel DAQ module (from 120 channels to 1 channel), paving the way to a portable, low-cost and real-time PACT system.","80":"The ability to monitor oxygen delivery in microvasculature plays a vital role in measuring the viability of skin tissue and the probability of recovery. Using currently available clinical imaging tools, it is difficult to observe non-invasive hemodynamic regulation in the peripheral vessels. Here we propose the use of a novel multispectral raster-scanning optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) system for noninvasive clinical monitoring of hemodynamic changes in the skin microvasculature's oxy- (HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb), total hemoglobin (HbT) and oxygen saturation (rsO2). High resolution images of hemoglobin distribution in the skin microvasculature from six healthy volunteers during venous and arterial occlusion, simulating systemic vascular diseases are presented. During venous occlusion, Hb and HbO2 optoacoustic signals showed an increasing trend with time, followed by a drop in the values after cuff deflation. During arterial occlusion, an increase in Hb value and decrease in HbO2 values was observed, followed by a drop in Hb and jump in HbO2 values after the cuff deflation. A decrease in rsO2 values during both venous and arterial occlusion was observed with an increase in value after occlusion release. Using this proof of concept study, hereby we propose multispectral RSOM as a novel tool to measure high resolution hemodynamic changes in microvasculature for investigating systemic vascular diseases on peripheral tissues and also for monitoring inflammatory skin diseases, and its therapeutic interventions.","81":null,"82":"Contrast enhancement in optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging can be achieved with agents that exhibit high absorption cross-sections, high photostability, low quantum yield, low toxicity, and preferential bio-distribution and clearance profiles. Based on advantageous photophysical properties of croconaine dyes, we explored croconaine-based nanoparticles (CR780RGD-NPs) as highly efficient contrast agents for targeted optoacoustic imaging of challenging preclinical tumor targets. Initial characterization of the CR780 dye was followed by modifications using polyethylene glycol and the cancer-targeting c(RGDyC) peptide, resulting in self-assembled ultrasmall particles with long circulation time and active tumor targeting. Preferential bio-distribution was demonstrated in orthotopic mouse brain tumor models by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and histological analysis. Our findings showcase particle accumulation in brain tumors with sustainable strong optoacoustic signals and minimal toxic side effects. This work points to CR780RGD-NPs as a promising optoacoustic contrast agent for potential use in the diagnosis and image-guided resection of brain tumors.","83":"Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is an emerging imaging method combining light and sound. However, limited by the laser's repetition rate, state-of-the-art high-speed PAM technology often sacrifices spatial sampling density (i.e., undersampling) for increased imaging speed over a large field-of-view. Deep learning (DL) methods have recently been used to improve sparsely sampled PAM images; however, these methods often require time-consuming pre-training and large training dataset with ground truth. Here, we propose the use of deep image prior (DIP) to improve the image quality of undersampled PAM images. Unlike other DL approaches, DIP requires neither pre-training nor fully-sampled ground truth, enabling its flexible and fast implementation on various imaging targets. Our results have demonstrated substantial improvement in PAM images with as few as 1.4 % of the fully sampled pixels on high-speed PAM. Our approach outperforms interpolation, is competitive with pre-trained supervised DL method, and is readily translated to other high-speed, undersampling imaging modalities.","84":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), featuring rich contrast, high spatial\/temporal resolution and deep penetration, is one of the fastest-growing biomedical imaging technology over the last decade. To date, numbers of handheld and semi-handheld photoacoustic imaging devices have been reported with corresponding potential clinical applications. Here, we summarize emerged handheld and semi-handheld systems in terms of photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), optoacoustic mesoscopy (OAMes), and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). We will discuss each modality in three aspects: laser delivery, scanning protocol, and acoustic detection. Besides new technical developments, we also review the associated clinical studies, and the advantages\/disadvantages of these new techniques. In the end, we propose the challenges and perspectives of miniaturized PAI in the future.","85":"Current intravascular imaging modalities face hurdles in the molecular evaluation of progressed plaques. This study aims to construct a novel hybrid imaging system (intravascular ultrasound\/intravascular photoacoustic, IVPA\/IVUS) via RGDfk peptide-targeted nanoparticles for monitoring angiogenesis in progressed atherosclerotic plaques in a rabbit model. An atherosclerotic rabbit model was induced by abdominal aorta balloon de-endothelialization followed by a high-fat diet. A human serum albumin (HSA)-based nanoprobe modified with RGDfk peptide was constructed by encapsulating indocyanine green (ICG) via electrostatic force (ICG-HSA-RGDfk NPs, IHR-NPs). A hybrid intravascular imaging system that combined IVUS and IVPA was self-assembled for RGDfk visualization within atherosclerotic plaques in the rabbit abdominal aorta. Through IHR-NPs and the hybrid IVUS\/IVPA imaging platform, multiple comprehensive pieces of information on progressed plaques, including anatomical information, composition information and molecular information, can be obtained simultaneously, which may improve the precise diagnosis of plaque characteristics and the evaluation of early interventions for atherosclerosis.","86":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging can be used to monitor flowing blood inside the microvascular and capillary bed. Ultrasound speckle decorrelation based velocimetry imaging was previously shown to accurately estimate blood flow velocity in mouse brain (micro-)vasculature. Translating this method to photoacoustic imaging will allow simultaneous imaging of flow velocity and extracting functional parameters like blood oxygenation. In this study, we use a pulsed laser diode and a quantitative method based on normalized first order field autocorrelation function of PA field fluctuations to estimate flow velocities in an ink tube phantom and in the microvasculature of the chorioallantoic membrane of a chicken embryo. We demonstrate how the decorrelation time of signals acquired over frames are related to the flow speed and show that the PA flow analysis based on this approach is an angle independent flow velocity imaging method.","87":null,"88":"The existence of a signal baseline due to a variety of reasons in a photoacoustic (PA) gas measurement system is a common phenomenon. One major component is the absorption of optical windows in an enclosed PA cell. This work explores the relation between the background signal and the thermoelastic effect inside the windows by modelling the pressure and elastic wave field by means of a Green-function based method. The influence of laser incidence location, angle and radius is discussed based on a rigorous three-dimensional solid-to-fluid coupling model. The effects were theoretically demonstrated culminating in the determination of best (minimum background signal) performance using a collimated and expanded incident laser beam. The results were also validated through experiments.","89":null,"90":"The tubular structures and dendritic distributions of blood vessels emit anisotropic photoacoustic (PA) signals with different intensities and frequency components at different angles. Therefore, spectral analysis of PA signals from a single angle cannot accurately determine the physical characteristics of microvessels. This study investigated the feasibility of using the PA power azimuth spectrum (PA-PAS) method to evaluate microvessel structures. We mapped the acoustic power spectrum of the PA signals along the azimuth direction. Based on a frequency-domain analysis of the broadband PA signal, we calculated the spectral parameter power-weighted mean frequency (PWMF). The results demonstrate that the PA signal information of the microvessel is mainly concentrated in the direction of its width. In addition, the PWMF decreases linearly with the microvascular size. The experimental findings exhibit good agreement with the simulation results, thus demonstrating that this approach can effectively differentiate the sizes of microvessels.","91":"In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using photoacoustic time-frequency spectral analysis (PA-TFSA) for evaluating the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone structure. Simulations and ex vivo experiments on bone samples with different BMDs and mean trabecular thickness (MTT) were conducted. All photoacoustic signals were processed using the wavelet transform-based PA-TFSA. The power-weighted mean frequency (PWMF) was evaluated to obtain the main frequency component at different times. The y-intercept, midband-fit, and slope of the linearly fitted curve of the PWMF over time were also quantified. The results show that the osteoporotic bone samples with lower BMD and thinner MTT have higher frequency components and lower acoustic frequency attenuation over time, thus higher y-intercept, midband-fit, and slope. The midband-fit and slope were found to be sensitive to the BMD; therefore, both parameters could be used to distinguish between osteoporotic and normal bones (p &lt; 0.05).","92":"The point-by-point scanning mechanism of photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) results in low-speed imaging, limiting the application of PAM. In this work, we propose a method to improve the quality of sparse PAM images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), thereby speeding up image acquisition while maintaining good image quality. The CNN model utilizes attention modules, residual blocks, and perceptual losses to reconstruct the sparse PAM image, which is a mapping from a 1\/4 or 1\/16 low-sampling sparse PAM image to a latent fully-sampled one. The model is trained and validated mainly on PAM images of leaf veins, showing effective improvements quantitatively and qualitatively. Our model is also tested using in vivo PAM images of blood vessels of mouse ears and eyes. The results suggest that the model can enhance the quality of the sparse PAM image of blood vessels in several aspects, which facilitates fast PAM and its clinical applications.","93":"As photoacoustic imaging (PAI) begins to mature and undergo clinical translation, there is a need for well-validated, standardized performance test methods to support device development, quality control, and regulatory evaluation. Despite recent progress, current PAI phantoms may not adequately replicate tissue light and sound transport over the full range of optical wavelengths and acoustic frequencies employed by reported PAI devices. Here we introduce polyacrylamide (PAA) hydrogel as a candidate material for fabricating stable phantoms with well-characterized optical and acoustic properties that are biologically relevant over a broad range of system design parameters. We evaluated suitability of PAA phantoms for conducting image quality assessment of three PAI systems with substantially different operating parameters including two commercial systems and a custom system. Imaging results indicated that appropriately tuned PAA phantoms are useful tools for assessing and comparing PAI system image quality. These phantoms may also facilitate future standardization of performance test methodology.","94":"The Laser Ultrasonic (LU) technique has been widely studied. Detected ultrasonic signals can be further processed using Synthetic Aperture Focusing Techniques (SAFTs), to detect and image internal defects. LU-based SAFT in frequency-domain (F-SAFT) is developed to visualize horizontal hole-type defects in aluminum. Bulk acoustic waves are non-destructively generated by irradiating a laser line-source, and detected using a laser Doppler vibrometer at a point away from the generation. The influence of this non-coincident generation-detection on the equivalent acoustic velocity used in the algorithm is studied via velocity mappings. Because the wide-band generation characteristic of the LU technique, frequency range selections in acoustic wave signals are implemented to increase Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and reconstruction speed. Results indicate that by using the LU F-SAFT algorithm, and incorporating optimizations such as velocity mapping and frequency range selection, small defects can be visualized in 3D with corrected locations and improved image quality.","95":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising emerging imaging modality that enables spatially resolved imaging of optical tissue properties up to several centimeters deep in tissue, creating the potential for numerous exciting clinical applications. However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability.","96":"Many nonlinear effects have been discovered and developed in photoacoustic imaging. These nonlinear mechanisms have been explored for different utilizations, such as enhancing imaging contrast, measuring tissue temperature, achieving super-resolution imaging, enabling functional imaging, and extracting important physical parameters. This review aims to introduce different nonlinear mechanisms in photoacoustics, underline the fundamental principles, highlight their representative applications, and outline the occurrence conditions and applicable range of each nonlinear mechanism. Furthermore, this review thoroughly discusses the nonlinearity rule concerning how the mathematical structure of the nonlinear dependence is correlated to its practical applications. This summarization is useful for identifying and guiding the potential applications of nonlinearity based on their mathematical expressions, and is helpful for new nonlinear mechanism discovery or implementation in the future, which facilitates further breakthroughs in nonlinear photoacoustics.","97":null,"98":null,"99":null,"100":"This work describes the design, development and added value of breast-supporting cups to immobilize and position the pendant breast in photoacoustic tomographic imaging. We explain the considerations behind the choice of the material, the shape and sizes of a cup-shaped construct for supporting the breast in water in an imaging tank during full-breast imaging. We provide details of the fabrication, and other processing and testing procedures used. Various experiments were conducted to demonstrate the added value of using these cups. We show that breast movement during a measurement time of four minutes is reduced from maximum 2 mm to 0.1 mm by the use of cups. Further, the presence of the cup, centered in the aperture leading to the imaging tank, ensures that the breast can be reproducibly positioned at the center of the field-of-view of the detection aperture in the tank. Finally, since an accurate delineation of the water-tissue boundary can now be made, the use of the cup enables accurate application of a two-speed of sound model for reconstruction. All in all, we demonstrate that the use of cups to support the breast provides clear enhancement in contrast and resolution of breast images in photoacoustic imaging.","101":null,"102":null,"103":"Machine learning has been developed dramatically and witnessed a lot of applications in various fields over the past few years. This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.","104":null,"105":"Measurement of ambient aerosol and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is important as they are major pollutants from the burning of fossil fuel and biomass. In the present work, a differential photoacoustic spectrometer (D-PAS) was developed for simultaneous, online measurements of aerosol optical absorption and NO2 concentration. A novel photoacoustic resonator was designed and employed in the D-PAS for controlling a large flow rate, improving response time, and keeping the flow noise at a low level. The detection limits of 1.0 Mm-1 and 0.87 ppb for aerosol absorption and NO2 concentration measurements were achieved with a lock-in amplifier time constant of 1 s. The D-PAS accuracy was demonstrated by performing a long-time, continuous measurement of aerosol, and NO2 in ambient air. The measured results of NO2 are consistent with the NOx analyzer and environmental monitoring station results.","106":"Enhancement of trace gas detectability using photoacoustic spectroscopy requires the effective suppression of strong background noise for practical applications. An upgraded infrared broadband trace gas detection configuration was investigated based on a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer equipped with specially designed T-resonators and simultaneous differential optical and photoacoustic measurement capabilities. By using acetylene and local air as appropriate samples, the detectivity of the differential photoacoustic mode was demonstrated to be far better than the pure optical approach both theoretically and experimentally, due to the effectiveness of light-correlated coherent noise suppression of non-intrinsic optical baseline signals. The wavelet domain denoising algorithm with the optimized parameters was introduced in detail to greatly improve the signal-to-noise ratio by denoising the incoherent ambient interference with respect to the differential photoacoustic measurement. The results showed enhancement of sensitivity to acetylene from 5 ppmv (original differential mode) to 806 ppbv, a fivefold improvement. With the suppression of background noise accomplished by the optimized wavelet domain denoising algorithm, the broadband differential photoacoustic trace gas detection was shown to be an effective approach for trace gas detection.","107":null,"108":"Adhesively bonded metals are increasingly used in many industries. Inspecting these parts remains challenging for modern non-destructive testing techniques. Laser ultrasound (LU) has shown great potential in high-resolution imaging of carbon-reinforced composites. For metals, excitation of longitudinal waves is inefficient without surface ablation. However, shear waves can be efficiently generated in the thermo-elastic regime and used to image defects in metallic structures. Here we present a compact LU system consisting of a high repetition rate diode-pumped laser to excite shear waves and noncontact detection with a highly sensitive fiber optic Sagnac interferometer to inspect adhesively bonded aluminum plates. Multiphysics finite difference simulations are performed to optimize the measurement configuration. Damage detection is performed for a structure consisting of three aluminum plates bonded with an epoxy film. Defects are simulated by a thin Teflon film. It is shown that the proposed technique can efficiently localize defects in both adhesion layers.","109":"For many optical imaging modalities, image qualities are inevitably degraded by wavefront distortions caused by varying light speed. In optical microscopy and astronomy, adaptive optics (AO) has long been applied to compensate for such unwanted aberrations. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), despite relying on the ultrasonic wave for image formation, suffers from the acoustic version of the same problem. However, this problem has traditionally been regarded as an inverse problem of jointly reconstructing both the initial pressure and the sound speed distributions. In this work, we proposed a method similar to indirect wavefront sensing in AO. We argued that wavefront distortions can be extracted and corrected by a frequency domain analysis of local images. In addition to an adaptively reconstructed aberration-free image, the speed of sound map can be subsequently estimated. We demonstrated the method by in silico, phantom, and in vivo experiments.","110":"Conventional photoacoustic imaging may suffer from the limited view and bandwidth of ultrasound transducers. A deep learning approach is proposed to handle these problems and is demonstrated both in simulations and in experiments on a multi-scale model of leaf skeleton. We employed an experimental approach to build the training and the test sets using photographs of the samples as ground truth images. Reconstructions produced by the neural network show a greatly improved image quality as compared to conventional approaches. In addition, this work aimed at quantifying the reliability of the neural network predictions. To achieve this, the dropout Monte-Carlo procedure is applied to estimate a pixel-wise degree of confidence on each predicted picture. Last, we address the possibility to use transfer learning with simulated data in order to drastically limit the size of the experimental dataset.","111":"Electromagnetic interactions between conventional earphones and the electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes used for analyzing brain waves give rise to efficiency problems in neurophysiological studies of auditory perception. Currently used speakers and headphones are electromagnetic devices based on strong magnets. In spite of intensive use of such systems, there has been no effective way to eliminate the electromagnetic artifacts produced by such audio transmitting devices to date. The ability for transferring audible sounds without the use of electromagnetic devices that can affect the EEG signal would open up many innovative possibilities in Audio Technologies. Audible sound transfer over long distances is possible by the photoacoustic effect. In such studies, the modulated optical signal can be converted into an audible signal arising from the absorption of the light energy of relevant molecules. In this study, we propose an earphone based on the photoacoustic effect, and calculated the dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level) values for a spherical cell filled with olive pomace. By the use of the method of Diebold and Westervelt, we theoretically calculated the sound pressure levels for our cell and determined a 60 dB SPL at a sound frequency of 1000 Hz for our preliminary earphone design.","112":"By providing complementary functional information, photoacoustic (PA) breast imaging based on the handheld ultrasound (US) probe has demonstrated promising potential for breast cancer diagnosis. However, the quantitative PA imaging primarily relies on the knowledge of the optical fluence distribution in the three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous breast tissue. Previous studies based on the handheld system generally provided two-dimensional (2D) B-scan results, which contains limited anatomical information of the tissue and the lesion. This study proposed a method to perform 3D modeling of the photon transportation for dual-modality PA\/US system based on the local 3D breast anatomical information by scanning US probe. Then the calculated optical fluence distribution can be used for PA imaging. Our phantom and clinical pilot study results demonstrated that this method has potential to improve the accuracy of the quantitative PA breast imaging, and it can also be used in other clinical implementations.","113":"Photo-or optoacoustic imaging (OAI) allows quantitative imaging of target tissues. Using multi-wavelength illumination with subsequent ultrasound detection, it may visualize a variety of different chromophores at centimeter depth. Despite its non-invasive, label-free advantages, the precision of repeated measurements for clinical applications is still elusive. We present a multilayer analysis of n = 1920 imaging datasets obtained from a prospective clinical trial (NCT03979157) in n = 10 healthy adult volunteers. All datasets were analyzed for 13 single wavelengths (SWL) between 660 nm-1210 nm and five MSOT-parameters (deoxygenated\/oxygenated\/total hemoglobin, collagen and lipid) by a semi-automated batch mode software. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were good to excellent for intrarater (SWL: 0.82-0.92; MSOT-parameter: 0.72-0.92) and interrater reproducibility (SWL: 0.79-0.87; MSOT-parameter: 0.78-0.86), with the exception for MSOT-parameter lipid (interrater ICC: 0.56). Results were stable over time, but exercise-related effects as well as inter-and intramuscular variability were observed. The findings of this study provide a framework for further clinical OAI implementation.","114":"There is a need for accurate and rapid detection of renal cancer in clinic. Here, we integrated photoacoustic tomography (PAT) with ultrasound imaging in a single system, which achieved tissue imaging depth about 3 mm and imaging speed about 3.5 cm2\/min. We used the wavelength at 1197 nm to map lipid distribution in normal renal tissues and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues collected from 19 patients undergone nephrectomy. Our results indicated that the photoacoustic signal from lipids was significantly higher in ccRCC tissues than that in normal tissues. Moreover, based on the quantification of lipid area ratio, we were able to differentiate normal and ccRCC with 100 % sensitivity, 80 % specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95. Our findings demonstrate that multimodal PAT can differentiate normal and ccRCC by integrating the morphologic information from ultrasound and lipid amount information from vibrational PAT.","115":null,"116":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has achieved remarkable growth in the past few decades since it takes advantage of both optical and ultrasound (US) imaging. In order to better promote the wide clinical applications of PAI, many miniaturized and portable PAI systems have recently been proposed. Most of these systems utilize fiber optic technologies. Here, we overview the fiber optic technologies used in PAI. This paper discusses three different fiber optic technologies: fiber optic light transmission, fiber optic US transmission, and fiber optic US detection. These fiber optic technologies are analyzed in different PAI modalities including photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), and minimally invasive photoacoustic imaging (MIPAI).","117":"A major challenge of transcranial human brain photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is correcting for the acoustic aberration induced by the skull. Here, we present a modified universal back-projection (UBP) method, termed layered UBP (L-UBP), that can de-aberrate the transcranial PA signals by accommodating the skull heterogeneity into conventional UBP. In L-UBP, the acoustic medium is divided into multiple layers: the acoustic coupling fluid layer between the skull and detectors, the skull layer, and the brain tissue layer, which are assigned different acoustic properties. The transmission coefficients and wave conversion are considered at the fluid-skull and skull-tissue interfaces. Simulations of transcranial PACT using L-UBP were conducted to validate the method. Ex vivo experiments with a newly developed three-dimensional PACT system with 1-MHz center frequency demonstrated that L-UBP can substantially improve the image quality compared to conventional UBP.","118":"Quantitative analysis of tumor vessels is of great significance for tumor staging and diagnosis. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has been proven to be an effective way to visualize comprehensive tumor vascular networks in three-dimensional (3D) volume, while previous studies only quantified the vessels projected in one plane. In this study, tumor vessels were segmented and quantified in a full 3D framework. It had been verified in the phantom experiments that the 3D quantification results have better accuracy than 2D. Furthermore, in vivo vessel images were quantified by 2D and 3D quantification methods respectively. And the difference between these two results is significant. In this study, complete vessel segmentation and quantification method within a 3D framework was implemented, which showed obvious advantage in the analysis accuracy of 3D photoacoustic images, and potentially improve tumor study and diagnosis.","119":null,"120":"Photoacoustic tomography has great potential to image dynamic functional changes in vivo. Many tomographic systems are built with a circular view geometry, necessitating a linear translation along one axis of the subject to obtain a three-dimensional volume. In this work, we evaluated a prototype spherical view photoacoustic tomographic system which acquires a 3D volume in a single scan, without linear translation. We simultaneously measured relative hemoglobin oxygen saturation in multiple placentas of pregnant mice under oxygen challenge. We also synthesized a folate-conjugated indocyanine green (ICG) contrast agent to image folate kinetics in the placenta. Photoacoustic tomography performed at the wavelength of peak optical absorption of our contrast agent revealed increased ICG signal over time. Through these phantom and in vivo studies, we have demonstrated that the spherical view 3D photoacoustic tomographic system achieves high sensitivity and fast image acquisition, enabling in vivo experiments to assess physiological and molecular dynamics.","121":null,"122":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) takes advantage of both optical and ultrasound imaging properties to visualize optical absorption with high resolution and contrast. Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is usually categorized with all-optical microscopy techniques such as optical coherence tomography or confocal microscopes. Despite offering high sensitivity, novel imaging contrast, and high resolution, PAM is not generally an all-optical imaging method unlike the other microscopy techniques. One of the significant limitations of photoacoustic microscopes arises from their need to be in physical contact with the sample through a coupling media. This physical contact, coupling, or immersion of the sample is undesirable or impractical for many clinical and pre-clinical applications. This also limits the flexibility of photoacoustic techniques to be integrated with other all-optical imaging microscopes for providing complementary imaging contrast. To overcome these limitations, several non-contact photoacoustic signal detection approaches have been proposed. This paper presents a brief overview of current non-contact photoacoustic detection techniques with an emphasis on all-optical detection methods and their associated physical mechanisms.","123":"Time-domain Brillouin scattering is an opto-acousto-optical probe technique for the evaluation of transparent materials. Via optoacoustic conversion, ultrashort pump laser pulses launch coherent acoustic pulses in the sample. Time-delayed ultrashort probe laser pulses monitor the propagation of the coherent acoustic pulses via the photo-elastic effect, which induces light scattering. A photodetector collects both the acoustically scattered light and the probe light reflected by the sample structure for the heterodyning. The scattered probe light carries information on the acoustical, optical and acousto-optical parameters of the material for the current position of the coherent acoustic pulse. Thus, among other applications, time-domain Brillouin scattering is a technique for three-dimensional imaging. Sharp focusing of coherent acoustic pulses and probe laser pulses could increase lateral spatial resolution of imaging, but could potentially diminish the depth of imaging. However, the theoretical analysis presented in this manuscript contra-intuitively demonstrates that the depth and spectral resolution of the time-domain Brillouin scattering imaging, with collinearly propagating paraxial sound and light beams, do not depend on the focusing\/diffraction of sound. The variations of the amplitude of the time-domain Brillouin scattering signal are only due to the variations of the probe light amplitude caused by light focusing\/diffraction. Although the amplitude of the acoustically scattered light is proportional to the product of the local acoustical and probe light field amplitudes, the temporal dynamics of the time-domain Brillouin scattering signal amplitude is independent of the dynamics of the coherent acoustic pulse amplitude.","124":"Multispectral photoacoustic microscopy uses a wavelength-dependent absorption difference as a contrast mechanism to image the target molecule. In this paper, we present a novel multispectral pulsed fiber laser source, which selectively alternates the excitation wavelengths between green and red colors based on the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) effect for imaging. This laser has a high pulse repetition rate (PRR) of 300 kHz and high pulse energy of more than 200 nJ meeting the real-time requirements of optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy imaging. By switching the polarization state of the pump light and optical paths of the pump light, the operating wavelengths of the light source can be selectively alternated at the same fast PRR for any two SRS peak wavelengths between 545 and 655 nm. At 545 nm excitation wavelength, molecular photoacoustic signals from both blood vessels and gold nanorods were obtained simultaneously. However, at 655 nm, the photoacoustic signals of gold nanorods were dominant because the absorption of light by the blood vessels decreased drastically in the spectral region over 600 nm. Thus the multispectral photoacoustic system designed using the novel laser source implemented here could simultaneously monitor the time-dependent fast movement of two molecules independently, having different wavelength-dependent absorption properties at a high repetition rate of 0.49 frames per second (fps).","125":"A multi-quartz-enhanced photothermal spectroscopy (M-QEPTS) based trace gas detection method is reported for the first time. Different from traditional QEPTS sensor employing a single quartz tuning fork (QTF) as a photothermal detector, two QTFs were used in M-QEPTS to increase the signal amplitude by adding the generated piezoelectric signals. The coating film of the QTFs was removed in order to improve the laser absorption and transmission. Acetylene (C2H2) was chosen as the target analyte. Wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) and 2nd harmonic detection were utilized for the concentration detection. Limit of detection (LoD) of 0.97 ppm was achieved with a 1 second integration time for the M-QEPTS sensor, which realized a 1.51 times signal enhancement compared to a traditional QEPTS sensor employing a single QTF. By using an Allan deviation analysis approach, LoD of 0.19 ppm for an optimum integration time of 200 s was obtained.","126":"We investigate the optical wavelength dependence of the photoacoustic (PA) signal, detected with bandwidth (BW) in the MHz range, of gold nanospheres (NSs) immersed in water upon illumination with ns laser pulses. We compare the wavelength dependence of the PA signal (within the MHz BW) with the one of the optical absorption coefficient as determined from optical transmission measurements. Thermal boundary conductance (TBC) at the gold-water interface is taken into account, as well as the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient of water. The effects of NS size and laser pulse duration on the PA signal are also explored. The PA signal is investigated with an opto-thermo-acoustic model considering light absorption in gold NS and in a surrounding water shell.","127":"Sono-photoacoustic (SPA) activation lowers the threshold of phase-change contrast agents by timing a laser shot to coincide with the arrival of an acoustic wave at a region of interest. The combination of photothermal heating from optical absorption and negative pressure from the acoustic wave greatly reduces the droplet's combined vaporization threshold compared to using laser energy or acoustic energy alone. In previous studies, SPA imaging used a broadly illuminated optical pulse combined with plane wave acoustic pulses transmitted from a linear ultrasound array. Acoustic plane waves cover a wide lateral field of view, enabling direct visualization of the contrast agent distribution. In contrast, we demonstrate here that localized SPA activation is possible using electronically steered\/focused ultrasound pulses. The focused SPA activation region is defined axially by the number of cycles in the acoustic pulse and laterally by the acoustic beam width. By reducing the spot size and enabling rapid electronic steering, complex activation patterns are possible, which may be particularly useful in therapeutic applications.","128":null,"129":"Precision control of vaporization, both in space and time, is critical for numerous applications, including medical imaging and therapy, catalysis and energy conversion, and it can be greatly improved through the use of micro- or nano-sized light absorbers. Ultimately, optimization of these applications also requires a fundamental understanding of the vaporization process. Upon laser irradiation, polymeric microcapsules containing a dye can vaporize, leading to the growth of a vapor bubble that emits a strong acoustic signature. Here, we compare laser-activated capsules containing either a volatile or a non-volatile oil core. We theoretically explore the vaporization of the capsules based on a three-phase thermodynamics model, that accounts for the partial vaporization of both the surrounding fluid and the oil core as well as for the interaction between heat transfer and microbubble growth. The model is compared to ultra-high-speed imaging experiments, where we record the cavitation events. Theory and experiments are in convincing agreement.","130":"The Hessian-based Frangi vesselness filter is commonly used to enhance vasculature in optoacoustic (photoacoustic) images, but its accuracy and limitations have never been rigorously assessed. Here we validate the ability of the filter to enhance vessel-like structures in phantoms, and we introduce an experimental approach that uses measurements before and after the administration of gold nanorods (AuNRs) to examine filter performance in vivo. We evaluate the influence of contrast, filter scales, angular tomographic coverage, out-of-plane signals and light fluence on image quality, and gain insight into the performance of the filter. We observe the generation of artifactual structures that can be misinterpreted as vessels and provide recommendations to ensure appropriate use of Frangi and other vesselness filters and avoid misinterpretation of post-processed optoacoustic images.","131":"Real-time intraoperative guidance during minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures (e.g., endonasal transsphenoidal surgery) is often limited to endoscopy and CT-guided image navigation, which can be suboptimal at locating underlying blood vessels and nerves. Accidental damage to these critical structures can have severe surgical complications, including patient blindness and death. Photoacoustic image guidance was previously proposed as a method to prevent accidental injury. While the proposed technique remains promising, the original light delivery and sound reception components of this technology require alterations to make the technique suitable for patient use. This paper presents simulation and experimental studies performed with both an intact human skull (which was cleaned from tissue attachments) and a complete human cadaver head (with contents and surrounding tissue intact) in order to investigate optimal locations for ultrasound probe placement during photoacoustic imaging and to test the feasibility of a modified light delivery design. Volumetric x-ray CT images of the human skull were used to create k-Wave simulations of acoustic wave propagation within this cranial environment. Photoacoustic imaging of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was performed with this same skull. Optical fibers emitting 750 nm light were inserted into the nasal cavity for ICA illumination. The ultrasound probe was placed on three optimal regions identified by simulations: (1) nasal cavity, (2) ocular region, and (3) 1 mm-thick temporal bone (which received 9.2%, 4.7%, and 3.8% of the initial photoacoustic pressure, respectively, in simulations). For these three probe locations, the contrast of the ICA in comparative experimental photoacoustic images was 27 dB, 19 dB, and 12 dB, respectively, with delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming and laser pulse energies of 3 mJ, 5 mJ, and 4.2 mJ, respectively. Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) beamforming improved the contrast of these DAS images by up to 15 dB, enabled visualization of multiple cross-sectional ICA views in a single image, and enabled the use of lower laser energies. Combined simulation and experimental results with the emptied skull and &gt;1 mm-thick temporal bone indicated that the ocular and nasal regions were more optimal probe locations than the temporal ultrasound probe location. Results from both the same skull filled with ovine brains and eyes and the human cadaver head validate the ocular region as an optimal acoustic window for our current system setup, producing high-contrast (i.e., up to 35 dB) DAS and SLSC photoacoustic images within the laser safety limits of a novel, compact light delivery system design that is independent of surgical tools (i.e., a fiber bundle with 6.8 mm outer diameter, 2 mm-diameter optical aperture, and an air gap spacing between the sphenoid bone and fiber tips). These results are promising toward identifying, quantifying, and overcoming major system design barriers to proceed with future patient testing.","132":"In molecular and cellular photoacoustic imaging with exogenous contrast agents, image contrast is plagued by background resulting from endogenous absorbers in tissue. By using optically modulatable nanoparticles, we develop ultra-sensitive photoacoustic imaging by rejecting endogenous background signals and drastically improving signal contrast through time-delayed pump-probe pulsed laser illumination. Gated by prior pump excitation, modulatable photoacoustic (mPA) signals are recovered from unmodulatable background through simple, real-time image processing to yield background-free photoacoustic signal recovery within tissue mimicking phantoms and from ex-vivo tissues. Inherently multimodal, the fluorescence and mPA sensitivity improvements demonstrate the promise of Synchronously Amplified Photoacoustic Image Recovery (SAPhIRe) for PA imaging in diagnosis and therapy.","133":null,"134":null,"135":"Medical image reconstruction methods based on deep learning have recently demonstrated powerful performance in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) from limited-view and sparse data. However, because most of these methods must utilize conventional linear reconstruction methods to implement signal-to-image transformations, their performance is restricted. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning reconstruction approach that integrates appropriate data pre-processing and training strategies. The Feature Projection Network (FPnet) presented herein is designed to learn this signal-to-image transformation through data-driven learning rather than through direct use of linear reconstruction. To further improve reconstruction results, our method integrates an image post-processing network (U-net). Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve high reconstruction quality from limited-view data with sparse measurements. When employing GPU acceleration, this method can achieve a reconstruction speed of 15 frames per second.","136":"Conventional reconstruction algorithms (e.g., delay-and-sum) used in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for limited-view with ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the initial PA pressure distribution by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network combines two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. We compared our result with some ablation studies, and the results of the test set show better performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning method (U-Net). Both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments are used to validated our method, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.","137":"","138":null,"139":"Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are sensitive to optical absorption and scattering characteristics, respectively. As such, the integration of these two modalities in order to combine important complementary information has garnered much attention. Due to the relatively low axial resolution of PAM, PAM and OCT dual modality systems generally have a large resolution gap, especially for reflection mode systems. In this study, based on a wide-band transparent pure-optical ultrasonic detector, we developed a dual modality system (PAM-OCT system) in which PAM has a similar spatial resolution (i.e. several micrometers in both the lateral and axial directions) to OCT. In addition, due to the optical transparency advantage, the integrated system works in reflection mode, which is ideal for in vivo biomedical imaging. We successfully imaged the skin of a mouse hindlimb, which cannot be done by a transmission mode dual modality system. Our work demonstrates this dual modality system has potential in biomedical studies with complementary imaging contrasts.","140":"The goal of this study is to further develop a multi-modality eye imaging system and evaluate its feasibility of acquiring images of different modalities simultaneously. An integrated multimodality imaging system combining spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and fluorescence microscopy (FM) was developed, and its performance for eye imaging was validated on multiple clinically-relevant retinal disease models in vivo in rabbits. OCT imaging allows for visualization of the different anatomic retinal layers with high axial resolution. PAM can be used to image vasculature, angiogenesis, and hemorrhages. The leakage of neovascularization can be verified with FM and fluorescein dye. Simultaneous imaging with OCT, PAM, and FM ensures co-registration of the three modalities without being affected by motion artifacts caused by breathing, body or eye movements, and heartbeat. This simultaneous multi-modality eye imaging system could be a new tool for applications both in ophthalmology and other fields.","141":null,"142":"Photoacoustic (PA) signals encode information about the optical absorption and spatial distribution of absorbing chromophores as well as the light distribution in the medium. The wavelength dependence of the latter affects the accuracy in chromophore quantification, including estimations of oxygen saturation (sO2) with depth. We propose the use of the ratio of the PA radiofrequency (RF) spectral slopes (SS) at different optical wavelengths to generate frequency filters which can be used to match the fluence profiles across separate images generated with different optical wavelengths. Proof-of-principle experiments were carried on a plastic tube with blood of a known oxygenation inserted into a porcine tissue. The algorithm was tested in-vivo in the hind leg of six CD1 mice, each under three different breathing conditions (100 % O2, room air and 100 % CO2). Imaging was done using the VevoLAZR system at the wavelengths 720 and 870 nm. The SS was calculated from the linear fit of the ratio of the photoacoustic RF power spectra at the two wavelengths. An ultrasound frequency filter was designed and applied to each segmented PA signal in the frequency domain and inversely transformed into the time domain to correct for the differences in the fluence profiles at both wavelengths. Linear spectral unmixing was used to estimate sO2 before and after applying the ultrasound frequency filter. The estimated blood sO2 in the plastic tube for the porcine tissue experiment improved by 10.3% after applying the frequency filter when compared to the sO2 measured by a blood gas analyzer. For the in-vivo mouse experiments, the applied sO2 correction was 2.67, 1.33 and -3.33% for every mm of muscle tissue for mice breathing 100% O2, room air and 100% CO2, respectively. The approach presented here provides a new approach for fluence matching that can potentially improve the accuracy of sO2 estimates by removing the fluence depth dependence at different optical wavelengths.","143":"The fidelity and quality of reconstructed images in optoacoustic mesoscopy (OPAM) can be significantly improved by considering the spatial impulse response (SIR) of the employed focused transducer into reconstruction. However, the traditional method fully taking the SIR into account can hardly meet the data-intensive requirements of high resolution OPAM because of excessive memory and time consumption. Herein, a modified back-projection method using a space-variant filter for full-frequency correction of the SIR is presented, and applied to the OPAM system with a sphere-focused transducer. The proposed method can readily manage the large datasets of the OPAM and effectively reduce the extra time consumption. The performance of the proposed method is showcased by simulations and experiments of phantoms and biological tissue. The results demonstrate that the modified back-projection method exhibits better image fidelity, resolution and contrast compared to the common and weighted back-projection methods that are not or not fully accounting for the SIR.","144":null,"145":null,"146":"Understanding the mechanical properties of biological cells is a challenging problem for the life sciences partly because there are limited methods for mapping elasticity with high resolution. Phonon microscopy is a form of Brillouin light scattering which uses coherent phonons for imaging with elasticity-related contrast, phonon resolution and without labels. It can measure material properties such as sound velocity, acoustic impedance and attenuation. To use it as a contrast mechanism in microscopy, high numerical aperture (NA) lenses are key to high resolution. However, increasing NA induces apparent attenuation, a premature decay of the detected signal. To reduce signal decay and quantify the sound attenuation coefficient in cells, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that affect signal decay. Here we define opto-acoustic defocus as a signal decay mechanism and propose methods to achieve quantitative sound attenuation measurements, and to optimise in-depth imaging at high resolution which is crucial for cell imaging.","147":"The use of photoacoustics (PA) being a convenient non-invasive analysis tool is widespread in various biomedical fields. Despite significant advances in traditional PA cell systems, detection platforms capable of providing high signal-to-noise ratios and steady operation are yet to be developed for practical micro\/nano biosensing applications. Microfabricated transducers offer orders of magnitude higher quality factors and greatly enhanced performance in extremely miniature dimensions that is unattainable with large-scale PA cells. In this work we exploit these attractive attributes of microfabrication technology and describe the first implementation of a vacuum-packaged microscale resonator in photoacoustic biosensing. Steady operation of this functional approach is demonstrated by detecting the minuscule PA signals from the variations of trace amounts of glucose in gelatin-based synthetic tissues. These results demonstrate the potential of the novel approach to broad photoacoustic applications, spanning from micro-biosensing modules to the analysis of solid and liquid analytes of interest in condense mediums.","148":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging non-invasive biomedical imaging modality that could potentially be used to determine the borders of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) preoperatively in order to reduce the need for repeated surgery. Two- and three-dimensional PA images were obtained by scanning BCCs using 59 wavelengths in the range 680-970 nm. Spectral unmixing was performed to visualize the tumor tissue distribution. Spectral signatures from 38 BCCs and healthy tissue were compared ex vivo. The PA spectra could be used to differentiate between BCC and healthy tissue ex vivo (p &lt; 0.05). Spectral unmixing provided visualization of the overall architecture of the lesion and its border. PA imaging can be used to differentiate between BCC and healthy tissue and can potentially be used to delineate tumors prior to surgical excision.

These approaches can also be used to investigate unicellular diatom algae that are extremely important for Earth's ecology. They are enveloped within silica frustules (exoskeletons), which can be used in drug delivery systems. Here, we report for the first time the successful application of photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescent visualization of diatoms. Chlorophyll a and c and fucoxanthin were found likely to be responsible for the photoacoustic effect in diatoms. The PA signal was obtained from gel drops containing diatoms and was found to increase with the diatom concentration. The fluorescence lifetime of the diatom chromophores ranged from 0.5 to 2 ns. The dynamic light scattering, absorbance, and SEM characterization techniques were also applied. The results were considered in combination to elucidate the nature of the photoacoustic signal. Possible biotechnological applications are proposed for the remote photoacoustic monitoring of algae.","150":null,"151":null,"152":"Multispectral photoacoustic imaging (MPAI) is a promising emerging diagnostic technology, but fluence artifacts can degrade device performance. Our goal was to develop well-validated phantom-based test methods for evaluating and comparing MPAI fluence correction algorithms, including a heuristic diffusion approximation, Monte Carlo simulations, and an algorithm we developed based on novel application of the diffusion dipole model (DDM). Phantoms simulated a range of breast-mimicking optical properties and contained channels filled with chromophore solutions (ink, hemoglobin, or copper sulfate) or connected to a previously developed blood flow circuit providing tunable oxygen saturation (SO2). The DDM algorithm achieved similar spectral recovery and SO2 measurement accuracy to Monte Carlo-based corrections with lower computational cost, potentially providing an accurate, real-time correction approach. Algorithms were sensitive to optical property uncertainty, but error was minimized by matching phantom albedo. The developed test methods may provide a foundation for standardized assessment of MPAI fluence correction algorithm performance.","153":null,"154":null,"155":"Photothermal measurements with an infrared camera enable a fast and contactless part inspection. The main drawback of existing reconstruction methods is the degradation of the spatial resolution with increasing imaging depth, which results in blurred images for deeper lying structures. In this paper, we propose an efficient image reconstruction strategy that allows prior information to be included to overcome the diffusion-based information loss. Following the virtual wave concept, in a first step we reconstruct an acoustic wave field that satisfies the standard wave equation. Therefore, in the second step, stable and efficient reconstruction methods developed for photoacoustic tomography can be used. We compensate for the loss of information in thermal measurements by incorporating the prior information positivity and sparsity. Therefore, we combine circular projections with an iterative regularization scheme. Using simulated and experimental data, this work demonstrates that the quality of the reconstruction from photothermal measurements can be significantly enhanced.","156":null,"157":"Using the same ultrasound detector, hybrid optoacoustic-ultrasound (OPUS) imaging provides concurrent scans of tissue slices or volumes and visualizes complementary sound- and light-based contrast at similar resolutions. In addition to the benefit of hybrid contrast, spatial co-registration enables images from one modality to be employed as prior information for improving an aspect of the performance of the other modality. We consider herein a handheld OPUS system and utilize structural information from ultrasound images to guide regional Laplacian regularization-based reconstruction of optoacoustic images. Using phantoms and data from OPUS scans of human radial and carotid arteries, we show that ultrasound-driven optoacoustic inversion reduces limited-view artefacts and improves image contrast. In phantoms, prior-integrated reconstruction leads to a 50 % higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the image than standard reconstruction, and a 17 % higher structural similarity (SSIM) index. In clinical data, prior-integrated reconstruction detects deep-seated radial arteries with higher CNR than the standard method at three different depths. In this way, the prior-integrated method offers unique insights into atherosclerotic carotid plaques in humans (with p&lt;0.01 between patients and healthy volunteers), potentially paving the way for new abilities in vascular imaging and more generally in optoacoustic imaging.","158":"Research on photoacoustic imaging (PAI) using a handheld integrated photoacoustic probe has been a recent focus of clinical translation of this imaging technique. One of the remaining challenges is the occurrence of out-of-plane artifacts (OPAs) in such a probe. Previously, we proposed a method to identify and remove OPAs by axially displacing the transducer array. Here we show that besides the benefit of removing OPAs from the imaging plane, the proposed method can provide a three-dimensional (3D) view of the OPAs. In this work, we present a 3D reconstruction method using axial transducer array displacement. By axially displacing the transducer array, out-of-plane absorbers can be three-dimensionally visualized at an elevation distance of up to the acquired imaging depth. Additionally, OPAs in the in-plane image are significantly reduced. We experimentally demonstrate the method with phantom and in vivo experiments using an integrated PAI probe. We also compare the method with elevational transducer array displacement and take into account the sensitivity of the transducer array in the 3D reconstruction.","159":"Bone microvasculature plays a paramount role in bone marrow maintenance, development, and hematopoiesis. Studies of calvarian vascular patterns within living mammalian skull with the available intravital microscopy techniques are limited to small scale observations. We developed an optical-resolution optoacoustic microscopy method combined with ultrasound biomicroscopy in order to reveal and discern the intricate networks of calvarian and cerebral vasculature over large fields of view covering majority of the murine calvaria. The vasculature segmentation method is based on an angle-corrected homogeneous model of the rodent skull, generated using simultaneously acquired three-dimensional pulse-echo ultrasound images. The hybrid microscopy design along with the appropriate skull segmentation method enable high throughput studies of a living bone while facilitating correct anatomical interpretation of the vasculature images acquired with optical resolution optoacoustic microscopy.","160":"X-ray imaging has proved invaluable in medical diagnoses and non-destructive testing (NDT) in the past century. However, there remain two major limitations: radiation harm and inaccessibility to the sample. A recent imaging modality, X-ray induced acoustic computed tomography (XACT), allows a novel solution. In XACT, x-ray induced excitation causes localized heating (&lt;mK) and thermoelastic expansion. This induces a detectable ultrasonic emission, thereby enabling imaging. XACT has the potential to enable low-dose, fast, 3D imaging requiring only single side access. We discuss the fundamentals of XACT and summarize milestones in its evolution over the past several years since its first demonstration using a Medical Linear Accelerator. We highlight XACT's potential applications in biomedical imaging and NDT, and discuss the latest advanced concepts and future directions.","161":null,"162":null,"163":"Photoacoustic (PA) spectroscopy enjoys widespread applications across atmospheric sciences.

We perform measurements on optically trapped droplets of varying sizes at different relative humidity. Our recently developed technique - photothermal single-particle spectroscopy (PSPS) - enables fundamental investigations of the interplay between the heat flux and mass flux from single aerosol particles. We find that the PA phase is more sensitive to water uptake by aerosol particles than the PA amplitude. We present results from a model of the PA phase, which sheds further light onto the dependence of the PA phase on the mass flux phenomena. The presented work provides fundamental insights into photoacoustic signal generation of aerosol particles.","164":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging (or optoacoustic imaging) is a novel biomedical imaging method in biological and medical research. This modality performs morphological, functional, and molecular imaging with and without labels in both microscopic and deep tissue imaging domains. A variety of innovations have enhanced 3D PA imaging performance and thus has opened new opportunities in preclinical and clinical imaging. However, the 3D visualization tools for PA images remains a challenge. There are several commercially available software packages to visualize the generated 3D PA images. They are generally expensive, and their features are not optimized for 3D visualization of PA images. Here, we demonstrate a specialized 3D visualization software package, namely 3D Photoacoustic Visualization Studio (3D PHOVIS), specifically targeting photoacoustic data, image, and visualization processes. To support the research environment for visualization and fast processing, we incorporated 3D PHOVIS onto the MATLAB with graphical user interface and developed multi-core graphics processing unit modules for fast processing. The 3D PHOVIS includes following modules: (1) a mosaic volume generator, (2) a scan converter for optical scanning photoacoustic microscopy, (3) a skin profile estimator and depth encoder, (4) a multiplanar viewer with a navigation map, and (5) a volume renderer with a movie maker. This paper discusses the algorithms present in the software package and demonstrates their functions. In addition, the applicability of this software to ultrasound imaging and optical coherence tomography is also investigated. User manuals and application files for 3D PHOVIS are available for free on the website (www.boa-lab.com). Core functions of 3D PHOVIS are developed as a result of a summer class at POSTECH, \"High-Performance Algorithm in CPU\/GPU\/DSP, and Computer Architecture.\" We believe our 3D PHOVIS provides a unique tool to PA imaging researchers, expedites its growth, and attracts broad interests in a wide range of studies.","165":"Translation of stem cell therapies to treat injuries and diseases of the spinal cord is hindered by lack of real-time monitoring techniques to guide regenerative therapies intra- and postoperatively. Thus, we developed an ultrasound (US), photoacoustic (PA), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging approach augmented with Prussian blue nanocubes (PBNCs) to guide stem cell injections intraoperatively and monitor stem cell therapies in the spinal cord postoperatively. Per the clinical procedure, a multi-level laminectomy was performed in rats ex vivo, and PBNC-labeled stem cells were injected directly into the spinal cord while US\/PA images were acquired. US\/PA\/MR images were also acquired post-surgery. Several features of the imaging approach were demonstrated including detection of low stem cell concentrations, real-time needle guidance and feedback on stem cell delivery, and good agreement between US\/PA\/MR images. These benefits span intra- and postoperative environments to support future development of this imaging tool.","166":"To date, the vast majority of intra-vital neuroimaging systems applied in clinic and diagnostics is stationary with a rigid scanning element, requires specialized facilities and costly infrastructure.

To evaluate the relationship between these metrics and the relative performance of the two modalities in assessment of tumour physiology, co-registration of their output imaging data is required. Unfortunately, this poses a significant challenge due to differences in animal positioning during imaging. Here, we present an integrated framework for registration of OT and MR image data in mice. Our framework combines a novel MR animal holder, to improve animal positioning during imaging, and a landmark-based software co-registration algorithm.

Resonators are usually closed, however, in some applications, open resonators are preferred. The opening deteriorates the photoacoustic signal hence reducing the sensitivity of the photoacoustic measurement. We present two new approaches for simulating the photoacoustic signal in open resonators using finite element modelling. The approaches are based on the amplitude mode expansion model and the viscothermal model with the opening modelled using perfectly matched layers and the boundary element method respectively. Additionally, the performance of the viscothermal model using perfectly matched layers for simulating open resonators is extended to the ultrasound region. The simulation results are verified by comparing them to photoacoustic measurements.

A calibrated absorber allowed scaling of the measured data during the inversion, while an acoustic correction method was employed to compensate the effects of limited view detection. Chromophore- and fluence-dependent step sizes and Adam optimization were implemented to achieve rapid convergence.

To instantaneously determine the blood flow speed, dual-pulse photoacoustic flowmetry is developed to determine the blood flow speed from photoacoustic signal decay in sub-microseconds. Grueneisen relaxation effect is compensated for in the oxygen saturation calculation. The blood flow imaging is validated in phantom and in vivo experiments. The results show that the flow speed can be measured accurately in sub-microseconds by comparing the dual-pulse flowmetric method with photoacoustic Doppler flowmetry. Wide-field OR-PAM of hemoglobin concentration, blood flow speed, and oxygen saturation are demonstrated in the mouse ear.

To compare interferometric and piezoelectric readouts, two QTFs have been selected; a tuning fork with rectangular-shape of the prongs, having a resonance frequency of 3.4 kHz and a quality-factor of 4,000, and a QTF with prong having a T-shape characterized by a resonance frequency of 12.4 kHz with a quality-factor of 15,000. Comparison between the interferometric and piezoelectric readouts were performed by using both QTFs in a QEPAS sensor setup for water vapor detection.

Although substantial emphasis has been placed on the yolk sac vascular remodeling, no detailed three-dimensional (3D) imaging and quantitative analysis of this process has been described. Herein, we explored the development of the vascular system in the visceral yolk sac (VYS) on E11.5, E12.5 and E13.5 mouse embryos using a home-built large field-of-view (FOV) optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM). The results showed that OR-PAM can be used as a label-free imaging tool for studying the 2D\/3D morphology changes of the vascular system during organogenesis. In addition, after a quantitative analysis the results showed that the microvascular density in the VYS gradually reduced along with the embryo growth. Vascular density in the VYS of E11.5 mouse embryos was almost 6-fold than that of E13.5. Hovever, the averaged vessel diameter of the entire VYS membrane increased gradually with the development of embryos. This study suggests that OR-PAM is a potential tool for acquiring the hemodynamic parameters of mammalian embryos, which could be further used for studying diseases related with the vascular remodeling such as vascular malformations and heart defects.","178":"Review sums up the application of photoacoustic and photothermal spectroscopies for the analysis and characterization of soils and soil organic matter and discusses the outlooks in this area.","179":"Image reconstruction in optoacoustic imaging is often based on a delay-and-sum (DAS) or a frequency domain (FD) algorithm. In this study, we performed a comprehensive comparison of these two algorithms together with coherence factor (CF) weighting using phantom and in-vivo mouse data obtained with optoacoustic microscopy. For this purpose we developed an FD based definition of the CF. Our results reveal the equivalence of DAS and FD, with and without CF weighting, in terms of spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) but highlight the clear advantage of FD in terms of computational cost, making it preferable for 3D reconstruction or real-time applications. An important additional result of this research is that, contradictory to previous studies, CF weighting does not lead to any improvement in lateral resolution.","180":null,"181":null,"182":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality that is based on optical absorption contrast, capable of revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of tissue at high spatial resolution and large imaging depths.

However, monitoring vascularity is quite challenging due to the lack of appropriate imaging techniques. Here, we describe a non-invasive imaging technique using optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) to track vascular changes in prostate cancer treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, DC101, on a mouse ear xenograft model. Approximately 1-3 days after the initial therapy, OR-PAM imaging detected tumor vascular changes such as reduced vessel tortuosity, decreased vessel diameter and homogenized intratumoral vessel distribution. These observations indicated vessel normalization, which was pathologically validated as increased fractional pericyte coverage, functional perfusion and drug delivery of the vessels. After four DC101 interventions, OR-PAM imaging eventually revealed intratumoral vessel regression. Therefore, OR-PAM imaging of the vasculature offers a promising method to study anti-angiogenic drug mechanisms of action in vivo and holds potential in monitoring and guiding anti-angiogenic therapy.","188":"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has many interesting advantages, such as deep imaging depth, high image resolution, and high contrast to intrinsic and extrinsic chromophores, enabling morphological, functional, and molecular imaging of living subjects.

We used MSPAI and non-negative independent component analysis (ICA) to unmix distinct signal sources in human carotid plaques blindly. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated on a plaque phantom with hemorrhage and cholesterol inclusions, and plaque endarterectomy samples ex vivo. Furthermore, the results were verified with histology using Masson's trichrome staining. Results showed that ICA could separate recent hemorrhages from old hemorrhages. Additionally, the signatures of cholesterol inclusion were also captured for the phantom experiment. Artifacts were successfully removed from signal sources. Histologic examinations showed high resemblance with the unmixed components and confirmed the morphologic distinction between recent and mature hemorrhages. In future pre-clinical studies, unmixing could be used for morphology assessment of intact human plaque samples.","192":null,"193":"Microvascular pressure drives perfusion in tissues but is difficult to measure. A method is proposed here to estimate relative pressures in microvessels using photoacoustic and ultrasound tracking of small vessels during calibrated tissue compression. A photoacoustic-ultrasound dual imaging transducer is used to directly compress on tissue in vivo. Photoacoustic signals from blood vessels diminish as an external load is applied and eventually reaches a minimum or vanishes when external pressure is sufficiently greater than the internal pressure. Two methods were proposed to estimate relative pressures. In the first approach, vessels were tracked during compression and when the vessel photoacoustic signals vanished below a set threshold, the internal pressures were assigned as the external loading pressure at the respective collapse point. In this approach pressures required to collapse vessel signatures completely were found to be much greater than physiological blood pressures. An alternative approach was to track the cross-sectional area of small vessels with changing external load and fitting the data to a known Shapiro model for thin-walled vessel compression. This approach produced estimates of internal pressures which were much more realistic. Both approaches produced the same rank-ordering of relative pressures of various vessels in vivo. Approaches thus far require future work to become fully quantitative but the present contributions represent steps towards this goal.","194":"Photoacoustic is an emerging biomedical imaging modality, which allows imaging optical absorbers in the tissue by acoustic detectors (light in - sound out).

The main merit of using matched filtering in continuous photoacoustics is the improvement in signal to noise ratio (SNR), but the correlation process may result in a loss of resolution. It is possible to enhance both SNR and resolution by matched-filtering and pulse compression with a frequency chirp. However, the theory behind the effect of the chirp parameters on both SNR and resolution is still not clear. In this paper, the one-dimensional theory of the photoacoustic radar with a pulse compressed linear frequency modulated sinusoidal laser chirp is developed. The effect of the chirp parameters on the corresponding photoacoustic signal is investigated, and guidelines for choosing the chirp parameters for resolution and SNR optimization are given based on theory and simulations. The results show that by judiciously manipulating the center frequency, bandwidth, and duration, the resolution and SNR can be easily enhanced.","197":"In ultrasound imaging, fully-developed speckle arises from the spatiotemporal superposition of pressure waves backscattered by randomly distributed scatterers. Speckle appearance is affected by the imaging system characteristics (lateral and axial resolution) and the random-like nature of the underlying tissue structure. In this work, we examine speckle formation in acoustic-resolution photoacoustic (PA) imaging using simulations and experiments. Numerical and physical phantoms were constructed to demonstrate that PA speckle carries information related to unresolved absorber structure in a manner similar to ultrasound speckle and unresolved scattering structures. A fractal-based model of the tumor vasculature was used to study PA speckle from unresolved cylindrical vessels. We show that speckle characteristics and the frequency content of PA signals can be used to monitor changes in average vessel size, linked to tumor growth. Experimental validation on murine tumors demonstrates that PA speckle can be utilized to characterize the unresolved vasculature in acoustic-resolution photoacoustic imaging.","198":"A variety of hematological diseases manifest in the bone marrow (BM), broadly characterized as BM failure (BMF). BMF can be caused by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which results in an expansion of hypoxic regions in the BM. Because of this hypoxic presentation, there is potential for improved characterization of BMF through in vivo assessment of oxygenation in the BM cavity.

An array of imaging technologies is considered for CVD diagnostics and therapeutic assessment, ranging from ultrasonography, X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to nuclear and optical imaging methods. Each method has different operational characteristics and assesses different aspects of CVD pathophysiology; nevertheless, more information is desirable for achieving a comprehensive view of the disease. Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging is an emerging modality promising to offer novel information on CVD parameters by allowing high-resolution imaging of optical contrast several centimeters deep inside tissue. Implemented with illumination at several wavelengths, multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) in particular, is sensitive to oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water and lipids allowing imaging of the vasculature, tissue oxygen saturation and metabolic or inflammatory parameters. Progress with fast-tuning lasers, parallel detection and advanced image reconstruction and data-processing algorithms have recently transformed optoacoustics from a laboratory tool to a promising modality for small animal and clinical imaging. We review progress with optoacoustic CVD imaging, highlight the research and diagnostic potential and current applications and discuss the advantages, limitations and possibilities for integration into clinical routine.","200":"Recently, an acoustic lens has been proposed for volumetric focusing as an alternative to conventional reconstruction algorithms in Photoacoustic (PA) Imaging. Acoustic lens can significantly reduce computational complexity and facilitate the implementation of real-time and cost-effective systems. However, due to the fixed focal length of the lens, the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the imaging system varies spatially. Furthermore, the PSF is asymmetric, with the lateral resolution being lower than the axial resolution. For many medical applications, such as in vivo thyroid, breast and small animal imaging, multiple views of the target tissue at varying angles are possible. This can be exploited to reduce the asymmetry and spatial variation of system the PSF with simple spatial compounding. In this article, we present a formulation and experimental evaluation of this technique. PSF improvement in terms of resolution and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) with the proposed spatial compounding is evaluated through simulation. Overall image quality improvement is demonstrated with experiments on phantom and ex vivo tissue. When multiple views are not possible, an alternative residual refocusing algorithm is proposed. The performances of these two methods, both separately and in conjunction, are compared and their practical implications are discussed.","201":"A dual modality microscopy with the highest imaging resolution reported so far based on reflection-mode photoacoustic and confocal fluorescence is presented in this study.

A major challenge lies in monitoring the blood supply to the new tissue following transplantation: the integration and neovascularization of scaffolds in vivo is critical to their functionality. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a laser-generated ultrasound-based technique that is particularly well suited to visualising microvasculature due to the high optical absorption of haemoglobin. Here, we describe an early proof-of-concept study in which PAI in widefield tomography mode is used to image biological, decellularized human tracheal scaffolds. We found that PAI allowed the longitudinal tracking of scaffold integration into subcutaneous murine tissue with high spatial resolution at depth over an extended period of time. The results of the study were consistent with post-imaging histological analyses, demonstrating that PAI can be used to non-invasively monitor the extent of vascularization in biological tissue-engineered scaffolds. We propose that this technique may be a valuable tool for studies designed to test interventions aimed at improving the speed and extent of scaffold neovascularization in tissue engineering. With technological refinement, it could also permit in vivo monitoring of revascularization in patients, for example to determine timing of heterotopic graft transfer.","204":null,"205":"With the capability of assessing high resolution optical contrast in soft tissues, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) can offer valuable structural and functional information of human joints, and hold potential for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of inflammatory arthritis.

One optical fiber is used for delivering the excitation light pulses. The other one serves as an acoustic delay line to relay the generated PA signal from the target to an outside ultrasound transducer. With the addition of suitable time delay, the original PA signal can be easily separated from the interference signals. To demonstrate this new design, a prototype probe was designed, fabricated and tested. The PA sensing performance was characterized with different concentration of black and red dye solutions. The testing results show that the PA sensing probe can provide good sensitivity and maintain high linearity over a wide range of concentrations.

Optoacoustic spectra confirm the contribution of surface dimer chains into the absorption of nanodiamonds in the long wavelength range. Optoacoustic and conventional absorption spectra of aqueous solutions of nanodiamond fractions after centrifugation (15300g) and ultracentrifugation (130000g) revealed a separation of a highly absorbing non-diamond sp2 phase.

However, spatially-varying chromophore concentrations cause the wavelength- and depth-dependent variations of the optical fluence, which degrades the accuracy of quantitative sPA imaging. This study introduces a depth-optimized method that determines an optimal wavelength set minimizing an inverse of the multiplication of absorption cross-section matrix and fluence matrix to minimize the errors in concentration estimation. This method assumes that the optical fluence distribution is known or can be attained otherwise. We used a Monte Carlo simulation of light propagation in tissue with various depths and concentrations of deoxy-\/oxy-hemoglobin.

The latter one is quantified by the instrument response function (IRF). The possibility of calculating the IRF from permeation curves measured at various volumetric flow rates of the carrier gas is examined. The results are in partial agreement with preliminary expectations: the dependency of the calculated IRF on the volumetric flow rate of the carrier gas indeed follows roughly the expected tendency; however it is not completely independent from the physical properties of the measured membrane sample. This discrepancy can most probably be attributed to the imperfect design of the applied permeation cell. Overall it is expected that the proposed method for determining the instrument transfer function is a valuable tool for improving the design of permeation measuring systems.","222":null,"223":null,"224":null,"225":null,"226":null,"227":"Optoacoustic imaging is a medical imaging modality that uses optical excitation and acoustic detection to generate images of tissue structures based up optical absorption within a tissue sample.

With its unique optical absorption contrast mechanism, PAT is inherently sensitive to the functional and molecular information of biological tissues, and thus has been widely used in preclinical and clinical studies. Among many functional capabilities of PAT, measuring blood oxygenation is arguably one of the most important applications, and has been widely performed in photoacoustic studies of brain functions, tumor hypoxia, wound healing, and cancer therapy. Yet, the complex optical conditions of biological tissues, especially the strong wavelength-dependent optical attenuation, have long hurdled the PAT measurement of blood oxygenation at depths beyond a few millimeters. A variety of PAT methods have been developed to improve the accuracy of blood oxygenation measurement, using novel laser illumination schemes, oxygen-sensitive fluorescent dyes, comprehensive mathematic models, or prior information provided by complementary imaging modalities.

Localised vibration tagging (LOVIT) retrieves OA signal from images that are acquired with and without a preceding ultrasonic pushing beam: Radiation force leads to a phase shift of signals coming from the focal area resulting in their visibility in a difference image, whereas clutter from outside the pushing beam is eliminated. Disadvantages of a single-focus approach are residual clutter from inside the pushing beam above the focus, and time-intensive scanning of the focus to retrieve a large field-of-view. To speed up acquisition, we propose to create multiple foci in parallel, forming comb-shaped ARF patterns. By subtracting OA images obtained with interleaved combs, this technique moreover results in greatly improved clutter reduction in phantoms mimicking optical, acoustic and elastic properties of breast tissue.","235":"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging may be advantageous as a safe, non-invasive imaging modality to image the carotid artery. However, calcification that accompanies atherosclerotic plaque is difficult to detect with PA due to the non-distinct optical absorption spectrum of hydroxyapatite.

All-optical LUS allows for flexible acquisition geometry and user-dependent data acquisition for high repeatability. We apply all-optical techniques to image an excised human carotid artery. Internal layers of the artery wall, enlargement of the vessel, and calcification are observed with higher resolution and reduced artifacts with nonconfocal LUS compared to confocal LUS.

DCE-US was chosen for this particular experiment because US is extremely sensitive to microbubble contrast agents and because microbubbles, like red blood cells but unlike currently available optical contrast agents, do not extravasate. Significant spatial correlations were revealed between the DCE-US properties and tumour blood-oxygen saturation and haemoglobin, as estimated using OAI.

One challenge when using normal one-dimensional (1D) probes and generating photoacoustic images is the limited-view problem, in which artefacts are observed due to the positions of the ultrasound transducers. In this study, we used a photoacoustic transmission matrix (PA-TM) for simulation and performed a verification test using a 1D probe and a phantom. The results confirmed that the eigenvalues of the PA-TM visualized the light absorber itself in the limited-view measurement system, which eliminates reconstruction artefacts and further scattering artefacts, and that visualization is possible by signal intensity amplification through further phase modulation.","252":"Non-invasive optoacoustic mapping of temperature in tissues with low blood content can be enabled by administering external contrast agents. Some important clinical applications of such approach include temperature mapping during thermal therapies in a prostate or a mammary gland.

In this work, we investigate how a key calibration parameter - the temperature of zero optoacoustic response (T0 ) - behaves in different environments simulating biological tissues augmented with either dissolved or particulate (nanoparticles) contrast agents. The observed behavior of T0 in ionic and molecular solutions suggests that in-vivo temperature mapping is feasible for contrast agents of this type, but requires knowledge of local concentrations. Oppositely, particulate contrast agents (plasmonic or carbon nanoparticles) demonstrated concentration-independent thermal behavior of optoacoustic response with T0 defined by the thermoelastic properties of the local environment.","253":"In the application of photoacoustic human infant brain imaging, debubbled ultrasound gel or water is commonly used as a couplant for ultrasonic transducers due to their acoustic properties.

It may also aid in improving the tomographic reconstruction accuracy by accounting for heterogeneous optical and acoustic tissue properties. In particular, when imaging through complex biological tissues, the real acoustic properties often deviate considerably from the idealized assumptions of homogenous conditions, which may lead to significant image artifacts if not properly accounted for. Although several methods have been proposed aiming at estimating and accounting for the complex acoustic properties in the image domain, accurate delineation of structures is often hindered by low contrast of the images and other artifacts produced due to incomplete tomographic coverage and heuristic assignment of the tissue properties during the reconstruction process. In this letter, we propose instead a signal domain analysis approach that retrieves acoustic properties of the object to be reconstructed from characteristic features of the detected optoacoustic signals prior to image reconstruction. Performance of the proposed method is first tested in simulation and experiment using two-dimensional tissue-mimicking phantoms. Significant improvements in the segmentation abilities and overall reconstructed image quality are further showcased in experimental cross-sectional data acquired from a human finger.","286":"Three-dimensional photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has gained considerable attention within the biomedical imaging community during the past decade. Detecting laser-induced photoacoustic waves by optical sensing techniques facilitates the idea of all-optical PAM (AOPAM), which is of particular interest as it provides unique advantages for achieving high spatial resolution using miniaturized embodiments of the imaging system. The review presents the technology aspects of optical-sensing techniques for ultrasound detection, such as those based on optical resonators, as well as system developments of all-optical photoacoustic systems including PAM, photoacoustic endoscopy, and multi-modality microscopy. The progress of different AOPAM systems and their representative applications are summarized.","287":"This paper considers the effect of an impedance mismatch between the absorber and its surroundings on the aborber reconstructions from the photoacoustic signal profile, in particular when a non-delta input pulse is used. A transfer function approach is taken, demonstrating in the case of impedance mismatch how the total response can be modeled using the sum of the mismatch-free response and its time-delayed, time-reversed replicas, which may or may not overlap. It is shown how this approach can be exploited to accommodate the effects of non-delta pulses and\/or pulse-equivalent waveforms such as linear-frequency-modulated (LFM) chirps, and impedance mismatches in any inversion algorithms, even in the presence of large reflection coefficients. As a consequence, for simple-absorber reconstruction algorithms that assume impulses or 'short enough' pulses, the compressive portion of the measured response may be used in reconstruction formulas that do not model the impedance mismatch, regardless of the size of the mismatch. For longer-duration input waveforms, it is demonstrated how existing reconstruction methods can be successfully adapted to include the effect of the impedance mismatch. Simulations are used to illustrate these ideas. The gained physical insight into how components of the generated pressure wave carry absorber information is then exploited for signal inversion and absorber reconstruction in the frequency domain when multi-frequency modulation chirps are used for photoacoustic radar pressure measurements. The foundational theoretical developments ultimately address impendance mismatch issues germane to the major photoacoustic frequency-domain imaging modality to-date, which is the photoacoustic radar.","288":"Influence of acoustic inhomogeneities and resulting reflection artifacts is an important problem in reflection-mode photoacoustic imaging. Absorption of light by skin and superficial optical absorbers will generate photoacoustic transients, which traverse into the tissue and get reflected from structures having different acoustic impedance. These reflected photoacoustic signals, when reconstructed, may appear in the region of interest, which causes difficulties in image interpretation. We propose a novel method to identify and potentially eliminate reflection artifacts in photoacoustic images using photoacoustic-guided focused ultrasound [PAFUSion]. Our method uses focused ultrasound pulses to mimic the wave field produced by photoacoustic sources and thus provides a way to identify reflection artifacts in clinical combined photoacoustic and pulse-echo ultrasound. Simulation and phantom results are presented to demonstrate the validity and impact of this method. Results show that PAFUSion can identify reflections in photoacoustic images and thus envisages potential for improving photoacoustic imaging of acoustically inhomogeneous tissue.","289":null,"290":"The underlying working principle of detecting impulsive stimulated scattering signals in a differential configuration of heterodyne diffraction detection is unraveled by involving optical scattering theory. The feasibility of the method for the thermoelastic characterization of coating-substrate systems is demonstrated on the basis of simulated data containing typical levels of noise. Besides the classical analysis of the photoacoustic part of the signals, which involves fitting surface acoustic wave dispersion curves, the photothermal part of the signals is analyzed by introducing thermal wave dispersion curves to represent and interpret their grating wavelength dependence. The intrinsic possibilities and limitations of both inverse problems are quantified by making use of least and most squares analysis. ","291":"Irradiation of an optically thin layer immersed in a transparent fluid with pulsed laser radiation can generate photoacoustic waves through two mechanisms. The first of these is the conventional optical heating of the layer followed by thermal expansion, in which the mechanical motion of the expansion launches a pair of oppositely directed sound waves. A second, recently reported mechanism, is operative when heat is conducted to the transparent medium raising its temperature, while at the same time reducing the temperature in the absorbing body. The latter mechanism has been shown to result in compressive transients at the leading edges of the photoacoustic waveforms. Here the photoacoustic effect produced by irradiating thin metal films which undergo negligible thermal expansion under optical irradiation, but which generate sound solely by the heat transfer mechanism is investigated. Solution to the wave equation for the photoacoustic effect from the heat transfer mechanism is given and compared with the results of experiments using nanosecond laser pulses to irradiate thin metal films.

Development of in vivo imaging techniques that can identify and monitor molecular composition of tumors remains an important challenge in pre-clinical research and medical practice. Here we present a molecular photoacoustic imaging technique that can visualize the presence and activity of an important cancer biomarker - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), utilizing the effect of plasmon resonance coupling between molecular targeted gold nanoparticles. Specifically, spectral analysis of photoacoustic images revealed profound changes in the optical absorption of systemically delivered EGFR-targeted gold nanospheres due to their molecular interactions with tumor cells overexpressing EGFR. In contrast, no changes in optical properties and, therefore, photoacoustic signal, were observed after systemic delivery of non-targeted gold nanoparticles to the tumors. The results indicate that multi-wavelength photoacoustic imaging augmented with molecularly targeted gold nanoparticles has the ability to monitor molecular specific interactions between nanoparticles and cell-surface receptors, allowing visualization of the presence and functional activity of tumor cells. Furthermore, the approach can be used for other cancer cell-surface receptors such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Therefore, ultrasound-guided molecular photoacoustic imaging can potentially aid in tumor diagnosis, selection of customized patient-specific treatment, and monitor the therapeutic progression and outcome in vivo. ","296":null,"297":"Integrating high contrast bubbles from ultrasound imaging with plasmonic absorbers from photoacoustic imaging is investigated. Nanoemulsion beads coated with gold nanopsheres (NEB-GNS) are excited with simultaneous light (transient heat at the GNS's) and ultrasound (rarefactional pressure) resulting in a phase transition achievable under different scenarios, enhancing laser-induced acoustic signals and enabling specific detection of nanoprobes at lower concentration. An automated platform allowed dual parameter scans of both pressure and laser fluence while recording broadband acoustic signals. Two types of NEB-GNS and individual GNS were investigated and showed the great potential of this technique to enhance photoacoustic\/acoustic signals. The NEB-GNS size distribution influences vaporization thresholds which can be reached at both permissible ultrasound and light exposures at deep penetration and at low concentrations of targets. This technique, called sono-photoacoustics, has great potential for targeted molecular imaging and therapy using compact nanoprobes with potentially high-penetrability into tissue. ","298":"Nanoparticles and molecular chromophores with strong optical absorption in the near-infrared spectral range can be used as contrast agents for optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity and enabling new applications of this novel and rapidly growing biomedical imaging technology. ","299":null,"300":"In tomographic optoacoustic imaging, multiple parameters related to both light and ultrasound propagation characteristics of the medium need to be adequately selected in order to accurately recover maps of local optical absorbance. Speed of sound in the imaged object and surrounding medium is a key parameter conventionally assumed to be uniform. Mismatch between the actual and predicted speed of sound values may lead to image distortions but can be mitigated by manual or automatic optimization based on metrics of image sharpness. Although some simple approaches based on metrics of image sharpness may readily mitigate distortions in the presence of highly contrasting and sharp image features, they may not provide an adequate performance for smooth signal variations as commonly present in realistic whole-body optoacoustic images from small animals. Thus, three new hybrid methods are suggested in this work, which are shown to outperform well-established autofocusing algorithms in mouse experiments in vivo. ","301":"We introduce optoacoustic tomographic imaging using intensity modulated light sources and collecting amplitude and phase information in the frequency domain. Imaging is performed at multiple modulation frequencies. The forward modeling uses the Green's function solution to the pressure wave equation in frequency domain and the resulting inverse problem is solved using regularized least squares minimization. We study the effect of the number of frequencies and of the bandwidth employed on the image quality achieved. The possibility of employing an all-frequency domain optoacoustic imaging for experimental measurements is studied as a function of noise. We conclude that frequency domain optoacoustic tomography may evolve to a practical experimental method using light intensity modulated sources, with advantages over time-domain optoacoustics. ","302":"A common side effect of medication is gastrointestinal intolerance. Symptoms can include reduced appetite, diarrhea, constipation, GI inflammation, nausea and vomiting. Such effects often have a dramatic impact on compliance with a treatment regimen. Therefore, characterization of GI tolerance is an important step when establishing a novel therapeutic approach. In this study, Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) is used to monitor gastrointestinal motility by in vivo whole body imaging in mice. MSOT combines high spatial and temporal resolution based on ultrasound detection with strong optical contrast in the near infrared. Animals were given Indocyanine Green (ICG) by oral gavage and imaged by MSOT to observe the fate of ICG in the gastrointestinal tract. Exponential decay of ICG signal was observed in the stomach in good correlation with ex vivo validation. We discuss how kinetic imaging in MSOT allows visualization of parameters unavailable to other imaging methods, both in 2D and 3D. ","303":null,"304":"Building on its high spatial resolution, deep penetration depth and excellent image contrast, 3D photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) has grown tremendously since its first publication in 2005. Integrating optical excitation and acoustic detection, PAM has broken through both the optical diffusion and optical diffraction limits. PAM has 100% relative sensitivity to optical absorption (i.e., a given percentage change in the optical absorption coefficient yields the same percentage change in the photoacoustic amplitude), and its ultimate detection sensitivity is limited only by thermal noise. Focusing on the engineering aspects of PAM, this Review discusses the detection sensitivity of PAM, compares the detection efficiency of different PAM designs, and summarizes the imaging performance of various endogenous and exogenous contrast agents. It then describes representative PAM applications with high detection sensitivity, and outlines paths to further improvement. ","305":"Surgical drainage of intracranial hematomas is often required within the first four hours after traumatic brain injury (TBI) to avoid death or severe disability. Although CT and MRI permit hematoma diagnosis, they can be used only at a major health-care facility. This delays hematoma diagnosis and therapy. We proposed to use an optoacoustic technique for rapid, noninvasive diagnosis of hematomas. In this study we developed a near-infrared OPO-based optoacoustic system for hematoma diagnosis and cerebral venous blood oxygenation monitoring in rats. A specially-designed blast device was used to inflict TBI in anesthetized rats. Optoacoustic signals were recorded from the superior sagittal sinus and hematomas that allowed for measurements of their oxygenations. These results indicate that the optoacoustic technique may be used for early diagnosis of hematomas and may provide important information for improving outcomes in patients with TBI. ","306":"Laser-ultrasonics is an attractive and powerful tool for the non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&amp;E) of composite materials. Current systems for non-contact detection of ultrasound have relatively low sensitivity compared to contact peizotransducers. They are also expensive, difficult to adjust, and strongly influenced by environmental noise. Moreover, laser-ultrasound (LU) systems typically launch only about 50 firings per second, much slower than the kHz level pulse repetition rate of conventional systems. As demonstrated here, most of these drawbacks can be eliminated by combining a new generation of compact, inexpensive, high repetition rate nanosecond fiber lasers with new developments in fiber telecommunication optics and an optimally designed balanced probe beam detector. In particular, a modified fiber-optic balanced Sagnac interferometer is presented as part of a LU pump-probe system for NDT&amp;E of aircraft composites. The performance of the all-optical system is demonstrated for a number of composite samples with different types and locations of inclusions.

We report on development of a portable clinical system for three-dimensional optoacoustic visualization of deep human tissues at video rate. Studies in human volunteers have demonstrated powerful performance in delivering high resolution volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT) images of tissue morphology and function, such as blood oxygenation parameters, in real time. Whilst most imaging modalities currently in clinical use are not able to deliver volumetric data with comparable time resolution, the presented imaging approach holds promise to attain new diagnostic and treatment monitoring value for multiple indications, such as cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, disorders related to the lymphatic system, breast lesions, arthritis and inflammation.

However, there are few imaging agents that offer both high signal intensity and biodegradation into small molecules. Here we describe a cellulose-based nanoparticle with peak photoacoustic signal at 700 nm and an in vitro limit of detection of 6 pM (0.02 mg\/mL). Doses down to 0.35 nM (1.2 mg\/mL) were used to image mouse models of ovarian cancer. Most importantly, the nanoparticles were shown to biodegrade in the presence of cellulase both through a glucose assay and electron microscopy.","315":"Corneal neovascularization leads to blurred vision, thus in vivo visualization is essential for pathological studies in animal models. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging can delineate microvasculature and hemodynamics noninvasively, which is suitable for investigating corneal neovascularization. In this study, we demonstrate in vivo imaging of corneal neovascularization in the mouse eye by optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM), where corneal neovascularization is induced by deliberate alkali burn injuries in C57BL6\/J inbred mice corneas on the left eye. We used OR-PAM to image five mice with corneal alkali burn injuries; the uninjured eyes (right eye) in these mice are then used as the controls. Corneal images acquired by OR-PAM with and without alkali burn injury are compared, clear signs of corneal neovascularization are present in the OR-PAM images of injured eyes; the OR-PAM results are also confirmed by postmortem fluorescence-labeled confocal microscopy.","316":"Photoacoustic (PA) detection of single absorbing targets such as nanoparticles or cells can be limited by absorption background. We show here that this problem can be overcome by using the nonlinear photoacoustics based on the differences in PA signal dependences on the laser energy from targets and background. Among different nonlinear phenomena, we focused on laser generation of nanobubbles as more efficient PA signal amplifiers from strongly absorbing, highly localized targets in the presence of spatially homogenous absorption background generating linear signals only. This approach was demonstrated by using nonlinear PA flow cytometry platform for label-free detection of circulating melanoma cells in blood background in vitro and in vivo. Nonlinearly amplified PA signals from overheated melanin nanoclusters in melanoma cells became detectable above still linear blood background. Nonlinear nanobubble-based photoacoustics provide new opportunities to significantly (5-20-fold) increase PA contrast of single nanoparticles, cells, viruses and bacteria in complex biological environments.","317":"By mapping the distribution of targeted plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs), photoacoustic (PA) imaging offers the potential to detect the pathologies in the early stages. However, optical absorption of the endogenous chromophores in the background tissue significantly reduces the contrast resolution of photoacoustic imaging. Previously, we introduced MPA imaging - a synergistic combination of magneto-motive ultrasound (MMUS) and PA imaging, and demonstrated MPA contrast enhancement using cell culture studies. In the current study, contrast enhancement was investigated in vivo using the magneto-photo-acoustic (MPA) imaging augmented with dual-contrast nanoparticles. Liposomal nanoparticles (LNPs) possessing both optical absorption and magnetic properties were injected into a murine tumor model. First, photoacoustic signals were generated from both the endogenous absorbers in the tissue and the liposomal nanoparticles in the tumor. Then, given significant differences in magnetic properties of tissue and LNPs, the magnetic response of LNPs (i.e. MMUS signal) was utilized to suppress the unwanted PA signals from the background tissue and thus improves the PA imaging contrast. In this study, we demonstrated the 3D MPA image of LNP-labeled xenografted tumor in a live animal. Compared to conventional PA imaging, the MPA images show significantly enhanced contrast between the nanoparticle-labeled tumor and the background tissue. Our results suggest the feasibility of MPA for high contrast in vivo mapping of dual-contrast nanoparticles.","318":"When ultrasonic transducers with large detecting areas and\/or compact measurement geometries are employed in photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), the spatial resolution of reconstructed images can be significantly degraded. Our goal in this work is to clarify the domain of validity of an imaging model that mitigates such effects by use of a far-field approximation. Computer-simulation studies are described that demonstrate the far-field-based imaging model is highly accurate for a practical 3D PACT imaging geometry employed in an existing small animal imaging system. For use in special cases where the far-field approximation is violated, an extension of the far-field-based imaging model is proposed that divides the transducer face into a small number of rectangular patches that are each described accurately by use of the far-field approximation.","319":"In this work, graphene nanoribbons and nanoplatelets were investigated as contrast agents for photoacoustic and thermoacoustic tomography (PAT and TAT). We show that oxidized single-and multi-walled graphene oxide nanoribbons (O-SWGNRs, O-MWGNRs) exhibit approximately 5-10 fold signal enhancement for PAT in comparison to blood at the wavelength of 755 nm, and approximately 10-28% signal enhancement for TAT in comparison to deionized (DI) water at 3 GHz. Oxidized graphite microparticles (O-GMPs) and exfoliated graphene oxide nanoplatelets (O-GNPs) show no significant signal enhancement for PAT, and approximately 12-29% signal enhancement for TAT. These results indicate that O-GNRs show promise as multi-modal PAT and TAT contrast agents, and that O-GNPs are suitable contrast agents for TAT.","320":null,"321":"Spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging has the potential to become a powerful tool that can estimate distributions of optically absorbing chromophores in the body. We have developed an algorithm to select imaging wavelengths for spectroscopic photoacoustics given the spectra of expected chromophores. The algorithm uses the smallest singular value of a matrix constructed from the absorption spectra as a criterion to remove extraneous wavelengths. The method performed significantly better than an approach where evenly spaced wavelengths were used in the presence of noise and wavelength-dependent attenuation of light in tissue. Finally, the algorithm was applied to photoacoustic imaging of a phantom containing indocyanine green dye and silica-coated gold nanorods, demonstrating significant improvements in the ability to estimate relative contrast agent concentrations compared to the case where evenly spaced wavelengths were chosen. In summary, our work provides a versatile framework to select optical wavelengths and evaluate sets of absorbers for spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging. ","322":"This paper investigates a novel method which allows clutter elimination in deep optoacoustic imaging. Clutter significantly limits imaging depth in clinical optoacoustic imaging, when irradiation optics and ultrasound detector are integrated in a handheld probe for flexible imaging of the human body. Strong optoacoustic transients generated at the irradiation site obscure weak signals from deep inside the tissue, either directly by propagating towards the probe, or via acoustic scattering. In this study we demonstrate that signals of interest can be distinguished from clutter by tagging them at the place of origin with localised tissue vibration induced by the acoustic radiation force in a focused ultrasonic beam. We show phantom results where this technique allowed almost full clutter elimination and thus strongly improved contrast for deep imaging. Localised vibration tagging by means of acoustic radiation force is especially promising for integration into ultrasound systems that already have implemented radiation force elastography. ","323":"We introduce a new acoustic lens material for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) to improve lateral resolution while possessing excellent acoustic acoustic impedance matching with tissue to minimize lens induced image artifacts. A large surface area detector due to its high sensitivity is preferable to detect weak signals in photoacoustic mammography. The lateral resolution is then limited by the narrow acceptance angle of such detectors. Acoustic lenses made of acrylic plastic (PMMA) have been used to enlarge the acceptance angle of such detectors and improve lateral resolution. However, such PMMA lenses introduce image artifacts due to internal reflections of ultrasound within the lenses, the result of acoustic impedance mismatch with the coupling medium or tissue. A new lens is proposed based on the 2-component resin Stycast 1090SI. We characterized the acoustic properties of the proposed lens material in comparison with commonly used PMMA, inspecting the speed of sound, acoustic attenuation and density. We fabricated acoustic lenses based on the new material and PMMA, and studied the effect of the acoustic lenses on detector performance comparing finite element (FEM) simulations and measurements of directional sensitivity, pulse-echo response and frequency response. We further investigated the effect of using the acoustic lenses on the image quality of a photoacoustic breast tomography system using k-Wave simulations and experiments. Our acoustic characterization shows that Stycast 1090SI has tissue-like acoustic impedance, high speed of sound and low acoustic attenuation. These acoustic properties ensure an excellent acoustic lens material to minimize the acoustic insertion loss. Both acoustic lenses show significant enlargement of detector acceptance angle and lateral resolution improvement from modeling and experiments. However, the image artifacts induced by the presence of an acoustic lens are reduced using the proposed lens compared to PMMA lens, due to the minimization of internal reflections. The proposed Stycast 1090SI acoustic lens improves the lateral resolution of photoacoustic tomography systems while not suffering from internal reflection-induced image artifacts compared a lens made of PMMA.
