The patient had pustular psoriasis for the last 12 years. During his hospital stay, he suffered sudden painless and profound loss of vision in both eyes. Subsequently, he was referred to an ophthalmologist. Slit lamp examination of both eyes revealed the presence of a clot in anterior chamber with neovascularization of the iris and the fibrovascular membrane covering the pupil and iris bombe formation nasally and inferiorly (Figure 2a). B-scan ultrasonography showed bilateral vitreous hemorrhage with normal optic nerve head in the right eye and an optic nerve cyst in the left eye (Figure 3). His erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 32.0 mm\/hour, while blood and urine screening tests along with review of other systems were found to be normal. The fundi were not visualized due to dense hemorrhage. There was no history of trauma, recent ocular surgery, diabetes, hypertension, hematologic abnormalities, and drug intake known to cause vitreous hemorrhage. Topical medication (eye drop atropine 1%, timolol 0.5%, moxifloxacin and dexamethasone combination) and oral prednisolone (60 mg per day for 2 weeks) were prescribed but were later withdrawn in view of no response and worsening of skin condition. In the past, he had received various treatments, including phototherapy, acitretin, methotrexate, apremilast, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil; however, his condition was recalcitrant.","5":"A 47-year-old man presented to the outpatient department with multiple asymptomatic, erythematous and violaceous, soft, dome-shaped papulonodular lesions that had been present for 3 years. The lesions were vascular and were about 1 cm in diameter. They were present over the face, trunk, arms and legs (Figures 1 and 2). The patient gave history of recurrent ascites and progressive difficulty in walking for last two years.","6":"","7":"","8":"Cumulative childhood sun damage increases skin cancer risk. Considerable childhood time is spent at school, posing an ideal site for sun safety intervention. Currently, national prevalence estimates of school district-level sun safety policies are limited. We evaluated the prevalence of sun safety policies in the US school districts and correlated with district-level factors using cross-sectional data from the 2012 and 2016 School Health Policies and Practices Study. The prevalence of sun safety policies among the US school districts was infrequent. In 2016, policies to schedule outdoor activities avoiding peak sun, allowing and encouraging use of sunscreen, and encouraging the use of protective attire were required by less than 5% of districts and remained unaddressed in 50%-75% of districts. Sun safety policies remain inadequately addressed in many US school districts and may contribute to preventable childhood sun damage. Implementing sun safety interventions in schools through more robust district-level regulations may more effectively reach students, allocate resources, and monitor implementation.","9":"Vesiculobullous disorders could be either immunobullous or non-immunobullous. The spectrum was analyzed using histopathology, direct immunofluorescence (DIF), and salt-split technique. Among the 104 patients analyzed, 77 (74%) were immunobullous and 25 (24%) were having non-immunobullous diseases. Bullous pemphigoid (20.2%) is the commonest among immunobullous lesions, and epidermolysis bullosa (11.5%) was the most frequent non-immunobullous lesion. Involvement of the hair and nail and a positive family history were common relationships for non-immunobullous disorders. Immunobullous lesions showed DIF positivity whereas non-immunobullous lesions were DIF negative. Perilesional DIF was more sensitive and specific than lesional DIF. The commonest antibody was immunoglobulin G (IgG) (78.9%) followed by complement 3c (C3c) (38.1%), immunoglobulin A (IgA) (25%), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (6.6%). No lesion should be considered non-immunobullous unless both lesional and perilesional DIF results were negative.","10":"Lockdown was enforced in many countries across the globe to flatten the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) curve. In these difficult times, people with skin diseases faced unique challenge, as major clinical facilities came to a standstill. Teledermatology helped to an extent to bridge this provider-seeker gap to an extent. We compiled data of patients seeking dermatology services during this period in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Most of the patients were middle-aged (70%) and had good access to teledermatology. Dermatoses were primarily due to frequent handwashing, use of alcohol-based sanitizers, excessive use of water (12.6%), improper skin care (43.3%), sun exposure (20.5%), lockdown-induced stress (22.04%), infections (15.75%), flare of preexisting diseases (8.66%), and hair disorders (11%). Many dermatoses had a causal overlap. Teledermatology proved to be useful for patients with skin diseases who were unable to access direct face-to-face consultations.","11":"Granuloma annulare (GA) is a cutaneous inflammatory disorder of unknown cause, typically characterized by an annular arrangement of dermal papules and nodules. While GA in adults has been linked to diabetes mellitus (DM) and other conditions, these associations have been less studied in children. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all pediatric patients diagnosed with GA at an urban academic institution over a 7-year period. A total of 47 patients were reviewed. Of these, 41 (85.1%) patients had localized GA, 3 (6.38%) had subcutaneous GA, 2 (4.26%) had generalized GA, and 1 (2.13%) had both localized and subcutaneous GA. The extremities were the most common site of involvement across all morphologies. Atopic conditions were determined in 23 (48.9%) patients, 16 (34.0%) of which had asthma, either alone or in conjunction with atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis. None of the patients carried a diagnosis of DM, and all 11 patients who were tested within 3 years of the documented visit had normal results. In summary, this retrospective series characterizes the presentation of pediatric GA and highlights a potential association with atopy. An association with DM was not observed.","12":"Human Papillomavirus is one of the most well-known pathogens having potential to cause both benign and malignant illnesses. The current controversy focuses on its continuity in non-epithelial tissues and the environment, and its ability to cause infection in these settings. This review addresses the virology aspects that contribute to its presence and resistance in humans and the environment.","13":null,"14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"A 42-year-old Latino man with a medical history of vitiligo presented to our outpatient clinic with a 25-year history of a recurrent, itchy eruption on his face and hands. Physical examination revealed pink, scaly, erythematous, lichenified papules and plaques with overlying crusts, photodistributed on the nose, chin, cheeks, hands, and ears (Figures 1a and 2a). The lips were edematous with hemorrhagic crusting, and conjunctival injection and partial corneal opacities were noted (Figures 1b-1c). Histologic evaluation demonstrated psoriasiform hyperplasia with hyper-granulosis and a superficial perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II typing was positive for HLA-DRB1*0407, thus confirming the diagnosis of actinic prurigo (AP).","19":"A 77-year-old man was referred to our department with a 6-month history of a painless, rapidly enlarging tumor on the left leg. Fourteen years ago, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and he had presented with lymphocytosis and multiple lymphadenopathies (Rai stage II). Both bone marrow aspiration and peripheral blood immunophenotyping identified a monoclonal B-cell population expressing surface CD5, CD20, CD23, CD43, and IgG kappa. At that time, he underwent eight courses of treatment with oral fludarabine, followed by complete remission, and he had been clinically stable ever since (Rai stage 0).","20":"A previously healthy 28-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and was found to have significant lymphadenopathy on her CT scan. A lymph node biopsy was performed; the pathology was consistent with a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma and the patient was noted to have multiple, wrinkled, nonscaly, oval-shaped papules that were easily compressible (Figure 1) and were present on the upper and lower extremities, abdomen, chest, and back. The lesions were entirely asymptomatic and had first developed 1 year prior to presentation. Since their initial development, the wrinkled papules had continued to crop up. Some of the lesions began as brownish-red papules and subsequently turned skin-colored.Punch biopsies of the lesional and unaffected skin were performed. A Verhoeff-Van Gieson (VVG) stain showed loss of dermal elastic tissue in the lesional skin, compared to that of the unaffected skin. The clinical and histologic examinations were consistent with the diagnosis of anetoderma.","21":"An 81-year-old man presented to the clinic with a 2.1 cm firm, skin-colored subcutaneous tumor on the left upper arm (Figure 1). The lesion arose at the site of a past smallpox vaccination and had been slowly enlarging for approximately 4 years. The differential diagnosis included sympastic leiomyoma, and a variety of desmoplastic spindle cell lesions such as desmoplastic melanoma, cutaneous spindle cell carcinoma, and desmoplastic leiomyosarcoma. Punch biopsy and immunohistochemical staining revealed positive spindle cells for desmin and caldesmon (Figures 2 and 3). Immunostain for p53 was also strongly and uniformly positive. Owing to poor circumscription on histopathology, symplastic leiomyosarcoma was ruled out. Demoplastic melanoma was also excluded due to positive immunoreaction to muscle markers (desmin and caldesmon) and negative S-100 staining. Additionally, cutaneous spinde cell carcinoma was also ruled out due to negative p63 and cytokeratin staining. Ultimately, clinicopathologic correlation favored a diagnosis of desmoplastic leiomyosarcoma. Staged excisions were performed to eradicate the lesion.","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"Erythroderma is a severe dermatologic manifestation of a variety of diseases. We analyzed the clinical parameters and the clinicopathologic correlation in patients with erythroderma. Consecutive patients diagnosed with erythroderma at a tertiary care institute were evaluated for 5 years. Detailed history and clinical examination were noted along with extensive hematologic and biochemical investigations, radiologic studies, and skin biopsy for histopathologic examination, and if required, for immunoflourescence and immunohistochemistry; 83 men and 17 women were included in the study. Based on microscopic findings, 34 patients were given a diagnosis of psoriasis, 28 of spongiotic dermatitis with predominant eosinophilic infiltrate, five of chronic actinic dermatitis, 18 of drug-induced erythroderma, three of pemphigus foliaceous, and two each of pityriasis rubra pilaris and erythrodermic mycosis fungoides. Histology was inconclusive in five cases, one each of psoriasis, dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, bullous pemphigoid, and drug eruption. Clinical-pathologic correlation occurred in 78.3% cases. The most common etiologies found in our study were psoriasis, airborne contact dermatitis, and drugs.","26":"Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can affect any part of the body, is often present in visible areas, and may occasionally be difficult to treat. Psoriasis can lead to depression and decreased quality of life. We performed a qualitative survey to examine patient perspectives on how psoriasis impacts their lives. Patients with psoriasis are vulnerable to embarrassment and stigmatization in public spaces, as well as discrimination at work, school, or in society. Further studies are needed to determine the best interventions for improving the quality of life in this patient population.","27":"We examined the prevalence and risk factors of anemia in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The presence of anemia and information on risk factors was obtained through interview, clinical examination, and blood samples in a cohort of 367 consecutive patients with HS. The overall prevalence of anemia was 9.3% (11.4% in men and 8.1% in women). Altogether 7.9%, 7.0%, and 20.4% of patients with Hurley stage I, II, and III were anemic, respectively. Risk factors for anemia included increasing age, nonwhite ethnicity, sporadic (nonfamilial) HS, concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), absence of hypertension, and absence of infected lesions in the preceding month. We found significant inverse correlations between hemoglobin level and inflammatory markers in the blood. There were significant correlations between hemoglobin and lipid levels, and between lipid levels and inflammatory markers. Hemoglobin levels are lower in patients with more severe HS and with more chronic inflammatory burden compared to those with less disease severity. Older age, nonwhite ethnicity, sporadic (nonfamilial) HS, and IBD are the risk factors of anemia.","28":null,"29":"Vitiligo, a disorder of depigmentation, has a profound psychosocial burden. Surgical techniques using transplantation of tissue grafts or melanocytes have long been used to correct vitiliginous macules, often utilizing noncultured epidermal suspension. This procedure has undergone a remarkable transformation from its original methods in terms of preparation of recipient site, concentration and separation of melanocytes, incubation, and cryofreezing.Vitiligo is an acquired hypomelanotic disorder characterized by depigmented and circumscribed macules or patches, with loss of melanin and functional melanocytes from the epidermis. There is a broad range of therapeutic options for vitiligo, including topical agents, ultraviolet therapy, oral therapy, and surgical modalities. Transplanting autologous melanocytes from a normally pigmented donor area to the depigmented skin forms a common principle in all surgical techniques-be it grafting at tissue level or cellular level.1Surgical modalities are further divided into tissue grafts and cellular grafts. Tissue grafting includes thin dermoepidermal grafts, punch grafts with full thickness, suction blister grafts, and epidermal harvesting systems. Cellular grafting employs noncultured epidermal suspensions and cultured melanocyte suspensions.1 The advantages of cellular grafting include large areas of depigmentation that can be treated with ease. In noncultured epidermal cell suspensions (NCES), keratinocytes are not separated from melanocytes, and they help to furnish factors that sustain and promote growth of melanocytes and homogeneity of repigmentation.2 A minimum density of melanocytes required for satisfactory repigmentation is 210-250 per mm.2,3.","30":"Resveratrol is a compound found abundantly in grapes' skin and red wine. It has recently become an increasingly popular ingredient of cosmeceuticals due to its reported anti-aging properties and inhibiting effects on melanogenesis. When compared to synthetic chemicals, natural ingredients, such as resveratrol, are often less expensive to produce and more widely available, which make them an attractive additive to skincare formulations. As resveratrol continues to gain commercial popularity, we reviewed the current literature regarding its background, biochemical mechanisms, and clinical data.","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":null,"35":"A 40-year-old man presented with pruritic perianal lesions existing for 18 months, accompanied by frequent burning sensation on defecating. He had received oral fluconazole 150 mg weekly for a presumptive diagnosis of candidosis earlier. There was no history of other mucocutaneous lesions or comorbidities. The patient denied any unprotected sexual exposure or having anal intercourse. Examination revealed a well-defined perianal, horseshoe-shaped, white-colored macerated plaque with fissures on the gluteal cleft (Figure 1) with tenderness. Examination of scalp, nail, and oral mucosa was unremarkable. Routine investigations, including complete blood counts and chemical profile, were within normal limits. His fasting glucose level was 85 mg\/ dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 5.3. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and 2 were nonreactive. A 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination was negative for fungal elements. Differential diagnoses of flexural psoriasis, Hailey-Hailey disease, and lichen sclerosus were considered, and a skin biopsy for pathology and direct immunofluorescence was performed. The pathologic features showed epidermal acanthosis, hyperkeratosis with elongated rete ridges, and focal hypogranulosis. The upper part of the dermis showed a moderate perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate with a few melanophages (Figure 2). Direct immunofluorescence was negative. Based on pathologic features, a diagnosis of psoriasis alba was confirmed, and the patient was started on desonide lotion (0.05%) to be applied in the morning and tacrolimus cream (0.1%) at night, plus oral antihistamines. At the follow-up visit 3 weeks later, the lesions diminished to a great extent (Figure 3).","36":"A 60-year-old Caucasian woman with a 15-year smoking history presented with new, asymptomatic, pink lesions that gradually appeared over a period of 6 weeks.

There is little epidemiologic information available on this disease in Latin America, including Colombia. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and describe the main demographic characteristics of HS in Colombia. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study using the code of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for HS (L732). For this study, data from the Comprehensive Social Protection Information System of the Ministry of Health of Colombia, which is the database on diagnoses made by physicians in all medical institutions of the country, were analyzed for the period 2013-2017. A total of 3,667 patients of HS were reported in Colombia, with a prevalence of 7.4\/100,000 inhabitants; 68% of the patients affected were women, with a woman to man ratio of 2.1:1. The highest prevalence was in the age group of 35-39 years. Among the departments of Colombia, the highest prevalence was in Caldas, with 17 patients per 100,000 inhabitants. Ours was the second study conducted in Latin America on the epidemiology of HS. We found a low prevalence of HS, which was even lower than that reported in studies from other countries.","42":"Trophic ulcer is a common disability in leprosy, recalcitrant to treatment. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a new technique for the treatment of trophic ulcer. A study was done to assess the efficacy of PRF in the treatment of trophic ulcer. Twenty-five patients of Wagner's Grade 2 trophic ulcer secondary to leprosy were enrolled. PRF was prepared and applied to ulcers and dressed; this was repeated weekly until complete healing or up to a maximum of six sittings. Ninety percent reduction in mean ulcer volume was seen at 6 weeks, with a mean healing time of 5 weeks. PRF is cost-effective, day care procedure with promising results in trophic ulcers.","43":"Earlobe keloids, although not a life-threatening disease, can severely impair a patient's quality of life. Contact cryosurgery is a safe technique for the management of earlobe keloids with tolerable side effects. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of contact cryosurgery in the treatment of earlobe keloids through a 1-year prospective study. We treated 15 Caucasian women ranging in age from 8 to 54 years with a total of 18 earlobe keloids. Excellent improvement was noted in 11 earlobe keloids, with a 75%-100% reduction in the volume of the keloids. An improvement ranging from 50% to 75% was observed in the seven other earlobe keloids. During the 18-month follow-up period, there was no evidence of bleeding, infection, recurrence, or permanent hypopigmentation. Two patients had a transient hypopigmentation which disappeared 2 months after the final session of contact cryosurgery. The results of our study highly encourage the use of contact cryosurgery which has tolerable side effects and high safety.","44":null,"45":"The exposure to cold can induce the development of wheals and angioedema in a group of susceptible individuals: this phenomenon is largely known as cold-induced urticaria. The pathogenesis of cold-induced urticaria is not yet understood, although both autoallergens and immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated autoimmunity are presumed to be involved. Flares of cold-induced urticaria might depend on the release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as Interleukin (IL)-1, which is the predominating stakeholder of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, a genetic disease characterized by cold-induced skin manifestations, including urticaria-like rashes. The majority of occurrence of cold-induced urticaria in children is idiopathic, but forms secondary to systemic conditions have been also reported. Primarily, the diagnosis remains a clinical process based on the history of patient, cold stimulation tests, and a few laboratory results, which could be useful for the excluding any underlying disorders. The general rules to manage cold-induced urticaria in children can be summarized with cold avoidance, treatment with nonsedating antihistamines, and the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab in selected patients. Familiar forms of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome could be prevented even in pediatric patients from the selective IL-1 blockade. Injectable epinephrine must be immediately used to manage the potential life-threatening manifestations occurring in a minority of children with cold-induced urticaria.","46":"Most conditions and diseases have one or more features that are essential for recognizing the most common presentations of the disease. Melanoma is a cancer of pigment-producing cells, and the term \"melanoma\" is derived from the Greek term for \"dark tumor.\" Many, if not most, descriptions of melanomas include their being in general dark brown or black; however, the most utilized set of criteria for melanoma education, the ABCDE (asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter &gt; 6mm, evolving) criteria, omits darkness as even one of the five emphasized features. A growing number of current approaches to melanoma recognition have addressed this need. In 2019, the Skin Cancer Foundation, for example, added that the \"D\" in the ABCDE mnemonic represents not just \"Diameter\" but also \"Dark\" (https:\/\/www.skincancer.org\/skin-cancer-information\/melanoma\/melanoma-warning-signs-and-images\/ Accessed April 5, 2020). The Georgia approach, for which this author advocates, includes an increase in emphasis on a screening look, with dark, different, and changing as screening features, as well as a \"D\" for \"Dark\" change in the ABCDE criteria.1 Given the number of new strategies for melanoma education being developed, it is a particularly appropriate time to review the logic and rationale of why darkness is an essential feature for recognition of melanoma.","47":"Dermatology publications have substantial untapped potential to improve patient care for all patients and communities.

Blinded, independent two-reviewer assessments of androgenic alopecia were performed based on the Hamilton-Norwood Hair Loss Scale. In all, 68 CEOs were included in this review, with 34 individuals each in the age groups of 50-59 and 60-69 years. Significant hair loss occurred in 18% (6\/34) of the CEOs aged 50-59 years and in 35% (12\/34) of those aged 60-69 years.

This study aimed to identify any associations between skin phototype and the histologic subtype, Breslow's thickness, and the site of melanoma. Patients diagnosed with melanoma for over an 18-month period were included. Data were gathered from the Malta National Cancer Registry. There were 167 registered cutaneous melanoma patients, of which 135 were included in the study. Melanomas in patients with skin phototypes I and II were more likely to be invasive than in situ when compared to patients with skin phototypes III and IV (P = 0.00027). There was also an association between skin phototype and histologic type of melanoma (P = 0.005), with melanoma in situ being the most common subtype in patients with skin type III. This study confirms that fairer skin phototypes have an increased risk of melanoma. It also shows that in our population, melanoma in skin phototypes I and II is more likely to be invasive rather than in situ compared to melanoma in darker skin phototypes. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and identify possible reasons.","59":"Dermatologists are at risk of occupational exposures to human papilloma virus (HPV); however, the required precautions during each treatment modality of warts are not standardized. A self-administered online survey to investigate awareness and current practice of precautions during treatment of warts among dermatologists in Saudi Arabia was administered. A total of 228 responses were received. The most commonly used procedures for genital\/other mucosal warts were liquid nitrogen (90%), electrocautery (57%), and in-clinic-administered podophyllin (51.3%). For cutaneous (non-genital) warts, the most commonly used methods for therapy were liquid nitrogen (95%) and electrocautery (77.6%). Of the respondents, 96% wore gloves while examining genital warts and 83.3% wore gloves while examining non-genital warts. The use of surgical masks during different procedures was variable from 27.7% to 76.7%. Only 38.6% always disinfected liquid nitrogen canister following use, while 49% always disinfected the electrocautery probe following use. Of the respondents, 34.65% had HPV infection, and of these, 55.7% developed warts during dermatology practice. There are variable precautions among dermatologists when dealing with HPV and further recommendations are warranted. As physicians, we gave our suggestions based on the literature review and our own opinions.","60":"Clostridium difficile infection is mainly the result of antibiotic usage which disturbs the normal microbial flora. Antibiotic-resistant strains of C. difficile have emerged which have limited the number of therapeutic options. We sought to determine if compound RNW03, a broad spectrum anti-microbial formula, would be effective in inhibiting C. difficile and its antibiotic-resistant subtypes. Compound RNW03 was titrated and added to standard concentrations of C. difficile. The wells were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 hours followed by a cell count. Compound RNW03 proved to be effective in preventing the growth of seven different C. difficile strains, including those that were antibiotic-resistant strains in dilutions of 32- to 64-fold.","61":"","62":"Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCis), also known as Bowen's disease, is a common superficial malignancy of the skin. Treatment of SCCis is important to prevent invasion into the dermis as well as metastases. Treatment of SCCis may be challenging based on the location of the tumor, advanced age, immunosuppression, medical comorbidities, or desire for noninvasive treatment. SCCis on the lower leg can be particularly challenging to treat due to poor wound healing in the setting of suboptimal circulation. This report reviews the evidence for various treatment options of SCCis, including their advantages, disadvantages, and efficacy, with an emphasis on treatment of SCCis of the lower extremity. Treatment options discussed in this contribution include wide local excision, Mohs micrographic surgery, cryotherapy, curettage, imiqimod, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorouracil and calcipotriol, ingenol mebutate, tazarotene, photodynamic therapy, acitretin, laser therapy, and radiotherapy.","63":"Although the US population is becoming increasingly diverse, diversity in medicine is lacking.

Two tumor suppressor genes, CET1 and CET2, involved in tissue growth and cell proliferation, show mutation in this disease, which leads to the appearance of various benign tumors, hamartomas. Clinical characteristics are more than three hypomelanotic macules, more than three angiofibromas or face or scalp cephalic fibrotic plaque, more than two ungual fibromas, shagreen plaque, multiple retinal hamartomas, etc. Treatment is basically symptomatic, and genetic counseling is very important.

The aim of this study was to prospectively show the alteration of sensitization and irritation reactions in acne patients undergoing 13-cRA therapy. This cross-sectional descriptive study consisted of 65 severe to refractory acne patients. The standard thin-layer rapid-use epicutaneous test (T.R.U.E. test) was used to screen sensitization and irritation reactions before and after 3-month 13-cRA treatment. Patch test results after 13-cRA therapy revealed an increase in newly formed sensitization and irritation reactions. Sensitization rate was significantly higher (43.1%) in the second patch test, when compared with the first patch test results (27.7%; P = 0.002). No statistical difference was found in irritation rates. In this study, the sensitization rate was higher after treatment, which could be attributed to the greater antigen penetration due to the disrupted barrier and\/or the upregulation of antigen-presenting activity in LC. This would cause a more prominent immune reaction to antigens. Based on these findings, we suggest that 13-cRA may have a sensitization effect, and physicians should be aware of this complication due to 13-cRA treatment.

It has a propensity for deep invasion but a low risk for distant metastasis. The classic presentation is a slowly progressive, painless, and erythematous to purpuric patch on the trunk or arms. A deep, subcutaneous punch biopsy or incisional biopsy should be performed for diagnosis in all suspected cases; wide undermining of the skin is to be avoided for minimizing the risk of tumor seeding and for retaining the feasibility of histopathologic examination of re-excisions. Histopathologic distinction of DFSP from dermatofibroma requires immunohistochemical assessment for CD34, factor XIIIa, nestin, apolipoprotein D, and cathepsin K. Management of this cutaneous sarcoma involves a multidisciplinary oncologic approach. Surgical excision is usually the first step in management. DFSP has a high propensity for local recurrence, even when surgical margins are negative; therefore, radiation therapy or rarely systemic therapy is recommended, especially for locally advanced or metastatic cases. The indolent nature of DFSP requires lifelong surveillance for recurrence; however, most recurrences occur within 3 years of the primary excision. The median time for the development of a local recurrence is estimated to be 32 months. An emerging theragnostic transmembrane receptor target, folate hydrolase-1 (FOLH1; prostate-specific membrane antigen), has been expressed in benign dermatofibromas and in high-grade sarcomatous phenotypes. These findings suggest that DFSP may also express FOLH1, which could allow for surveillance with FOLH1 PET\/CT and antibody-mediated brachytherapy.","138":null,"139":"Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated, genetically determined inflammatory disease, which afflicts the skin and joints.

Gordon Falknor, a podiatrist, first introduced the technique of needling for the treatment plantar warts in 1969. He reported only two recurrences in 126 patients treated with his technique. Falknor's technique involves using a hollow needle to repeatedly penetrate the base of a wart, into the subcutaneous tissue, until there is no longer resistance to puncturing. Needling causes extensive destruction of keratinocytes and the release of high levels of viral protein into the surrounding tissue. Deep penetration of this viral protein into the subcutaneous tissue increases the likelihood of developing a systemic immune response against the virus, which often results in the resolution of both satellite and distant warts in addition to the treated primary wart. Since Falknor's original study, there have been few studies on needling for warts. Despite the paucity of literature, needling appears to be a low-risk, inexpensive, and effective treatment for warts, especially in patients with extensive or refractory disease on the hands and feet.","177":"The introduction of biologic therapy has resulted in a major change in treatment efficacies, especially in conventional treatment-resistant psoriasis patients.

This interpretation has caused more than 50 years of confusion in the dermatologic literature. Unquestionably, the clinician sees more abnormal toenails than fingernails, and investigators have described a multitude of fungi as the cause of the clinically abnormal toenail. In 2010, developmental scientists proved, what we have long recognized, that there is no bilateral symmetry in living organisms and, therefore, one sole is different from the other. This causes a gait asymmetry, coupled with the pressure the closed shoe exerts on toenails while walking. This produces a series of abnormalities, which are clinically identical to what has been described for dermatophytic onychomycosis. These are fungus free and result in toenail niches. These toenail abnormalities were recently described as the asymmetric gait nail unit syndrome (AGNUS). It is possible that environmental fungi can colonize these toenail niches and, therefore, were described by investigators as a new onychomycosis entity In the normal host, onychomycosis should be only used to describe the active invasion of the nail bed (NB) corneocytes by a dermatophyte, as seen in dermatophytic onychomycosis. Dermatophytes only affect those hosts who have inherited the dermatophytosis susceptibility gene, transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In studies encompassing 3,000 abnormal toenails, only 27%-30% were found as dermatophyte culture positive, 25% were negative and the rest environmental fungi were recovered.","191":null,"192":"","193":"","194":null,"195":null,"196":null,"197":"Noninvasive vaginal rejuvenation (NVR) is a growing area of interest in dermatology.

Many of the deposition diseases resemble each other and can also be confused with disorders not related to deposition. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) results from dysfunction particularly in the fifth enzyme of the heme synthesis pathway, leading to increased skin fragility and bullae among other abnormalities. Ochronosis develops from alkaptonuria or exogenous sources, creating deposition of ocher-colored pigment in the skin. Hemochromatosis is a systemic disorder that can be inherited or acquired, altering skin pigmentation in more than 90% of patients. PCT can be an initial manifestation of hemochromatosis. Argyria is an acquired disorder of silver deposition that can also cause pigmentation similar to ochronosis.

In this study, we sought to determine SSI rates before and after employment of NSGs for dermatologic procedures. Infection data were collected from January 2009 to December 2015 on 7365 tumors treated with MMS and 1620 tumors treated by surgical excision. For MMS procedures using chlorhexidine as the antiseptic, the SSI rate with SGs was 3.39% compared to 3.06% with NSGs. For surgical excisions, the SSI rate was 3.02% with SGs and 4.17% with NSG. Using NSGs for MMS tumor resection and reconstruction can provide cost savings without adversely affecting SSI rates, and could also be considered in dermatologic procedures, including electrodessication and curettage and surgical excisions.","252":"","253":"","254":"","255":"","256":"","257":"","258":"","259":null,"260":"A 34-year-old man presented with a painless lesion of the glans present for more than 4 years.

Melanoma patients were more likely to practice sun-protective behaviors after their diagnosis. But it is not known how long these sun-protective behaviors will sustain. We aim to evaluate if sun-protective behaviors and likelihood of recent sunburn differ according to time elapsed since the melanoma diagnosis using the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Data in the NHANES cycle years 2003-2006 and 2010-2012 were analyzed. The relationship of sun-protective behaviors and likelihood of sunburns with the time since a melanoma diagnosis was evaluated and also adjusted for possible confounding factors such as age, gender, and skin reaction to the sun. A total of 34 participants with previous melanoma provided responses to their current sun-protective behaviors and recent occurrence of sunburns. The control group consisted of 13,871 participants who never had any diagnoses of malignancies. The control and the non-recent diagnosis groups were more likely to have sunburns but less likely to engage in consistent sun-protective behaviors compared to the recent diagnosis group. A multivariate regression model showed a 1.17 increased odds of having a recent sunburn for each additional year elapsed since a melanoma diagnosis ( p = 0.046).

During admission, a needle aspirate of the left leg cellulitis was performed to obtain fluid for culture to guide therapy. The patient was empirically started on vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours and managed by infectious diseases. The culture yielded no growth, however, and the patient was continued on vancomycin for 2 weeks, with resolution of his cellulitis. Two months later, the patient developed multiple painful nodules on his left leg and returned to the infectious disease physician who had managed him during his inpatient stay. He was initially treated with 2 weeks of clindamycin 300 mg twice daily (bid) without improvement. This was then followed by 2 weeks of erythromycin 500 mg every 6 hours, again without improvement.

Skin lesions followed a triphasic progression pattern from erythema to hyperpigmentation and then erosions. A symmetric and predominant flexural involvement was observed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) (38.9%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (38.9%) were the most frequently cultured bacteria from skin swabs. Complete resolution was evident in all cases, and the recurrence rate was 35%. In conclusion, a unique complication characterized by triphasic progression to painful erosions was found in a cluster of AD patients.

Laboratory tests are mandatory but have limitations, thus demanding continuous innovation. In our study, we took punch biopsies from lesions on 48 patients. Half of these biopsies underwent histopathologic investigation, and the other half were analysed using the BACT Alert 3D system, the Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test (AMTDT), and DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for the M. tuberculosis 16SrRNA complex. Patients were given antitubercular therapy for 6 weeks. A positive response was indicative of CT. Histopathology was suggestive, although no acid-fast bacilli could be demonstrated. In vitro culture recovery of M. tuberculosis was possible in six (12.5%); only two (4%) were positive on AMTDT, and 14 (29%) on real-time PCR. Regression of skin lesions was remarkable after antitubercular therapy, irrespective of a laboratory result. AMTDT and real-time PCR are seen to be of low value in the diagnosis of CT. They are limited by high cost, their paucibacillary nature, and technical errors. On comparing has AMTDT and PCR, the latter was found to be superior. High percentages of negative results were also investigated; extensive involvement of skin has yielded positive PCR results, probably due to low immunity and high bacterial load.","317":"","318":"","319":"We present the case of a 66-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, who presented with tender nodules on the forearms.

A case-control study was conducted on the medical records of all patients with skin infections who had had dermatoscopy performed over a period of 3 months. Our control participants were all patients with skin infections in two 3-month periods, and sex-pair-matched patients with the same infections, who had not undergone dermatoscopy. Records of 523 study subjects were analyzed. Our first new finding was that dermatoscopy brought forward the diagnosis of herpes zoster by 1.62 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.34 days; z-score -2.18). Second, dermatoscopy facilitated the diagnosis of genital (P&lt;.01) and small extragenital risk ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.59) viral warts. Third, patients with genital herpes and\/or genital warts and\/or genital molluscum contagiosum diagnosed by clinical examination and dermatoscopy were significantly more willing to pay US$300 to investigate for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.18), and bring partners for investigation (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.55), compared to patients diagnosed by clinical examination alone. We performed dermatoscope-guided laser ablation on viral warts, and dermatoscopy-guided excisional biopsy to confirm molluscum contagiosum. We conclude that dermatoscopy contributes to the diagnosis of some viral and bacterial infections. In addition, it may modify the help-seeking behaviour of patients with STIs.","328":"Previous studies have reported elevated homocysteine levels and folic acid and\/or vitamin B12 deficiencies after isotretinoin therapy, which increase the risk of cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. Homocysteine is metabolized in the liver, a process requiring folate and vitamin B12. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether folate and vitamin B12 replacement therapy with isotretinoin would be useful for preventing hyperhomocysteinemia. A total of 66 patients with acne were randomized into two groups: group A took isotretinoin, folic acid, and vitamin B12, whereas group B took isotretinoin alone. Treatment was continued for 2 months. Blood homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin B12 levels were measured before and after treatment. In group A, a significant decrease in homocysteine level was observed after treatment (P=.0004), although it was still within the normal range. Folic acid and vitamin B12 levels significantly increased (P=.0026 and P=.0002, respectively). In group B, no significant changes were observed in the levels of homocysteine and vitamin B12, but folic acid levels decreased significantly (P=.02). We concluded that folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation during isotretinoin therapy could be useful for preventing folate deficiency and improving blood homocysteine levels; this might as a result reduce the risks for cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders in patients taking isotretinoin.","329":"Calciphylaxis is a rare and severe syndrome of vascular calcification with unclear pathogenesis. This disease mainly affects patients with end-stage renal disease; however, it also has been described in nonuremic patients.

These cases support the literature suggesting that bisphosphonates and sodium thiosulfate are effective drugs in the treatment of calciphylaxis regardless of renal function.","330":null,"331":"The crucial role sunscreen plays in preventing sunburns, photoaging, and skin cancer is unquestionable, and as a result, it is incumbent upon dermatologists to influence patients to appropriately use sunscreens. In addition to explaining the benefits of sunscreen use and how to properly use sunscreen, dermatologists must also address possible barriers or concerns that patients may have regarding sunscreen. One concern that has gained increasing media attention in the recent years has been the environmental impact of sunscreens, especially the impact on coral reefs. There is strong evidence that some sunscreen ingredients, especially oxybenzone, are harmful to corals if the concentration in water is high. In some situations, primarily related to the number of swimmers and the geography of the shoreline, concentrations of oxybenzone far exceed the levels shown to be harmful to corals. As advocates for our patients' skin health, we need to be prepared to address this issue when asked, so that patients do not forgo sunscreen use in an effort to protect corals. This article will review evidence regarding the effects of sunscreen ingredients on corals and will provide practical guidance for counseling patients on how to select sunscreens that minimize the potential for harm to coral reefs.","332":"As primary care providers and experts on diseases affecting the skin, such as herpes zoster (shingles) and human papillomavirus-related cancers, dermatologists are often asked to make important recommendations on vaccines and vaccinations; however, a rise in antivaccine attitudes-sometimes referred to as \"vaccine hesitancy\"-among patient populations, especially in North America and Europe, has created new challenges for the practicing dermatologist.

The clinical manifestations had started 24 hours after taking 100 mg of doxycycline for acute bronchitis. She had no history of allergic disease or allergic reactions to drugs. The dermatologic examination revealed multiple erythematous, purplish annular patches with overlying bullae with hemorrhagic content on both palms (Figure 1). The patient had no fever, and the rest of the physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Results of laboratory tests were within normal limits. A skin biopsy was performed, showing hydrophic degenerations of the basal membrane, a superficial perivascular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and red blood cells in the dermis (Figure 2). A pharmacovigilance investigation was conducted, and doxycycline was confirmed as the agent responsible for the bullous fixed drug eruption (FDE) in our patient.","336":"A 78-year-old woman with a history of bilateral hip replacements presented with an ill-defined erythematous plaque with foci of reticulated and indurated areas on the left thigh. Initially, a few weeks after her surgery, a small area of erythema appeared overlying the incision site. Over a 6-month period, the erythema slowly expanded before stabilizing in size (Figure 1). There was no pruritus, pain, or warmth. Orthopedic evaluation found no evidence of infection or malfunction of the hip prosthesis. A skin biopsy revealed telangiectasia of the superficial vessels. Based on the clinical and histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of reticular telangiectatic erythema (RTE) was established. An ultrasound scan revealed a greater trochanteric bursa distended by a chronic, organized hematoma measuring 12 cm at greatest dimension, secondary to a full-thickness tear of the left gluteus minimus (Figure 2), establishing the underlying cause of the RTE in this patient.","337":null,"338":"","339":"","340":"","341":null,"342":"","343":"Antimicrobial resistance to Cutibacterium acnes has become a worldwide problem in the last century, but there are no previous studies on antibiotic susceptibility patterns of this bacterium in Ecuador.

He had had right-sided segmental vitiligo (SV) for the previous 7 to 8 years (Figure 1A), and this had started to cross the midline, covering a margin over the left side of the chest and back. This coincided with the onset and spread of the hyperpigmented patches. He denied any history of drug intake, or history of inflammatory dermatoses at either the vitiliginous or the hyperpigmented sites.","352":"Dermatology was consulted in the care of a 58-year-old man with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a positive purified protein derivative test, and a lack of bathing for approximately 4 years who had been admitted to the hospital because of thick, crusted lesions over an increasing portion of his body. Admitted involuntarily, he was disinterested in the history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. Comorbid schizophrenia presented a unique challenge because he was unable to participate in his care effectively. His story was told through caregivers. Although mostly compliant, the patient was reserved and indifferent, and had little to add even with direct questions.","353":"38-year-old married woman presented with multiple spontaneous painful ulcers that had involved both forearms for the previous month, along with a single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with no residual palsy or paresis. She complained of photosensitivity and diffuse hair loss for the past 6 months. She also had had arthralgia for the previous 3 years, which had initially involved the small joints of the fingers (especially the proximal interphalangeal joints) and gradually progressed to involve the larger joints. There was no history of recurrent oral ulcers, psychosis, thromboembolic events, or any other skin lesions. Two years previously, she had taken antitubercular treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis.","354":"78-year-old man presented with complaints of progressive nasal blockage and epistaxis over the previous 2 months. Clinical examination revealed a nodular, polypoid, ulcerated nonpigmented tumor filling the right nasal cavity (Figure 1). A punch biopsy was taken from the mass for histopathologic examination, which revealed many melanocytes in the submucosa. The stroma contained large numbers of spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic spindleoid nuclei (Figure 2), confirming the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The tumor cells stained positive for melan-A (Figure 3) and HMB-45.","355":"","356":"","357":"Surgical management of benign or malignant cutaneous tumors may result in noticeable scars that are of great concern to patients, regardless of sex, age, or ethnicity. Techniques to optimize surgical scars are discussed in this three-part review. Part 3 focuses on scar revision for erythema, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation. Scar revision options for erythematous scars include moist exposed burn ointment (MEBO), onion extract, silicone, methyl aminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), pulsed dye laser, intense pulsed light (IPL), and nonablative fractional lasers. Hyperpigmented scars may be treated with tyrosinase inhibitors, IPL, and nonablative fractional lasers. Hypopigmented scars may be treated with needle dermabrasion, medical tattoos, autologous cell transplantation, prostaglandin analogues, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors, excimer laser, and nonablative fractional lasers.","358":"Basal cell carcinoma of the buttock is rare, and only 28 patients have been described. An extensive literature search was performed on basal cell carcinoma and buttock using the PubMed database. The literature was evaluated, and the characteristics of individuals with basal cell carcinoma of the buttock were summarized. The calculated prevalence of basal cell carcinoma of the buttock was 0.35%. The majority of patients had no obvious basal cell carcinoma-associated risk factors. Carcinomas were observed 1.2 times more often in women than in men, and more often on the right buttock. They frequently presented as an asymptomatic nodule. The buttock tumor was typically associated with a nodular histologic subtype of basal cell carcinoma. The prognosis for these patients was excellent after complete removal of the tumor. In conclusion, basal cell carcinoma of the buttock is a rare clinical variant of this type of skin cancer that usually presented as an asymptomatic nodule in an individual who did not have any traditional risk factors for this malignancy. The cancer was typically associated with a nonaggressive histologic subtype. Recurrence or metastasis was not observed after treatment of the primary tumor.","359":null,"360":"Footwear contact dermatitis is a common problem with multifactorial exogenous, as well as endogenous, etiologies. Patch testing is the gold standard for detection of the possible contactants. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 108 outpatients over a period of 18 months. Demographic data comprising age, sex, and occupation were collected. Details of clinical and laboratory investigations were used to define the incriminating ingredient(s), subsequently confirmed by patch test using Indian standard and footwear series approved by the Contact and Occupational Dermatitis Forum of India. Reading and interpretation were carried out according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG) guidelines. Of the 108 patients, 64 were girls or women and 44 boys or men. Although footwear contact dermatitis affected all age groups, most individuals were 21 to 40 years old. The morphology and distribution of the lesions were very specific. Patch testing was helpful, the primary sensitizing agent being mercapto mix, followed by mercaptobenzothiazole, potassium dichromate, and paraphenylenediamine. Footwear contact dermatitis is an extraordinary entity, requiring a high level of expertise (or knowledge) to determine its etiology through history, clinical examination, and patch testing.","361":"","362":null,"363":"A 75-year-old man had been monitoring his glucose using a blood glucose monitoring system at the same body site for at least 20 years (&gt;7300 needlesticks). The asymptomatic skin lesion had been present for many years. He used the same site because it hurt less than the fingers and bled well. His medical history was remarkable for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a pacemaker. His medications included glipizide, metformin, carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, amlodipine, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Physical examination revealed a brown, slightly raised, rough plaque with focal, punctate hemorrhagic crusts, on the distal area of the right thigh (Figure 1). The clinical differential diagnosis was more likely to be lichen simplex chronicus than pigmented Bowen's disease. A skin biopsy demonstrated an acanthotic epidermis with coarse collagen bundles in a thickened papillary dermis with extravasated erythrocytes, consistent with a dermal reparative reaction (Figure 2).","364":"An otherwise healthy man in his 50s presented complaining of pruritic lesions on the left side of his scalp. The lesions had slowly been growing in size over the preceding 30 years. They would occasionally bleed, and this is what ultimately prompted him to seek medical advice. Physical examination revealed multiple aggregated and soft, flesh-colored nodules on the left posterior auricular area of the scalp (Figure 1). No appreciable clinical lymphadenopathy was identified on examination. A shave biopsy of one of the nodules was performed for diagnostic clarification.","365":"A 52-year-old man was admitted for clinical counseling at the Campus Bio-Medico in Rome in the early days of August 2017. He presented with multiple erythemato-hemorrhagic papules localized on the abdomen (Figure 1), back, arms, and thighs (Figure 2). The wide eruption was characterized by an intense reddish color that disappeared with diascopy. The patient stated that the eruption had appeared overnight after helping his mother-in-law dispose of a piece of antique furniture from her country villa the previous afternoon. Unexpectedly for the patient, the eruption did not cause intense itching during the night (it became more severe upon waking the next morning), and it did not affect his wife.","366":null,"367":null,"368":"An 11-year-old girl presented with an insidiously evolving, reddish-brown, small, hard, elevated lesion, occupying the midsection of her face, which had been present since early childhood.

The role of cortisol in autoimmune diseases is well known; yet studies on this subject are controversial. In this study, the salivary flow rate and salivary cortisol level were compared among subtypes of OLP. This study involved three groups of patients: (1) 11 with reticular OLP, (2) 20 with atrophic-erosive OLP, and (3) 30 with no apparent oral lesion. The salivary flow rate in the control group was significantly higher than in OLP patients. The mean level of cortisol in atrophic-erosive cases was higher than in reticular cases and in the control group; however, there was no significant difference between the three study groups. In a previous study, there was moderate to severe acinar atrophy in two-thirds of patients with OLP, which may explain the decreased salivary flow rate in these patients.","378":"We describe two cases of cutaneous eruptions of pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) arising after exposure to medications not previously reported in the literature as causing these reactions. Specifically, two women had biopsy-proven PPDs, one after exposure to an over-the-counter iodine supplement marketed as an extract from \"Norwegian kelp,\" and the other after intraocular injections of pegaptanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. The eruption occurred shortly after beginning the medication and resolved upon discontinuation.

His nails were also hyperpigmented. In addition, he had been coughing and had a fever, each present for a month. Significant laboratory studies included mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.6 gm%) and leukocytosis of 20,800. A chest x-ray was suggestive of interstitial lung disease. Similar lesions were present on his two siblings and parents. Additionally, his father had developed multiple, acne-like lesions, large abscesses, palmar and plantar peeling, and severe jaundice with hepatic failure.

The urticaria was accompanied by variable episodes of transient facial swelling and difficulty breathing. The patient noted that exposure to fish, nuts, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs triggered facial swelling. Other reported findings included a 5-year history of diarrhea, sense of memory deterioration, concentration difficulties, and clinical manifestations of anomic aphasia. Although her allergy testing was \"negative,\" she had been given the diagnoses of lactose intolerance and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Laboratory studies on initial presentation were significant for a positive history of antithyroperoxidase antibodies and elevated total complement activity. Medications included budesonide\/formoterol, fluticasone\/salmeterol, levothyroxine, albuterol, and fexofenadine 180 mg twice daily.

It has a key position in wound healing and tissue repair processes owing to its ability to maintain a humid environment favorable to healing and the stimulation of growth factors, cellular constituents, and the migration of various cells essential for healing. This review aims to describe briefly the physical, chemical, and biologic properties of HA, together with some details of the dermatologic indications of this unique molecule.","398":"Itch is frequently associated with dermatoses characterized by a defective skin barrier. We formulated an itch-relieving moisturizing cream containing 3% menthol and ceramides. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and antipruritic efficacy of application of this cream in volunteers with and without skin diseases. Volunteers were asked to apply the cream for 1 month on a minimum body surface area of 6%. Safety was assessed by the absence of contact dermatitis or other side effects, using a self-administered questionnaire completed at 5 minutes, 1 week, and 1 month after application. To determine efficacy, volunteers with pruritic dermatoses were asked to grade their average itch intensity at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month after application. Sixty volunteers were recruited, of whom 41 had no skin disease; no adverse events were reported in the latter. Of the 19 volunteers with dermatoses, 18 reportedly had atopic dermatitis. One of the 60 volunteers stopped application due to stinging sensations induced by menthol. Itch scores of volunteers with dermatitis improved from baseline at 1 week (P=.01) and 1 month (P&lt;.01) after application. Application of a 3% menthol-containing moisturizing cream was safe in healthy individuals and participants with dermatitis. In the latter, itch scores were significantly reduced during follow-up.","399":"Few studies provide qualitative data on the acne treatment experience. This study describes patients' personal experiences of acne treatment. Video interviews were made of 27 teenagers and young adults with acne treated for 12 weeks with adapalene\/benzoyl peroxide gel. Transcripts were then coded and qualitatively analyzed. Four thematic domains affecting quality of life and experience were identified: clinical manifestations, self-perception, social placement, and perception of control. Successful treatment increased self-esteem and performance at work and school. Successful acne treatment improves patients' quality of life by improving appearance and self-perception, satisfaction with social placement, and perception of control.","400":"Oral mucosal lesions (OMLs) present with a variety of manifestations, emanating largely from tobacco chewing, smoking, and consumption of alcohol. Evolution of the lesions may be facilitated by poor oral hygiene and restorative dental materials, as well as by trauma, infections, and immune-mediated diseases. Two hundred consecutive patients seen at a pre-eminent dermatologic clinic formed the study group. They were interviewed about clinical manifestations, duration of the lesion, patient's age and sex, and incriminating factors. After informed consent had been gained, a thorough clinical examination was performed to define the precise morphology, site, and distribution of lesions. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by histopathology and other relevant techniques was confirmed.","401":"Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, but has been associated with various diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). This study analyzes serum vitamin D in pediatric medical center patients with AD and potential confounding factors. At Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, charts of 665 children with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels taken between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Defining vitamin D deficiency as &lt;20 ng\/mL, neither average 25-hydroxyvitamin D nor deficiency prevalence varied among disease groups, except for cystic fibrosis (CF), which demonstrated significantly higher average vitamin D and lower deficiency prevalence. Children with AD had the lowest prevalence of vitamin D sufficiency, without significant association with disease severity. No seasonal variation was detected. Strong correlations were observed between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, body mass index (BMI), and race. Our data showed no strong association between vitamin D levels and AD or AD severity. A strong association was noted between skin type and BMI. The lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among children with CF may be explained by lighter skin and lower BMI. A high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency as currently defined among children with dark skin and high BMI suggests a need to reevaluate normal vitamin D levels in these populations.","402":"","403":"","404":"","405":"70-year-old white man presented with a 6-week history of an acute pruritic eruption in the axillary vaults, inguinal folds, and central lumbar area. Due to the severity of the pruritus, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department. He was treated with intramuscular triamcinolone, oral fluconazole, clobetasol cream, and miconazole powder, which provided only minimal relief. The patient had presented with brightly erythematous patches in the axillary vaults and inguinal folds with numerous erythematous, scaly, coalescing papules and plaques agminated on the lumbar region (Figure). Due to persistence, despite topical corticosteroids, an allergic contact dermatitis was suspected so patch-testing using the T.R.U.E. Test (SMARTPractice Denmark ApS, Hillerod, Denmark) epicutaneous system was conducted. Results were positive for 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothazolinone (panel 2.1, #17), budesonide (panel 3.1, #30), and 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, also known as bronopol (panel 3.1, #36).

The patient underwent transurethral resection of the bladder with diagnosis of melanoma.","407":"The first patient was a 41-year-old white man who was referred to the dermatology clinic with a 2-year history of numerous erythematous, hypoesthetic, poorly demarcated papules and plaques present on the trunk, buttocks, and bilateral upper and lower extremities (Figures 1 and 2). The lesions had initially begun as localized erythematous plaques on the right flank, and were diagnosed and treated as cellulitis and allergic contact dermatitis by primary care on separate occasions, with no resolution and continued gradual but persistent spread.","408":"A 40-year-old woman presented with multiple itchy violaceous papules and plaques on the medial aspects of both thighs. This was accompanied by a burning sensation on friction and increased itching that interfered with her daily activities, particularly in the summer. The family history was noncontributory. Cutaneous examination showed multiple flat-topped hyperkeratotic violaceous papules and plaques, appearing in linear fashion on the medial aspects of the thighs bilaterally (Figure 1). Histopathologic examination showed acanthosis, widespread suprabasal acantholysis resembling a \"dilapidated brick wall,\" without any evidence of dyskeratosis. There was a mild dermal perivascular infiltrate (Figure 2). On the basis of the clinical and histologic findings, she was diagnosed as having localized Hailey-Hailey disease. She was treated conservatively with topical corticosteroids and antimicrobials. She was also advised to lose weight, to avoid friction, and to wear loose-fitting cotton garments. There was marked symptomatic relief, and the lesion showed mild improvement over the next 2 months.","409":"A 79-year-old Chinese man presented with a 2-month history of pruritic, tender ulceration covering his perianal region. He was initially treated with oral amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid and vancyclovir, with no improvement. His history included hypertension.

Treating keloids is often difficult, and suboptimal responses are frequent. Fortunately, there are many treatment options available to the clinician that may lead to improved clinical outcomes. We present a review of currently available therapeutic options. Intralesional steroid injection remains the first-line treatment for keloids. Imiquimod, direct interferon therapy, or intralesional 5-flurouracil may alleviate the need for excessive corticosteroid therapy. Radiation and laser therapy are emerging therapeutic options that have demonstrated efficacy in reviewed studies. Given the unsatisfactory outcomes associated with pressure dressings, vitamin E, ablative laser, and surgical excision, these options should be avoided in keloid management. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and recurrence associated with the reviewed therapeutics.","415":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of the pre-eminent tumors of the epidermis, recognized by explicit clinical-pathologic characteristics. It is relatively uncommon in South Asia including India and is amenable to a variety of modalities, including cryosurgery. The outcome of cryosurgery was evaluated in 18 men and 11 women, aged 58 to 83 years, who were treated with two freeze-thaw cycles of liquid nitrogen under local anesthesia, after requisite preparations. Of the 29 patients, 27 had complete clearance of the lesions in the course of 3 years of follow-up, while only 2 had a recurrence, one at 17 months and one at 23 months. Recurrences were treated with a repeat cryosurgery, with a cure rate of 93%. Cryosurgery is a simple, inexpensive, and dermatologist-friendly office procedure with a high cure rates for well-defined facial BCC lesions.","416":"More men are beginning to take advantage of opportunities to improve the health and appearance of their skin; however, the effectiveness of men's skincare regimens has not been well studied. The authors investigated the efficacy and tolerance of a twice-daily, three-step men's skincare regimen in improving skin appearance and reducing shave-related issues. Twenty-nine men who used a wet-shaving method completed a specific, three-step, twice-daily facial regimen-a Shave Cleanser, a Post-Shave Treatment, and Day Protection-in place of their usual routine for 4 weeks. This skincare regimen produced significant improvements in tactile smoothness, clarity, radiance, and pore size at weeks 2 and 4 and in fine lines, razor burn, and photodamage at week 4 (P&lt;.05). Significant improvements were seen in the appearance of nicks\/cuts and folliculitis of the face and neck after weeks 2 and 4 (P&lt;.05). Mean change in the moisture content of the stratum corneum was significant at week 4 (P&lt;.05). The majority of men provided positive self-assessments and indicated an interest in continuing this regimen.","417":"Angiokeratomas are benign vascular lesions characterized by ectatic blood vessels in the papillary dermis with overlying acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, often occurring as idiopathic scrotal tumor and rarely as penile lesions. Twelve men, including our case of a 58-year-old white man, have been reported with angiokeratomas of the glans penis. The lesions typically present as asymptomatic dome-shaped papules ranging in size from 0.5 to 5 mm and present as red, purple, blue, or black lesions along the penile coronal rim. Histopathologic examination of the lesions reveals dilated, thin-walled vascular structures in the upper portion of the dermis with overlying acanthosis and\/or hyperkeratosis. Such angiokeratomas may have a multifactorial etiology with elevations in local venous pressure, degeneration of elastic tissue, and\/or capillary injury. Biopsy would exclude a melanocytic lesion, particularly melanoma. Laser surgery is an option for patients presenting with multiple lesions or lesions that coalesce to form a plaque.","418":"Alopecia is typically viewed as a localized process, and comorbidities are not usually analyzed. The authors examine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients attending an alopecia clinic during a 3-month period. The data showed that 79% of patients had vitamin D deficiency, and the average value of low vitamin D was 19.1 mg\/mL in patients. Vitamin D levels have not been examined extensively in skin disorders, and it is not clear whether vitamin D levels are correlative or causative in alopecia. The co-occurrence of both findings at such a dramatic level suggests the need for evaluation of this laboratory value in the alopecia population.","419":"Oral lichen planus (OLP), a well-known entity, is often neglected; however, its assessment is considered essential for evolving future strategies for treatment. Thirty-three patients with OLP from 200 consecutive patients with oral mucosal lesions were studied according to demography. Tobacco chewing, smoking, and alcohol intake were recorded. Examination of the oral cavity, using a head light and tongue depressor, was undertaken to define the morphology of the lesion(s). Colored photographs were an essential part of the process. OLP, a frequently encountered manifestation of oral mucosal lesions, was responsible for 16.50% of the total number of lesions. There was a preponderance of lesions in women aged 40 to 59 years, in contrast to men in the same age group. The duration of the lesions was variable, and tobacco chewing\/smoking and amalgam fillings might have exacerbated them. Morphology ranged from a reticular, erythematous pattern to an erosive one. The diagnosis is largely clinical, but it can be confirmed by histopathology.","420":"","421":"","422":"","423":"","424":"A 34-year-old man from Djibouti presented with a 14-year history of relapsing and remitting transverse white bands on the fingernails with sparing of the toenails. Examination revealed several transverse, white bands following the contour of the lunula on seven of his fingernails that did not fade upon compression of the digits (Figure). There was no onycholysis. No other skin lesions were noted. The patient reported having lived for 4 years (2000-2004) in a house that had well water as its primary water supply. This 4-year period was a stressful point in our patient's life. During that time, he had been a student at university. He had had no reported occupational exposure to arsenic. He reported being a cigarette smoker since 1996 but denied any illicit drug use or alcohol consumption. His past medical history was significant for hepatitis A infection, but he denied any history of systemic illness, including renal disease, heart disease, and lung disease. He denied any family history of leukonychia. He denied any trauma or participation in activities that require excessive use of his hands, and also denied manipulation of the cuticles. The patient's liver function tests, lipid panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis were all within normal limits. A blood test revealed normal arsenic levels. Histologic examination of the nail plate showed segmental parakeratosis, with no evidence of fungal organisms upon PAS staining.","425":"A 64-year-old white woman was originally diagnosed with histiocytic lymphoma in 1977. She had bilateral lymph node biopsies of the groin, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy after her diagnosis had been confirmed pathologically. She was treated with prednisone and vincristine.","426":"We present a case of postmenopausal-onset nevus comedonicus in a 58-year-old white woman with no relevant medical history. Two years before presentation, the patient had had a solitary red nodule, measuring 3.8 cm wide, on the mid lateral region of her left thigh. This progressed to a large area, 11.4 cm wide and 14 cm long, of multiple pruritic and painful red nodules, cysts, and deep open comedones extending across the lateral part of the left thigh, with less severe segmental extension to the lateral aspect of the left leg.","427":"A 74-year-old Caucasian man with poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension was seen in the dermatology clinic for treatment of a nodular basal cell carcinoma on his right temple. He had poorly controlled diabetes for decades and had been insulin dependent for 20 to 25 years. He had not been on any anticoagulation therapy in the past or present and had no history of a hematologic disorder. He was retired and did woodworking as a hobby. During a routine presurgical head and neck skin examination, he was noted to have macular bluegray dyspigmentation of the central portion of the anterior portion of his ear lobes, bilaterally (Figure 1). He had first noticed this color change approximately 2 years ago and thought the pigmentation was darkening. It was not symptomatic. A punch biopsy was obtained.","428":"A 27-year-old man with terminal renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis for the past 2 years was referred to the dermatologist for evaluation of red violaceous macular skin lesions consistent with livedo reticularis. These lesions had appeared suddenly on his legs (Figure 1). He had first experienced recurrent nephrolithiasis at the age of 14. Results from urine analysis and abdominal ultrasound revealed chronic kidney failure. Because the patient had a sister with similar findings, primary hyperoxaluria (PH) was suspected and genetic testing was performed in all members of his family. The results confirmed PH type 1 (PH1) in both our patient and his sister, who had died 8 years after the establishment of the diagnosis. A biopsy of the livedo reticularis lesions revealed deposits of a yellowish brown crystalline material within the lumen and the media of medium vessels in the hypodermis associated with a histiocytic giant cell reaction (Figure 2a). There was no evidence of extravascular calcium deposition in the sections examined. The deposits were intensely birefringent under polarized light, and classic speculated crystals of oxalate salts were observed (Figure 2b). No focal epidermal or superficial dermal necrosis was seen. On the basis of the histopathologic findings, the diagnosis of oxalate crystal-induced vascular disease was established. The patient subsequently developed complications including pancreatitis and peritonitis. He underwent hemodialysis until a combined liver-kidney transplant could be performed.","429":"A 48-year-old Hispanic man presented with a nodule on the right cheek. The lesion had started as a papule 4 months previously that had slowly enlarged and then plateaued at its present size. The nodule was asymptomatic, and the patient denied bleeding, draining, or preceding trauma. Review of systems was negative for fevers, weight loss, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, or other skin findings. Past medical history was significant only for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.","430":"A 35-year-old man presented with a 2-day history of a maculopapular pruritic eruption that had affected his general state of health and was accompanied by chills. The patient had been diagnosed with HIV in 2008, and was undergoing treatment with a combination of emcitrabine\/tenofovir plus nevirapine. He had a current viral load of 1,558,160 copies\/mL and a lymphocyte count CD4+ count of 230\/mm3. Physical examination revealed an eruption involving the face, nape of the neck, chest, abdomen, extremities, palms, and soles. This was characterized by erythematous papules approximately 2 mm in diameter coalescing on the palms and soles, where they formed plaques (Figures 1 and 2).","431":"A 23-year-old white man presented to our dermatology department complaining of pruriginous and erythematous papulopustules on the right cheek that had developed 6 months previously. He had a history of chronic blepharitis, complicated by a recurrent hordeolum that had been treated with warm compresses and topical antibiotic ointment (chloramphenicol) for approximately 2 years. The patient had oily skin and atopy (allergic rhinitis) and did not experience photosensitivity or flushing or have previous exposure to immunosuppressants or topical\/systemic corticosteroids.","432":"A 68-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 1-month history of a facial and neck eruption (Figure 1A). Her face was covered with 3-mm monomorphic, pink, shiny, papules and rare pustules on an erythematous background. The eruption extended down the neck, her conjunctivae were injected, and her lid margins were inflamed. She had no history of rosacea.","433":"","434":"","435":"","436":"","437":"Surgical management of benign or malignant cutaneous tumors may result in noticeable scars that are of great concern to patients, regardless of sex, age, or ethnicity. Techniques to optimize surgical scars are discussed in this three-part review. In part 1, an overview of the importance of preoperative planning, intraoperative technique, and pathophysiology of wound healing is followed by a discussion of scar revision options for depressed\/atrophic scars. Scar revision options for these scars include dermabrasion, needling and subcision, punch excision and grafts, fillers, nonablative fractional lasers, ablative and fractional ablative lasers, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This review examines the scar revision outcomes for each technique, discusses potential adverse effects, and highlights the importance of further studies to optimize postsurgical scar revision.","438":"There are many molecular variations in the histologic subtypes of basal cell carcinoma (BCC); Ki67 and Bcl-2 expression differs among them and might relate to their prognostic features. The clinically notable friability and its histologic counterpart, retraction, are dependent on cell-cell adhesion and basement membrane characteristics, which may be altered in different ways depending on the tumor morphology and phenotype. Finally, we discuss the pathogenesis of BCCs and recent molecular advances with a review of new and upcoming molecular-based therapeutics.","439":"Muir-Torre syndrome is a rare genodermatosis inherited most frequently in an autosomal dominant fashion. Current criteria for its diagnosis include at least one sebaceous tumor and an underlying visceral malignancy. Muir-Torre syndrome is strongly associated with a germline mutation in DNA mismatch repair genes. We report two patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma who presented with sebaceous neoplasms on the face and trunk. Immunohistochemical staining of the sebaceous neoplasms demonstrated absence of mismatch repair proteins MSH2 and MSH6. Genetic studies confirmed deletions in the MSH2 gene, and a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome was made. Immunohistochemical staining for mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 may aid in the diagnosis of Muir-Torre syndrome in cases where there is high suspicion. Genetic testing is an important final step in the confirmation of Muir-Torre syndrome.","440":"This contribution describes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) occurring in Down disease that presented with morphology conforming to an overlap of stages 1 and 2 of the Hurley staging system, namely the formation of solitary or multiple isolated abscesses without scarring or sinus tracts, recurrent abscesses, and single or multiple widely separated lesions with sinus tract formation, occupying apocrine sweat gland-bearing areas: the inner thighs, groin, and buttocks. The lesions were bilateral and symmetrical, of rare occurrence. In addition, the clinical and pathognomonic features of several other concomitant diseases are defined and reviewed; these include elastosis perforans serpiginosa, fissured tongue\/macroglossia, syringomas, palmoplantar keratodermas, cheilitis, xerosis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, vitiligo, cutis marmorata, and alopecia areata.","441":"","442":"","443":"","444":"","445":null,"446":"A 23-year-old man presented to our practice with erythroderma and an unusual retiform eruption, along with alopecia universalis and nail dystrophy. He had had no skin findings at birth, but since early infancy had had localized eczematous eruptions of his skin. At 10 years of age, he had developed a generalized eczematous flare requiring hospitalization, and another generalized episode occurred in October 2010. He was prescribed prednisone 60 mg daily, which initially provided an improvement, but tapering of the corticosteroid resulted in another generalized flare.","447":"A 45-year-old Chinese man had begun to show asymmetry of the face 30 years previously. Subsequently, he developed visual extinction of the right eye, slight numbness, and weakness of the left extremities. Simultaneously, multiple atrophic brownish patches occurred on his side. He denied prior trauma or tick bites at those sites. There was no report of preceding redness, induration, or a history of trauma. The atrophic lesions extended and enlarged slowly. Ten years previously, some brownish patches with normal texture had appeared on the right side of the trunk. There was no further progression of the lesions. In November 2010, the patient consulted our department for the final diagnosis and prognosis of his disease. He did not suffer from epileptic seizures and had no history of a tick bite or Lyme disease.","448":null,"449":"An otherwise healthy 36-year-old Caucasian woman, without prior history of atopic dermatitis or eczema, presented to an outside dermatologist with a generalized, severely pruritic eruption involving the entire body except the face. One month previously, she had used a 50% trichloroacetic acid tattoo removal solution on a blue-colored tattoo on the medial aspect of the left ankle. The patient's eruption persisted for 7 months, and after several attempts to slowly taper her prednisone dose, she presented to our institution. On physical examination, there was a 3-cm erythematous, lichenified plaque surrounding the tattoo (Figure). On the trunk and upper regions of the arms, there were scattered, 1- to 2-cm, nummular patches and plaques. Biopsy of a truncal lesion revealed spongiotic pustules with a mixed dermal infiltrate and scattered eosinophils, consistent with subacute spongiotic dermatitis.","450":"A 46-year-old woman with a 30 pack-year smoking history presented with a worsening eruption on the left cheek that failed to improve with metronidazole gel. The cutaneous eruption spread to most of her face and did not respond to a brief tapering course of prednisone. During the initial evaluation at our institution, approximately 6 weeks after the onset of the cutaneous eruption, the patient had erythematous, crusted plaques on her face and scalp (Figure 1A); they were also present on the V-area of the anterior aspect of the neck and upper region of the chest, the shoulders, and the arms, with isolated lesions on the trunk and legs. Her oral mucosa had erythematous erosions on the hard palate and gingivae. A review of systems revealed pain and burning of her skin lesions, but no muscle weakness or other systemic clinical manifestations. The differential diagnosis included autoimmune connective tissue disease, pemphigus foliaceous, sarcoidosis, lichen planus, phototoxic drug eruption, and eczema herpeticum.","451":"A 91-year-old Hispanic man with a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the stomach that was currently being treated with immunosuppressive therapy was referred for evaluation of a biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCis) on the left mid-region of his back. The lesion had apparently been present at birth and had recently started to itch, become red, and progressively enlarge.","452":"A 37-year-old woman attended the dermatology outpatient clinic because of recent hair loss from the eyebrows and axillae. Her past medical history revealed mild generalized erythema and hyperpigmented papules and plaques since childhood. On dermatologic examination, there were flat-topped, purple to brown hyperkeratotic lichenoid papules and linear plaques on the elbows, trunk, and buttocks, some of which coalesced into hyperpigmented reticular plaques on the axillae, neck, and groin. Mild erythema was noted. There was thinning and loss of hair of the eyebrows; severe loss of hair was noted in the axillae and genital regions (Figure 1). One of the lichenoid papules was biopsied. The specimen showed histopathologic findings of focal parakeratosis, irregular acanthosis, an increased granular layer, and focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer. Necrotic keratinocytes were also observed. Hyalinization and abundant melanin in the papillary dermis and marked congestion of blood vessels were noted (Figure 2). Clinicopathologic correlation of the case was consistent with keratosis lichenoides chronica (KLC).","453":"","454":"","455":"","456":"Smoking has been identified as a habit that carries great health risks.

Although the condition was first described in 1887, its clinical aspects and clinical forms have still not been well individualized, nor has its etiopathogenesis been fully elucidated. The disease, despite having clinical features similar to dermatitis, does not have the same histopathologic features or the same progressive clinical behavior. This contribution reviews the history of seborrheic dermatitis.","458":null,"459":"Autoimmune bullous diseases (ABDs) are uncommon but significant skin disorders with relatively high morbidity and mortality. Some surveys have been carried out to describe the spectrum of ABDs in a region, but this is the first that has focused on ABDs in elderly patients. This study was conducted to determine the clinicoepidemiologic features of ABDs in elderly patients. Medical records of all ABD patients with disease onset after the age of 60 years who presented to the Autoimmune Bullous Diseases Research Center, Tehran, Iran between April 2003 and March 2013 were reviewed. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were not included. During the 10-year period studied, 296 patients with ABD and disease onset after 60 years of age were diagnosed. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) was observed to be the most common ABD (48.3%), followed by pemphigus vulgaris (45.3%), pemphigus foliaceus (3.7%), mucous membrane pemphigoid (1.4%), paraneoplastic pemphigus (0.7%), epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (0.3%), and linear IgA bullous disease (0.3%). A predominance in women was observed for total ABDs, BP, and pemphigus vulgaris. Although Iran is known to have a high prevalence of pemphigus, BP is the most frequent ABD among elderly patients in Iran, highlighting the importance of the clinical diagnosis of BP in elderly patients.","460":"Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) is a rare, heterogeneous disease of mast cell proliferation. The variable clinical presentation of TMEP, coupled with its rarity, makes the recognition and diagnosis of this disease difficult and challenging for clinicians. The histopathologic findings with hematoxylin and eosin staining that distinguish TMEP from a normal skin biopsy can be so subtle that confirmation of the diagnosis with additional special stains (c-Kit, Giemsa, toluidine blue) is strongly recommended. We describe three cases that highlight the variable clinical presentation of TMEP. One patient experienced only a localized skin manifestation, another an aggressive clinical course with systemic involvement, and a third diffuse skin involvement with mild fatigue, muscle pain, and weight gain.","461":"","462":"","463":"A 45-year-old woman presented with multiple, slightly painful, reddish, nodular facial lesions that had developed at the site of Mycobacterium w vaccine injections given for her facial warts 4 weeks prior. She had not received a sensitization dose of Mycobacterium w vaccine, and all of the inflamed lesions were injected at the same time. On examination, approximately 20 erythematous, succulent nodules of variable size were noted over the cheeks and forehead (Figure 1). Some of these lesions had purulent discharge due to secondary infection. After a course of oral amoxicillin, a punch biopsy was performed from one of the nodules and submitted for histopathologic examination.","464":null,"465":"An elderly woman presented with a 3-month history of nonhealing, tender ulcers involving the right calf and both forearms. She denied any history of similar lesions or trauma. Two trials of oral antibiotics had led to no improvement. Her medical history was significant for rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisone. A review of clinical manifestations was otherwise negative for disease. Physical examination of the patient's right calf revealed two punched-out ulcers with central necrotic black eschars, underlying retiform purpuric pattern, and mild fibrinopurulent drainage (Figure 1). Similar lesions were present on her forearms (Figures 2 and 3). No other remarkable skin changes were noted.

Within these systems, their roles serve a different purpose than their classical counterparts in skin as pigment cells. Such roles include cell turnover in retinal pigment epithelium, maintenance of balance and prevention of environmental damage in the auditory neuroepithelium, role-playing as dendritic cells within the leptomeninges, and prevention of oxidative damage in adipose tissue. Vitiligo, commonly known as a skin pigmentation disorder, has also been associated with several systemic disorders, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and Alezzandrini, Kabuki, and MELAS syndromes. Therefore, since these conditions involve compromise of systems in which melanocytes reside, it is not surprising that vitiligo has other systemic associations. The authors present a detailed review of systemic associations of vitiligo and melanocytes' roles in other organ systems with a focus on systemic disease.","474":"The authors performed a pooled analysis of three randomized, 4-week, phase II\/III studies in adult patients with mild to severe psoriasis and assessed the safety\/tolerability of aerosol foam fixed-combination calcipotriene 0.005% (Cal) plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% (BD) versus different comparators. Overall, 1104 patients were randomized to Cal\/BD aerosol foam (n=564), Cal aerosol foam (n=101), BD aerosol foam (n=101), aerosol foam vehicle (n=152), Cal\/BD ointment (n=135), or ointment vehicle (n=51). A total of 543 Cal\/BD patients in the aerosol foam group (96.3%) completed the studies, with only two patients (0.4%) withdrawing as a result of adverse events (AEs). Ninety-five AEs were reported in 78 patients (13.8%) receiving Cal\/BD aerosol foam; similar event rates were observed in other groups. The most common AEs with Cal\/BD aerosol foam were nasopharyngitis (n=6, 1.1%) and application-site pain (n=4, 0.7%); most AEs were mild (n=71\/95; 74.7%). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) experienced by two or more patients receiving Cal\/BD aerosol foam were application-site pain (n=4; 0.7%) and application-site pruritus (n=2; 0.4%). There were no clinically relevant changes in calcium homeostasis. Cal\/BD aerosol foam has a positive benefit-risk profile for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris; the superior efficacy versus Cal\/BD ointment and the individual active ingredients is not associated with poorer tolerability.","475":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been widely used for oncologic indications, especially nonmelanoma skin cancer such as superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC). We present a multicenter clinical study conducted between 2012 and 2014 analyzing the adverse reactions during and after PDT with a standardized protocol in 866 lesions. A total of 728 patients with positive clinical and histopathological diagnosis for BCC with up to 2 cm diameter were treated. The procedure consisted of curettage and topical application of cream containing 20% methyl 5-aminolevulinate. The illumination (630 nm and 150 J\/cm2) was performed 3 hours after the cream application. The expected and unexpected effects observed were pain, healing, and inflammatory reactions. The pain intensity was correlated with the anatomical localization of the lesion. The patients reported a higher intensity of pain in lesions located on the head and neck rather than on the trunk and limbs. The number of sessions also influenced the pain response. A total of 83% of patients showed perfect healing and the other 17% presented abnormal healing. PDT plays an important role in BCC because of its low cost, ease of use, and low rate of side effects.","476":"Reports of the sequential use of multiple light and laser sources for topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) activation in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of inflammatory acne vulgaris are lacking. The authors sought to retrospectively compare field-directed ALA-PDT with blue light only, blue light + pulsed dye laser (PDL), blue light + intense pulsed light (IPL), blue light + PDL + IPL, or blue light + red light + PDL + IPL for inflammatory acne of the face or upper trunk. Results showed a trend toward greater patient-reported improvement with comparable tolerability using multiple, sequential light sources in ALA-PDT for acne vulgaris, albeit not statistically significant. The addition of red light, however, did not improve outcomes. The disparate numbers of patients between treatment arms and high potential for recall bias limit this single-center retrospective study.","477":null,"478":"","479":"","480":"A middle-aged man came in for evaluation of \"white spots\" on his upper body. The number of lesions had increased progressively over the past 20 years but were asymptomatic. The patient expressed concern that his young son had recently developed similar lesions on the upper part of his back. Physical examination revealed numerous, slightly elevated, flat-topped papules scattered over the back, chest, and upper extremities (Figure 1). Each 4- to 6-mm papule was oval or round, ivory white, with a cobblestone surface. The patient's son was also examined and found to have six papules scattered across the upper part of his back and legs, identical in morphology to those of our patient. A shave biopsy was taken from of one of the papules. Results from routine hematoxylin-eosin, as well as Melan-A sections, are shown (Figure 2). The diagnosis was familial keratosis alba or familial hypochromic seborrheic keratosis.","481":"A 45-year-old farmer presented with ulcers and plaques over his scrotum for the past 4 to 5 years. The condition started as a small lesion on the shaft of the penis, which improved with treatment; however, after 2 to 3 months, papulonodular lesions developed on the scrotum, which increased in size and subsequently broke down to form ulcers. He denied drug abuse but had a history of multiple unprotected sexual exposures. He was prescribed oral antibiotics, which improved the lesions, but he failed to take the antibiotics for more than a week. He also used powders, lotions, and salves (exact nature not known), which did not help and sometimes even burned the skin. After stopping the medicine, he developed new lesions that followed a similar course. Examination revealed nontender ulcers on the scrotum with raised, rolled-out margins and pale red, granulation tissue that bled on touch (Figure 1). In addition, there were nodules with a pinkish red granular surface and scaly erythematous plaques on the scrotum. Regional lymph nodes were not enlarged.","482":null,"483":"","484":"","485":"","486":"Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae.

Its origin dates back to the year 5000 BCE with a frozen mummy and travels across time through diverse cultures and places until it reaches the modern occidental world. Inks and materials used for tattooing are poorly controlled and carry potential risks of skin reactions. The procedure itself is also not innocuous. In this review, different types of tattoos are mentioned and associated dermatologic conditions are discussed. Unfortunately, treatment and removal procedures are often poor in effectiveness and lead to unwanted results. Combining different lasers may be a suitable option that requires further investigation.","488":"Midline capillary formation nuchae (MCFN) consists of blanchable pink macules located around the midline of the occiput and nape. It has been implicated in the literature as a risk factor for angiosarcoma and might be related to a decrease in innervation of the involved capillaries. Although there is ample literature on its prevalence from birth through adult life, the literature in late life is sparse. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence in late life, whether it is truly a risk factor for angiosarcoma and whether it might be an indication of a systemic neuroendocrine effect or a local reaction. In routine skin screening examinations of 411 patients, the prevalence of MCFN increased with age (P&lt;.0001), by quartiles of age overall (P=.0001), and among men only (P=.0013). No difference in prevalence was observed across quartiles of age among women only (P=.0688). No association was found with routine parameters that might be influenced by the systemic neuroendocrine system. Prevalence increases in old age, is not a risk factor for angiosarcoma, and might represent a response of local capillaries to normal changes in the neuroendocrine system that occur with age.","489":"The authors present the immunopathologic findings of Toll-like receptor 2 in psoriasis. This novel work shows positive staining within the dermal capillaries in psoriatic lesions. Neither normal skin nor lesional skin in eczema showed similar staining.

Dressings are a form of treatment and, in view of the variety and high cost of the products on the market, three agents were selected for this investigation, regarding their efficacy and cost\/benefit ratio. The objective of the investigation was to evaluate and compare the efficacy, costs, and benefits of carboxymethylcellulose in paste at 20% (CMC 20%), trichloroacetic acid at 90% (TCA 90%), and Unna boot for treatment of chronic venous ulcers. Three groups of 30 patients each were chosen randomly for ambulatory treatment with TCA 90% (G1), CMC 20% (G2), and Unna boot (G3). The evolution of the cicatricial process of each group separately and between groups was analyzed with measurement of the lesion areas in square centimeters (cm2) and observation of the amount of exudate from observation of the photographic record, until their healing, in the maximum period of 20 weeks. A significant reduction of lesion areas in all groups was observed (P=.0001), with a median reduction of 7.6 cm2 (38.1%) for G1, 3.9 cm2 (38.8%) for G2, and 16.2 cm2 (77.8%) for G3.

The dermatitis began 3 weeks after receiving an initial infusion of pemetrexed (500 mg\/m2) as induction chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Physical examination revealed numerous erythematous, scaly papules over the face, extensor surface of the arms, hands, and upper aspects of the chest and back, sparing sun-protected areas (Figure). He acknowledged that in the past he frequently went shirtless outdoors and rarely wore sunscreen or sun protective clothing during the many years he worked at construction sites. Results from a biopsy specimen from a typical lesion on the forearm revealed an inflamed actinic keratosis. Systemic chemotherapy was continued, and only emollients and mid-potency topical steroids were used to treat the skin eruption.

The disorder is most likely the result of traumatic percutaneous inoculation of one of several etiologic dematiaceous fungi. Causative organisms have been associated with dead wood, soil, and plants. Chromomycosis may present clinically in a wide variety of manners. We illustrate the characteristic morphologic appearances of mycosis as it was encountered in both Panama and Texas, including verrucous papules and nodules, scaly plaques, exophytic or ulcerative tumor-like masses, and cicatricial plaques of both small and large dimension. As is typical of this disease, all lesions in this series were located on the extremities, and all patients had frequent and intimate exposure to vegetation in hot, humid environments. Chromomycosis characteristically runs an indolent course and is rarely fatal. The patients described herein had experienced cutaneous lesions for many months to several decades prior to diagnosis. This mycosis is often difficult to treat. Successful therapy may involve one or more oral antifungal drugs (such as itraconazole and terbinafine) and\/or use of physically ablative modalities (such as laser, photodynamic therapy, and cryosurgery).","509":null,"510":"","511":"","512":"Case 1 A 41-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 diagnosed 16 years prior to his consultation was referred for an 8-month history of multiple painless lumps in his mouth.

Physical examination showed multiple small mucosal-colored and lobulated papulonodules located in the palate and lower gingiva and a whitish verrucous plaque on the lower labial mucosa (Figure 1a). The lesions were diagnosed clinically as focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH) and further confirmed by classical histopathological findings (Figure 1b). He had previously received unspecified treatment; thus, topical 5% imiquimod cream was initiated every night. Mild erosion and ulceration developed in the upper labial mucosa, which were managed with lubrication (petrolatum ointment). After 2 weeks, all of the small lesions disappeared and the largest plaque resolved 1 week later (Figure 1c).

Investigated more recently in conventional medicine, this causative bond between dietary factors and blistering skin diseases was mentioned by Persian scholars such as Avicenna a thousand years ago. Avicenna, a well-known Persian physician and philosopher, who could be considered a pioneer in dermatology, discussed skin diseases in a chapter in The Canon of Medicine. He accounted for some nutritional triggers for skin blisters (mentioned as \"hot swellings\"), such as onion, garlic, leek, pepper, and wine.

The authors highlight five cases of patients with terra firma-forme dermatosis presenting to our dermatology center between 2012 and 2013. All patients presented to the dermatologist for persistent reticulated brown patches on the skin. These patients ranged in age from 6 to 22 years. All patients had tried various cleansing soaps and agents but were unable to remove the patches. The condition was cosmetically unacceptable to the patients and parents. Clinically, these patients had reticulated brown patches. Rubbing 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes on the affected areas demonstrated clearance of the brown pigmented patches in all cases. The diagnosis of terra firma-forme dermatosis (TFFD) was confirmed by forceful rubbing with a gauze pad immersed in 70% isopropyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol. Patients should be reassured about the benign nature of TFFD and educated about the cleaning procedure. Recognition of this condition can assist physicians in making a diagnosis and therapy with a simple alcohol wipe, preventing further unnecessary tests for patients.","526":"Hair is the ultimate personal beauty tool of self-expression. It is more malleable than skin and it is more personal than clothing; however, hair does not remain constant with age. Hair is arguably in peak condition at about 30 years of age. With time, there is a gradual change in many aspects of hair: hair diameter is reduced, hair density is decreased, androgenic alopecia may develop, and pigmentation may be diminished, producing a significant psychological impact. These age-related changes can be exacerbated by blast drying, heat straightening, perming, and coloring. In this review, the changes in hair fiber and array (collection of fiber) properties that occur during aging and the impact on styling and potential interventions that consumers undergo to circumvent these issues are discussed.","527":"","528":"","529":"An 18-year-old Caucasian man presented with extensive recalcitrant verrucae on his trunk and extremities that were unresponsive to cryotherapy, salicylic acid, topical imiquimod, CO2 laser, candida antigen, and intralesional bleomycin.

In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of lipid mediators are released and play a major role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases. Recent data suggest that lipid mediators are able to interfere with the pathogenesis of certain dermatologic diseases, seriously affecting patient quality of life. Acne, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis are specific examples of skin diseases that may respond to treatment with medication affecting these metabolic pathways.

A solid-phase enzyme immunoassay was developed to semiquantitate serum antibodies to a human melanocyte extract and was used in 127 patients, 93 of whom showed clinical progression of the disease, while the remaining 34 were quiescent. Results showed different values for clinical sensitivity and specificity depending on the cutoff level for decision, but the overall performance of the test was adequate and supported statistical significance to predict clinical activity\/progression or quietness of the disease process. The test might prove useful in deciding the indication and aggressiveness of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with vitiligo.

Physical examination revealed an ill-defined, firm, mobile subcutaneous nodule measuring approximately 3 cm on the right upper part of the back and a similar but smaller nodule on the left upper portion of the back (Figure 1). The location of the lesions corresponded to the areas of maximal pressure produced by a squat bar that he uses frequently during weightlifting (Figure 2). Histologic analysis of the right lesion revealed a markedly expanded dermis caused by a striking increase in the number of collagen bundles that were relatively normal in thickness, accompanied by a subtle increase in the number of fibroblasts (Figure 3). In some foci, fibroplasia along with increased deposition of mucin further contributed to the expansion of the dermis (Figure 3). Although the process spanned the entire dermis, it was more pronounced in the deep reticular dermis, particularly near the subcutis as collagen bundles were arranged in a more haphazard array in this region. Verhoeff-Van Gieson stain revealed diminished and fragmented elastic fibers within some of the involved areas.

The majority of chondroid syringomas occur at the head and neck region (80%). Their clinical presentation is not specific and the final diagnosis is based on histopathologic examination. The authors report four cases of benign chondroid syringoma in three women and one man aged 26, 45, 50, and 38 years, respectively. They presented with a slow-growing, painless and firm subcutaneous nodule measuring between 1 and 3 cm involving the lower eyelid, the nasogenien groove, the nose, and the chin, respectively. All patients underwent uneventful surgical excision of the nodules. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen was compatible with benign chondroid syringoma in all cases. Chondroid syringomas must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any small subcutaneous nodule in the head and neck region in middle-aged patients.

The authors' results indicate that TrichoScan represents a very useful tool in the evaluation of hair loss.","693":"","694":"","695":"Scleroderma en coup de sabre is a disfiguring disease for which only limited therapeutic options exist. Three cases of facial linear scleroderma treated with autologous fat transplantation with acceptable results are presented. Autologous fat transplantation was preferred to corrective surgery because of the extent of the lesions and absence of any associated facial distortion. Fat as a filler was chosen to reduce the risk of adverse effects. Adipocytes are suggested to have wider biological effects than other fillers and may offer more durable results. At least two transplantations were needed to evoke a significant effect.","696":"","697":"","698":"","699":"","700":"Alopecia areata is a trichosis characterized by loss of hair, with the abrupt onset of round or oval, nonscarring, flat, single or multiple areas of alopecia lesions, which can coalesce.

TCM is an alternative method of therapy that proposes to treat symptoms that Western medicine is unable to manage by treating the underlying causes of disease. The authors provide a general overview of TCM remedies used in the treatment of various dermatologic disorders (acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) for dermatologists interested in this unconventional therapeutic approach.","702":"The aim of this study was to evaluate by clinical and noninvasive instrumental evaluations the efficacy and tolerance of a cosmetic topical slimming treatment specific for light\/moderate adipose pannicula at the level of the waist and hips. The protocol was performed as a double-blind active vs placebo trial in 110 volunteers for a period of 4 weeks, with an additional visit 4 weeks after the last product application. The following clinical\/instrumental evaluation was performed during the visit: clinical assessment of hip-abdomen adipose pannicula, circumference measurements, ultrasonographic evaluation of adipose pannicula thickness, and plicometry. At the end of treatment, the slimming activity of the study product resulted in clinically different results than placebo, determined by a significant decrease in abdomen\/hips circumferences and considerable reduction of abdomen\/hips adipose pannicula thickness. The tolerability of the product was good and the enrolled volunteers expressed their full satisfaction with the studied product.","703":"Rosmarinus officinalis L. is a medicinal plant with diverse activities including enhancement microcapillary perfusion. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of rosemary oil in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and compare its effects with minoxidil 2%. Patients with AGA were randomly assigned to rosemary oil (n = 50) or minoxidil 2% (n = 50) for a period of 6 months. After a baseline visit, patients returned to the clinic for efficacy and safety evaluations every 3 months. A standardized professional microphotographic assessment of each volunteer was taken at the initial interview and after 3 and 6 months of the trial. No significant change was observed in the mean hair count at the 3-month endpoint, neither in the rosemary nor in the minoxidil group (P &gt; .05). In contrast, both groups experienced a significant increase in hair count at the 6-month endpoint compared with the baseline and 3-month endpoint (P &lt; .05). No significant difference was found between the study groups regarding hair count either at month 3 or month 6 (&gt; .05). The frequencies of dry hair, greasy hair, and dandruff were not found to be significantly different from baseline at either month 3 or month 6 trial in the groups (P &gt; .05). The frequency of scalp itching at the 3- and 6-month trial points was significantly higher compared with baseline in both groups (P &lt; .05). Scalp itching, however, was more frequent in the minoxidil group at both assessed endpoints (P &lt; .05). The findings of the present trial provided evidence with respect to the efficacy of rosemary oil in the treatment of AGA.","704":"","705":"","706":"A 12-year-old girl presented with swelling on the lateral aspect of the left foot since early childhood, progressively increasing in size and now causing pain on walking.

Fissuring is a common feature, resulting in an inability to walk, and it may prevent the wearing of footwear, especially when shoes are the cause of the dermatosis. In the absence of adequate care and therapy, footwear dermatitis may turn into a chronic distressing disease that largely effects the daily quality of life of patients.","713":"Inflammation is the physiological response of the organism to different stimuli such as infection, trauma, or immunological mechanisms. Lipid mediators play a major role in skin inflammation and are known as \"local mediators\" acting in the intercellular microenvironments, where they reach considerable levels. A complex family of lipid mediators regulates a wide variety of physiological responses and pathological processes. Lipid mediators are produced by all human tissues, differing widely in the amounts of the various enzymes they contain and, therefore, in the relative proportions and amounts of products. The authors emphasize the effects and roles of lipid mediators in skin inflammation, focusing particularly on evidence provided by recently published studies. In the future, pharmacologic manipulation of lipid mediators and their receptors may provide a novel approach for controlling inflammation.","714":"Atypical vascular lesions are an uncommon adverse sequela to the radiotherapy of tumors. Many characteristics are shared between atypical vascular lesions caused by radiation port and well-differentiated radiation-induced angiosarcomas. The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical literature using PubMed, searching the terms acquired, atypical, benign, lymphangioma, lymphangioendothelioma, lymphangiomatous, lesion, papules, progressive, and vascular. Patient reports and previous reviews of the subject were critically assessed and the salient features are presented. Atypical vascular lesions associated with the radiation port present as clinically innocuous flesh-colored to erythematous papules or plaques. The condition presents within the radiation field, approximately 3 years after initial treatment. While the exact me chanism remains to be elucidated, growing evidence supports an association between radiation-associated atypical vascular lesions and radiation-induced angiosarcomas. Atypical vascular lesions within a radiation port are suggested to be in a state of morphologic continuum, which may progress into the more aggressive, malignant angiosarcoma. The authors recommend consideration for biopsy of new skin lesions within or adjacent to radiation. While it is clear that atypical vascular lesions caused by radiation are not equivalent to angiosarcoma, growing evidence supports that radiation-associated atypical vascular lesions may progress to angiosarcoma in some patients; therefore, the authors recommend excision of the lesion with margins depending on clinical judgment and the lesion encountered.","715":"","716":"","717":"","718":"","719":"","720":"A 34-year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic with photosensitivity, photophobia, and facial pruritus (Figure 1). She had brown eyes and fair skin, hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows since birth. Her sister had similar skin and hair pigments. The patient had no systemic disease and was not taking any medication. Her parents were second-degree relatives. A dermatologic examination revealed small hyperkeratotic papules with an erythematous background, minimal desquamation, and some excoriation over the nose, zygomatic arch, and forehead consistent with actinic keratosis and solar damage. An ophthalmological examination demonstrated impaired visual acuity (60\/100 in both eyes, reaching 80\/100 in the left eye with best correction). Hypopigmentation at the albinotic retinal midperiphery (Figure 2) by fundoscopy was noted. She had no nystagmus or strabismus.

The patient stated that she had two sexual partners in that period, who showed no skin lesions. Cutaneous examination showed about 30 to 40 molluscoid lesions of 0.5 cm to 2 cm in diameter and widespread cauliflower-like condyloma acuminata (Figure) spread on the vulvovaginal and perianal region without any symptoms. At the time of observation, she was under treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil.","722":"","723":"","724":"","725":"","726":"Mohs micrographic surgery is an excision technique that has been widely adapted as the recommended treatment for basal and squamous cell carcinomas and other skin cancers. It was developed by Frederic E. Mohs in the 1930s and has since advanced in its methods and applications. Mohs developed the practice in the process of determining a method to treat various neoplasms. Mohs micrographic surgery is a modality that involves serial excision of a tumor followed by microscopic evaluation of the tissue. It is a complicated surgical technique that involves scrupulous training and constant adaptation. It has greatly expanded since its inception to include new imaging techniques such as immunohistochemistry and confocal mosaicing microscopy. Further advancements include its application to other medical specialties, such as otolaryngology. This technique began as a revolutionary practice but has since become the standard treatment for a variety of skin cancers.","727":"Scabies is found worldwide among people of all groups and ages. It is curable with scabicide medications. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral ivermectin vs malathion 0.5% lotion for the treatment of scabies. In total, 148 patients with scabies were enrolled and randomized into two groups: the first group received a single dose of oral ivermectin 200 sg\/kg body weight, and the second was treated with two applications of topical lindane lotion 1%, with a 1-week interval between applications. Treatment was evaluated at intervals of 2 and 4 weeks, and if there was treatment failure at the 2-week follow-up, treatment was repeated. A single dose of ivermectin provided a cure rate of 60.8% at the 2-week follow-up, which increased to 89.1% at the 4-week follow-up after repeating the treatment. Treatment with two applications oflindane lotion 1%, with a 1-week interval between them, was effective in 47.2% of patients at the 2-week follow-up, which increased to 72.9% at the 4-week follow-up after this treatment was repeated. A single dose of ivermectin was as effective as two applications of lindane lotion 1% at the 2-week follow-up. After repeat treatment, ivermectin was superior to lindane lotion 1% at the 4-week follow-up. The delay in clinical response with ivermectin suggests that it may not be effective against the parasite at all stages in the life cycle.","728":"Hair loss can have a negative effect on self-image and self-esteem for both men and women. The results of a recent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study demonstrated the ability of a new oral dietary supplement to increase hair growth in women with thinning hair after 90 days. A companion hair fiber filler product has been designed to be applied to areas of thinning hair to provide the temporary appearance of fuller-looking hair until their own hair is replenished. Forty men and women from a dermatology and cosmetic surgery clinic were asked to use the product and afterward complete quality-of-life, self-assessment, and product satisfaction questionnaires. Mean quality-of-life and self-assessment results were favorable. Hair qualities showing the greatest improvement were scalp coverage and hair fullness. The product satisfaction questionnaire indicated a high level of satisfaction and most patients (35 [88%]) were pleased with the way the product matched their natural hair color. Based on the results reported here, use of the product is likely to increase the quality of life of men and women with thinning hair.","729":"","730":"","731":"","732":"A 56-year-old Caucasian woman presented with acute onset of dermatitis on her face accompanied by intense itching. The patient reported that the condition began after cleaning a decorative plant, Euphorbia trigona, and contact with some drops of the plant's latex sap released upon cutting its leaves. The clinical examination revealed erythema and edema of the infraorbital and perioral regions (Figure 1). The patient was in otherwise good general health, had no personal or family history of systemic or skin disease, and was not receiving any concomitant medications. Therapy with topical methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% cream once daily was initiated and systemic desloratadine 5 mg tablets once daily was administered for the intense itch. Seven days after the introduction of the treatment a significant improvement was noticed (Figure 2). Patch testing with the leaves of the plant as well as with the latex sap was undertaken in order to prove the causative role (Figures 3 and 4). Strongly positive reactions with bulla formation were observed on day 2 and 3, most likely suggesting acute irritation instead of true delayed hypersensitivity.","733":"A 64-year-old man presented with asymptomatic eruption on his right forearm and the dorsum of the hand present for 2 weeks. There was no history of trauma, prolonged sun exposure, or application of or contact with any substance prior to the development of lesions. He was a known hypertensive and diabetic and was taking treatment for these conditions. The rest of his history was noncontributory. On examination, multiple grouped tiny white papules were found on both normal skin and on the erythematous plaque. These papules were of almost uniform size (2-4 mm) and were notable for absence of umbilication. The erythematous plaque was roughly 15 cm in length and was extending along the ulnar border of forearm and dorsum of hand in a linear pattern (Figure 1). The surface temperature of the plaque appeared similar to the surrounding area, and the surface was studded with multiple tiny white papules. There were no lesions suggestive of chronic actinic damage in the surrounding area. The papules revealed solid whitish material on expression with a needle. The rest of the mucocutaneous examination was noncontributory. Based on clinical presentation, a diagnosis of linear milia en plaque was made.","734":"Patient 1: A 65-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 2-month history of large erythematous patches of the right temporal scalp. The patient was otherwise in good health and taking no medications. He denied a family history oflymphomas or autoimmune diseases. No hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was appreciated. A complete blood cell count, serum protein electrophoresis, peripheral blood flow cytometric analysis, bone marrow biopsy, Helicobacter pylori titers, and Borrelia burgdorferi titers were within normal range. The antinuclear antibody titer was positive at 1:640 and showed a homogenous pattern. Rheumatoid factor, SSA (Ro), and SSB (La) antibody titers were negative. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were unremarkable. Two punch biopsies from different time points demonstrated an atypical lymphocytic infiltrate forming clusters in the dermal and subcutaneous tissue. These cells had a (14;18) translocation and were mostly positive for CD20 and bcl-6, but not bcl-2. The patient was diagnosed with low-grade primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma based on clinicopathological evidence, and achieved complete remission after local radiation and 6 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. The patient has had no evidence of recurrence for 6 years.","735":"","736":"","737":"","738":"Dermatophyte infections are traditionally localized to the stratum corneum. The advent of immunosuppressants and topical steroid\/antifungal preparations, however, has created a new phenomenon: dermatophytosis in the stratum lucidum. This atypical presentation manifests in 3 clinical scenarios: oral immunosuppression and\/or medical comorbidities, lesions\/body sites with lichenification, and sites on\/near acral skin. In each setting, superficial potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparations have proved ineffective in diagnosis, despite high indices of suspicion for dermatophytosis. It is only under histologic examination that florid hyphal elements are identified. The authors propose a modified KOH technique requiring a sample of deeper, pathological scale-containing fungal elements to be used in scenarios where tinea lucidum or dermatophyte infection of the stratum lucidum may be present.","739":"Asymmetric gait nail unit syndrome (AGNUS) is the result of asymmetric shoe pressure on the toes and foot caused by ubiquitous uneven flat feet that affect the gait. The pressure produces clinical changes in the toenails, which are identical to all clinical types of dermatophyte and opportunistic onychomycosis, yet they are dermatophytes-free. AGNUS produces additional signs that make it easy to identify. Its coexistence with fungal disease has resulted in reports describing new clinical types of onychomycosis, identifying signs of drug resistance, assessing severity index, and defining complete clinical cure when taking a systemic or topical antifungal, as well as \"retronychia.\" These signs are typically seen in the toenails of patients with AGNUS. AGNUS has a mechanical etiology and can coexist with dermatophytosis, which is a hereditary disease. AGNUS can coexist with any other disease affecting the toenails and results in greater clinical severity than each condition individually. AGNUS is and has been the most common worldwide toenail abnormality in shoe-wearing societies.","740":"The number of surgical hair restorations performed worldwide is ever-increasing. Today's gold standard in surgical hair restoration is follicular unit transplantation (FUT). FUT refers to the transplantation of individual follicular units (FUs) from the donor region to the recipient region. Strip extraction and manual FU extraction (FUE) are the most common methods for FU production. While strip extraction and manual FUE both hold individual merits, they are also associated with a number of limitations. The introduction of a robotic surgical assistive device may circumvent many of the limitations associated with traditional strip and manual FUE methods. As with all new technologies, however, the robotic device will require further independently funded, peer-reviewed, clinical testing to establish its efficacy relative to existing hair restoration methods in clinical practice.","741":"Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disease of hair follicles. Cryotherapy has been employed to stimulate hair regrowth. The current investigation evaluated the efficacy of this method in patchyAA. Forty patients older than 5 years and with 120 recalcitrant patches were enrolled in the study. AA covered less than 50% of the patients' scalps. In each individual, one lesion was treated with N2 jet cryotherapy once a week for a period of 12 weeks, while another lesion was treated with topical 0.05% clobetasol proprionate lotion. All patients were followed from weeks 2 to 16. Thirty-eight of 40 patients completed therapy. The overall response rate of patches was 80% in the cryotherapy group and 91.5% in the clobetasol group. Complete recovery (&gt;95% terminal hair growth) was not obtained in any patient. Results from chi-square test showed no significant difference between improvements in AA in the two groups (reliability 95%). Pearson measurement showed a significant reverse relationship between diameter and duration of patches and the improvement rate in both groups. Liquid nitrogen jet cryotherapy can be a helpful modality in the treatment of AA.","742":"","743":"","744":"","745":"","746":"","747":"","748":"","749":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer in humans, which typically appears over the sun-exposed skin as a slow-growing, locally invasive lesion that rarely metastasizes. Although the exact etiology of BCC is unknown, there exists a well-established relationship between BCC and the pilo-sebaceous unit, and it is currently thought to originate from pluri-potential cells in the basal layer of the epidermis or the follicle. The patched\/hedgehog intracellular signaling pathway plays a central role in both sporadic BCCs and nevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome). This pathway is vital for the regulation of cell growth, and differentiation and loss of inhibition of this pathway is associated with development of BCC. The sonic hedgehog protein is the most relevant to BCC; nevertheless, the Patched (PTCH) protein is the ligand-binding component of the hedgehog receptor complex in the cell membrane. The other protein member of the receptor complex, smoothened (SMO), is responsible for transducing hedgehog signaling to downstream genes, leading to abnormal cell proliferation. The importance of this pathway is highlighted by the successful use in advanced forms of BCC of vismodegib, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, that selectively inhibits SMO. The UV-specific nucleotide changes in the tumor suppressor genes, TP53 and PTCH, have also been implicated in the development of BCC.","750":"During the past century, organ transplantation has delivered the miracle of life to more than 500,000 patients in need. Secondary malignancies have developed as an unforeseen consequence of intense immunosuppressive regimens. Cutaneous malignancies have been recognized as the most frequent cancer that arises post-transplantation. Among organ transplant recipients (OTRs), skin cancer is a substantial cause of morbidity and potential mortality. The authors discuss epidemiology and clinical presentation of cutaneous malignancies; associated risk factors; recommendation for the care of immunosuppressed OTRs, and emerging therapies on the horizon.","751":"Dandruff is a common cosmetic condition associated with flaky scalp skin and pruritus. It is generally treated with regular use of antifungal-based shampoos. Research into factors underlying the characteristic skin lesions has revealed perturbations in epidermal differentiation and a dramatic deterioration in the associated process of stratum corneum (SC) maturation. These observations suggest that directly addressing the quality of the SC could have a scalp benefit. In this study, the authors investigated the efficacy of a moisturising leave-on lotion (LOL) containing a high concentration of glycerol (10%) and other known skin benefit agents (saturated fatty acid and sunflower seed oil) to reduce dandruff over an 8-week treatment period with 3 applications per week. Results of expert visual grading and biophysical measurements of SC parameters (transepidermal water loss and hydration) revealed a significant reduction in the dandruffcondition over this period, with significant improvement in both SC water barrier function and hydration. These scalp skin benefits were maintained for up to a week following cessation of the treatment. This study indicates that use of a glycerol-rich substantive LOL, designed to directly improve the quality of the SC barrier can have a significant impact on the dandruff condition.","752":"The media-fuelled obsession with beauty in modern society has led more women to seek elective cosmetic procedures to meet the portrayed ideals of beauty in different cultures. This study gives insights into incentives and desires to undergo cosmetic procedures in a conservative society with strict religious practices where women are veiled. Questionnaire data were obtained from 509 Saudi women who responded to a survey distributed randomly to a sample of Saudi women aged 17 to 72 years. At least 1 elective cosmetic procedure was performed in 42% of the women, of whom 77.8% wore a veil. Another 33% considered having a procedure. The motives for seeking a cosmetic procedure were to improve self-esteem in 83.7%, attract a husband in 63.3%, or prevent a husband from seeking another wife in 36.2%. The decision to seek a procedure was affected by the media, with high peer influence. Motivation for elective cosmetic procedures in Saudi women is influenced by a combination of emotional and cultural factors, level of education, marital status, and religious beliefs. The veil is not an impediment for seeking such procedures. The limitation of the study was missing data analysis as some items in the questionnaire were completed inaccurately or left unanswered.","753":"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a persistent and pervasive condition that affects men worldwide. Some common treatment options for AGA include hair prosthetics, oral and topical medications, and surgical hair restoration (SHR). Pharmaceutical and SHR treatments are associated with limitations including adverse side effects and significant financial burden. Low-level laser or light (LLL) devices offer alternative treatment options that are not typically associated with adverse side effects or significant costs. There are clinic- and home-based LLL devices. One home-based laser comb device has set a standard for others; however, this device requires time devoted to carefully moving the comb through the hair to allow laser penetration to the scalp. A novel helmet-like LLL device for hair growth has proven effective in preliminary trials and allows for hands-free use. Regardless, there are few clinical trials that have been conducted regarding LLL devices for AGA and results are mixed. Further research is required to establish the true efficacy of these devices for hair growth in comparison to existing alternative therapies.","754":"","755":"","756":"","757":"A 35-year-old man presented with asymptomatic eruption on both forearms and lower aspects of the legs for 6 months. The lesions first appeared on his inner aspects of the wrist, the dorsal surface of the hands, and legs and progressed to involve proximal aspects of the extremities. There was no significant past history. On examination, multiple pearly white papules and depigmented atrophic plaques were found bilaterally on the flexors of the arms and the extensors of the legs. The lesions were arranged in a linear manner, following the lines of Blaschko (Figures 1 and 2). The surface of the atrophic plaques was notable for prominent telangiectasia, giving an erythematous appearance. The genitalia, oral cavity, palms, and soles were spared. Systemic examination was noncontributory. Lichen striatus and extragenital lichen sclerosus (ELS) were considered the differential diagnosis. Clinically, the age of the patient, the absence of scaling, and the presence of atrophic plaques and telangiectasia were in favor of ELS. A punch biopsy from an atrophic plaque was performed, and it revealed hyperkeratosis, atrophic epidermis, basal layer vacuolar degeneration, mild lymphocytic infiltration in the dermis, edema, and homogenization of collagen of the upper portion of the dermis (Figures 3 and Figure 4). Histopathologic findings were consistent with lichen sclerosus. A diagnosis of bilateral zosteriform ELS was made.","758":"A 92-year-old man presented for evaluation with a 1-month history of a rapidly growing asymptomatic pink nodule on his forearm. Biopsy results of the lesion demonstrated pathology consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Immunohistochemical studies displayed positive cytoplasmic staining for cytokeratin AE1\/AE3, positive dot-like perinuclear staining for cytokeratin-20, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for neuron specific enolase, and no significant staining for S-100. Subsequent positron emission tomography did not reveal evidence of metastatic disease. Wide excision of the lesion was performed along with a sentinel node biopsy of his left axilla. The sentinel nodes were negative for MCC. Adjuvant radiation treatment of the tumor site was provided because the pathologist noted MCC within 2 mm of the deep margin.","759":"A 2-year-old girl patient was admitted with intractable diarrhea, respiratory infections, and seizures. She was the first child of the first-degree parents. She was born at term with a birth weight of 2300 g. Physical examination revealed weight 6800 g, height 76 cm, and head circumference 41 cm, below the third percentile. Findings included sparse and dull hair, nail dystrophy, and proximally located thumbs (Figure). Aphthous lesions were observed on the oral mucosa. Neurologic examination disclosed poor head control.

He had iron deficiency anemia, a slow-growing anal wart for many years, and intermittent bleeding and pruritus. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy findings were normal. Endoscopic ultrasound of the anorectum showed no anal sphincter involvement, and computed tomography did not reveal any pelvic inguinal lymph nodes. Wide-staged excision was performed and the patient recovered well with resolution of symptoms and no local recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Final pathology confirmed human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 strain and a giant condyloma acuminatum with mild atypia and no malignancy. Further examination of his oropharynx showed additional small HPV lesions, which were removed locally.","761":"A 30-year old man with no trauma history presented to our department of dermatology with a 2-year history of abdominal painful masses. The spontaneous pain and tenderness in the abdominal region gradually worsened. Physical examination revealed 3 firm, irregular subcutaneous nodules measuring 1 x 0.5 cm, which were movable and unattached to the overlying skin. One of the nodules was ulcerated (Figure 1). Histopathologic examination showed spindle-shaped fibroblast cells intermingled with gangliocyte-like giant cells in the hypodermis with an infiltrate made of lymphocytes and histiocytes (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The immunohistochemical staining showed the negativity of the fusiform cells and the gangliocyte-like cells to anti-S100 protein and to anti-smooth muscle actin.","762":"","763":"A 31-year-old man presented with a history of extensive thickened skin of the palms and soles since the age of 7. The patient reported difficulty in ambulating and in using his hands secondary to his skin condition and associated pain. He also reported being seen by numerous specialists in the past for his hands, feet, and fingernails. He tried various topical medications, none of which were successful in minimizing the lesions on the hands and feet. Pertinent review of systems was positive for complete deafness diagnosed at 9 months of age. The patient did not speak and used sign language to communicate. His family history was significant for two brothers, both of whom are deaf and who have a similar skin condition of their hands and feet, but with lesser severity than the patient. The patient had no other medical issues.","764":"","765":"","766":"","767":"","768":"Several studies have described a wide spectrum of hyperandrogenism diseases, many of which are difficult to distinguish from each other. In order to better understand diseases of hyperandrogenism, the authors performed a retrospective study of the cutaneous features and metabolic findings in women with hyperandrogenism. A retrospective chart analysis compiled by three dermatologists in both academic and private settings was performed, including patients presenting with &gt; or = 2 manifestations of hyperandrogenism. Relevant dermatologic and associated manifestations and laboratory and imaging study findings were reviewed. Moderate to severe acne was the most common manifestation. Other common manifestations that patients first presented with include hirsutism, acanthosis nigricans, androgenic alopecia, and skin tags. Oligomenorrhea was the most common systemic presenting sign. Statistical analysis of various clinical markers revealed correlations with hyperandrogenemia. Acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism were found to be useful clinical markers for hyperandrogenism, whereas androgenic alopecia was not. This study provides some insights into the presentation and diverse manifestations seen in hyperandrogenism.","769":"","770":"","771":"","772":"","773":"","774":"","775":"A 10-year-old boy presented to us with a localized patch of hair loss on the scalp, first noticed by his mother a few months after birth.

There was no history of any trauma to the site. There was no family history of any similar lesion or any associated systemic problems. On examination, grouped comedonal lesions were seen over a patch of partial alopecia located on the occipital area of the scalp (Figure 1). There was no evidence of inflammation. Systemic examination was normal. Biopsy specimen from the lesion on the scalp showed foci of wide and deep invaginations of the epidermis filled with keratin.

Although most BCCs are easily treated by surgical methods, these lesions occasionally progress to an advanced state that is no longer conducive to surgery or radiation therapy. Even more rarely, the lesions spread to distant sites. Until recently, treatment for locally advanced and metastatic BCC were restricted to chemotherapy and radiation; however, the effectiveness of traditional chemotherapeutic methods in treating locally advanced or metastatic BCC is limited at best. Recent discoveries in the fields of molecular biology have found important pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of BCC. Among these are the epidermal growth factor receptor and hedgehog pathways, which are now being targeted by new biologic therapies. Despite a paucity of phase II and III trial data, preliminary evidence demonstrating the disease-stabilizing ability of biologic therapies in locally advanced and metastatic BCC appears promising.","782":"Surface-active agents (surfactants) form the foundation of an effective detergent formulation. As such, surfactants are a major component of laundry detergents. Depending on multiple factors, the amount of residual detergent surfactants in clothing after washing varies but may be sufficient to elicit skin irritation in susceptible individuals and in patients with existing dermatologic disorders. The goal of this review is to examine the relationship between surfactants commonly used in laundry detergent formulations and their potential for skin irritancy. In this context, the role of surfactants in achieving broad-spectrum cleaning performance in laundry is discussed, and currently available methodologies to evaluate and measure the effect of surfactant exposure on the skin are reviewed.","783":"Topical dapsone 5% gel for the treatment of mild to moderate acne has been shown to be effective in randomized controlled studies. A total of 101 adult women with mild to moderate facial inflammatory acne participated in a 12-week cohort study to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of dapsone gel 5% in this specific group who often complain of sensitive skin. The women were instructed to apply dapsone 5% gel twice daily after washing their face with a standard noncomedogenic soap-free cleanser. Treatment outcome was evaluated using physician-scored Global Acne Assessment Scale (GAAS) and patient-reported facial skin condition. Ninety-three women completed the study (6 were lost to follow-up and 2 had mild skin irritation). At 12 weeks, significant physician GAAS scores (t55 = 8.85, P = .001) and patient-reported lesion reductions were shown. Treatment success (GAAS 0 or 1) at 12 weeks was achieved in 69.4% (n = 75) of women (t94 = 4.17, P = .001), improving patient-reported quality-of-life aspects. Topical dapsone gel 5% was shown to be safe, minimally irritating, and effective in the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory facial acne in adult women with sensitive skin.","784":"","785":"","786":null,"787":"A 58-year-old, nonalcoholic, nonsmoker, official in private enterprise presented with a confirmed case of human immunodeficiency virus\/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV\/AIDS) and an itchy, violaceous skin eruption over the lower part of the left leg. He noticed a change in the color and texture of the skin for the first time 2 years ago. Ever since that time, the eruptions had insidiously progressed. He was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), comprising 600 mg of zidovudine, 300 mg of lamivudine, and 600 mg of efavirenz for the past year. Despite the therapy, the lesions continued to progress. He claimed to be very compliant with therapy. In addition, he developed pulmonary tuberculosis during the course of the disease. Accordingly, he was treated with a daily schedule' of antitubercular therapy, comprising 450 mg of rifampicin, 300 mg of isoniazid, 1500 mg of pyrazinamide, and 800 mg of ethambutol for 9 months. He experienced a significant loss of weight and appetite. The patient was a divorcee but refused to divulge any details of his married life after a considerate and focused discussion by a trained counselor on HIV\/AIDS. He emphatically denied any extramarital sexual contact, blood transfusion, and surgery in the past. Ultimately, the patient's disease status was defined by HIV viral load (&lt; 20 copy\/mL) after obtaining informed consent.","788":"A 19-month-old boy presented to our department with ulcerated plaque on the right lumbar region. The lesion was known to have been growing for about 5 months. At another center 9 months prior to presenting to our department, the patient's parents reported a history of cutaneous nodules from the same lumbar region. Their total excision was performed, and the pathology report stated that it was infantile calcifying fibromatosis or nodular fasciitis. The patient was healthy with a nonsignificant, medical history including no use of medications, no known drug allergies, and no significant family history of disease.","789":"A 7-year-old boy from El Salvador presented with several well-demarcated 3- to 4-cm round to oval, grey-brown patches on his shoulder and trunk (Figure a) that appeared simultaneously about 1 year previously. The lesions were red initially and thought by the patient's mother and primary care physicians to be bruises, but a hematologist's evaluation was unremarkable. The erythema soon subsided, leaving persistent light-brown spots on the torso. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic.","790":"A 26-year-old man presented with a scar at the site of a pigmented lesion treated with DermaTend (Solace Interntational, Inc., Reno, NV), an over-the-counter mole removal cream. According to the patient, the pigmented lesion had been present since childhood, was asymptomatic, and had not changed in appearance. It remained cosmetically displeasing to him. In an effort to remove the lesion, he had applied DermaTend on a daily basis for several weeks, at which point he noticed a scar at the site of treatment.","791":"","792":"","793":"","794":"","795":"","796":"Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign vascular tumors of infancy. Their hallmark feature is the spontaneous involution over months to years after an initial rapid proliferation. The exact origin of infantile hemangiomas and the pathogenetic mechanism(s) of their life cycle are still unknown, but recent findings, including multipotent hemangioma-derived stem cells, vasculogenic activity, and response to hypoxic stimuli, give new insights into this common yet puzzling vascular tumor. beta-Blockers have been recently introduced as effective therapy alongside conventional modalities, such as corticosteroids and lasers. Better understanding of the pathogenesis is needed in the future to ensure a more focused treatment approach with high efficacy and good safety.","797":"The authors sought to investigate androgenic alopecia (AA) utilizing clinical and investigative procedures to establish the pattern of AA in the Indian subcontinent. A total of 35 consecutive women presenting with AA were included. After obtaining informed consent, a detailed history\/examination, hair pull test, trichogram, and a scalp biopsy were performed in patients. AA classification was attempted across Ludwig and Norwood guidelines. Of 35 women, 16 had grade I, 10 had grade II, and 1 had grade III Ludwig classification. In addition, 6 other women had Christmas tree baldness: 1 each of fronto-parietal and male pattern baldness. Several investigations including hormonal profile were inconclusive; however, hair pull test and trichogram may be helpful in understanding the sequence in AA in women. AA has infrequently been reported, particularly India and in Asia in general.","798":"Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentation disorder affecting 1% to 4% of the population worldwide. The chronic nature of the disease, long-term treatment, and lack of uniform effective therapy are demoralizing for patients with vitiligo, leading to decreased self-image and depression. Prevalence and severity of depression in vitiligo patients was studied by self-administered questionnaires distributed in dermatology departments in Qassim Region. Modified Beck Depression Inventory Scale was the tool used in the questionnaire to study and classify depressive symptoms. A total of 308 vitiligo patients participated in our study, including 59.7% men and 40.3% women. According to the Beck Depression Scale, 54.5% were found to be depressed, most with mild depression. Depression was more prevalent in single patients, especially women in the first few years of the disease (P &lt; .05). Age, sex, duration of disease, marital status, and educational level were significant factors that influenced severity and prevalence of depression. Assistance of a psychiatrist or psychologist is of crucial importance in taking care of vitiligo patients, especially in high-risk individuals.","799":"","800":"","801":"","802":"A 37-year-old white man diagnosed with multiple myeloma was admitted for respiratory distress. He was found to have hypercalcemia (13.1 mg\/dL), hyperphosphatemia (7.2 mg\/dL), hyponatremia (121 mEq\/L), and acute renal failure (serum urea nitrogen, 116 mg\/dL; creatinine, 4.9 mg\/dL). On hospital day 7, skin lesions over his elbows, wrists, and fingers were noticed and the dermatology department was consulted. Physical examination revealed 0.5- to 3.0-cm erythematous denuded patches with yellow crusts at the periphery that were localized to the bilateral interdigital web spaces, medial elbows, and volar wrists (Figure 1 and Figure 2). No oral mucosal or conjunctival findings were present. Results from skin biopsies of the lesions revealed focal epidermal necrosis with zones of amorphous basophilic material that focally appeared to perforate the epidermis (Figure 3). Results from Congo red and Verhoeff-van Gieson stains were negative, and results from Von Kossa stain were positive, confirming the perforating material as calcium. Ten days after initial dermatology examination, the patient's respiratory distress worsened and he subsequently died. Autopsy revealed diffuse pulmonary calcinosis and renal tubular calcification. As a result of the autopsy findings, the patient was diagnosed with perforating metastatic calcinosis cutis.","803":"A 19-year-old Caucasian man presented with numerous erythematous to flesh-colored papules that appeared in crops on his neck, axillae, buttocks, and lower back. The lesions started on his anterior neck at age 12. At 18 years, new crops of papules appeared on his axillae, back, and buttocks over several months. He reported pruritus in the lesions following exercise and perspiration. He denied any family history of similar lesions. His primary care physician treated him with topical triamcinolone 0.1% cream, which made the lesions smaller, less erythematous, and less pruritic; however, the papules never fully resolved. After discontinuation of the steroids, these erythematous pruritic papules gradually recurred in the same areas of his body. The patient denied any other medical complaints.","804":"A 24-year-old man presented with multiple mildly itchy flesh-colored papules and plaques on both legs for the past decade. The lesions were preceded by transient vesicles that contained clear fluid. The papules and plaques used to develop on sites where vesicles had healed. Many family members in three generations had similar lesions (Figure 1). On examination, multiple discrete flesh-colored papules and plaques were found on both lower extremities, extending from the feet up to the knees (Figures 2 and 3). A few of the plaques were excoriated. No vesicles or bullae were noted, and the skin in between the lesions appeared normal. The nail of left great toe was discolored and dystrophic. The rest of the mucocutaneous examination was unremarkable. Bullous lichen planus, Neckam's disease, lichenoid amyloidosis, and epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) were considered as differential diagnoses. Histopathology from the plaque showed a subepidermal cleft with no inflammatory cells. The epidermis was acanthotic at places, and the dermis appeared normal (Figure 4a and 4b). Based on clinical presentation and histopathology, a diagnosis of EBP was made.","805":"A 26 year-old woman presented with asymptomatic multiple skin-colored eruptions affecting the vulva. She claimed that the lesions had started at the age of 15. The eruptions have been increasing in size and extent since her presentation. There was a family history of similar eruptions around the eyes of one of her sisters. Examination of the skin surface was marked by the presence of multiple, 2- to 3-cm firm, skin-colored, nodules on the labia majora (Figure 1). They were bilateral and symmetrical. One of the lesions was excised, and histopathologic serial sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections showed clusters of small comma-shaped ducts lined by 2 cell-thick epithelium surrounded by a fibrotic stroma. Solid strands of basophilic epithelial cells independent of ducts were documented in the dermis (Figure 2). Accordingly, a diagnosis of syrangoma was made.","806":"Our patient is a 29-year-old woman without any previous disease who presented with different kinds of lesions on her face, neck, and chest. She first noticed the lesions 10 years ago and, since that time, they have become more numerous. She has no affected relatives. On physical examination, she had multiple cystic lesions on her neck, chest, and vulva, which were between 0.3 cm and 1 cm and skin-colored or yellowish (Figure 1). She presented with small, white papules on her face measuring approximately 0.2 cm, localized on her forehead and cheeks. Some of these papules had a blueish appearance (Figure 2). She also presented clinically typical eruptive syringomas on her upper and lower eyelids and neck and multiple facial milia. Finally, a sacrococcygeal pilonidal cyst was diagnosed and surgically removed. Her nails and teeth were clinically normal. Biopsies of each kind of lesion were performed, with the following results: (1) neck cystic lesion: steatocystoma; (2) small, white facial papule: eccrine hidrocystoma; (3) blueish facial papule: apocrine hidrocystoma; and (4) small neck papule: syringoma (Figure 3). With these findings, our diagnosis was steatocystoma multiplex with multiple eccrine and apocrine hidrocystomas, eruptive syringomas, and sacrococcygeal pilonidal cyst.","807":"","808":"","809":"","810":"","811":"The process of aging induces the transformation of the face with changes that are usually classified as either chronological or photo-induced and that affect the shape, the texture, and the color of the face. Facial shape is mainly transformed by the evolution of bones and soft tissues (muscles, fat, and skin) in addition to noticeable effects of gravity. Skin texture is mainly determined by wrinkles, which arise from atrophy of the skin layers, elastosis, and facial expressions. Skin color is related to the distribution of skin chromophores and the structure of the dermis, which affects light scattering. All facial changes are dependant on sex, ethnicity, and lifestyle. They affect self-perception and social interactions and can sometimes be slowed down or reversed using appropriate clinical procedures (eg, dermatological, surgical, cosmetic interventions).","812":"There are no large-scale studies ofpolypharmacy (PP) in dermatology. The authors examined trends in PP (simultaneous use of &gt; or = 4 medications in our study) and associated clinical factors among a nationally representative sample of 46,273 (weighted count +\/- standard error [SE]: 617,970,596 +\/- 25,187,959) dermatology-related (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 680-709) patient visits from 1995 to 2009. Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey were examined. The overall frequency (+\/- SE) of PP was 8.9% +\/- 0.4%. There was almost a doubling in the frequency of PP in dermatology from 1995 to 2009 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-2.44, after controlling for comorbidities and sex). This increase was noted among patients with &gt; 1 diagnoses, and all age groups including the younger than 25 age category (PP frequency +\/- SE, 7.4% +\/- 0.4%; OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.88), and not just among patients in the geriatric age range with multiple complex dermatologic problems. Some of the most frequent conditions in the PP group included acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, conditions that are known to be affected by psychodermatologic factors. PP among these patients may in part be an indication of their complex presentation caused by psychosocial vs dermatopathologic factors.","813":"The use of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has recently been advocated in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis as it may help in faster regeneration of detached skin. Three patients who presented with toxic epidermal necrolysis were managed as per the protocol followed at our department. In addition, they received recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in a dose of 300 microg\/d (5 microg\/ kg\/d) for 5 days. Severity of Illness Score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis was calculated on day 1 and the lesions were observed for re-epithelialization. The 3 patients were aged 16 years, 20 years, and 65 years, with the latter showing leucopenia at presentation. All 3 patients showed a significant rise in total leukocyte count (reaching up to 45,000\/mm3) after administering recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, with the rise being comparatively less in the third patient (maximum of 12,000\/mm3). A similar pattern was seen in re-epithelialization of skin, with rapid re-epithelialization occurring in the first 2 patients and much slower re-epithelialization in the third. The first two survived but the third died from refractory sepsis. Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor improves epithelialization of skin and should be used for treating toxic epidermal necrolysis irrespective of the leucopenic status of the patient.","814":"","815":"","816":"An 89-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic translucent blue mass noticed 1 year prior to evaluation.

Physical evaluation revealed a 4-mm firm light blue translucent papule on the left medial canthus (Figure 1). No cervical or axillary adenopathy was present. No further lesions were identified during full body skin examination, including chest wall masses. A diagnostic study was performed and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Figure 2) and periodic acid-Schiff (Figure 3).","817":"A 55-year-old man was admitted to us with a sense of numbness, tingling, and burning in his feet and headache, characterized as a feeling of pressure all around his head, for 1 year and aggravated in the past 3 months. The patient's neurologic examination was normal and he had no other known diseases except for hypertension according to his medical history. During the examination, we recognized purplish lesions on the patient's body. His kidney, liver, and thyroid function test results and vitamin B12 levels were all normal. His hematocrit level was 41.8%, platelet value was 234,000 (150,000-500,000); and sedimentation rate was 9 mm\/h (0-20). Electromyography was performed and results were found to be normal. The patient was diagnosed as having small fiber neuropathy. Dermatologic examination revealed reddish blue mottling of the skin with fishnet reticular pattern on his back, on the front side of the body, and on both arms and legs, and the lesions were classified as livedo racemosa (Figure 1). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed subcortical hyperintense ischemic-gliotic signal changes on T2-FLAIR in the deep white matter of bilateral frontoparietal vertex, centrum semiovale, and corona radiata (Figure 2). FLAIR sequence axial MRI of the brain of our patient showed subcortical hyperintense lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. His cardiac examination was normal and minimal aortic regurgitation was seen on echocardiography. His cognitive assessment Minimental Test Score was 22, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 18. Laboratory values for inflammatory markers and autoimmune antibodies including syphilis serology, lupus anticoagulants, and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Factor V Leiden mutation was not detected in the patient. The patient was diagnosed with Sneddon's syndrome with the above signs and symptoms and small fiber neuropathy.

Hair loss in women has accordingly been interpreted and classified differently than that in men. The Ludwig scale is the most accepted classification. The gross anatomy and the general microanatomy of the hair follicle, including that of the anagen, catagen, and telogen phase, are presented. The hair growth cycle, encompassing anagen, catagen, telogen, exogen, and kenogen, is also discussed to address pattern hair loss in women and provide therapeutic options that are currently available.","823":"There are 25.8 million people with diabetes in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet). This number is expected to increase by 1 million per year. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) occur in patients with a history of poorly controlled blood glucose. Almost 30% of people with diabetes aged 40 years or older experience DFUs caused by an impaired nerve sensation. It is one of the more persistent types of chronic wounds, which poses an economic burden on individuals and society and reduces the quality of life of patients and their families. This paper reviews the efficacy of nutrition supplementation in diabetic wound healing, including both human and animal studies. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methods, the search was conducted in PubMed and ISI's Web of Science databases. Studies in which diabetic wounds\/foot ulcers were treated with specific nutritional or herbal suplements were selected. This review includes 4 human and 9 animal studies that met the criteria of the search. Positive outcomes in the human studies were not significant while the nutritional supplements used in the animal studies were effective and promoted wound healing. The most notable effect of supplementation with curcumin, L-Arginine, or vitamin E have been shown in animal sudies. More human studies need to be conducted to determine the efficacy of these nutritional supplements in promoting wound healing.","824":"Natural arsenic pollution is a major global health problem. The two worst affected areas e Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. Arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen that affects many organs including the skin. The authors sought to find out the clinical patterns of different malignant and premalignant conditions associated with chronic arsenicosis from drinking contaminated ground water in a group of patients from eastern India. This was a clinical observational study. Patients with chronic arsenicoses with suspected cutaneous malignancies for whom dermatology service was sought were enrolled in the study. A total of 24 patients (male to female ratio, 11:1; age range, 32-71 years; mean age, 52.2 years) were evaluated. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the commonest malignancies in our series, seen in 10 (41.7%) patients. This was followed by Bowen's disease (9 [37.5%]) and basal cell carcinoma (8 [33.3%]). Three patients (12.5%) had &gt; 1 type of cutaneous malignancies. Multicentric lesions were seen in 3 cases. The most common site of involvement was the chest (8 [33.3%]). No statistically significant correlation was found between number of lesions and arsenic content in the hairs and nails of the patients.","825":"Inflammation is a key component in the pathogenesis of sulfur mustard (SM)-induced skin complications. Here, the levels of interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were evaluated in patients with chronic SM-induced complications. Seventy-four serum samples were collected from SM-injured veterans (SM group; n = 37) and nonchemically injured patients (control group; n = 37) with skin pruritus. The levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were evaluated by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay technique in both nil and mitogen medium. No significant difference was found in pruritus score between SM (74.16 +\/- 5.93) and control (74.48 +\/- 6.15) groups (P &gt; .05). The mean serum concentrations of IL-2 and IL-6 were found to be significantly elevated in the control compared with the SM group (P &lt; .05). However, no significant difference was observed between the study groups regarding serum levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (P &gt; .05). Serum IL-2 (in both SM and control groups) and IL-6 (in the control group) concentrations were significantly correlated with pruritus score while no significant association was found for IL-4 and IL-10. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 are significantly decreased in SM-exposed patients with chronic pruritus. Such alterations might represent a plausible mechanism for tissue damage and skin itching following SM exposure. Therefore, variation of ILs may also contribute to skin pruritus induced by SM.","826":"","827":"","828":"","829":"","830":"A 74-year-old man presented with muscle weakness in both legs for a duration of 2 months.

Results from anti-SS A\/SS B antibodies, anti Jo-1 antibody, U1-snRNP antibody, and anti-ds DNA antibody tests were negative. A skin biopsy specimen obtained from the right antecubital fossa showed minimal orthokeratosis and subepidermal detachments. There was marked edema in the dermis and lymphocyte infiltration around the skin appendages (Figure 2). Direct immunofluorescence studies demonstrated scattered staining for C3 and IgM at the basal membrane zone. Results for IgG, IgA, and fibrin staining were negative. Muscle biopsy from left deltoid muscle was performed and some muscle fibers were demonstrated to be atrophied. There was remarkable difference between muscle fiber diameters. With Masson staining, there was increased connective tissue and no inflammation. Electromyography (EMG) showed a myogenic pattern. Nerve conduction studies showed tibial, median, ulnar, peroneal motor neuropathy, and median, ulnar, and sural sensory neuropathy. Based on these findings, diagnosis of vesiculo-bullous dermatomyositis (DM) was made. Further investigation of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy revealed ulcerated lesions on antrum and corpus and these were assessed as Helicobacter pylori-negative atrophic chronic gastritis. No pathologic findings were described on chest, abdomen, and pelvic tomography. Levels of tumor markers were within normal ranges. Overall, no sign of malignancy was detected. Methyl prednisolone treatment of 1 mg\/kg\/d was started; however, new bullous lesions erupted while the original lesions were healing.","831":"A 40-year-old woman presented with red swelling of the right mandibular region of the face.

Clinical variants include classic LPP, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and the Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lassueur syndrome. The pathogenesis of LPP remains to be fully elucidated, but like other cicatricial alopecias involves the irreversible destruction of hair follicle stem cells and loss of a hair follicle's capacity to regenerate itself In the early stages of LPP, patients may have scalp pruritus, burning, tenderness, and increased hair shedding. A scalp biopsy shows a lymphocytic infiltrate involving the isthmus and infundibulum. Apoptotic cells present in the external root sheath and concentric fibrosis surrounds the hair follicle. Treatment is prescribed with the goal to alleviate patient symptoms and to halt the progression of hair loss. Treatment involves use of potent topical corticosteroids and\/or intralesional corticosteroids. Options for systemic treatment include anti-inflammatory agents such as hydroxychloroquine, tetracyclines, pioglitazones, and immunosuppressive medications such as cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, or systemic corticosteroids. Hair transplantation may also be an option if the disease has been in clinical remission. The management of LPP can sometimes be challenging and additional research is needed to improve outcomes for patients.","838":"Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales, mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. Cutaneous mucormycosis is the third most common clinical form of the disease, after pulmonary and rhino-cerebral. The usual factors predisposing to this infection are hematological malignancies and diabetes mellitus, but a significant proportion of patients are immunocompetent. The agents of mucormycosis are ubiquitous in nature and are transmitted to the skin by direct inoculation, as a result of various types of trauma. These include needle sticks, stings and bites by animals, motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters, and burn injuries. The typical presentation of mucormycosis is the necrotic eschar, but it can present with various other signs. The infection can be locally invasive and penetrate into the adjacent fat, muscle, fascia, and bone, or become disseminated. Diagnosis is difficult because of the nonspecific findings of mucormycosis. Biopsy and culture should be performed. The treatment of mucormycosis is multimodal and consists of surgical debridement, use of antifungal drugs (amphotericin B and posaconazole), and reversal of underlying risk factors, when possible. Mortality rates, although lower than in other forms of the disease, are significant, ranging from 4% to 10% when the infection is localized.","839":null,"840":"Pityriasis rosea is an acute self-limiting papulosquamous skin disorder of unknown etiology.

He had a 10-year history of these lesions. The initial plaque appeared on the back followed by rapid progression of multiple similar lesions involving the face, chest, abdomen, and extremities. The plaques on his face were predominately in the periorbital and eyelid regions. Skin biopsy revealed an ulcerated epidermis. Dense sheets of foamy histiocytes were present in the dermis and contained foci of necrobiosis. Numerous Touton giant cells were present and cholesterol clefts were prominent. Special stains for organisms were negative. On further laboratory evaluation, serum protein electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal spike of 0.5 g\/dL IgG lambda. Results from bone marrow biopsy were negative. Other significant laboratory findings included an elevated sedimentation rate and low serum complement. Clinical findings, histopathology, and laboratory evaluations were consistent with the diagnosis of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG).","845":"","846":"","847":"","848":"Lichen planus pigmentosus, a variant of lichen planus, is a disorder with conflicting taxonomy. Its worldwide recognition is still not fully understood because of insufficient contemporary evidence of the disease in the literature. The authors review the historical background, etiopathogenesis, clinical connotation, atypical variants, and histopathology to highlight its diversity.","849":"Persistent serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation (PSSH) describes a hyperpigmentation of the skin overlying peripheral veins. This cutaneous finding is typically seen in association with systemic chemotherapy or collagen vascular diseases such as progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Three dark-skinned patients with idiopathic serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation (ISSH) without collagen vascular disease or prior intravenous cytotoxic treatments were reported. All 3 patients were dark-skinned men with symmetric, uniform hyperpigmentation of the supravenous network of the bilateral lower extremities that had been present for years. The serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation on the lower extremities was uniform in width and color, which contrasts with the darker discoloration near the site of infusion seen with PSSH associated with chemotherapy. Interestingly, 2 of the patients had advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in association with their ISSH while the HIV status of the third patient was unknown. Thus, we contend that ISSH be considered a normal racial variant or a possible cutaneous manifestation of HIV disease.","850":"The aim of this randomized, double-blind, controlled study was to evaluate the antidandruff activity exerted by a new shampoo on patients affected by dandruff and\/or mild seborrheic dermatitis by means of both D-squame technique coupled with image analysis and clinical assessments. Thirty-four patients were enrolled and 1:1 randomly assigned to either a test shampoo or a comparative shampoo group. Treatment schedule was twice a week for 4 weeks. The D-squame technique was shown to be able to objectively record variations in scalp desquamation both between test and comparative groups and within the same group over time. The results obtained with this instrumental approach showed a statistically significant reduction by 52% vs baseline after 2 weeks of treatment. There was an even greater reduction after 4 weeks (-66%). This reduction was statistically significant compared with the comparative group at the same time points. The analysis of all the other parameters (except Wood's lamp) confirmed the superiority of the test vs the comparative shampoo. The test shampoo proved to be safe, well tolerated, and accepted by the patients for cosmetic acceptability and efficacy. The study confirmed the antidandruff efficacy of the test shampoo and its superiority vs the comparative shampoo.","851":"","852":"","853":"An otherwise healthy 45-year-old man with a 3-year history of poorly controlled psoriasis (no arthritis) was treated with etanercept 50-mg subcutaneous injections twice weekly for 3 months and then once weekly. Alternative treatment options were either unavailable (long commute for phototherapy) or contraindicated (history of alcohol abuse). The patient initially tolerated etanercept well with significant clinical improvement and had an uneventful course; however, approximately 18 months after initiating therapy, he abruptly developed dusky, indurated, and tender plaques on his abdomen and thighs at the sites of etanercept injections (Figure 1). There was also diffuse woody induration involving his flanks and back where injections had not been performed. His only recent prior exposure to an injectable medication was rabies vaccination in his arm 1 year earlier. The patient denied any systemic symptoms. Upon noting these findings, etanercept was immediately discontinued. Biopsy of an indurated plaque on his right lower abdomen revealed a superficial and deep perivascular lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate in a background of thickened and hyalinized collagen fibers with notable loss of perieccrine fat (Figure 2). These features were most consistent with the inflammatory stage of morphea. Further work-up revealed a negative antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere. Borrelia titers were not obtained. The differential diagnosis included scleredema and scleromyxedema; serum and urine protein electrophoresis were within normal limits. The sites were treated with intralesional corticosteroids. During the next 3 months, there was minimal progression of disease although the plaques of morphea had not yet resolved.","854":"Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common dermatologic condition resulting from long-term sun exposure. It is considered a precancerous lesion that may convert into a squamous cell carcinoma, which highlights the importance of prompt identification, early treatment and eradication of AK, and recurrence monitoring. Currently, there are many treatments available for widespread AKs that include a combination of local lesion destruction along with stimulation of an individual's immune response. Preliminary data from combination therapy studies demonstrate that these may offer improved efficacy, tolerability, and long-term results compared with monotherapy. The authors investigate combination systems aimed at intensifying photodynamic therapy for the treatment of AKs as reported at the 8th World Congress of the International Academy of Cosmetic Dermatology in Cancun, Mexico, and include a comprehensive literature review. Further investigations and data collection are in progress in order to solidify these promising results.","855":"","856":"","857":"","858":"Hair may be a source of concern for patients when there is a change in its texture, amount, or thickness. It can present in women as androgenic alopecia also called female pattern baldness, and in men as adrogenic alopecia, also called male pattern baldness. Thinning\/rarefaction affecting the vertex is a progressive condition, and hair loss in women has been interpreted and classified differently from that in men. The Ludwig classification for women's hair loss seems to be the most accepted assessment, which will be outlined in this review, along with the hair growth cycle that encompasses anagen, catagen, telogen, exogen, and kenogen.","859":"","860":"Localized facial fat deposits are common, and treatment to restore and reshape the lower aspect of the face is mainly limited to surgical procedures. There has been a rapid growth in nonsurgical aesthetic procedures, and physicians and patients are seeking less invasive, nonsurgical facial rejuvenation options. Few data are published, however, on physician and patient perceptions and treatment of submental fat. This contribution reviews data from surveys of 78 physicians (dermatologists and plastic surgeons) and 385 patients who received nonsurgical facial rejuvenation. On average, physicians discussed fat reduction options with 19% of their patients; 18% of these discussions involved fat under the chin. Most patients surveyed (80%) had submental fat, assessed by a clinician using a 5-point rating scale. Submental fat was of concern to patients surveyed; 77% reported noticing extra fat under their chin and 61% wanted it reduced. Most patients (63%) surveyed would use an effective and well-tolerated noninvasive pharmacologic treatment for submental fat reduction. Patients were more likely to wish to reduce the fat below their chin if they had higher chin grade scores based on clinician assessment. Interesting insights are provided into the perceptions and behavior of physicians and patients with regard to submental fat reduction.","861":"This study assessed the bioequivalence, using keratolytic efficacy, of topical preparations studied in humans using adhesive tape stripping and biophysical methods. Ten healthy patients (3 men and 7 women [7 Caucasians and 3 Asians] mean age, 47 years) completed the study. Each coded product was randomly applied to the back according to the designated time of each sample. In addition, an untreated site (normal skin), and an untreated occluded site (chamber only) served as controls. At the end of the application time, each site was rinsed with tap water and then covered with a plastic chamber for 6 hours. Following removal of the chamber, the site was stripped for protein assay and squamometry analysis. This extends previous observations discerning bioequivalence resulting from different active materials with varying mechanism of action and potency on the skin. Results showed no significant difference between tested products. The novel formulations were of equal keratolytic activity to the \"standard\" (comparator) and hence bioequivalent in keratolytic activity.","862":"","863":"","864":"","865":"","866":"A 55-year-old man presented with multiple gradually progressing asymptomatic swellings on his body for the preceding 6 months. He had no personal or family history of any skin disease. There was no systemic symptom apart from occasional constipation. Examination revealed multiple discrete, firm, nontender, skin-colored nodules of varying sizes, fixed to the skin but free from the underlying structures on his chest, abdomen, and back. The overlying skin of the nodules was erythematous at places (Figure 1). A solitary depigmented, nonanesthetic patch (measuring 3 cm x 3 cm) was noted around a central gray macule (4 mm x 4 mm) on his left shin (Figure 2). The surface of this lesion was otherwise normal. Wood's lamp examination of this area showed attenuation of pigmentation in the central area and total depigmentation surrounding it. No dyspigmented area was noted on Wood's lamp examination of the other areas. There was no abnormality of the orogenital mucosae. General examination revealed mild pallor and multiple discrete, nontender, firm lymph nodes, measuring 3 cm x 3 cm, attached to the skin in the left inguinal region. The overlying skin was normal. Ocular examination (including direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy) and otolaryngologic evaluation were normal. Proctoscopic examination revealed a reddish-black indurated mass at the right lateral wall of the lower third of the rectum. Examination of the other system was noncontributory. Complete hemogram showed mild anemia (hemoglobin % = 10 gm%) and raised ESR, (80 mm in the first hour; Westergren's method). Biochemistry panel was normal apart from raised levels of aspertate transaminase (78 U\/L), alanine transaminase (68 U\/L), alkaline phosphatase (386 U\/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (692 U\/L). Chest x-ray showed a rounded opacity in the left apical area suggestive of cannon-ball metastasis (Figure 3). Ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple liver nodules suggestive of hepatic metastasis. Findings from omputed tomography of the brain and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were normal. Colonoscopic examination did not reveal any colonic lesion. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the enlarged inguinal lymph node was suggestive of malignant melanoma (MM). Histopathologic examination of the excision biopsy specimen of a skin nodule showed a tumor mass in the dermis composed of nests of oval to polygonal cells with vesicular nuclei and large prominent nucleoli (Figure 4). Extensive areas of necrosis were also seen. The tumor cells contained brownish pigment that stained positively with Masson Fontana stain. Pearl's stain was negative. Excision biopsy of the depigmented patch on the left shin showed mild hyperkeratosis, proliferation of capillary-sized blood vessels in the dermis, and thick-walled blood vessels in the subcutaneous tissue (Figure 5). No cellular atypia or any other evidence of malignancy was noted in this specimen. Biopsy from the rectal growth was suggestive of MM. Tumor cells were positive for S100 and human melanin black 45. Based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and laboratory investigations, a diagnosis of metastatic MM (stage IV: T(x)N(3)M(1c)) with unknown primary site was made. Treatment was started with injection dacarbazine 250 mg\/m2 intravenous infusion daily for 5 days intended to be given every 3 weeks for palliation. The patient died 2 week after the first treatment with chemotherapy.","867":"An 11-year-old healthy red-haired girl presented with a 3-year history of hair loss and mild pruritus of her scalp. She had previously been diagnosed with trichotillomania. Cutaneous examination showed scant hair loss with neither crusting nor scaly lesions. The scalp hair was diffusely thin, dry, and brittle on the frontal, mid-parietal, and anterior occipital scalp (Figure 1A). A pull test was negative, and a significant number of hair shafts were not detached on repeated traction. Closer examination using a dermatoscope showed follicles with broken hair shafts. The dermatoscopic evaluation also showed frequent pinpoint black dots scattered among the terminal hair shafts at their bases. No scale, scar, or inflammatory changes were seen in the involved areas (Figure 1B). A 20% potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of material obtained after gentle scrapping of the black dots on the scalp provided fragments of hair fibers containing aggregates of pigmented yeast forms (Figure 2A) and brown septate hyphae (Figure 2B). Two samples were sent for fungal culture and both showed dark brown colonies on the surface and black coloration when viewed from the reverse side (Figure 3A). Lactophenol cotton blue preparation of the fungal colonies revealed long and septate hyphae with laterally branching conidiophores ending in round-shaped conidia (Figure 3B). The microorganism was identified by the reference laboratory as Cladosporium species. The conidia were usually noted to be single-celled with a distinct dark hilum. They also exhibited prominent attachment scars that caused the cells to appear \"shield-shaped.\" These features were considered to be diagnostic for Cladosporium; however, the reference laboratory could not identify the organism to the species level. The girl's Cladosporium scalp infection was treated with itraconazole at an oral daily dose of 200 mg for 2 months. Upon re-evaluation, she showed significant improvement with not only discontinuation of her alopecia and new hair growth (Figure 4A), but also an absence of broken hair shafts and the dark pigmentation found initially at their base when her scalp was examined using a dermatoscope (Figure 4B). In addition, a new KOH preparation did not reveal the presence of conidia.","868":"A 75-year-old man was treated with stereotactic radiation to 50 gray units in 4 fractions for stage IB non-small cell lung cancer. Radiotherapy was directed at the right lower lobe segment of the lung and lasted 4 days. He developed radiodermatitis, which completely resolved within a few weeks after radiotherapy was finished. Three months after completing radiation therapy, he developed a pruritic red lesion within his radiation port on his right mid back with the formation of blisters a week later. Two weeks after the onset of the patient's blisters, cutaneous examination showed individual and convergent erythematous papules and plaques with superficial scaling at sites of resolving vesicles located within the radiated area (Figures 1 and 2). The patient had neither symptoms of mycoplasma pneumoniae, nor lesions or history of present or past herpetic infection. Also, he had not recently been placed on any new medications, and he did not have any other erythema multiforme-associated risk factors. A biopsy from the erythematous lesions showed a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes in the dermis. The overlying epidermis contained necrotic keratinocytes and there was alteration of the basal layer. Correlation of the clinical presentation and pathologic changes established a diagnosis of erythema multiforme localized to the radiation port. The patient was treated with topical triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream twice daily for 10 days and once daily for 4 days. His lesions resolved and there was mild hyperpigmentation of the affected area.","869":"","870":"","871":"Adverse cutaneous drug reactions are a group with common morphology.

The authors report preliminary findings on the use of a new, medical-grade, film-forming silicone gel dressing approved for use on open wounds and injured skin as monotherapy and in combination with other treatments prior to re-epithelialization. An observational study involving 105 patients examined the silicone gel's effectiveness in promoting accelerated epithelialization, reducing the inflammatory response and in the prevention of scarring. The study was conducted on a range of dermatological surgical interventions. The authors' observations confirmed silicone's role in promoting accelerated wound healing, scar prevention, and the utility of this new film-forming silicone dressing when used in combination with various other treatment modalities.","873":"Psoriasis is a chronic and currently incurable inflammatory skin disease, affecting 2% to 3% of the US population. The cost of care in the United States for hospitalizations, outpatient physician visits, phototherapy, prescription therapies, and over-the-counter medications is estimated to be more than $650 million per year. Guidelines developed by the American Academy of Dermatology in 2009 state that approximately 80% of these patients with psoriasis have mild to moderate disease that can be managed with topical agents, including corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. Topical vitamin D analogs provide \"steroid-sparing\" effects and a favorable safety profile. Many experts, including a recent consensus conference, classify topical vitamin D agents as first-line therapy for psoriasis either as monotherapy or in combination with topical steroids due to a synergistic, complementary effectiveness. Vitamin D analogs are an indispensable component of the current physician's armamentarium for psoriasis treatment. This review, therefore, is oriented to give a comprehensive understanding of this group of drugs and display the available clinical data for each formulation.","874":"The purpose of this brief review is to summarize all in vitro, in vivo, and controlled clinical trials on green tea preparations and their uses in dermatology. An extensive literature search was carried out to identify in vivo and in vitro studies as well as clinical trials. Twenty studies were assessed and the results suggest that oral administration of green tea can be effective in the scavenging of free radicals, cancer prevention, hair loss, and skin aging plus protection against the adverse effects associated with psoralen-UV-A therapy. Topical application of green tea extract should be potentially effective for atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, rosacea, androgenetic alopecia, hirsutism, keloids, genital warts, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and candidiosis. There are promising results with the use of green tea for several dermatologic conditions; however, the efficacy of oral and topical green tea has not always been confirmed.","875":"Among the large variety of effects of acetylcysteine, several of them relate to cutaneous function in general and to sebaceous activity in particular. Due to the latter, a study was undertaken to investigate a possible effect of this substance in grade I acne. An analysis of the data from 99 patients in a double-blind study demonstrated that 5% acetylcysteine topical gel is significantly superior to placebo (P = .04) in reducing comedo counts. Comparable results were obtained in both sexes. This study indicates that acetylcysteine is an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of mild to moderate acne.","876":"This study examines whether sociodemographic factors and\/or hair attributes are better predictors of hair wash frequency. A total of 96 patients were recruited from the general dermatology outpatient clinic to complete an 18-item questionnaire by self-report. Three linear regression models were constructed and compared to determine whether sociodemographic factors, hair wash frequency, or a combination of the two would best predict wash frequency. Results showed that sociodemographic factors, specifically race, sex, and age group, are all better predictors of hair wash frequency than hair attributes such as hair type, texture, length, and scalp type (adjusted R2 = 0.59 vs 0.27, respectively).","877":"","878":"","879":"","880":"","881":"An 83-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of a gradually enlarging, reddish, crusted papule on her left medial epicanthus. Her medical history did not reveal any systemic disease. She gave no personal history of tuberculosis or any systemic symptoms, such as night sweat, weight loss, and pulmonary abnormalities. Her husband had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 30 years ago. A dermatologic examination revealed a 2.5 x 1.2-cm nontender, erythematous plaque with fine, white adherent scales on the left medial epicanthus (figure 1A). All laboratory values were within the normal range. Results from a tuberculin skin test were initially negative. A skin biopsy was performed, and a pathological examination demonstrated multiple noncaseating granulomas with various diameters in the reticular dermis and an infiltrate of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the surrounding dermis (figure 2). Periodic acid-Schiff, Ziehl-Nilsen, gram, and giemsa stains were negative for any microorganism. Leishman-Donovan-like bodies were observed within the epitheloid histiocytes that formed the granulomas. The pathological diagnosis was granulomatous dermatitis. The patient was diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) based on her clinical appearance and histopathological findings, although the parasite was not detected in the tissue specimens. Treatment with intralesional glucantime for 5 consecutive weeks did not improve her condition. By the end of the fifth week, the patient developed asymptomatic facial swelling and a 1.5 x 1.2-cm erythematous plaque in the left parotid area (figure 1B). An ultrasonographic examination demonstrated a 13 x 11 x 17-mm hypoechoic mass, which suggested pleomorphic adenoma. In addition, lymph nodes, the largest of which were 9 x 10 mm, were noted in the left cervical area. A skin biopsy from the erythematous plaque of the left parotid area demonstrated diffuse neutrophilic infiltration with formation of focal granulomas. Tuberculosis was suspected, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) was isolated from the culture. A tuberculin skin test was performed again, which was positive (12 mm). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 35 mm\/h, and all other laboratory tests were within normal limits. Pulmonary radiography and thoracic computerized tomography findings were normal. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasonographic examination of the parotid mass were performed, which revealed necrotic material with neutrophils and lymphocytes (figure 3). We treated the patient with a standard antituberculous regimen, comprising isoniazid 300 mg\/d, rifampin 600 mg\/d, ethambutol 1200 mg\/d, and pyrazinamide 1500 mg\/d. By the end of the second month of treatment, the patient improved considerably. There was a marked reduction in facial swelling, and the lesion on the left medial epicanthus regressed dramatically (Figure 4A and Figure 4B). No adverse effects of the medication occurred. An additional 7 months of therapy with isoniazid and rifampin was planned.","882":"In the outpatient department of the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (NIHMP) in Rome, Italy, and at the Italian Dermatological Hospital in Mekele, Ethiopia, from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009, 47 patients, adults, and children showing typical circular skin lesions referable to cupping were observed. The patients (32 men and 15 women) underwent complete dermatological examination, and their case histories were collected with the aid of a cultural mediator from the same linguistic or cultural area of the patient. The clinical picture included blue-red, circular erythematous spots, sometimes covered with crusts, consistent with recent cupping (figure 1 and figure 2). In some cases, particularly in older lesions, atrophic-cicatricial lesions and irregular, normal-color, slate gray, or hypochromic skin surface were observed (figure 3). Lesions were observed on the back, on the presternal region (figure 4), and, in case of pathologies causing abdominal swelling (i.e., kwashiorkor, intestinal parasitosis), on the abdomen (figure 5). The clinical pictures initially diagnosed as dermatophytoses or lesions caused by traumas or violence were later proved to be cupping-related outcomes or complications.","883":"A 29-year-old, normotensive, nondiabetic man presented with a 9-day history of a scaly, pruritic eruption involving the right chest, axilla, and arm. He had a history of herpes zoster involving the same areas about 4 weeks ago. The present eruption started after the herpetic lesions had healed. Examination revealed scaly, erythematous plaques and papules involving the right side of the chest, axilla, and arm in a dermatomal pattern (figure 1). Removal of the scales revealed underlying bleeding points (positive Auspitz sign). The rest of the body, including scalp, palms, soles, and nails, were normal. There was no history suggestive of psoriasis in any family member. Systemic examination and routine investigations were noncontributory. A clinical diagnosis of psoriasis was made and confirmed by histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy sample. The patient was prescribed a topical clobetasol cream and oral levocetirizine. The eruption resolved completely after 3 weeks. A 43-year-old normotensive, nondiabetic woman presented with a 2-day history of fever, arthalgias, and generalized erythematous dermatitis. Five days ago, the patient had a toothache for which she was prescribed injectable ampicillin. After receiving ampicillin for 3 days, she developed fever, myalgias, and arthalgias, which was followed several hours later by an erythematous eruption. The dermatitis started on the trunk and, over a period of several hours, progressed to involve the face and limbs. The eruption was slightly pruritic. History revealed herpes zoster 7 months ago involving left thoracic dermatomes, for which the patient was treated with valacyclovir (1 g thrice a day x 7 days) and analgesics. There was no history of post-zoster neuralgia. On examination, the patient was febrile (oral temperature 102 degrees F), her heart rate was 118 beats per minute, and her blood pressure was 110\/70 mm Hg. Cutaneous examination revealed an erythematous, maculopapular dermatitis involving the face and limbs in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern; the palms and soles were also bilaterally involved. The whole of the trunk was involved with erythematous and, in places, violaceous, maculopapular eruption except for a small area on the left side corresponding to T8 and T9 thoracic dermatomes (Figure 2). Complete blood cell counts revealed eosinophilia (9%) and liver function tests, kidney function tests, random blood sugar, routine urine examination, and blood and urine cultures were noncontributory. Histopathologic examination of lesional skin biopsy revealed an intense mononuclear cell infiltration with many eosinophils and an interface dermatitis with hydropic degeneration of basal keratinocytes, while in the spared area, only slight lymphocytic infiltration was present in a perivascular distribution. Based on the history and examination, a diagnosis of ampicillin-induced drug dermatitis was made. The ampicillin was stopped and the patient was put on a short course of oral prednisolone, antipyretics, and topical calamine. The patient was afebrile in 2 days and the eruption resolved completely in 8 days.","884":"","885":"","886":"","887":"","888":"","889":"Footwear dermatitis is an important aspect of contemporary dermatology.

Facial shape is mainly transformed by the evolution of bones and soft tissues (muscles, fat, and skin) in addition to noticeable effects of gravity. Skin texture is mainly determined by wrinkles, which arise from atrophy of the skin layers, elastosis, and facial expressions. Skin color is related to the distribution of skin chromophores and the structure of the dermis, which affects light scattering. All facial changes are dependant on sex, ethnicity, and lifestyle. They affect self-perception and social interactions and can sometimes be slowed down or reversed using appropriate clinical procedures (e.g., dermatological, surgical, and cosmetic interventions).","891":"","892":"","893":"","894":"","895":"","896":"A 32-year-old man was referred for acute onset of pruritic scaly eruptions in the axillae of 8 days' duration, which was unresponsive to topical clotrimazole. The lesions consisted of multiple, coalescent oval plaques of 1 cm to 6 cm in longest diameter (Figure 1 and Figure 2) with central clearing and typical collarette scales at the periphery (Figure 3). Other skin areas and mucosal surfaces were unaffected. His general and systemic examinations were normal. Family and past histories were unremarkable except for a \"ring worm-like patch\" on his lower aspect of the abdomen 4 months ago, which rapidly regressed. On further inquiry, he gave a history of an episode of fever, coryza, and headache 3 weeks earlier to his eruption on the abdomen, which resolved with conservative remedies and one paracetamol tablet. He remained asymptomatic until axillary lesions appeared. We made a provisional diagnosis of pityriasis rosea (PR). Investigations including scrapings for potassium hydroxide examination, complete blood cell counts, urinalysis, blood sugar, VDRL test, and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were all normal or non-reactive. As cutaneous biopsy revealed parakeratosis, epidermal spongiosis, dermal inflammatory cells, and extravasated red blood cells (Figure 4). The eruptions cleared within 8 days, following treatment with mometasone furoate cream and oral desloratidine 5 mg\/d, leaving post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. There was no recurrence for the next 6 months of observation. He was later lost to follow-up.","897":"A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic pain syndrome presented with a 3-day history of a painful \"rash\" that started on her face and spread to her legs. Further history revealed that she recently started a new medication, varenicline, 7 weeks prior to admission and had a long-standing history of intranasal cocaine use. Review of systems was significant for rhinitis, nasal congestion, joint pain, and a febrile episode 2 days prior to admission. Physical examination revealed centrally violaceous, tender, stellate, and retiform purpuric patches and plaques on her extremities, nasal dorsum, and cheeks. Approximately 1.0-centimeter tender purpuric nodules were noted on her bilateral second proximal interphalangeal joints. She was afebrile. Initial laboratory data revealed a mild leukopenia, normal serum urea nitrogen and creatinine without hematuria, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Further analysis showed a normal complement level, negative antinuclear antibody, human immunodeficiency virus, rapid plasma reagin, and hepatitis panel. Trace cryoglobenemia and a positive anti-streptolysin O were noted, along with a positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) (&gt; 8.0 U) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, or p-ANCA (1.5 U). The hypercoagulable workup was negative. A skin biopsy taken from the left thigh was consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. After several weeks of high-dose oral prednisone taper, the patient's symptoms improved, but flared upon discontinuation. On follow-up, she admitted to frequent relapses of cocaine abuse and had developed tender purpuric plaques on her nose, ears, and extremities, some with ulcerations (Figure 1 and Figure 2). She also had significant edema and joint pain that limited her ambulation. Further evaluation revealed normal chest x-ray results; however, computed tomography of her sinuses demonstrated thickened maxillary sinuses consistent with subacute\/ chronic sinusitis. She also developed hematuria. Mass spectrometry analysis ofhair and urine samples tested positive for cocaine and levamisole. A presumptive diagnosis of levamisole-induced Wegener's vasculitis was made. She was restarted on high-dose prednisone and methotrexate with improvement and advised to discontinue cocaine use, so as to avoid exposure to both substances.","898":"A 70-year-old woman urgently presented with severe eruptive skin dermatitis associated with fever and malaise 7 days after taking clindamycin for an unknown skin eruption. She had a 40-year-long history of well-controlled Hailey-Hailey disease. Physical examination revealed erythrodermic skin changes covering more than 80% of the patient's body surface, with hundreds of nonfollicular pustules. Many of the pustules fused into large bullae, involving the intertriginous as well as the extensor areas, sparing the mucosa. Her body temperature was 103 degrees F. Laboratory workup was significant for neutrophilia with a white cell count &gt; 10,000\/mm3.","899":"A 39-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a tender nodule on the umbilicus that had been present for 6 months. She stated that it had slowly been increasing in size and would occasionally open up and crust over with dried blood. Physical examination revealed a 4-mm firm, tender, brown papule in the umbilicus (Figure 1). She had a history of chronic pelvic pain and exploratory laparoscopy for endometriosis 10 years prior, at which time the diagnosis ofa bicornuate uterus was made. Subsequently, hysterectomy was performed (Figure 2) at which time the entire umbilical lesion was excised. Histopathology revealed branching tubular glands in the dermis lined by stratified columnar epithelium, surrounded by small cells with scant cytoplasm, characteristic of proliferative-phase endometrial stroma (Figure 3 and Figure 4). These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of umbilical endometriosis (Villar's nodule). Subsequent examination revealed no evidence of recurrence.","900":"T-cell lymphoma accounts for 10% to 15% of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States (approximately 5000 to 6000 cases a year). Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) comprises a subgroup of rare and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas that develop from T cells in different stages of maturity outside of the thymus. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a subgroup that falls within the T-cell lymphoma population but is classified differently than other PTCLs. Most cases of CTCL are considered indolent and can often be treated with less aggressive therapies. Eight percent to 55% of CTCL cases undergo transformation, and once this transformation occurs, the disease acts similarly to other PTCLs and its classification changes to that of a PTCL. Transformed CTCL requires aggressive systemic therapy. Pralatrexate is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for relapsed and refractory PTCL and has also gained compendia approval for treatment of CTCL. Pralatrexate is an antifolate chemotherapeutic inhibitor of dihydrofolatereductase. It has a high affinity for the one carbon-reduced folate carrier, which leads to better cellular internalization of the drug and has a greater antitumor effect than methotrexate. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of this drug in PTCL and other malignancies such as non-small cell lung cancer. This review offers focused information for dermatologists about pralatrexate and its use as a novel treatment for relapsed or refractory PTCL.","901":"Time frames are always dictated by the calendar. Kaposi was born 175 years ago, Carl Heitzmann one year before, and lupus erythematosus (LE) just one year later. Strawberry Hill and its lord played not too small a role in unraveling some details of LE and the \"hemorrhagic sarcoma to-be.\" Kaposi (1837-1902) lent his name to one of the above two syndromes, but he published extensively on both in the same year, same journal, and same volume (German Archives, volume 4, 1872). The literary \"birth\" of chronic discoid LE (CDLE) (1838) trails the master's by one year. Carl Heitzmann's birth precedes it, also by one--justification enough to deal with the three in one.","902":"","903":"Adverse cutaneous drug reactions are common, but their physiopathology is largely elusive. The authors assess various reactions to facilitate their diagnosis and treatment. Some of the common reaction patterns are included with the prime objective of highlighting their physiopathology.","904":"A 56-year-old woman presented with a painless lesion on the inner aspect of her upper lip. The clinical differential diagnoses were oral syphilitic chancre, tuberculosis, histoplamosis, and neoplasia. A biopsy was performed, and the histopathologic diagnosis revealed an eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa. Based on this case, we discuss the history, mechanisms of pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, histopathology, differential diagnosis, and therapy of eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa.","905":"Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) as a distinctive entity was first described about 30 years ago. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of all randomized controlled trials for treatment of FPHL. A preliminary search was carried out in several databases up to August 2008 to identify all randomized controlled trials on nonsurgical interventions for treatment of FPHL. Studies reporting fewer than 10 patients and non-English articles were excluded. Additionally, references of relevant articles and reviews were checked manually in search for additional sources. Among 238 citations found in the preliminary search, 12 fulfilled all criteria to be included in the systematic review. Topical minoxidil 1% to 5% for 24 to 48 weeks was shown to be effective in FPHL and its effect was not related to age or androgen level of patients. In addition, it may be effective in women with FPHL, both with and without hyperandrogenism, and in young and old premenopausal or postmenopausal. In patients with increased serum androgens, oral flutamide but not finasteride or cyproterone acetate was more effective than no treatment. Topical minoxidil is effective in patients with FPHL, with or without hyperandrogenism, but there is limited evidence for the efficacy of antiandrogens.","906":"The aim of this investigation was to resolve a diagnostic problem and report toenail unit changes attributable to shoe friction that resemble onychomycosis, but that are fungus-negative, and identify common skeletal causes in patients with an asymmetric walking gait. X-ray and clinical feet inspections were performed to evaluate skeletal components that change normal foot biodynamics. Forty-nine patients, all dermatophyte-negative, were reviewed. All patients were those seen in our private practice who demonstrated skeletal and toenail unit abnormalities such as onycholysis, nail bed keratosis resembling distal subungual onychomycosis, nail plate surface abnormalities, distal toe skin keratosis, a diagnostic nail plate shape, as well as several skeletal abnormalities. The clinical abnormalities of the asymmetric gait syndrome include onycholysis, nail bed keratosis, nail plate surface abnormalities, and a diagnostic nail plate shape. By the patient's history, the skeletal findings that were present worsened with age and, in many patients, they were familial. Onychomycosis does not lead to an asymmetric gait nail problem, asymmetric gait toenail does not favor dermatophyte infection, and not all nail dystrophies are the result of an asymmetric walking gait.","907":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is prevalent worldwide and known as a notorious opportunistic pathogen ofimmunocompromised patients. During the course of HSV treatment, acyclovir (ACV)-resistant HSV strains may emerge, causing many clinical complications. Because few studies in this area showing the presence and\/or frequency ofACV-resistant HSV are available, the authors evaluated the sensitivity of HSV isolated from 3 hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients and 24 normal patients observed in a University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Twenty-seven HSV isolated in VERO cells and typed by the direct immunofluorescence assay were tested for their susceptibility to various concentrations ofACV by the dye-uptake method. The susceptibility of the HSV strains was expressed as ED50 (the concentration of drug reducing viral cytophatic effect by 50%). The sensitivity to ACV by the dye-uptake assay revealed that 25 samples (92.6%) were sensitive to ACV concentrations &lt; 1.5 microg\/mL. One sample (3.7%) showed intermediate susceptibility (1.56 microg\/mL) and one other sample (3.7%) showed resistance to ACV concentrations above the cut-off (2 microg\/mL). The presence of resistance in immunocompetent patients could be the result of the frequent use of ACV for the treatment of recurrence. The routine use of HSV susceptibility testing is fundamental in the clinical suspicion of resistance not only for the knowledge of the incidence of HSV resistance in Brazil, but also to understand the mechanism of HSV resistance.","908":"","909":"","910":"","911":"Anti-infective prevention has led to a significant use of disinfectants, detergents, and antiseptics in various areas of activities. Most of these products are skin irritants and allergens, which can cause skin disorders in exposed workers. The authors conducted a descriptive and retrospective study on occupational dermatitis diagnosed at an occupational dermatology hospital consultation service, targeting exposed workers in the health, food, and cleaning industries. These included 20.9% (61 of 291) of the patients seen at this consultation. An occupational origin was proven for 50 of these 61 patients. The most frequent dermatoses were irritant contact dermatitis (42%) and allergic contact dermatitis (26.3%). The main allergens were disinfectants and antiseptics (26.3%), especially quaternary ammoniums, aldehydes, and nickel. Patients exposed to disinfectants, detergents, and antiseptics in the workplace represent an important part (about 1 of 5) of occupational dermatology consultations, although factors may be contributory. Prevention and knowledge are necessary for this increasing issue.","912":"","913":"A 75-year-old woman with full dentures had a progressive growth on the tongue for the past 15 years. She reported ulceration of the lesion 4 months prior that was accompanied by pain and odinophagia. She denied addiction to alcohol or tobacco. On examination, there was an ulcerated, vegetating, verrucous lesion, with yellow-whitish areas intermingled with erythematous areas, being infiltrated and having well-defined borders, on almost all areas of the back of the tongue (Figure 1). No adjacent lymphadenopathy was found. Biopsy of the tongue was compatible with verrucous carcinoma demonstrating squamous cell neoplasia with prevailing areas of rounded borders. There were \"tunnels\" filled with parakeratotic material surrounded by an extensive inflammatory response, plus isolated foci of neutrophils inside the tumor (Figure 2). There were relatively well-differentiated neoplastic cells with little cytological atypia. In addition, there were several foci of individual or grouped dyskeratotic cells (Figure 3), plus tunnelling of parakeratotic material and an intratumor inflammatory response (Figure 4). Following surgical removal, the woman underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment.","914":"A 26-year-old woman exhibited multiple, 1- to 3-mm eruptive asymptomatic papules, symmetrically distributed on the face. None of her family members had similar lesions. The papules first appeared in 2006 and gradually increased in number, particularly during her first pregnancy. She stated that the development of lesions was preceded by dermatitis. Physical examination revealed many flesh-colored or slightly reddish, smooth-surfaced papules around the eyes, both cheeks, and temples (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The differential diagnosis included syringomas in an atypical location, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and periorificial dermatitis. Histopathologic examinations revealed aggregation of small tubular structures lined by two rows of epithelial cells, most of which were characterized by comma-like tails, giving them a tadpole shape. They were embedded in a fibrous connective tissue stroma in the dermis. These histopathologic findings were consistent with syringoma (Figure 3).","915":"A 16-year-old unmarried woman presented with recurrent cracking of the lips indicated by the appearance of grayish white flakes since October 2004, which, in due course, shed off leaving behind an apparently normal mucous membrane. Chewing roasted corn treated with salt and lemon (bhutta) initially caused the lesions. Ever since, it has been a cause of its exacerbation. She never had any relief with either systemic or topical treatment. In fact, an obsession had overtaken her, resulting in a psychological setback. She denied regular drug use for any other ailment. Her menstrual cycle was normal. There was a positive history of psoriasis in her mother. Examination of the lips was conspicuous. It was marked by the presence of a well-circumscribed, moist, raised plaque (Figure 1). Its surface was irregular, with elevation and depression. It was made up of thick, grayish white scales, which were arranged in layers; however, Grattage\/Auspitz sign could not be elicited. Fissuring was prominent but the buccal mucosa, surface of the tongue, gingiva, and palate were normal. The clinical examination did not reveal any evidence of skin and\/or nail psoriasis\/psoriatic arthropathy or any other systemic abnormality. Blood examination including total and differential leukocyte count, complete hemogram, and liver and renal function tests were normal. Biopsy of the representative lesion was subjected to serial sections. They were stained with hematoxylin-eosin to work up microscopic pathology. It revealed the presence of mounds of parakeratosis with numerous neutrophilic Munro microabscesses (Figure 2). Submucosal vessels were dilated and congested. Periodic-acid-Schiff (PAS) stain revealed fungal hyphae and spores within the parakeratotic layer. Colonies of Gram-positive cocci were also demonstrated on the surface of the mucosa. She was administered combination therapy, comprising topical tacrolimus (0.1%) ointment and calcipotirol hydrate (50 microg\/g) plus betmethasone dipropionate (0.5 mg\/g) twice a day for 7 days. A single bolus dose of fluconazole 450 mg orally was also administered. The response to treatment was favorable and the lesions showed regression (Figure 3).","916":"","917":"Pellagra was first described in the 18th century as an epidemic in the poverty-stricken Spanish countryside by Gaspar Casal. Pellagra did not appear in the United States until the turn of the 20th century. It then ravaged the Southern United States and was not eliminated until the 1940s. This short report will redact the descriptions of pellagra in two early textbooks of dermatology. The first, published in 1897 before cases of pellagra were recognized in the United States, and, the second, published in 1915 in the midst of the epidemic. The text published in 1915 described in detail the medical signs and symptoms of pellagra particularly as they relate to the skin, as well as speculations as to its cause. The complicated story of the socioeconomic situation of the Southern United States and the hunt for the cause of pellagra will also be discussed briefly.","918":"","919":"Calciphylaxis occurs due to calcium deposition in arterioles, which leads to ischemic ulceration of overlying skin. Two-year mortality rates from sepsis ranges from 50% to 80%. Calciphylaxis is most common in hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal impairment and rarely occurs in the setting of normal renal function. Biopsy of the calciphylaxis ulcer reveals calcium deposits lining the vascular intima. Tissue calcification may also be seen on plain radiographs. Calcium-phosphate metabolism should be normalized by treating any underlying hyperparathyroidism with bisphosphonates, parathyroidectomy, and\/or cinacalcet in addition to dialysis in chronic renal failure. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate has been used successfully to treat renal and normo-renal calciphylaxis. Sodium thiosulfate displaces calcium ions from calcium deposits to form calcium thiosulfate, which is excreted by the kidneys or dialyzed. Systemic glucocorticoids may prevent ulceration of early plaques of calciphylaxis. Hyperbaric oxygen, skin grafting, and iloprost infusions are useful adjuncts in the management of this debilitating condition.","920":"The initial presentation of Paget's disease of the breast is an eczematous lesion, similar to contact dermatitis, in the skin of the breast at the areola and\/or nipple and is refractory to usual topical treatments. It is frequent among women, especially those in their 50s and 60s. Most cases are associated with an in situ or underlying invasive breast neoplasia. The histopathology is usually diagnostic, with immunohistochemistry useful for its differentiation from melanoma and other types of tumors. Treatment should always be surgical with invasive procedures for the effective and complete removal of the breast tumor.","921":"The pathogenesis of keloid formation is poorly understood. The fibroblasts in keloid patients continue to multiply even after initial wound repair and are characterized by a persistent dermal fibroproliferative reaction and excessive extracellular matrix production. Most studies concentrate on the type of collagen produced within keloids and the cytokines that dominate the disease. There have been considerably fewer studies in the expression of messenger RNA level in key cell cycle genes of the keloid fibroblast. The aim of this study was to measure the messenger RNA expression of the key regulators of cell cycle, cell cycle cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases, and their inhibitors.","922":"Two separate single-center, randomized, evaluator-blinded, bilateral (split-face) comparison studies compared the tolerability of adapalene 0.1% cream with adapalene 0.1% lotion in individuals with healthy skin treated once per day for 3 weeks. At each visit, the participants were graded on erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging\/burning (scale: 0 = none to 3 = severe). On the final study visit, the participants completed a Cosmetic Acceptability Questionnaire. Adverse events were recorded at each study visit. A total of 144 participants were enrolled and 130 completed the studies (study 1, n = 66; study 2, n = 64). The lotion formulation was non-inferior to the cream for the success rates and tolerability assessments in both studies. The frequency distributions of worst scores of either 0 (none) or 1 (mild) (study 1; study 2) for adapalene lotion were erythema (98.5%; 40.7%), scaling (100%; 73.5%), dryness (100%; 68.8%), and stinging\/burning (98.5%; 100%). The most common treatment-related adverse event was dryness (study 1, cream 2.7% [2 of 75] and lotion 4.0% [3\/75]); study 2, cream 2.9% [2 of 69] and lotion 4.3% [3 of 69]. Both the adapalene 0.1% cream and 0.1% lotion formulations were well tolerated and acceptable to the study participants. The adapalene 0.1% lotion provides clinicians with a retinoid for the treatment of acne in a lotion formulation.","923":"","924":"","925":"","926":"A 16-year-old young man presented with intensely itchy erythematous dermatitis on the body for 1 week and vesicular lesions on the palms and soles for 4 to 5 days. Lesions on the palms and soles were accompanied by severe burning and itching. The patient gave a history of sore throat and fever, 1 week prior to the onset of lesions. A general physical examination was normal, and cutaneous examination revealed multiple, well-defined erythematous scaly plaques with collaret scaling on the trunk and extremities (Figure 1). Vesicular lesions were seen on the palms and soles (Figure 2). The differential diagnoses we considered were pityriasis rosea and secondary syphilis. The possibility of dermatophytid, vesicular pityriasis rosea, and pompholyx was limited to the palms and sole lesions. Complete blood cell count was within normal limits. Results from antistreptolysin O titer, potassium hydroxide mount, and venereal disease research laboratory were negative. Skin biopsies were taken from the back and left palm. The biopsy specimen from the back revealed focal spongiosis, lymphocyte exocytosis, vacuolar changes in the basal layer, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis (Figure 3). The biopsy obtained from the vesicular lesion on the left palm revealed an intraepidermal vesicle with no evidence of acantolytic process (Figure 4). A diagnosis of pityriasis rosea was made and the patient was started on clarithromycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days, along with antihistamines and emollients. The lesions faded dramatically in a very short period, and there was significant involution of almost all of the lesions after 7 days of clarithromycin. During the 6 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed.","927":"A 55-year-old man presented with desquamating lesions on his bilateral buccal mucosa intermittently for approximately 3 years. The alteration in texture within his mouth created an uncomfortable sensation and, at times, the lesions spontaneously peeled away requiring him to spit repeatedly. The patient denied any history of trauma, cheek biting, or use of tobacco products. On initial examination, the patient was asymptomatic and the oral mucosa had no abnormal findings, but on repeat examination when symptoms were present, the patient had shaggy white plaques on the bilateral buccal mucosa limited to the line of dental occlusion (Figure 1). The plaques could be easily peeled away from the underlying skin with a cotton swab without any pain, leaving behind normal underlying mucosa. A review of the prior biopsy of the affected mucosa revealed an irregularly hyperplastic epithelium with foci of ballooned epithelial cells within the upper layer, parakeratosis, and bacterial overgrowth (Figure 2). Microscopic examination of fragments of mucosa peeled away from the affected area revealed fragments ofparakeratotic cornified material colonized by numerous bacteria (Figure 3). Results from periodic acid-Schiffstain revealed no fungal elements. The diagnosis of oral frictional hyperkeratosis was established based on the clinical and microscopic findings. It was concluded that the hyperkeratosis was likely caused by bite trauma or grinding of the teeth while the patient was asleep. Triamcinolone 0.1% ointment in Orabase and tretinoin 0.05% gel were ineffective. The patient found that rinsing with hydrogen peroxide solution was most helpful in reducing the lesions. A bite guard was recommended by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, but the patient has yet to use it.","928":"An 18-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic complaining of pruritic lesions on her inguinal and genital areas that had been present since birth. She had previously used topical steroids and a combination of topical steroids and calcipotriol for approximately 6 months; however, the treatment was unsuccessful. Her medical history was unremarkable. On dermatologic examination, mild erythematous, lichenified, and verrucous papules occurring in a linear pattern on the right inguinal area and on the region extending from the right labium majus to the perianal area were noted (Figure). Additionally, an erythematous area with central erosion surrounded by maceration was noted on the intergluteal area. Two separate punch biopsy samples were obtained from the erythematous, lichenified, verrucous, papular lesion on the inguinal area and from the erythematous, eroded, macerated lesion on the intergluteal area. Histopathological examination of both biopsy specimens revealed a thin orthokeratotic layer and scattered parakeratotic layers, as well as papillomatosis and acanthosis of the epidermis with a slight hyperpigmentation of the basal layer. A mild, perivascular, chronic inflammatory cell infiltration was noted in the dermis. Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the patient was considered to have inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, and cryotherapy was initiated. At the 2-week follow-up after the first application, it was observed that the itching complaint decreased substantially and the eroded lesions in the intergluteal area were re-epithelialized. On clinical follow-up, no improvement was observed in the papular component of the lesion after 4 sessions of cryotherapy. The patient voluntarily discontinued the follow-up after 4 sessions of cryotherapy.","929":"","930":"A 71-year-old man presented to our dermatological clinic with a 3-month history of a wound on his leg. He complained of weakness for the past few months. On his dermatological examination he had a 3x3-cm necrotic ulcer on his left tibia (Figure 1). On physical examination, there was 1 x 1-cm axillary lymphadenopathy. There was no other lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, or gingival hypertrophy. Peripheral blood results showed 2.4x103\/mm3 leukocytes (normal range 4-11 x 103\/mm3) with 66% neutrophils. The hemoglobin value was 10.1 g\/dL (13-18 g\/dL), and the platelet count was 63x103\/mm3 (150-440 x 103\/mm3). No blasts were detected in a peripheral blood smear. His lactate dehydrogenase level was 567 U\/L (240-480 U\/L). All other results of blood chemistry were within normal limits. Punch biopsy of the skin lesion showed ulceration and dense dermal acute and chronic inflammation. There was a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of neoplastic cells composed of relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei with blastic chromatin and occasional small nucleoli (Figure 2). Mitotic figures were prominent. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, and the neoplastic cells were CD3, CD20, CD138, and S100 protein negative. Myeloperoxidase and CD68 were positive. The histopathological findings were consistent with leukemic infiltration. Examination of bone marrow biopsy revealed that the blastic cells constituted more than 20% of the bone marrow cellularity. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow aspiration with fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for inversion 16, t(8;21) and t(15;7). Histochemical stains for myeloperoxidase, sudan black, periodic acid-Schiff, and alpha naphthyl acetate were also negative. Blastic cells were DR, CD13, CD117, and CD34 positive and CD5, CD7, CD10, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD41, CD56, CD64, and CD79 negative according to flow cytometry immunophenotyping. Blastic cells were 35% in the bone marrow. Based on the findings of bone marrow examination, the patient was diagnosed as having acute myeloblastic leukeamia (AML) with minimal differentiation (subtype MO) according to French-American-British and World Health Organization classification. The examination of abdominal ultrasonography and thorocic and abominal computed tomography revealed no metastases. The patient was treated with chemotherapy that consisted of cytarabin and daunorubicin. After chemotherapy, the lesion regressed. One month after chemotherapy, the patient presented to the hospital with a complaint of fever. He was diagnosed with febrile neutropenia. He died of cardiac failure 12 months after appearance of skin infiltration.","931":"A 48-year-old white man presented with a 2-month history of a lump on his right ear following purported exposure to the cold. The patient denied any history of trauma, rubbing, insect bite, or inflammation at the site. The patient was otherwise healthy and was not taking any medications. The lesion was completely asymptomatic, as the patient denied any pain, tenderness, or change in size since the lesion appeared. Physical examination revealed a 1.1-cm x 1-cm skin-colored, slightly fluctuant, rubbery, nonmobile dermal nodule on the right scaphoid fossa (Figure 1). No erythema, warmth, tenderness, or drainage was noted. A review of systems was noncontributory. A punch biopsy performed at the site of the cyst yielded clear, serous drainage. The cystic lesion was drained completely and decompressed. Histological examination revealed the surface of an intracartilaginous cystic space lined by degenerated cartilage, consistent with a diagnosis of pseudocyst of the auricle (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The lesion, although much smaller than at the time of presentation, persisted at the 3-week follow-up visit. It remained asymptomatic, without pain or irritation. At that time, the patient declined re-excision with bolster dressing. At 7-month follow-up, he reported the lesion to be stable.","932":"A 68-year-old Caucasian man presented with a suspicious lesion near the left axilla during a full skin examination that was performed for a presentation for dermatitis. The patient stated that he had the lesion for several decades but that it may have become more raised over the past few months. He did not think much of the changes, however, because it was to him, \"just a birthmark.\" The patient had no personal or family history of melanoma. On examination, the patient had a 4.5-cm by 1.2-cm oval light tan patch studded with multiple hyperpigmented macules regularly distributed within the lesion. In addition, at the lateral aspect of the lesion, the patient had a 0.9-cm irregularly pigmented black papule that was suspicious for melanoma (Figure 1). A deep saucerization biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histopathological examination revealed malignant melanoma, with a Breslow depth of 1.13 mm (Figure 2 and Figure 3). It was recommended that the patient have a wide local excision of the biopsy site and the adjacent remaining portions of the nevus spilus. A sentinel lymph node biopsy and an oncologic evaluation were also performed. The sentinel lymph node biopsies, as well as a computed tomographic scan performed by oncology, showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Since the procedure, the patient has shown no signs of disease recurrence.","933":"","934":"","935":"The degree of cell proliferation in a tumor is often associated with metastatic risk and mortality. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67 are proliferation markers that can be used to assess malignant potential in cutaneous lesions and pathological cell proliferation in psoriasis. These markers are elevated during periods of cell proliferation; however, they are also upregulated following UV irradiation. This upregulation may be problematic, as many skin lesions are subject to sun exposure in an everyday setting.","936":"Bacterial cultures are the gold standard for diagnosing cutaneous tuberculosis, but there are limitations, despite the advances embracing the innovative technologies, including interferon yrelease assays, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay, and molecular diagnostics, in addition to conventional skin tests and microscopic pathology. The results and their interpretation of cultures are reviewed for use in day-to-day practice.","937":"Chronic wounds can pose a challenging diagnostic and treatment dilemma in the older frail adult population. The benefits of short-term rehabilitation and long-term care settings are the access to interdisciplinary resources. Rehabilitative specialists, dieticians, and skilled nurses are readily available to meet the patients' needs as they transition to home or remain in a long-term care setting for their higher level of care needs. This article follows 3 cases: a skin tear complicated by venous ulceration, a pressure ulcer with fever, and arterial ulcers in a patient who opts for comfort care. The cases illustrate the higher needs of this population and emphasize the attention that must be paid to respect nursing-time intensiveness, incorporate realistic goals of care for wound healing, and ensure excellent communication with the team members, patients, and family.","938":"Two new cases are presented with delusions of parasitosis. Both were women, one middle-aged and one elderly, and exhibited classic symptoms of parasites and \"strings\" in the skin indicative of Morgellons disease. Each had an additional psychiatric disorder: drug addiction to cocaine and senile dementia. They also illustrate the difficulty encountered by the dermatologist in providing adequate therapy because of resistance to psychiatric referral as well as to standard accepted medication. Newer psychotropics, such as risperdal and lexapro, show promise in helping these patients and add to the therapeutic armamentarium of pimozide.","939":"Erlotinib is a highly specific epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat various metastatic cancers. The most commonly reported side effects in patients receiving erlotinib are dermatitis and diarrhea. The authors present two cases of erlotinib-induced severe scalp perifolliculitis, which is an adverse reaction that has not been reported to date. Both patients developed pustules and thick yellow-green crusted plaques on the scalp within weeks of starting treatment with erlotinib for metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma. Skin biopsies revealed a perifollicular accumulation of inflammatory cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Both patients were treated with oral doxycycline and achieved complete resolution within 2 to 3 weeks and no recurrence despite continuing the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This is a unique presentation of an erlotinib-induced skin eruption.","940":"","941":"","942":"A 70-year-old woman presented with an atypical erythematopapular zosteriform eruption of 3 weeks' duration. The patient had no history of previous vesicular eruption. She developed a painful burning sensation on the neck. Clinical examination revealed a cluster of small erythematous firm papules and plaques in a zosteriform distribution on the left ear, face, neck, and shoulder (Figure 1A). The lesions were unilateral and did not cross the midline. Multiple cervical and axillary lymph nodes were palpable. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in white blood cells of 25,000\/mm3, with 17,910\/mm3 lymphocytes and a normal range of hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 87 mm. Blood smear results showed small, morphologically mature lymphocyte cells. In immune phenotyping, lymphocyte cells co-express CD5 and B-cell-surface antigens CD19 and CD23, as well as a restriction of kappa immunoglobulin light chains. The cells were CD22-, CD79b-, CD38-, CD10-, CD25- and FMC7-. Computed thoracoabominal tomography revealed cervical, mediastinal, abdominal, and pelvic adenopathy confirming the diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) stage B. Histology of a skin biopsy from a papule showed a dense nodular granulomatous infiltrate in the dermis (Figure 2A). The infiltrate contained epithelioid and giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Small monomorphic lymphocytes without mitotic figures predominated (Figure 2B). The epidermis was irregularly thickened. Immunohistology revealed a polymorphous infiltrate with a phenotype of reactive T lymphocytes (CD3, CD5 positive) (Figure 2C), B lymphocytes (CD20 positive) (Figure 2D). Epithelioid and giant cells were positive for CD68 (Figure 2E). A latent herpes zoster infection with granulomatous reaction at the site ofzoster lesions was highly suspected as the patient reported a unilateral burning sensation without a history of vesicular zosteriform eruption. She received treatment with intravenous acyclovir 10 mg\/kg every 8 hours. The papular lesions resolved markedly (60%) on macular plaques at the end of the treatment. Following topical treatment with corticosteroids, the lesions healed completely within 4 weeks (Figure 1B). Concerning leukemia, our patient was monitored without therapy by the hematologist.","943":"A 28-year-old man with decreased libido received ashwagandha in the usual daily dosage of 5 g for 10 days. During this period, he experienced a burning and\/or itching sensation as well as discoloration of the skin\/mucous membrane confined to the penis. He had a similar type of eruption at the same site 6 months prior while taking ashwagandha. Examination of the skin surface was conspicuous and marked by the presence of a dusky, erythematous, oval, eroded plaque of 3 cm, affecting the glans penis and prepuce (Figure). The drug was withdrawn and topical 0.05% clobetasol propionate cream was administered along with cetrizine dihydrochloride, an H1-receptor blocker, 10 mg daily for 1 month. There was a perceptible amelioration of the lesion, resulting in residual greyish white pigmentation. He was prescribed oral drug provocation with 1 g of ashwagandha powder. Within 12 hours, a flare-up developed at the earlier site, confirming the causality.","944":"An 18-year-old black woman with cerebral palsy was admitted for evaluation of an intrathecal baclofen pump site infection. The dermatology service was consulted for treatment suggestions of a presumed diagnosis of chronic tinea capitis. Three courses of oral griseofulvin during the past 2 years failed to resolve the patient's chronic scalp dermatosis. Scalp lesions first began about 2 years earlier after hospitalization for placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump. The patient was unable to care for her scalp due to her cerebral palsy, and her mother interpreted the scalp condition as infectious. No routine shampoo care, scalp care, or topical treatment was performed for more than 1 1\/2 years. The mother felt that touching the patient's scalp might cause pain and noted that the majority of her time was spent concentrating on more critical medical issues. Physical examination revealed coalescing hyperkeratotic plaques extending dorsally from the anterior hairline to the occipital scalp with small flecks of keratinous debris throughout the remaining hair (Figure 1). The plate-like plaques were devoid of hair, except at a few fissures where a few tufts of hair emerged. No cervical lymph nodes were appreciated on palpation. Treatment was initiated with compresses consisting of large warm water-soaked towels 4 times daily. Three times a day, a nursing staff applied 5% salicylic acid in olive oil to the scalp under a shower cap for approximately 1 hour. Over the following 2 days, a significant reduction in keratinous debris was appreciated. Within 2 weeks, the bulk of the plaques had been removed (Figure 2). At 6-week follow-up, the underlying scalp showed areas of fibrosis and possible scarring with a few emerging tufts of hair. On the basis of history and response to treatment with salicylic acid and routine scalp care, the patient was diagnosed with an unusually severe case of dermatosis neglecta.","945":"","946":"","947":"","948":"Cutaneous tuberculosis continues to be one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose. It is a challenge particularly in developing countries due to the lack of resources. The authors define the classification and clinical manifestations considered predictive of its diagnosis.","949":"A critical question in the treatment of chronic wounds is whether and when debridement is needed. The three most common chronic wounds are the diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), the venous leg ulcer, and the pressure or decubitus ulcer. Surgical debridement, aimed at removing necrotic, devitalized wound bed and wound edge tissue that inhibits healing, is a longstanding standard of care for the treatment of chronic, nonhealing wounds. Debridement encourages healing by converting a chronic nonhealing wound environment into a more responsive acute healing environment. While the rationale for debridement seems logical, the evidence to support its use in enhancing healing is scarce. Currently, there is more evidence in the literature for debridement for DFUs than for venous ulcers and pressure ulcers; however, the studies on which clinicians have based their rationale for debridement in DFUs possess methodologic flaws, small sample sizes, and bias. Thus, further studies are needed to develop clinical evidence for its inclusion in treatment protocols for chronic wounds. Here, the authors review the scientific evidence for debridement of DFUs, the rationale for debridement of DFUs, and the insufficient data supporting debridement for venous ulcers and pressure ulcers.","950":"Pityriasis rubra pilaris is an uncommon inflammatory dermatosis that is well recognized across the globe. Erythroderma is a common presentation. A precise diagnosis of pityriasis rubra pilaris is based on morphologic features and is classified into 6 types: classic adult onset (type I), atypical adult (type II), classic juvenile (type III), circumscribed juvenile (type IV), atypical juvenile (type V), and human immunodeficiency virus-associated (type VI). Several conventional systemic and\/or topical treatments are currently in use. Largely, their results are unsatisfactory and limited by long-term toxicity. The authors investigate the efficacy of a wide spectrum of drugs by examining historical (archive) and promising (modern) treatment modalities for the treatment of pityriasis rubra pilaris.","951":"Kerions result from a massive delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to a dermatophyte. Treatment traditionally has been directed primarily toward the dermatophyte. The authors propose, however, that inflammation should be the initial target oftreatment. Clinical findings and treatment outcomes for two patients with kerions, treated with short courses of anti-inflammatory agents, are presented. Earlier studies showing minimal effects with corticosteroid treatment of kerions may have had design flaws. The anti-inflammatory treatment of kerions is both safe and effective and permits the duration of therapy to be shortened dramatically.","952":"The venereal form of treponematosis, caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, plagued every major city in the preantibiotic era. \"Civilization means syphilization,\" was an idea touted by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in the late 19th, and early 20th centuries that the effects of modern life make men more susceptible to syphilis and other diseases. Christopher Columbus was thought of as an importer of syphilis to Europe. Because his serendipitous voyages to the New World initiated the process of Spanish colonization, which foreshadowed general European colonization of the New World, it is difficult to rule out the cultural and political animosity created by Columbus and his men. These recent revelations are intriguing and may create dialogue that may subsequently challenge the age-old theory of \"East to West\" spread of venereal syphilis. This contribution warrants the continuation of study in this direction, taking into account skeletal studies that utilized radiocarbon dating technique and the phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial strains, offering a possible consensus on the origin and evolution of syphilis.","953":"","954":"","955":"","956":"","957":"","958":"","959":"A 34-year-old nonpregnant woman noted a mildly pruritic skin lesion on her right breast for 1 week following an episode of coryza, malaise, and low-grade fever of 3 days' duration. The latter symptoms subsided without any treatment. Ketoconazole cream prescribed by her family physician did not resolve the breast eruption after 1 week, so was stopped. A week later, multiple skin lesions erupted suddenly on her right chest wall starting near the herald patch in midaxillary line and spread distally until the midback. She then consulted the authors. She denied a history of abrasion or trauma to the affected areas. Travel, contact, sexual, and drug histories were unremarkable. She categorically denied past or family history of eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and drug eruptions. On examination, the initial lesion was an annular and well-demarcated erythematous plaque on her right breast in the upper outer quadrant. Multiple small oval scaly plaques were noted, extending distally along the ribs to the midline on her back, not crossing the midline, predominantly over the distribution of right T4 dermatome (Figure 1). Peripheral collarette scaling was noted (Figure 2). A few scattered small lesions were also noted in the vicinity of this dermatome. Three isolated small plaques were also present on the trunk, one in the supramammary area and the other two on the abdomen and back, respectively. Palmoplantar and mucosal surfaces were uninvolved. The rest of the skin and systemic examination revealed no abnormalities. Complete blood cell counts, fasting glucose, and urinalysis were normal. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) results were nonreactive and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies were negative. Repeat testing ofVDRL in serial dilutions and HIV antibodies after 3 months were also nonreactive and negative, respectively. Scrapings from the initial large lesion and subsequent smaller eruptions did not show any evidence of fungal infection on potassium hydroxide smear examination. The patient declined skin biopsy; however, we thought that the most diagnostic label for this condition was pityriasis rosea. Hence, we treated her with triamcinolone acetonide ointment 0.025% to be applied twice daily and desloratadine tablet 5 mg daily for 10 days. The patient demonstrated complete resolution, leaving postinflammatory hypopigmentation. There was no recurrence until 1 year after complete remission.","960":"","961":"","962":"","963":"Nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) has been used in dermatology for more than 40 years for a diverse range of conditions including acne, rosacea, autoimmune bullous dermatoses, and now the treatment and prevention of photoaging and photoimmunosuppression. The broad clinical effects of nicotinamide may be explained by its role as a cellular energy precursor, a modulator of inflammatory cytokines, and an inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1, which plays a significant role in DNA repair, maintenance ofgenomic stability, and cellular response to injury including inflammation and apoptosis. This review outlines the use of nicotinamide for inflammatory dermatoses and photoaging and focuses on its emerging role in photoprotection.","964":"Notalgia paresthetica is a neurocutaneous disorder that most commonly manifests as pruritus and a brownish macula in the patient's upper back. Pain, burning, and paresthesias to a variable degree have also been reported. Although the physiopathology of notalgia paresthetica is still obscure, it is currently considered a sensory neuropathy caused by damage to the spinal nerves. To date, no definitive treatment has been described for this disorder. Alternatives, including physical therapies and topical, systemic, and intralesional drugs, have been tested with diverse results. A review of the current knowledge on notalgia paresthetica and its treatment is provided.","965":"The aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy of skin needling in the treatment of the aging neck. Eight patients with aging necks were included in the study. Each patient was treated with 2 sessions of needling. The evaluation of treatment effectiveness was based on changes from baseline on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale, photographic and ultrasonographic images, and silicone rubber microrelief impressions of a selected neck region before and after therapy. Analysis of the photographs, the degree of irregularity of the surface microrelief, and the ultrasound images showed that, after 2 sessions, the lesions' severity grade was reduced in almost 90% of the patients. The present study presents evidence for the efficacy of skin needling for the aging neck.","966":"","967":"","968":"","969":"","970":"","971":"A 39-year-old Sikh businessman of Asian origin was referred to us with complaints of a painless scrotal lesion that had enlarged over a 2-year period and was causing him discomfort. There was no history of trauma, inflammation, or infection, and no significant urologic history. Physical examination revealed a 2x2 cm skin-colored nodule of rubbery consistency on the left side of the scrotum (Figure 1), which was separate from the testicles or epididymis. There was no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Scrotal ultrasonography demonstrated that the testicles and epididymis were normal. The scrotal mass and surrounding skin were surgically resected using a vertical elliptical incision and sent for histopathology. Histologic examination was consistent with leiomyoma. The epidermis was normal with a prominent proliferation of intertwined smooth muscle fibers with interlacing collagen bundles in the dermis. At higher magnification, the cells were spindle-shaped with eosinophilic cytoplasm and long nuclei. These interweaving bundles of cells surrounded the vessels and the pilosebaceous apparatus. There was no evidence of atypia and the mitotic index was low (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Some normal dartoic muscle fibers were seen in the periphery of the tumor. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. On follow-up visit 10 days later, he did not have any complications, and the sutures were removed. At his last visit 6 months after the procedure, he was still asymptomatic and did not have any recurrence.","972":"A 70-year-old Caucasian man with a medical history of Parkinson's disease presented with a 3-month history of violaceous reticulated patches on his upper and lower extremities. The lesions were asymptomatic. The patient did not have a history of cardioembolic events or autoimmune disorders. No new medications were started before the onset of the lesions. Review of systems was unremarkable. On examination, large erythematous to violaceous patches were present in a reticulated net-like pattern on the patient's upper and lower extremities (Figure 1 and Figure 2). No edema, erosions, or ulcerations were noted. An extensive workup for autoimmune, infectious, and hematologic causes of livedo reticularis was performed. Complete blood cell count, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C and S levels, cryoglobulin screen, rheumatoid factor, and hepatitis screen were all within normal limits. After these potential other causes were excluded, the patient was diagnosed with amantadine-induced livedo reticularis (LR), a medication he had been taking for 2 years for Parkinson's disease. The patient's dose of amantadine was decreased from 100 mg to 50 mg twice daily and over the next few months, his lesions gradually faded. Because his neurologic condition benefited from amantadine and his lesions were asymptomatic, his neurologist continued the medication.","973":"A 56-year-old white man presented with a lesion on the right shoulder. The lesion developed during a short period and recently became irritated with occasional bleeding and mild pruritus. The patient denied pain. Medical history included melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, multinodular thyroid goiter, and obesity. Medications and family and social history were noncontributory. Review of systems was negative. Examination revealed a slightly raised, friable yellow-pink waxy plaque located on the right shoulder (Figure 1). There was no evidence of excoriation, secondary infection, drainage, scale, crust, atrophy, lichenification, or telangiectasia. The patient had no mucosal or nail changes and the remainder of his skin examination was normal. A shave biopsy on the right shoulder revealed a nodular deposit of homogenous eosinophilic material associated with extravasated erythrocytes within the dermis. An infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells was associated with the deposits. Immunohistochemical stains revealed positive plasma cells with kappa light chain and negative with lambda light chain. Congo red stain was positive and supported the diagnosis. The findings were consistent with nodular cutaneous amyloidosis (NCA) of the amyloid light-type. Initial work-up included referrals to hematology\/oncology and to general surgery. The patient had a complete blood cell count (CBC), complete metabolic profile (CMP), serum protein electrophoresis (S-PEP), urine protein electrophoresis (U-PEP), 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, and protein, serum immunoglobulins and 132 microglobulin. These were all within normal limits. Abdominal\/pelvic computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan also were within normal limits. Bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormalities. The patient underwent both an abdominal fat pad biopsy as well as a colonoscopy with rectal biopsy. Both were negative for amyloidosis. Initially, the patient's cutaneous amyloidosis remained localized and mild pruritus was controlled with low potency topical steroids. The patient was closely monitored by hematology\/oncology and general surgery on a biannual basis to assess the possibility of progression to systemic amyloidosis. Over the course of the subsequent two years, the patient developed multiple similar lesions across the back, shoulders, and chest, which were biopsied and found to be consistent with NCA. Progression of the cutaneous nodules led to disfiguring, painful, and friable pink to yellow waxy papules coalescing into plaques with obvious hemorrhage diffusely over the trunk (Figure 2). In lieu of the painful and disfiguring progression of disease, the patient desired a more aggressive treatment plan. At present, the treatment option recommended to the patient is carbon dioxide laser ablation. Hematology\/oncology recommendation consists of a general systemic amyloid reevaluation annually, including CBC, CMP, S-PEP, U-PEP, 24-hour urine collection with creatinine clearance, and history and physical examination.","974":"Claude Huriez (1907-1984) was a well-known French dermatologist. In the 1960s, Huriez and colleagues reported two families from northern France with a rare congenital genodermatosis-later known as Huriez syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by scleroatrophy of the hands and feet, nail hypoplasia, mild palmoplantar keratoderma, and hypohidrosis and is a cancer-prone genodermatosis.

Hundreds of medicinal plants are widely used in Asia and Western countries in oriental medicine, yet the phototoxicity of oriental medicinal plants is an understudied area. In this contribution, the authors discuss some methods used to measure the phototoxicity of plants and give an overview of the results of their previous and ongoing studies into the phototoxicity of medicinal plants. The authors argue that because they found that more than a quarter of oriental medicinal plants can be phototoxic, such research is helpful for dermatologists and that active phototoxic components extracted from oriental medicinal plants may be used therapeutically.","978":"In the past 15 years, research in dermatology has significantly increased. Dermatology-related contributions in premier medical journals such as The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) are the representation of our field in the medical world.

This open-label, single-center pilot study evaluated the efficacy and safety of naftifine 1% gel applied twice daily for 2 weeks in 10 men and women (median age 38 years) with TV. Baseline mycology status was determined by potassium hydroxide (KOH) and microscopy and clinical symptom severity (CSS) scored by the investigator using a 0 to 9 scale (0=absent, 9=worst). Patients applied naftifine HCI 1% gel to the affected area twice daily for 14 days. They returned for follow-up efficacy and safety assessments at the end of treatment (week 2), 2 weeks after treatment (week 4), and 6 weeks after treatment (week 8). All patients had a positive mycology at baseline; one was KOH negative at week 2, two were negative at week 4, and five (50%) were negative at week 8. Mean investigator total CSS score decreased from a baseline value of 4.7 to 3.2 at week 2 (32% improvement), 2.6 at week 4 (45% improvement), and 2.7 at week 8 (43% improvement). The patients rated their symptoms to be improved at all follow-up visits. There were no treatment-related adverse events during the study. These results suggest that naftifine 1% gel is a safe and efficacious topical treatment for TV.","980":"Although studies have yet to prove definitively a causal relationship between diet and acne, the lay public has traditionally held that such causality exists. The authors' study aims to determine which nutritional elements are thought to be related to acne, both positively and negatively. YouTube, a popular video-sharing Web site, was used to survey the views of the lay public. The keywords \"acne,\" \"acne diet,\" and \"acne food\" were searched in YouTube in July and August of 2009, and 87 videos were included in the study. More than 85% of videos suggest at least a moderate correlation between diet and acne. Dairy products and oily and greasy foods were viewed as aggravating factors, while fruits, vegetables, and supplements were regarded as alleviating factors. Generally regarded \"truths\" can affect patient compliance with treatment regimens, and a knowledgeable physician is better able to address these issues with his or her patients.","981":"","982":"A 53-year-old woman presented with a 20-year history of pruritic dermatitis on the groin, axillae, inframammary folds, posterior aspect of the neck, and popliteal fossae. She was referred to our clinic by an outside facility after results from a punch biopsy diagnosed Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD). The patient had previously attempted treatment with many traditional noninvasive options with no success. Topical treatment modalities included corticosteroids, immunomodulators, antifungals, retinoids, and antibiotic preparations. Intralesional corticosteroids, as well as botulinum toxin and carbon dioxide laser, were also unsuccessful. Failed systemic treatment modalities included antibiotics, antihistamines, prednisone, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, acitretin, isotretinoin, adalimumab, and etanercept. Of note, cyclosporine was successful in clearing the cutaneous involvement in our patient, but elevation ofcreatinine and exacerbated hypertension precluded continued use. The decision was made to treat the patient by dermabrasion with sandpaper. The patient was prepped in a sterile fashion, and a field block with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was performed. This was followed by abrasion down to the superficial dermis with 3M Sandblaster fine sandpaper (3M, St. Paul, MN) and hyfrecation between rounds ofdermabrasion. The treated areas were then covered with petrolatum and sterile gauze, and antibiotics and pain medication were prescribed. This treatment was initially performed on the patient's posterior aspect of the neck and later to the bilateral popliteal fossae and axillae. Three months post-treatment, desirable functional and cosmetic results of the treated areas had been achieved (Figure 1 and Figure 2). While no recurrence of clinically active HHD has been seen in the dermabraded areas of the neck and popliteal fossae, the patient continues to have active disease in the axillae despite sandpaper dermabrasion. To quantify our results, we performed two biopsies in the dermabraded sites of the popliteal fossae as healing occurred: a shave biopsy from an obviously active area, and a punch biopsy from a peripheral inactive border. The biopsy from the active area showed diffuse epidermal acantholysis similar to that seen in untreated HHD, while the healing periphery showed only scattered acantholytic areas and a sparse perivascular infiltrate-a marked improvement from the untreated areas.","983":"A 21-year-old housewife presented to the authors' clinic in 2009 with recurrent papulovesicular and pustular eruptions on the index an ring fingers of the left hand accompanied by throbbing pain that had been active for the past 10 years. The condition did not respond to topical and\/or systemic treatment. There was neither a personal\/family history of psoriasis nor any other systemic disease. The sk surface of the patient's left hand was marked by the presence of multiple pustules located over an erythematous background, affecting th ring and adjoining middle fingers, with crusting prominent in places along the tips (Figure 1). Gram-stained smears prepared from th purulent specimen revealed Gram-positive cocci in clusters. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of the pustules did not show a fungal elements. In vitro culture of the same specimen yielded growth of Staphylococcus aureus, which was found to be sensitive to almo all conventional antibiotics on aerobic culture. Sections prepared from the skin of the tip of the patient's finger showed marked epithelial hyperplasia with uniform elongation of rete ridges and supra-papillary thinning of the epidermis. There was hyperkeratosis with foci of mounds of parakeratosis. Spongiosis with neutrophilic infiltration and microabscess formation were prominent. The dermis showed perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate (Figure 2A and 2B). No organism was identified on special stains. Results from hemography and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. The diagnosis of acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) was made, in keeping with the findings. The patient received ceftriaxone 1.0 g and tazobactam 125 mg by slow intravenous infusion for 3 consecutive days, following which there was complete regression of the lesions. After cessation of therapy, there was complete recurrence.","984":"A 62-year-old Asian woman presented with multiple small, rock-hard papular lesions on her face (Figure). She had no previous history of acne vulgaris or cutaneous malignancy. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995 and was treated with left lumpectomy followed by combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate. In 1995, at age 50, she also began therapy with systemic alendronate to treat osteoporosis. Within 1 year, she noticed the development of asymptomatic indurated dermal papules on her cheeks. Topical treatment with 12% lactic acid lotion did not improve her condition. Clinical examination revealed numerous 1- to 2-mm, brown dermal nodules on the malar cheeks bilaterally. Normal laboratory data included complete blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, serum calcium, and serum phosphate. A lesional punch biopsy from the left cheek revealed lamellar bone within the dermis. Correlation of the clinical presentation, laboratory data, and pathology established the diagnosis of multiple miliary osteoma cutis of the face.","985":"","986":"","987":"","988":"Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide public health problem.

He also had two previous hospitalizations, both for culture-negative bacterial meningitis; the first episode occurred 12 months before admission and the second episode occurred 5 months later. At that time, he was found to be positive for serum antibodies against HIV and a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 126\/mm3. He had no known drug allergies and was not receiving any medication. On admission, the patient was febrile (104.0 degrees F) and hypotensive (blood pressure, 92\/40 mm Hg). Pertinent physical examination findings included cachexia with bitemporal wasting, dry mucus membranes, adherent white patches on the oral mucosa, and negative Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. His laboratory results revealed macrocytic anemia, a decreased serum sodium of 125 mEq\/L, and a normal total leukocyte count with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count &lt; 50\/mm3. Lumbar puncture opening pressure was elevated at 160 mm Hg, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an increased white cell count of 97\/microL (84% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 26 mg\/dL, and a decreased protein level of 42 mg\/dL. The patient was started on empiric therapy that included intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime, oral Bactrim, and clotrimazole lozenges for thrush. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Escherichia coli, sensitive to cefotaxime. Two days later, the patient developed fine, erythematous, nonblanchable macules primarily on his abdomen, with minimal involvement of his thorax and back. His skin lesions remained unchanged for the next 2 weeks. Repeat lumbar puncture was performed after 14 days of cefotaxime. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed an elevated white cell count of 7\/microL (100% lymphocytes), a decreased glucose level of 53 mg\/dL, and a decreased protein level of 33 mg\/dL. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was now positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to cefotaxime. The patient was started on imipenem. On day 34 of his admission, the patient became tachypneic with complaints of dyspnea. A chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates. He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (arterial blood gas values on 6 L of oxygen: pH, 7.46; bicarbonate, 23; and oxygen saturation, 37). That evening, the patient was also noted to have diffuse petechiae and purpura in a reticulated pattern over his abdomen (Figure 1A and 1B), most heavily concentrated in the periumbilical region, extending to the axillae and upper thighs. A 3x3-mm punch biopsy from abdominal skin demonstrated Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in the dermis (Figure 2A and 2B). His sputum specimen was teeming with adult S stercoralis worms (Figure 3) and, subsequently, numerous S stercoralis larvae were observed not only from the bronchoalveolar lavage but also from the nasogastric fluid specimen. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. On hospital day 35, the patient was doing poorly and was started on thiabendazole (1250 mg twice daily for 28 days). Nine days later, ivermectin (4.5 mg once daily for 3 days for 2 courses) was also added. He continued to clinically deteriorate.

He did not respond to prednisone 50 mg and 6-mercaptopurine 100 mg daily. Abdominal computed tomography findings revealed diffuse submucosal edema consistent with extensive colitis. Colonoscopy demonstrated diffuse inflammation with erythema, friability, and shallow ulcerations in the rectum and colon. Biopsies were consistent with Crohn's colitis. He was admitted for infliximab infusion for his unremitting diarrhea. Five days before admission, the patient noted mild swelling and redness of the left lower eyelid, which progressed to involve the right lower eyelid with frank pus draining from both eyes. He had no visual impairment or eye pain. Two days before admission, an ophthalmologist prescribed a steroid eyedrop with no relief. He also complained of seropurulent painful skin lesions on his face and scalp, which spread to involve his upper trunk and proximal arms. On admission to the hospital, dermatology, ophthalmology, and infectious disease consultations were obtained to rule out disseminated infection before initiation of infliximab therapy. The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His oral mucosa was normal. He had prominent bilateral lower eyelid edema, erythema, and superficial erosions with hemorrhagic crusting and frank green purulent drainage from both eyes, with crusting along the lower lash line and bilateral sclera injection (Figure 1). On his scalp, face, trunk, and proximal extremities, he had 25 to 30 erythematous, 4- to 8-mm papulopustules with narrow red halos, some with central necrosis and crusting (Figure 2). Cultures from the purulent ocular drainage and pustules on the trunk and arms were all negative for bacteria, virus, and fungi. Gram stain from the eye drainage showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes without organisms. Tissue cultures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial infection. Skin biopsy taken from the central upper back demonstrated subcorneal pustules with areas of eroded epidermis and collections of neutrophils in the superficial dermis (Figure 3). Special stains were negative for organisms. He received infliximab infusion 5 mg\/kg for a total dose of 420 mg over 2 hours. Within 48 hours of infusion, there was notable decrease in size of lesions, in addition to reduction of purulent drainage from both eyes. The patient was discharged home following infliximab infusion. His skin lesions resolved during a period of 2 weeks, leaving small pink atrophic scars. He received his second infusion of infliximab 2 weeks after discharge with continued improvement in his gastrointestinal symptoms.","997":"The parents of an 18-year-old woman had noticed white hair while combing their daughter's hair 12 years ago. They found tiny white spots on her scalp, but she was asymptomatic. The spots have since progressed. Examination of the affected skin on the scalp was marked by the presence of a chalky\/ivory white macule, 8 to 10 cm in diameter, conforming to that of segmental (zosteriformis) vitiligo (Figure 1). The lesions were located on the temporoparietal region of the scalp. The hair over the macules was white (leukotrichia) and dry, coarse, and brittle. The patient's nails were thin and dull. Her thyroid profile revealed the following: triiodothyronine, 1.12 nmol\/L (0.95-2.5 nmol\/L); thyroxine, 69.21 nmol\/L (60.0-120.0 nmol\/L); and thyroid-stimulating hormone, 6.26 microIU\/mL (0.25-5.00 microIU\/mL), indicative of primary hypothyroidism. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. A lipid profile revealed the following: total lipids, 503.8 mg% (400-700 mg %); triglycerides, 123.0 mg % (160 mg %); cholesterol, 212.0 mg % (150-250 mg %); high-density lipoprotein, 43.1 mg % (30-63 mg %); and low-density lipoprotein, 144.3 mg % (50 mg %). Electrocardiographic findings were normal. History of tiredness, constipation, depression, sensitivity to cold, weight gain, muscle weakness, cramps, and increased menstrual flow supported the diagnosis. The patient was administered 100 microg of thyroxine once a day along with methoxsalen, the dose of which was calculated at 0.6 mg\/kg to 0.7 mg\/kg body weight per day given on alternate days, followed 2 hours later by exposure to UV-A (1 J\/cm2) irradiation (psoralen-UV-A [PUVA]), supplemented by 1 mg of beta-methasone, 150 mg of levamisole on 2 consecutive days per week, and an antioxidant. During the course of 7 weeks, the macules (13 exposures) had become erythematous, with an appearance of perifollicular\/ marginal pigmentation. Repeat examination showed a thyroid profile of total triiodothyronine (T3), 127.3 microg\/dL (86-186); total thyroxine (T4), 6.54 microg\/dL (4.5-12.5 microg\/dL); and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 0.32 microIU\/mL (0.3-5.6 microIU\/mL), supplemented by antithyroid microsomal peroxidase antibodies (thyroid microsomal antibody and thyroid peroxidase), 21.9 IU\/mL (1-40 IU\/mL), and antithyroglobulin antibodies, 78.1 U\/mL (1-100 U\/mL). During the patient's treatment period, 4 other patients with clinical symptoms and signs of long-standing hypothyroidism developed vitiligo, the duration of which was variable in each patient (Table I). All of the patients were taking thyroxin. Thyroid and lipid profiles were performed periodically to evaluate the progress (Table I). These patients were also treated with PUVA therapy and thyroxin. During the course of treatment, 2 of the patients noticed asymptomatic, progressive, localized, and well-circumscribed hair loss at the temporal region of the scalp that extended to involve the vertex, conforming to findings of alopecia areata (Figure 2A and Figure 2B).","998":"Two siblings with generalized pustular psoriasis were admitted to the hospital. Case 1: A 7-year-old girl presented with recurrent episodes of multiple pinhead-sized pustules all over her body since the age of 3. The current episode began a week prior to the onset of the lesions. On cutaneous examination, she had generalized erythema topped with tiny pustules, scales, and crusting (Figure 1A). A Gram stain performed from the pustule and cultures taken from the pus and blood were sterile. Histopathology of the pustule was suggestive of pustular psoriasis (Figure 2). Hemoglobin was 8.8 g%. Other hematologic, microbiologic, and radiologic investigations were normal. Treatment was started with methotrexate, to which she responded dramatically with reduction in appearance of new lesions, erythema, and scaling. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was almost 90% clearance of skin lesions. Case 2: A 3-year-old boy, brother of the patient in case 1, presented with similar complaints for the past week. The episode was preceded by high-grade fever. He had generalized erythema, scaling, and edema and multiple pinhead-sized pustules, some of which were arranged in an annular configuration (Figure 1B). All investigations, as in case 1, were normal except for hypocalcemia (Ca2+ = 8.8 g%) and generalized rarefaction on x-rays of both the ankle joints. Treatment was started with prednisolone (because of poor general condition) and methotrexate. Following therapy, significant improvement was evident with reduction in erythema and cessation of appearance of new pustules. The dose of prednisolone was gradually tapered after 3 weeks and then stopped.","999":null,"1000":"","1001":"","1002":"","1003":"Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by the deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to multisystemic storage of globotriaosylceramide in visceral tissues and vascular endothelium. FD manifests primarily in affected hemizygous men, with a wide range of clinical signs in heterozygous women. Acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, pain crisis, and cornea verticillata are early manifestations of FD. With age, severe complications involving the kidneys, heart, and brain cause considerable morbidity and premature death. Although the clinical onset of FD occurs in childhood, diagnosis is often delayed or missed. In men, the diagnosis must be confirmed biochemically by demonstration of decreased levels of alpha-galactosidase A activity. In women, the disease is diagnosed by identification of a mutation in the alpha-galactosidase A gene. Until a few years ago, the existing treatment for FD was based on clinical manifestations, but the advent of enzyme replacement therapy should stimulate the identification of the signs and symptoms suggestive of this disorder to allow earlier diagnosis and treatment.","1004":"Primary anetoderma is a rare idiopathic disease of the skin characterized by circumscribed areas of slack skin and loss of elastic fibers found on histopathologic examination. It has been related to systemic lupus erythematosus and other immune diseases. In recent years, however, its association with antiphospholipid antibodies has been highlighted, and it should be considered a clinical manifestation of these antibodies.","1005":"Follicular accentuation in some patients with seborrheic dermatitis of the back and chest has been recognized for more than a century. The recognition of Malassezia folliculitis in recent decades has led to some confusion regarding categorization of these cases. The author proposes that there is sufficient clinical variation between the typical case of Malassezia folliculitis and patients with follicular seborrheic dermatitis to justify continued separation of these entities until further study provides more clarification.","1006":"Oral doxepin was shown to reduce chronic pruritus due to sulfur mustard. The present study compared the effects of topical doxepin 5% with betamethasone 1% for the treatment of pruritus in veterans exposed to sulfur mustard. This investigator-blinded, randomized, clinical trial was conducted in an outpatient dermatology clinic. Seventy-five men who were exposed to sulfur mustard 23 to 28 years ago during the Iran-Iraq war who complained of pruritus were randomized to receive doxepin cream 5% (n = 40) or betamethasone cream 0.1% (n = 35) twice a day for 6 weeks. Pruritus severity and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were evaluated before and after each treatment. Both groups showed significant improvement regarding pruritus (P &lt; .05), burning sensation, skin dryness (P &lt; .001), and skin scaling (P &lt; 0.05). The lesions of all regions significantly reduced after treatments (P &lt; .05), except those on the head, face, and genitalia. Pruritus, visual analog scores, and DLQI significantly decreased (P &lt; .01, P &lt; .01, and P &lt; .001, respectively) in doxepin- and betamethasone-treated groups, and there was no difference between groups. All DLQI subscores decreased after both type of treatments (P &lt; .01). Equal efficacy of doxepin cream and betamethasone suggest that doxepin is a potential alternative to control pruritus caused by sulfur mustard in exposed veterans.","1007":"","1008":"","1009":"","1010":"","1011":"","1012":"A 70-year-old white housewife presented with a rare presentation of coexistent generalized morphea and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus with unusual clinical aspects. The patient had disseminated erythematous lesions that evolved into indurated large plaques. Hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation developed later, in addition to ivory, white, and shiny plaques on the trunk (Figure 1). The skin of the arms and legs showed a wavy contour (Figure 2). Various areas were markedly sclerotic and some had edematous papules (Figure 3). Multiple indurated, ivory, white, shiny, large, and hypochromic plaques were seen on the trunk Laboratory examinations showed increased immunoglobulin A and antinuclear antibodies 1:200 speckled. Scl-70, anti-centromere, anti-ribonucleoprotein, and anti-DNA tests were negative. Esophageal manometry and abdominal and pelvic ultrasound findings were all normal. Complete blood cell count, blood profile, and urinalysis were also within normal limits. Skin biopsy of an arm lesion showed an atrophic epidermis with orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and follicular plugging. A broad area of homogenization and edema was seen in the papillary dermis with dilated capillaries and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. There was also collagen sclerosis throughout the reticular dermis, and thickened, homogenized collagen bundles replaced the subcutaneous fat. Vessel walls showed proliferated intima with mucin deposition and sclerosis, as well as multiplied elastic layers. There was edema of the papillary dermis in some areas and incipient deposition of calcium (Figures 4-7).","1013":"A 30-year-old woman presented with multiple pruritic raised skin lesions at the proximal part of her left arm for the past 15 years. At the age of 15, the patient noticed red nodules accompanied with severe pruritus over the arm, which started to spread and involved the dorsal aspect of her scapula (Figure 1). They had been increasing in number during the past 15 years. There was no history of pain either spontaneously or in response to cold, tactile, or emotional stress, with no bleeding or oozing. There was no family history of similar skin lesions; however, she had a history of gynecologic problems for 10 years, and examination of her uterus showed uterine leiomyomas. The patient complained about severe pruritus. This symptom was exaggerated with sun exposure, cold, emotional stress, and rough cloths. It was so severe that it caused sleep disturbances. Clinical examination showed multiple pink and red nodules ranging from 5 mm to 20 mm over the above-described sites. The lesions were firm, smooth, not mobile, and nontender, with no pain on touch. Routine hematologic and biochemical investigations were normal. Kidney and pelvic ultrasonography showed myomatous uterus and normal kidneys. Microscopic examination of one of the nodules in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections showed proliferation of smooth muscle cells with fascicular aspect in dermis. These cells had thin, elongated eel-like nuclei with blunt edges (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The diagnosis of leiomyoma was made and the patient was referred for surgical excision. Due to the extension and site of the lesions, the plastic surgeon did not recommend surgical procedure and the patient was treated with an antihistamine (loratadine 10 mg\/d).","1014":"A 72-year-old Caucasian woman without remarkable medical history presented with an asymptomatic bilateral periocular swelling, which had been present for 2 months. Physical examination showed symmetric indurated periocular erythematous plaques (Figure 1). Biopsy of a skin lesion revealed aggregates of vacuoles of different sizes (Figure 2) surrounded by a prominent inflammatory infiltrate constituted by macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulomatous foreign body reaction throughout the reticular dermis and hypodermis. These histological findings were consistent with the injection of an oily foreign substance. The patient denied the self-induced nature of the lesions, so she was referred for psychiatric evaluation and admitted having self-injected mineral oil as an impulsive attempt to get attention from her family. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and started treatment with oral fluoxetine, showing a rapid decrease of impulsive behavior and anxiety from the second week with a mean dose of 80 mg\/d.","1015":"A 28-year-old woman presented with reddish raised, shiny lesions over the face and ears present for the past 3 years. Four years ago, she developed in her left axilla a nodule that became fluctuant and tender, which ruptured to discharge seropurulent material. It subsided after the patient had received antibiotics for 6 months, leaving puckered scarring. There was no history of antituberculous treatment. After 1 year, she developed papulonodular lesions on her face, nose, and ears. There was now a history of malaise, fever, dry cough, and anorexia and weight loss for the past 2 months. The patient was fully vaccinated in childhood, including against varicella infection. The general physical examination revealed lymphadenopathy involving cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 1 x 1.5 cm, firm in consistency, and nontender. They were discrete except in the left axilla where multiple matted lymph nodes were present with overlying scarring and a papule. Her systemic examination was normal. Cutaneous examination showed a shiny erythematous plaque 3x2 cm with central atrophy and scarring on the face (Figure). It was comprised of multiple shiny nontender soft papules arranged in annular configuration. Similar discrete papules and nodules with adherent fine scaling were seen bilaterally on the alar prominence of the nose, lower lip, and post-auricular area. On diascopy, apple jelly nodules were seen. The hemogram, liver function tests, and renal function tests were normal, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The Mantoux test showed erythema and an induration of 20 x 20 cm. A posteroanterior view on the chest x-ray showed fibrotic changes suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis showed no tubercular foci. Human immunodeficiency virus serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with 3 different kits was nonreactive. Histopathology from a nodule showed a focally thinned-out epidermis with follicular plugging and multiple epithelioid cell granulomas, rimmed by lymphocytes in the deeper portion of the dermis, mainly peri-appendageal. Stain for acid-fast bacteria was negative. Cultures from the skin lesions were negative. The patient was diagnosed as having lupus vulgaris with multiple lesions of varying morphology at different sites with pulmonary tuberculosis and healed lymph node involvement.","1016":"An 11-year-old boy was referred to our department for vesicular lesions of the buttocks of 7 years' duration (Figure 1). He also complained of intermittent oozing of serosanguineous fluid, which caused social impairment. On clinical examination, clusters of flesh-colored to translucent papules were present over the buttocks, perianal area, and left calf. The lesions were excised 4 years ago, after confirming the diagnosis of lymphangioma circumscriptum on histopathology. They started recurring on and around the surgical site within 6 months of surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to evaluate the deeper extension of the lesion. The lymphangioma previously identified by cutaneous examination manifested as an altered T2 signal, spreading to subcutaneous tissues and major and minor muscles and infiltrating the sacral vertebrae and presacral area (Figure 2). Although the muscles were infiltrated, the boy was asymptomatic. He did not have pain, tenderness, or difficulty in the movement of the back and hip muscles. Renal function was also normal. Options of surgical resection and sclerotherapy were rejected by the parents because of the extensive spread of lymphangioma and fear of disfigurement. Carbon dioxide laser ablation was performed, and the parents were asked to follow up regularly for control of any symptoms, if they appear in the future.","1017":"CASE 1: A 24-year-old black woman was referred to our clinic in September 1999 by the department of dermatology. She was referred to confirm the diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Her medical history was normal. Dermatologic examination revealed confluent papules that gave the skin a \"plucked chicken\" appearance on the flexural surfaces in the neck, axillae, clavicle, thigh, and periumbilical area (Figure 1). The patient stated that the changes in her skin had begun in the periumbilical region at about 5 years of age and had since been slowly progressive. Physical examination showed brownish black pigmentation on the left side of the face, left eyelid, and left sclera, which was diagnosed as Nevus of Ota (Figure 2). Her visual acuity was 20\/10 in both eyes, with no afferent pupillary defect. Intraocular pressure in both eyes was normal. Slit lamp examination showed no abnormalities. Findings from fundus examination revealed angioid streaks that formed an incomplete ring around the optic disc and anteriorly radiated toward the equator of the globe, multiple calcified drusen-like structures, and \"peau d'orange\" changes. Skin biopsy (skin tissue from the neck) was taken and the diagnosis of PXE was confirmed. Histopathologic findings revealed calcification of the elastic fibers and abnormalities of the collagen (Figure 3). The patient was not known to have sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait, and her blood pressure levels had never elevated. Other systemic causes of angioid streaks were excluded by findings from extensive laboratory examination. Her relatives were asked to come in for examination but lived far away. One of the patient's sisters lived in Kinshasa, Africa, however, and is presented in case 2. CASE 2: The 27-year-old sister of the previous patient was examined on April 19, 2000. At examination, she was found to have PXE. Her medical history was significant for systemic hypertension since 1998 and genital hemorrhage. She underwent an ablation of a cyst of her left ovary in 1988. Her ocular history was unremarkable. On physical examination, raised (yellow) papillary lesions, typical of pseudoxanthoma, were found on the neck, axillae, clavicle, thigh, and periumbilical regions. External and anterior segment examinations (of her eyes) were unremarkable. She was found to have a best-corrected visual acuity of 20\/10 in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was normal. Funduscopy revealed bilateral angioid streaks, crystalline bodies, and \"peau d'orange,\" but to a lesser extent than in her sister. In both cases, after informed consent, peripheral blood cells were taken and sent for extraction of DNA. Analysis was performed but could not demonstrate the known gene defects of PXE.","1018":"","1019":"","1020":"","1021":"","1022":"Nanotechnology is a subject of extensive global interest.

There are also heredofamilial and hemodialysis-associated varieties of amyloidosis, all with specific amyloid fibril derivatives. Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis is the most rare form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis. Lesions typically present as a crusted nodule on the face, extremities, or acral sites. The amyloid fibrils are immunoglobulin-derived and either kappa or lambda light chains. Systemic involvement is dependent on plasma cell amyloid protein deposition. Lesions may otherwise be classified as a local plasma cell clone or cutaneous plasmacytoma. Recent reports state that there is &lt;10% risk of systemic progression. Workup should include at least a full history and physical examination; serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis; and gingival, rectal, or abdominal fat pad biopsies to rule out the presence of extracutaneous amyloid deposition. Management of nodular cutaneous amyloidosis is challenging, as there is no consistently effective treatment and local recurrence is common.","1025":"Efficacy and safety of azithromycin and doxycycline for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris were evaluated (240 patients) in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The evaluation of clinical efficacy was based on the change in the number of facial inflammatory lesions from baseline to the end of treatment, and noninferiority was defined by the upper 95% confidence limit of the difference between two treatments being less than 9. Reduction in the number of lesions was similar with both azithromycin and doxycycline treatments (27 +\/- 12 and 30 +\/- 12, respectively) in both groups. Also, the upper 95% confidence limit of 5 inflammatory lesions has satisfied the noninferiority criterion. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the two treatment groups. The shorter and simpler treatment schedule of azithromycin had similar efficacy and safety as doxycycline in the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris, confirming noninferiority of azithromycin as compared with doxycycline.","1026":"Although alopecia is one of the most prevalent dermatologic conditions in the United States, it is typically viewed as a benign process with only cosmetic consequences. Androgenic alopecia has an especially strong perception as a cosmetic management issue. This contribution reviews literature gathered through MEDLINE from PubMed to emphasize the value of hair as a part of the system and to illustrate that androgenic alopecia, like psoriasis, can have severe consequences and serve as a risk factor for the development of life-threatening diseases. Individuals with alopecia experience psychosocial and psychiatric illness and may be at risk for cardiovascular disease, prostatic cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp. All persons with alopecia should be evaluated and treated by a physician to minimize its psychological effects and reduce the risk of developing other medical conditions and be further assessed for the presence of commonly associated comorbid conditions.","1027":"","1028":"A 2-hour-old newborn boy hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit was examined for unusual cutaneous lesions.

Topical emollients and etretinate were advised, but the newborn died a few hours later. The parents were first-degree relatives. There was no family history of similar lesions. On the basis of clinical features, the diagnosis of harlequin ichthyosis was made.","1029":"Case 1: A 17-year-old male rural worker from Bolivia living in La Plata (Argentina) for the past year had a lesion on the flexor side of his right forearm (6 x 4 cm). The lesion was formed by several confluent nodular areas, wine-red in color, some fistulized, with hemopurulent drainage. The area was hot and painless (Figure 1). On physical examination, no regional adenomegalies were reported. The following analyses were requested and results reported. Soft tissue ultrasound: material of solid consistency with layered liquid areas, located in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, with fistulous tract, connecting through superficial planes. Evidence of peripheral edema. Bacteriologic analysis (puncture aspiration): methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Mycologic analysis (puncture aspiration): negative; laboratory results: eosinophilia; and human immunodeficiency virus: nonreactive. Histopathologic examination: lesions of necrosis with granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Fungi techniques (periodic acid-Schiff, Grocott stains): negative. Bacilos acid-alcohol resistentes (acid-alcohol resistant bacillus) (BAAR) techniques (Kinyoun, Ziehl-Neelsen): negative. Foreign body examination tested with polarized light: negative. Mycologic and bacteriologic examinations were repeated, including a search for mycobacterium species using material obtained from the biopsy performed on the cutaneous lesion. Macromorphology: the colony was initially black and of creamy consistency, to later become velvety. Micromorphology: dark blastoconidia, then cylindrical phialides with elliptical conidia (Figure 2). Exophiala dermatitidis infection. On the basis of these characteristics, the diagnosis is phaeohyphomycosis due to Edermatitidis. The patient is treated with antimycotic therapy, with oral itraconazole (400 mg\/d), plus indication of surgical procedure to remove the lesion. The patient's condition evolves favorably with no recidivant episodes after the sixth month post-treatment (Figure 3). During the first year, controls were scheduled every 2 months. Case 2: A 72-year-old diabetic man had a painful chronic varicose ulcer on the side of his left foot, with black friable exudate, 2x3 cm in diameter after 1 year.

She reported worsening with deodorant use, but had been using the same deodorant for many years and had continued using it twice a day. Treatment with topical corticosteroids had not helped. The patient coincidentally had been started on isotretinoin 5 months previously for acne, but it had no effect on her axillary or abdominal lesions. Physical examination revealed multiple dark brown and black papules with a \"stuck-on\" appearance in both axillae and on the lower right abdomen. A biopsy of the left axilla revealed a thickened parakeratotic stratum corneum with retention of keratohyalin granules within the parakeratoric cells, which is considered diagnostic of granular parakeratosis (Figure 2). The patient was prescribed calcipotriene cream twice daily. After 2 weeks, she had complete resolution of the axillary lesions, but the abdominal lesions persisted.

Recent trends suggest a continuous rise in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in developed nations and in countries undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization. Pattern and morphology of skin lesions vary with different age groups, and the course of the disease is punctuated by remissions and relapses. Atopic dermatitis has a profound effect on quality of life of patients and may cause financial burden and loss of employment. Therapeutic options, although limited, are associated with risk of various side effects and are mostly appropriate when combined with education and counseling. Evolving knowledge of the pathogenesis and epidemiologic trends of the disease has led to an advent of many new therapeutic agents and treatment options.

It is a synthetic 17-lactone steroid and primarily acts as an aldosterone antagonist. Since the accidental discovery of its antiandrogenic effects, it has been used in the treatment of many dermatologic conditions in which androgen plays a role in the pathogenesis. Antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone are exerted by reducing testosterone production and inhibiting its action on the target tissues. Spironolactone is used as a primary medical treatment for hirsutism and female pattern hair loss. Continuous treatment is required to sustain the effect. It is an effective alternative treatment for acne in women. It has the benefit of a long-term safety profile. Spironolactone should not be used in pregnancy due to its teratogenic effects and is not used in men due to the risk of feminization.","1039":"Leprology is the medical science that focuses on the study of leprosy.

Direct mycologic examination and culture supported the establishment of the etiologic diagnosis. All reported cases showed a single dermatoscopic pattern. Manual and digital dermatoscopic images revealed irregularly distributed dark brown-pigmented dot lesions with filamentous aspect. The authors could not observe any melanocytic lesions. Cutaneous pigmented lesions, including superficial spreading melanoma, are the differential diagnosis. The dermatoscopic images are useful to help distinguish tinea nigra from other melanocytic diseases.","1041":"","1042":"A 48-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of papular hyperkeratotic diffuse lesions on his trunk, arms, and neck that were highly pruritic (Figure 1).

Abnormal laboratory values included elevated levels of uric acid and triglycerides. Serum electrolytes, blood sugar, and renal and liver function test results were within normal range. X-ray film and abdominal ultrasonography findings were also normal. Histopathologic study of the biopsy from the thorax revealed acantholysis with suprabasal clefting, intraepidermal lacunae, and dyskeratosis with corps ronds. The clinical features and results of the histopathologic studies suggested a diagnosis of Darier disease (Figure 2), but the course was not typical of this entity because the patient had no family or personal history of previous cutaneous lesions and the age of onset was older than usual. In the course of the disease, he developed blisters and small black hemorrhagic macules with jagged borders on the back of his hands (Figure 3). Nikolsky's sign was negative. A biopsy of a blister was performed, which confirmed Darier disease, studied by means of immunofluorescence. Measurement of porphyrins in the urine was also ordered. Direct immunofluorescence did not show deposition of immunoglobulins or complement, and the study of porphyrins was normal. The patient was treated with an oral retinoid (acitretin 10 mg daily), but treatment was stopped because he developed an increase in triglycerides; therefore, control of the disease with oral antihistamines, 5-fluorouracil 1% cream, and topical tazarotene was used, with mild improvement.","1043":"A 33-year-old healthy Latina (from either Mexico or Central America) woman with Fitzpatrick type V skin complained of a 2-year history of progressive hyperpigmentation on the axillary folds, dorsal hands, upper neck spilling onto the jawline area, and lower abdomen. There was no preceding dermatitis. The lesions were asymptomatic. She did not use any prescription or over-the-counter drugs or any herbal supplements. She denied contact with any new substances and did not start any new activities. A full review of systems was negative. Physical examination revealed diffuse symmetric gray patches on the proximal arms radiating from the axillary folds with extension onto the trunk (Figure 1). This discoloration was also present on the dorsal hands (Figure 2), upper neck and jawline, and lower abdomen. The lesions were nonpalpable and without erythema. Thyroid function test results and morning cortisol levels were normal. Two adjacent 4-mm punch biopsies were performed on the right axillary skin, one consisted of unaffected skin and one of hyperpigmented skin. Figure 3 shows affected axillary skin with an interface dermatitis and significant pigment dropout. There was no evidence of depositional process of substances such as heavy metals, drugs, or tattoo. There was no evidence of an actinic process. Differential diagnosis included erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP), fixed-drug reaction, or interface drug reaction. As the patient was not taking any medications, the overall clinical and histologic impression was most consistent with EDP.

In addition, because the patient was concerned about the cosmetic appearance of the hyperpigmentation, a 4% hydroquinone cream was started twice daily to the neck area.","1044":"A 71-year-old man presented to the authors' clinic for evaluation of a red line under his right thumb. He noticed a red streak develop during the past year. It slowly grew in width and become more prominent in color (Figure 1). It did not cause pain. He delayed presentation because he perceived it to be only a cosmetic issue. Medical history included a metastatic atypical carcinoid tumor to the liver, lung, and the bone diagnosed 9 years ago. He had undergone multiple debulking surgeries and was currently taking octreotide and zoledronic acid. He had not started any new medications in the past 2 years. Review of systems was unremarkable. On physical examination, the right thumb nail was noted to have a red streak that began at the distal matrix. The line ended at the distal nail plate with distal disintegration and subungual hyperkeratosis. A biopsy was performed through the nail plate. The site removed by biopsy included the area in which the erythronychia visibly started, as well as the preceding normal nail matrix. The ventral nail plate was noted to have a groove of thinning, with slight purple discoloration. The nail bed\/matrix was red in a linear pattern and no clinically apparent hyperkeratosis was noted. The matrix\/bed sample was sent for pathologic evaluation. Notable findings included an acanthotic epidermis with some enlarged nuclei (Figure 2). Mild capillary dilatation was present in papillary dermis. Focal solar elastosis in the distal portion of the nail bed was identified. In situ hybridization for low- and high-risk human papillomavirus was negative. An immunohistochemical study using a panmelanocytic cocktail (HMB45, anti-MART1, anti-tyrosinase) failed to reveal any melanocytic lesion. Perl's iron stain was negative. Metastatic carcinoid or primary squamous cell carcinoma were not identified.","1045":"","1046":"","1047":"","1048":"The nail, a well-recognized and fascinating appendage of the skin, represents an invaluable clinical means to facilitate the diagnosis of a number of dermatoses; hence, the authors considered it worthwhile to examine the physiopathologic alterations affecting the nail morphology, including shape, attachment, surface, and color. The accurate definitions of nail abnormalities in various cutaneous disorders have been delineated and their clinical ramifications have been recounted.","1049":"Patients have frequently described fatigue in association with chronic diseases, including cancer and a host of neurologic, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases. Fatigue can be influenced by factors such as the activity of the disease, medication, age, sex, and duration of symptoms. It presents a multidimensional influence with expression on physical, emotional, cognitive, and even social aspects of life. Fatigue also coexists and often interacts with other factors, including disturbance of mood, anemia, infections, fever, pain, sleep, and stress, making its evaluation complex. Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory and chronic disease that can be widespread and recurrent. Patients with psoriatic arthritis have reduced physical activity (associated with pain, inflammation of joints, muscle hypotrophy, reduced muscular strength, and resistance), reduction of self-esteem, and depression and reduction of quality of life, leading to common somatic manifestations such as fatigue and sleep disturbances.","1050":"The Tzanck smear test is a simple, rapid, valuable, and cost-effective diagnostic method based on the investigation of characteristics of individual cells. In this method, materials are obtained by various techniques and then transferred to a glass slide. Slides can be stained with various dyes and then are examined under a light microscope. To date, cytology has mostly been used in the diagnosis of various erosive-vesiculobullous and nodular lesions, including many tumors. The sampling methods for Tzanck smears and the cytologic findings of a broad range of skin diseases that could provide a rapid diagnosis are described.","1051":"Formulation development is key to the successful treatment of acne. There has been significant progress over the past few years, but not all developments can be universally applied. An effective topical formulation must provide chemical stability and enhanced penetration of active ingredients at optimal concentrations for efficacy and safety; be cosmetically acceptable; and not add side effects of its own. Both retinoids and fixed combinations containing benzoyl peroxide are commonly used to treat acne, but both have the potential to cause troublesome dose-dependent irritation and dryness. Excipients such as surfactants and alcohol have added to the problem. Two products have recently been introduced where a combination of micronization skills and well-chosen excipients has minimized irritation and dryness without compromising efficacy. Results from two major studies are discussed in this article.","1052":"Psoriasis was recently accepted as an autoimmune T cell-mediated disease. Various autoimmune disease associations for psoriasis have been defined, including multiple sclerosis, a model autoimmune demyelinating neurologic disorder. In this study, the familial frequency of psoriasis in a Turkish multiple sclerosis cohort was investigated, and a higher frequency of psoriasis was found, supporting the presence of a complex background of autoimmunity underlying psoriasis.","1053":"","1054":"An 18-month-old boy was consulted to a pediatric clinic with a 5-month history of purpuric macules and nodules on the scalp. He had a history of trauma (falling down from a chair) to the scalp about 6 months before the consultation. He had been brought to an emergency department after the trauma. Cranial computed tomography revealed a small crack on the temporal bone. Purpuric macules and nodules of the scalp had been noticed on the control 1 month later. Results of total blood tests had been within normal limits. Dermatologic examination disclosed multiple pink to violaceous infiltrated cutaneous nodules and purpuric macules with diameters of0.5 to 1.5 cm on his scalp (Figure 1). No petechiae or ecchymoses were seen. Cervical lymphadenopathy was detected during physical examination. There was no hepatosplenomegaly. A punch biopsy was obtained from one of the infiltrated nodules and was sent for histopathologic examination. Histopathologic examination revealed diffuse dermal and subcutaneous edema, erythrocyte extravasation and infiltration by monomorphic cells with large hyperchromatic nuclei, and high mitotic activity (Figure 2). Histopathologic staining was positive for leukocyte common antigen and CD68 in these cells. Results of complete blood cell count of the patient were as follows: hemoglobin: 8.44 g\/dL; white blood cell count: 29.2 x 10(9)\/L; and platelet count 55.6 x 10(9)\/L. Bone marrow aspirate results showed 68.4% blast cells and a biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, with flow cytometry findings positive for acute monoblastic leukemia (AML) French-American-British (FAB)-M5 phenotype. We initiated induction chemotherapy for AML (AML-M5) according to the AML Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 2004 protocol.' Complete resolution of the leukemia cutis lesions was attained with chemotherapy at the end of the first month of treatment.","1055":"A 55-year-old high school science teacher with diabetes presented with severe pain and swelling of his left hand. He reported receiving a \"shock\" 2 days earlier while cleaning out his classroom's aquarium with a bare left hand. Thinking it was a \"short\" in the electrical connections to the aquarium's pump, he disconnected the electrical cord and continued to clean behind the pump mechanism. After a few more such shocks he put on a glove and retrieved 10 foot-long worms. Antibiotics were started. It took more than 2 weeks for the hand to return to its normal size. On presentation to our office, the patient's left hand was moderately swollen, with blistering and purpura seen on his distal fingers. He reported pain, itching, and numbness in the hand, which was getting worse. No systemic symptoms were reported. The patient was a non-insulin-dependent diabetic who was also taking warfarin for a carotid vascular problem. He brought to our office a bucket with coiled aquatic worms at the bottom (Figure 1). When extended, they measured about 1 foot and their morphology could be better seen (Figure 2). No spicules could be seen in the patient's hand on magnification, but taping was performed to remove any possible residual spicules. The patient was given oral antibiotics, a Medrol dose pack, oral antihistamines, and topical corticosteroids. Within 1 day of starting treatment his symptoms and hand swelling began to abate, by 1 week his hand skin peeled, and by 2 weeks the swelling and skin appearance was almost back to normal. Bacterial cultures of the hand's wounds showed no growth.","1056":"A 46-year-old Caucasian man living on the central Mediterranean island of Gozo (Malta) was started on mefloquine 250 mg once weekly before a trip to lower Egypt. He took his medication 1 week before starting his holiday and was advised to continue it for 4 weeks after returning. He did not take any other medication and enjoyed the holiday, which he initially intended to repeat in the near future. His medical history revealed a number of episodes of psoriasis for which he sought dermatologic advice. He had been given systemic therapy on at least one occasion, but the condition had been fairly quiescent for some time and he had not needed to consult a dermatologist for more than 4 years. Soon after the third tablet of mefloquine and effectively just after his return home to Gozo, the patient noticed that the psoriasis was \"creeping back.\" He noted progressive deterioration in his skin problem but nevertheless finished the recommended course of therapy considering that \"being sure about not developing malaria was far more important than a touch of psoriasis.\" The psoriasis worsened to the extent that he had taken off work for 2 weeks from his job as a self-employed carpenter at the time of referral. On examination, clearly there was a significant flare up of his psoriasis with severe involvement of the hands (Figure 1) and feet and less so over the rest of his body. He had been off work and matters were steadily getting worse in spite of topical treatment with a combination of calcipotriol-betamethasone ointment. Oral methotrexate 15 mg once weekly was commenced together with topical therapy with good results (Figure 2).","1057":"A 35-year-old African American man presented with complaints of malodorous drainage from hypertrophic lesions on his occipital scalp (Figure 1, inset). The patient had no family history of keloid formation and no other keloids on his body. The hypertrophic mass on his scalp had been present for 10 years and had not been a result of any type of mechanical, surgical, or laser treatment. It corresponded to the distribution of a large vascular malformation over the occiput (Figure 1). The vascular malformation extended from the occipital scalp to the right parietal scalp, the right side of the face, neck, upper chest, and right arm, with varicosities and hypertrophy of the right upper extremity (Figure 2). The vascular malformation over the right parietal scalp and ear was characterized by bleb formation and hypertrophy of the right ear. The patient reported that no manipulation, including laser treatment, of the vascular malformation had been previously performed. He did state that a previous dermatologist had attempted serial surgical excision of the cerebriform nodules but retired during the course of treatment. He stated that the appearance of his keloid formation and port-wine stain had not changed during the past 10 years. A previous biopsy of a hypertrophic lesion showed histologic findings consistent with folliculitis keloidalis nuchae. Cephalexin 500 mg 4 times daily for 14 days was prescribed for the purulent drainage. A Doppler ultrasound was ordered of the right upper extremity to evaluate for an arteriovenous malformation and showed no evidence of venous thrombosis or arteriovenous malformation. On a second visit 2 weeks later, the hypertrophic lesions continued to show drainage. Clindamycin gel to be applied twice daily to the scalp was added. The patient also had magnetic resonance imaging with and without gadolinium contrast (Figure 3) ordered, which showed a large hypertrophic giant scalp keloid overlying the occipital and suboccipital region measuring 12x 19 cm. There was soft tissue thickening involving the right external ear, extending inferior to the right ear, overlying an intact parotid gland. There was no evidence of muscular or skull invasion.","1058":"","1059":"David Gruby (1810-1898) was an early mycologist, the most prominent between Agostino Bassi (1773-1856) who discovered the fungus on silk worms and Raymond Sabouraud (1864-1938) who wrote the first textbook in the field.","1060":"","1061":"","1062":"","1063":"","1064":"Sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis of implantation. It is the only subcutaneous mycosis for which direct examination or histology is of little or no value for diagnosis. The diagnosis solely rests on the isolation of Sporothrix schenckii in culture. On pathologic examination, causative organisms are rarely seen. Staining with fluorescent-labeled antibodies may aid in visualizing the cigar-shaped yeast forms; however, the organisms are still difficult to identify. Topical therapy is not effective. Potassium iodide is an effective treatment for sporotrichosis, but this agent has not been subjected to specific treatment trials comparing its efficacy against azoles or allylamine alternatives. Itraconazole is generally safe and well tolerated, and the relapse rate is low. Terbinafine could be another therapeutic alternative to treat the disease. Since 1998, researchers from Brazil suggested that feline transmission of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro city was associated with a large and long-lasting outbreak of the disease. To understand the outbreak, there have been studies on the epidemiology and antifungal susceptibility of the S schenckii strains through molecular diagnosis. Data suggest that all isolated strains were genetically related.","1065":"The practice of dermatoscopy continues to gain popularity among clinical dermatologists as well as nondermatologists, and therefore an increasing number of publications in the literature are targeted toward providing education on using a dermatoscope with success.

University students who visited two dermatology outpatient clinics within the Ege University Health, Culture and Sports Office were included in the study. Each student was examined by two dermatologists. Questions about demographic data and information about the frequency of using the swimming pool were directed to the patients. All dermatological diseases were recorded. Patients were asked to assess and give a score for the state of their mental wellness using the visual analog scale (0-100) during the past month. Chi-square and Student t tests were used for statistical analyses. A total of 1733 individuals, 750 (43.3%) men and 983 (56.7%) women, were included in the study. The most frequently seen diseases were acne vulgaris (40.1%) and fungal diseases (17.08%), whereas the least frequently seen were parasitic skin diseases (0.46%) and vascular diseases (0.51%). The mean mental wellness score was found to be 61.03 +\/- 21.34 (0-100, median: 65.00). It can be concluded that students visit university dermatology outpatient clinics frequently and the most common complaints are acne vulgaris and fungal diseases.","1067":"Patch testing is an important diagnostic tool commonly used to identify allergens responsible for allergic contact dermatitis, especially in cases where the diagnosis is not clearly apparent. The authors report the patch test results from 2004-2008 and compare the results with the North American Contact Dermatitis Group and Mayo Clinic. Four hundred thirty-four patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis underwent standardized patch testing with a tray consisting of 50 allergens at Mount Sinai Medical Center. Two hundred ninety patients (66.8%) had positive reactions to at least one allergen. The most frequent contact allergens included nickel sulfate (13%), fragrance mix (9.6%), propylene glycol (7.8%), neomycin sulfate (6.6%), thimerosal (6.4%), bacitracin (6.2%), and sodium gold thiosulfate (5.8%).","1068":"","1069":"","1070":"A 42-year-old white male military recruit presented with a 2-year history of painful ulcerations on the skin of his flanks and thighs. Prior skin biopsies were nondiagnostic but raised the suspicion of an infectious etiology due to the presence ofa granulomatous infiltrate. His medical history was significant for herpes zoster and eczema, and, on review of systems, he had a 1-year history of progressive fatigue and night sweats. Examination revealed approximately one dozen 1- to 5-cm indurated, dusky violaceous plaques on his trunk and lower extremities. Several of the plaques, including one on his right flank, had overlying deep ulcerations (Figure 1A and 1B). Bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was present.","1071":"A 49-year-old man was first seen in our department for the evaluation of scleroderma-like skin changes and a nonhealing ulcer on his leg from years before referral. His medical history was of long duration. His growth was stunted at the age of 12. At 21 years of age, the patient noted graying of the scalp hair, most prominent on his temples, and the process was progressively completed by the age of 23. At the same age, atrophy and thinning of the skin and loss of subcutaneous fat resulted in a tense, shining, and adherent appearance of his skin, most obvious on his face and extremities. Soon after, he developed a high-pitched, hoarse voice. He had undergone bilateral cataract surgery at the age of 30. Around the age of 46, he developed a unilateral nonhealing chronic leg ulcer (Figure 1). He had separated from his wife because of infertility. He was the first offspring of his second-degree healthy relative parents. The other 3 siblings had similar signs and symptoms. Our patient gave the history of premature graying of the hair of his younger brother at the age of 18 and his 2 younger sisters at the age of 12 and 16. His brother had recently received diagnoses of bilateral cataract and diabetes mellitus. All of the siblings had ceased growth from early adolescence. On physical examination, our patient's weight was 48 kg and his height was 150 cm. He had normal intelligence. He was speaking with a high-pitched and childish voice. He had a bird-like appearance with a beak-shaped nose. Mottled and diffuse pigmentation and poikiloderma appearance was conspicuous on his neck (Figure 2). The entire skin was smooth, shiny, and scleroderma-like, and a marked decrease in the subcutaneous fat was noted over the extremities. A deep cutaneous ulcer was evident on his slimmed leg. Digital ulcers were not found, and radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable. Clinodactyly of the toes were conspicuous. His nails were dystrophic and he had used dentures from the age of 20. On examination of the external genitalia, his testes were smaller than normal. In the biopsy taken from the leg ulcer, there were no signs of malignancy. There were no signs ofosteomyelitis on x-ray. Biopsy of the normal skin revealed atrophic epidermis and thick dermis with hyalinization of the collagen fibers and absence of pilosebaceous structures (Figure 3). The patient's scalp hair was thin and sparse and there were few axillary and pubic hairs. His fasting plasma glucose level was normal.","1072":"A 10-year-old girl who was admitted to the urology department with complaints of urinary incontinence was referred to our dermatology outpatient clinic because of a congenital, circumscribed, hypertrichotic area on the lumbosacral region. Cutaneous examination revealed a circumscribed area of coarse, dark terminal hair measuring 25 x 15 cm overlying the lumbosacral area with normal underlying skin (Figure 1). There were erythematous macular lesions on the superior of the hairy area. The lesion had been present since birth, and no other family member had similar lesions. Her history revealed back pain and a long history of urinary incontinence. On neurologic examination, no motor weakness or sensory changes were observed. Babinski reflex was positive on the left. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings included diastematomyelia between T12 and L1 levels and slight flattening of lumbar lordosis (Figure 2). A diagnosis of faun tail with underlying spinal dysraphism was made. There was also urinary incontinence as late sequelae of spinal dysraphism.","1073":"A 60-year-old African American man presented to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of skin and nail changes associated with docetaxel therapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

At his latest visit, he reported recently noticing a new bluish discoloration of his lunulae that had developed during the past 3 months, the time corresponding to his most recent docetaxel treatment cycle (Figure). The patient's history did not reveal any recent medication changes, ingestion of known lunula-discoloring agents, or any silver-containing compounds. On examination, the patient's observation was confirmed, as the lunulae on both his right and left thumb were found to have a marked blue discoloration to them. The patient was treated with observation as the discoloration was not bothersome to him, and on routine follow-up for an unrelated skin complaint, the patient's nail beds had returned to their normal color, approximately 3 months after discontinuation of the docetaxel therapy, according to the patient.","1074":"","1075":"","1076":null,"1077":"Teledermatology is a developing application of telemedicine.

The authors examined the systemic safety (adrenal suppression potential) of topically applied hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream (proprietary lipid rich cream vehicle) in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 6 years and 12 years to 18 years. An open-label hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression study was conducted wherein the sole treatment was 0.1% proprietary lipid rich cream vehicle. A total of 65 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and body surface area involvement of at least 25% were included in the treatment phase of the study based on the requirement that these patients had normal baseline cortisol and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system function. All signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis showed progressive improvement beginning with day 8 through the day 29 evaluation. Pruritus showed the greatest improvement, with a decrease in grade of 1.3 at day 8, and continued to show improvement at day 29, with a decrease of 1.8 from baseline. The percent body surface area affected at baseline averaged 40.5%, and it decreased significantly to a mean of 6.5% at day 29. Only 5 (8%) of the 63 patients showed laboratory evidence of adrenal suppression at the end of the treatment evaluation. None of these ever demonstrated any clinical signs or symptoms of adrenal suppression.

There were a total of 390 boys and 310 girls. The majority of skin conditions in newborns are transient. The most common dermatoses found were of infectious etiology (38.43%) in which impetigo (11.13%) and pyoderma (8.9%) were the most common. In infectious etiology, incidence of scabies was 5.32%. Viral warts were the most common viral infections followed by molluscum contagiosum. Incidence of eczema, atopic dermatitis, and sweat gland disorders were 6.64%, 0.83%, and 8.86%, respectively. The study shows various unique features of tropical pediatric dermatology in a developing country, such as high frequency of infections and infectious, nutritional, and environmentally associated disorders. Many of these dermatoses can be controlled by proper environmental sanitation, improving nutrition, awareness among parents and children, and preventing overcrowding.","1083":"","1084":"A healthy 5-year-old Caucasian girl presented to the pediatric dermatology clinic for poor hair growth.

She are a normal diet and had normal growth and development otherwise. She was not taking any medications or over-the-counter supplements. There was no family history of hair disorders. On physical examination, the patient had short, fine, reddish blond hair that was of different lengths (Figure 1). There were no papules, pustules, scale, or crust on her scalp. Lymphadenopathy was absent. She had normal eyelashes and eyebrows. There were no lesions on her oral mucosa. No tooth or nail abnormalities were present. The rest of the physical examination was normal. The hair pull test resulted in 4 easily pulled hairs (3 anagen and 1 telogen). A hair mount was performed (Figure 2). The hair mount analysis revealed anagen hairs with distorted bulbs and ruffled cuticles extending a short distance distally from the bulb, consistent with loose anagen hair (Figure 2). All of the anagen hairs on the pull test demonstrated the above findings. Based on the patient's clinical presentation and the findings seen on light microscopy of the hair mount preparation, the patient was diagnosed with loose anagen syndrome.","1085":"A 71-year-old black woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a several-year history of increasing numbers of itchy white spots spreading over the chest, back, elbows, and legs. In 2004, the patient developed clusters of mildly pruritic hypopigmented and depigmented macules on her back and left shoulder along with depigmented flat papules on the lower extremities. The patient's condition was unresponsive to topical triamcinolone and tacrolimus, after which she was lost to follow-up for 3 years until her entire chest became involved. Her medical history was significant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus and her medications included amlodipine, aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, irbesartan, and metformin. Family history, social history, and review of systems were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed multiple shiny white perifollicular macules, some with slight scale, on the trunk (Figure 1) and extremities (Figure 2). On the left shoulder and back were 2 shiny plaques with hypopigmented macules and follicular scale within. Punch biopsies from the abdomen and back showed atrophy of the epidermis, edema and sclerosis of the papillary dermis, and a patchy lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate (Figure 3). Despite inspecting multiple step sections, we were unable to histopathologically confirm the clinically apparent folliculocentric distribution. Based on the clinical and histological findings, extragenital lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) was diagnosed and the patient was treated with clobetasol proprionate 0.05% ointment. While being prepared for narrowband UV-B therapy, a serologic screen revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640 with a homogeneous pattern. A subsequent rheumatologic evaluation was negative for autoimmune disorders; pertinent negative serologies included anti-double-stranded DNA, smooth muscle, mitochondrial, thyroid, and parietal cell antibodies.","1086":"A 46-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic juvenile arthritis with bilateral prosthetic hips presented with vulvoperineal ulcerations of 3 years' duration. There was no diarrhea or recent weight loss. Cutaneous examination showed asymmetrical vulvar edema of the labia minora and labia majora with deep and linear ulcerations having verrucous borders located on the inguinocrural regions and the buttocks fold (Figure 1). On physical examination there was bilateral limited mobilization of the hips. A biopsy specimen was taken from the border of the vulvar ulceration and histologic examination showed under a hyperplasic epidermis an epithelioid granuloma with multinucleated giant cells of the dermis without caseification. Laboratory analyses and results from chest x-ray were normal. Results for Koch bacilla in the spittle, microbiologic studies (staining for microorganisms and cultures), and tuberculin intradermoreaction were negative. There was no Crohn's disease aspect on colonoscopy, and there was normal small bowel enterography. Systematic intestinal biopsies were also with normal aspect. Based on the clinical data and granulomatous histologic characteristics, the diagnosis of metastatic Crohn's disease without digestive involvement was obtained.

Classic infection is associated with traumatic inoculation of soil, vegetables, and organic material contaminated with Sporothix schenckii. Animals of various species, including humans, are affected by this disease. This subcutaneous mycosis is an infection of implantation. The most frequent clinical form is the lymphocutaneous form. The fixed cutaneous form is characterized by infiltrated nodular, ulcerated, or erythematosquamous lesions located on exposed areas where fungal inoculation occurred. The disseminated cutaneous forms have mainly been observed among immunosuppressed patients, especially human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals. Sporotrichosis is the only subcutaneous mycosis for which direct examination or histology is of little or no value for diagnosis.

Although the diagnosis is easily made on medical examination, DPN is characterized by a chronic and worsening course. Therefore, even if DPN is a benign disease, the lesions are unaesthetic and the therapeutic options are quite inefficient. A prospective study was carried out during a period of 24 months (January 2006 to December 2007) at the Department for Preventive Medicine for Migration, Tourism and Tropical Dermatology of San Gallicano Dermatological Institute in Rome. Among 58 patients, 41 (71%) were women and 17 (29%) were men. The mean age was 33.5 years (range, 8-45 years). One pediatric patient was observed. This study is the first in Italy that, in recent years, has observed an important growth of the migration. The classic female predominance, family predisposition, and photodistribution of the lesion were found. DPN is frequently associated with patient discomfort, therefore the education of patients to reduce self-treatment is important.","1096":"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory and proliferative dermatosis.

It was performed in the department of dermatology at Al-Sadr Teaching Hospital in Najaf, Iraq. The lipid profile, including serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein, were assessed in both groups. The patient and control groups each consisted of 39 men and 11 women. The serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL, and very LDL levels were significantly higher in psoriatic patients (P &lt; .05) but not for high-density lipoprotein (P &gt;.05). Serum lipid level was found to be significantly higher in Iraqi patients with psoriasis. It may be useful to do early screening and treatment ofhyperlipidemia in psoriasis to prevent atherosclerosis and its complications.","1097":"","1098":"","1099":"A 66-year-old woman presented with asymptomatic skin-colored to hypopigmented scaly plaques over the extremities, reportedly of 12 years' duration. The lesions started as well-defined erythematous scaly papules over the forearms, gradually followed by the appearance of similar lesions over both legs and dorsum of feet. During this period, the lesions increased in size, with peripheral extension and central clearing, leading to the present morphology. She is a known patient with coronary artery disease currently on treatment. There is history of exertional dyspnea, which has been related to her cardiologic ailment.

He was of Greek descent. His medical history was remarkable for nasal polyps, which were surgically removed 15 years earlier. Initially, he had been treated with antibiotics, without improvement. Several days before admission, chest radiography revealed pulmonary infiltrates in the left lower lobe. On admission, physical examination revealed a well-orientated man in mild distress, with inspiratory rhonchi at the lower part of the left lung and scattered erythematous nodules of variable size, some of which were ulcerated. Laboratory values were notable for leukopenia, 3.3 x 10(9)\/L; total protein, 5.9 g\/dL; globulin, 2.2 g\/dL; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, 86 IU\/L; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, 71 IU\/L; and lactate dehydrogenase, 519 U\/L. Computed tomograph (CT) of the chest showed multiple alveolar opacities bilaterally (Figure 2). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy did not reveal any important pathologic findings. Results of bronchial biopsy, cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage, washing, brushing, and sputum following bronchoscopy were negative. CT of the brai and sinonasal area revealed an abnormal low-density mass in the left nasal area. CT findings of the abdomen were negative, as were results of a bone marrow biopsy. There was no evidence of immunosuppression. The differential diagnosis, considering the evidence described, included granulomatous or infectious diseases, angiocentric lymphoproliferative lesions, and lymphomas. Biopsy of a skin lesion showed lymphoproliferative infiltration of the dermis with a follicular and angiocentric growth pattern and regional epidermal necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cell were positive for CD56 and CD3 (cytoplasmic positivity) and expressed the cytotoxic proteins T-cell intracellular antigen and granzyme B (Figure 3) They lacked TdT, CD34, CD7, CD8, TCL-1, and CD123. Findings from an in situ hybridization study for Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Give this result, molecular analysis ofT-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based TCR-gamma gene, wit negative results. The morphology and the immunophenotype were consistent with natural killer\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type. Nasal involvement must be first excluded to proceed to the diagnosis of nasal-type natural killer-cell lymphoma. Indeed, histologic examination of the nasal mass revealed its polypoid nature. Thus, the authors were led to the diagnosis of extranodal extranasal natural killer\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type, CD56-positive, Ep stein-Barr virus-negative, TCR-negative. The patient received combination chemotherapy and completed 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin vincristine, and prednisone every 14 days for 2 months. Skin lesions improved, and there was no fever soon after the initiation of therapy. Reevaluatio after the fourth cycle, however, disclosed pulmonary infiltrations as well as leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system. The patient had receive systemic salvage chemotherapy and intrathecal infusions of methotrexate. Although the lung lesions had diminished at that time, the patient develope paraplegia, his clinical course rapidly deteriorated, and he eventually died.","1101":"In this short historical review, we will discuss the origin and references to the giant cell that is sometimes histopathologically present in the dermis of lichen simplex chronicus that was first described by Hamilton Montgomery, MD.

Consequently, they may manifest potential adverse effects and drug interactions. The expansion in sales of herbal remedies has brought products to the marketplace that do not always conform to the standards of safety and efficacy that physicians and patients have come to expect. Relatively few physicians inquire about herbal medicine use, and up to 70% of patients do not reveal their use of herbal medicines to their physicians and pharmacists. All physicians should question patients regarding their use of herbal remedies and document their responses in the medical record. Patients should be aware that potentially limited standardization and quality control, and somewhat circumscribed regulation, may result in variability in content, efficacy, and potential contamination of herbal remedies. Physicians in general, and specifically dermatologists, should be aware of potential adverse reactions related to the use of certain herbal remedies. Specific cautions exist with regard to dermatologic side effects such as contact dermatitis, blisters, urticaria, angioedema, ulceration, photosensitization, and changes in skin pigmentation.","1107":"This study reports the results obtained during the \"Quitting Smoking Rejuvenates the Skin\" campaign, a pilot project in favor of the fight against nicotine addiction in women promoted by the Municipality of Milan jointly with other organizations. The initiative allowed researchers to evaluate the benefits on the skin obtained by cessation of smoking in a sample of 64 Caucasian women who smoked and who, in the period between February 2007 and November 2007, were followed by a team of dermatologists, psychologists, and nutritionists. During the dermatologic program, clinical and instrumental evaluations were made at the beginning of the study and at 3, 6, and 9 months. The state of skin aging was evaluated visually by giving a clinical score to each sign of skin aging (lines, vascular and pigmentation state, elasticity, brightness, texture of the skin). These signs were then correlated using a particular \"spider web\" graph called Spiderming, the result of Derming research that allows the monitoring of results obtained over time. Taking into account that a wider area of the graph coincides with more advanced skin aging, the graph of mean values observed in the study patients narrowed as time went by, reaching certain statistically significant values in as little as 6 months of observation. The patients' biological skin age was also calculated so as to better quantify the benefits they obtained by giving up smoking. It was possible to measure the biological age of the skin using noninvasive instrumental measurements of parameters such as skin smoothness, brightness, coloring, and elasticity. A complex mathematic algorithm processed the results obtained for each patient and, on this basis, calculated the biological age of the patient's skin. At the end of the program, an average reduction of about 13 years in the biological age of the patients' skin was found, while, at the beginning of the study, patients had presented with an average biological age of 9 years older than their chronologic age. This pilot project not only demonstrated that quitting smoking improves skin conditions, and above all skin-aging effects, but for the first time it afforded the opportunity to produce data that quantify this benefit.","1108":"A new fixed-dose combination formulation of adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% has shown excellent efficacy and safety in registration studies; however, it can be difficult to judge the real-world performance of a product using only the results from controlled clinical trials. This 12-week, open-label, community-based study evaluated adapalene\/BPO in 91 patients with mild to moderate acne (20-50 inflammatory lesions and 30-100 noninflammatory lesions) who were treated at dermatology centers throughout Argentina. The study evaluated efficacy, described the most common side effects, determined tolerability, and assessed the level of patient satisfaction with treatment. By week 12, there were statistically significant reductions in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions (80.6% and 69.3% from baseline, respectively; P &lt; .001); there were also significant improvements in the Investigator's Global Assessment scores (median score, 2.9 at baseline and 1.0 at week 12; P &lt; .001). By week 12, 67% of patients were rated clear or almost clear by investigators. Local tolerability was good overall. When cutaneous irritation was present, it typically occurred in the first 2 weeks of treatment and improved or resolved with continuing therapy. Patients were highly satisfied with the results of treatment, and 74% of patients felt that they had marked or total improvement by week 12. Patient survey also revealed that 94% rated the efficacy as good or very good and 87.5% rated tolerability as good or very good. A significant majority (81%) felt that the treatment met expectations, and 62% perceived that improvement had been rapid during adapalene\/BPO therapy. These results demonstrate that adapalene\/BPO has good efficacy and tolerability in routine practice, resulting in continuous reductions in lesion counts throughout the study. Adapalene\/BPO therapy is also associated with high patient satisfaction, which is important for therapeutic adherence and satisfaction with the physician's care.","1109":"Pemphigus, a life-threatening autoimmune disorder, is the most common autoimmune bullous disease in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. No studies have investigated the immunopathologic features of this geographic setting. To determine the immunopathologic features of pemphigus in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey, the authors evaluated the histopathological, immunofluorescence (IF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results in a 4-year study. In this prospective study, tissue from 174 patients was analyzed by direct IF (DIF); 384 by indirect IF (IIF) from 61 patients with pemphigus; and 88 by ELISA for antibodies against desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and Dsg 3 from 50 of those 61 patients. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) was the most commonly observed subtype (46 of 61 patients, 75.41%), followed by pemphigus foliaceus (9 of 61 patients, 14.75%), pemphigus erythematosus (5 of 61 patients, 8.2%), and pemphigus herpetiformis (1 of 61 patients, 1.64%). There was a significant correlation between clinical activity score (CAS) and IgG antibody titer in IF (P &lt; .001) and ELISA tests (P = .024 for Dsg 1; P = .028 for Dsg 3). Antibody titers and C3 scale did not predict exacerbations and relapse. The commonest clinical subtype of pemphigus was PV in this region. Results indicate that IgG antibody titer in IF and ELISA tests of patients with pemphigus are correlated with CAS; however, they are not useful in predicting exacerbations and relapse of disease.","1110":"Infantile hemangioma is a common disease. Steroids have been used for its treatment; however, intralesional steroids cause pain and other problems. A treatment modality that can avoid these problems is desirable. The authors evaluated the role of topical steroids as an alternative to intralesional steroids in the treatment of superficial hemangioma. Inclusion criteria were &lt;2 superficial type ofhemangiomas &lt;5 cm. The topical steroid mometasone furoate was applied twice daily. Intralesional triamcinolone acetonide was injected at monthly intervals using a 24-gauge needle at doses of 1 to 2 mg\/kg. Forty-five (86.5%) patients responded to treatment with the topical steroids, of which 50% had excellent and 36.5% had good response. In the intralesional group, the response rate was 95.7%, of which 63.8% had excellent and 31.9% had good response. Complications in the topical steroid group were mild itching and irritation (19.2%) and hypopigmentation (7.6%). Complications in the intralesional group were pain (100%), bleeding (17%), infection (17%), cutaneous atrophy (8.5%), cushingoid facies (2.1%), and growth retardation (2.1%). Topical steroids are a reasonably good alternative to intralesional steroids as an initial choice for treating superficial hemangioma.","1111":"","1112":"","1113":"","1114":"","1115":"","1116":"","1117":"","1118":"","1119":"","1120":"","1121":"Vicks VapoRub (Procter &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, OH) is one of the most popular over-the-counter therapies in the world, used to provide relief from the symptoms of the common cold and non-life-threatening respiratory infections.

Women participants with bilateral, outer aspect of the thigh SR were randomized to apply a quarter-sized amount of the onion extract cream twice daily for 12 weeks to the randomized left or right, outer aspect of the thigh. No treatment was administered to the contralateral side. Participants were evaluated at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Primary efficacy endpoints included color, texture, softness, and overall appearance of SR by the participant and investigator at week 12. The treated thigh demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the mean change in participant and investigator evaluations in overall appearance, texture, color, and softness compared with the untreated thigh at week 12. No adverse events occurred during the study. The onion extract cream was well tolerated and significantly improved the appearance of SR in women.","1127":"Only a few corticosteroids for topical use have proven safe and effective in pediatric populations down to 3 months of age.

A total of 264 boys and girls 3 months to less than 18 years old, with stable, mild to moderate atopic dermatitis affecting at least 10% body surface area applied HCB 0.1% in LCr or LCr alone twice daily for up to 1 month without occlusion. Primary end-points included: percent of patients who achieved treatment success based on physician global assessments. Secondary endpoint included: difference in pruritus and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at day 29. Treatment was significant (P &lt; 0.001) for HCB 0.1% LCr over vehicle. No serious nor significant adverse events were reported. Results are representative of a short duration treatment for a chronic disease.

They are an important topic as they are transmittable and cause social embarrassment. Though there are several treatments for viral warts, none offer a fast, simple, complete cure by itself. A simple and inexpensive way of treatment would be outstanding, especially in the developing countries. The authors' goal was to determine in patients with warts, the efficacy and safety of topical puncture with 85% formic acid in distilled water solution. A placebo-controlled, clinical trial was performed in patients with common viral warts who were referred to the Khorshid and Beheshti dermatology centers of Isfahan Medical School in 2003 and 2004. A total of 34 patients received 85% formic acid in distilled water solution on their lesion on one side of the body and distilled water as placebo on the other side of the body, every other day, using a needle puncture technique. Follow-up occurred every 2 weeks up to 3 months for all patients. Ninety-one percent of patients who received formic acid application showed complete disappearance of warts after follow-up period, compared to 10% in the placebo (distilled water) group. The results show that the application of 85% formic acid in distilled water solution is a safe and effective treatment for common warts with few side effects and good compliance.","1129":"","1130":"","1131":"","1132":"Reports have appeared that sera of patients with systemic autoimmune disorders have demonstrated autoantibodies to vinculin.

Results of staining for vinculin were positive in 2 of 7 PV patients, 6 of 9 BP patients, and all 6 cutaneous autoimmune patients. Staining results were negative in all controls. Strong immunostaining to vinculin was found in 3 of 6 vinculin-positive BP patients and 5 of 6 vinculin-positive cutaneous autoimmune patients. The expression and distribution of vinculin are accentuated in patients with various skin autoimmune diseases and appear to be stronger in diseases involving the basement membrane, where it is thought to be relatively more important than in other skin disorders. ","1133":"A 30-year-old man diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 10 years earlier, presented with large tense blisters associated with minimal itching of 10 days' duration. He had no history of oral or genital erosions or ulcerations and showed no symptoms of HIV-related illnesses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had been started 6 weeks earlier when his CD4 count was 116\/mL. He initially received nevirapine 200 mg once daily; after 2 weeks with no skin eruptions or other adverse reactions, the dose was increased to 200 mg twice daily. Other components of his HAART included lamivudine and stavudine. The patient was not taking any other prescription or alternative medicines. During the past year, he experienced 4 episodes of intensely itchy urticarial lesions that subsided with antihistamines. The present episode of bullous lesions was also preceded by urticarial lesions. On examination, he had multiple, large, tense bullae over relatively normal-looking skin involving all parts of the body (Figure 1). There were a few well-defined erosions. Nikolsky and bullae spread signs were negative, and no oral or genital erosions or ulcerations were noted. Results of a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, and chest x-ray were within normal limits. Skin biopsy from one of the blisters showed a subepidermal bulla filled with eosinophils and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Figure 2). The underlying dermis showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed of polymorphonuclear and lymphomononuclear cells. The overall features were suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. A direct immunofluorescence test could not be done because of possible risk of cross-infection to the operator of the cryostat. Workup for herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infection also could not be performed. HAART was discontinued temporarily with the suspicion that it was the causative factor. The patient was started on oral prednisolone 40 mg\/d and topical clobetasol propionate (0.05%). Within 1 week of treatment, he had significant improvement with almost complete disappearance of the lesions. A few small, tense vesicles continued to appear between. Once the lesions completely disappeared, the prednisolone was gradually tapered off and all the components of HAART were resumed. The patient did well without any recurrence of lesions, thus virtually excluding HAART as the cause of the bullous pemphigoid-like eruptions. Subsequently, he did not return for follow-up.","1134":"","1135":"Alefacept is a biologic response modifier indicated for moderate to severe psoriasis; it has been available since 2003.

A secondary objective of this study was to examine whether increasing the dose during the initial course of alefacept would reduce the time to onset of efficacy and overall response rate. Two separate dosing regimens are evaluated in this study: 30 mg IM for 6 weeks followed by 15 mg IM for 6 weeks (group 1) and alefacept 30 mg IM weekly for 12 weeks (group 2). Efficacy was assessed using the PASI, Physician Global Assessment, body surface area, and photographic evaluation of a target lesion. A total of 20 patients enrolled and were randomized, 16 of whom completed the study. Data analyses were performed on a per-protocol basis. Overall, the mean PASI scores progressively decreased, with 43.8% reaching a 50% reduction in the PASI (PASI 50) at week 14 evaluation. Of these participants, 37.5% were in group 1 and 50% were treated with alefacept 30 mg IM for 12 weeks (group 2). Although our sample size was small, 12.5% of patients (one patient in each treatment arm) reached PASI 75. The most common adverse events encountered in this trial were mild infection, headache, pruritus, and erythroderma. There were no infections associated with a CD4(+) cell count &lt;250 cells\/mm(3). There was no difference between the treatment groups in achieving PASI 50 or PASI 75. In addition, in our small population, the higher doses of alefacept were associated with increased adverse effects, including erythroderma.

Within 2 months of starting treatment, he had evidence of diffuse repigmentation of all the patches of vitiligo. Two months later, all the lesions repigmented completely with excellent color matching except those in the infraorbital area. The parents were anxious due to brownish hyperpigmentation in the previous patch of vitiligo in infraorbital area (Figure). He had no irritation or burning sensation in the areas of application. There was no history of photosensitivity. The patient was applying tacrolimus once at night, and no photoprotection was advised. Due to location of the lesion in the infraorbital area, a cosmetically important site, the parents did not consent for punch biopsy.

Results of a throat swab were positive for influenza A infection (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assay), and the patient was treated with oseltamivir. The patient's constitutional symptoms improved slightly, but within 2 days after her initial presentation, she returned to her primary care provider and described 24 hours of dysuria and vulvar swelling. She had a history of herpes labialis (cold sores) and rare episodes of minor oral aphthae (canker sores) that occurred less than twice a year. The patient denied a history of sexual activity, sexual abuse, or physical trauma. Physical examination showed ulceration and swelling of the labia minora, and the patient received an empiric dose of acyclovir (200 mg 4 times daily) for presumed autoinoculated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. An ulcer swab was performed, and urinalysis revealed no evidence of infection. Two days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with increasing vulvar pain and vaginal discharge. The previous ulcer swab findings were negative for HSV (PCR assay), and consequently, acyclovir was discontinued after 1 day of therapy. She received topical viscous lidocaine and an empiric dose of oral fluconazole. The lidocaine provided temporary symptomatic relief. Results of DNA amplification studies were negative for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A potassium hydroxide preparation was negative for fungi, and an ulcer swab for bacterial culture revealed usual flora. Of note, the PCR assay for Epstein-Barr virus was not performed on ulcer cells. The patient was referred to the department of dermatology, and results of a physical examination showed copious white mucoid discharge and a 2-cm ulceration of the left labia minora (Figure, panel A). Two smaller pinpoint ulcerations and swelling of the left labia minora were also noted. The lesions were clinically indistinguishable from the genital aphthous ulcers of patients with complex aphthosis (recurrent, severe aphthous ulcers on oral or genital mucosa). A diagnosis of ulcus vulvae acutum was made, and treatment was started with clobetasol 0.05% ointment (4 times daily) and lidocaine gel as needed. Four days later, the patient reported marked symptomatic improvement. Physical examination showed near resolution of the large vulvar ulceration (Figure, panel B). The patient tapered use of clobetasol ointment over the next several days until the ulcerations healed completely. Two months after her initial episode, the patient again had 3 small vulvar erosions after symptoms that included low-grade fever, malaise, and vomiting. She did not receive oseltamivir for this illness; clobetasol ointment was applied 4 times daily, and the vulvar erosions ameliorated within a few days. Her constitutional symptoms resolved without treatment.

She complained of dry cough and dyspnea of 2 years' duration, which was diagnosed as interstitial lung disease (ILD) based on chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography. Apart from occasional backaches, the patient had no other systemic complaints. The results of the general physical examination was normal, with no lymphadenopathy. Cutaneous examination revealed multiple (5) firm, yellowish to skin-colored well-defined nodules with irregular margins ranging in size from 1 x 1 cm to 4 x 8 cm present over the left periorbital region and right jawline, with overlying telangiectasias on the skin (Figure 1). On examination of the chest, she had generalized rhonchi and crepts; the remainder of the systemic examination results were normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology from the nodule in the periorbital area revealed a dispersed population of spindle cells, numerous foam cells, and giant cells suggestive of xanthogranuloma. Histopathology from the nodule on the jawline showed abundant foamy histiocytes in the dermis with few multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes (Figure 2). The foamy histiocytes were periodic acid-Schiff-positive. On immunohistochemistry, histiocytes were CD68-positive. Findings of routine investigations including hemogram, peripheral blood smear, and blood chemistry were normal. Radiography of the lumbosacral spine showed mixed osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions involving L5-S1, the left sacroiliac joint, and the left iliac blade. Findings from radiography of the long bones and skull were normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed areas of osteolysis, with marginal sclerosis present bilaterally that involved the iliac blades and the right half of the sacrum. A methylene diphosphate bone scan revealed increased tracer uptake seen at the fifth lumbar vertebrae, bilateral sacroiliac bone, and left iliac bone and areas of photopenia in sacrum. Bone marrow aspiration from the sternum showed normal cells with a normal erythroid-to-myeloid ratio. Ultrasonographic B scanning of the eyes showed no retro-orbital involvement. Erdheim-Chester disease was diagnosed in this patient on the basis of diagnostic histopathology, radiologic features involving bones, and ILD and treatment with 40 mg oral prednisolone daily was started.

At the time of the examination, the patient presented with psoriatic plaques with adherent scales confined on the scalp (Figure 2A). According to the patient's history, her limited psoriasis was partially controlled with occasional topical medications (topical corticosteroids, calcipotriol, and tar shampoo). She also had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, asthmatic bronchitis, and partially controlled hypertension with hyperlipidemia. A biopsy specimen was taken from lesional skin on her feet, and a histological examination showed a subepidermal blister with an inflammatory cell infiltrate in the upper dermis. No drugs were incriminated, and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid was confirmed by Western immunoblotting of serum. Laboratory investigation revealed mild thrombocytopenia of 110,000\/mm(3), cholesterol 279 mg\/dL, and triglycerides 210 mg\/dL. The patient could not tolerate prednisolone and cyclosporine because of hypertension and diabetes, or azathioprine because of the mild thrombocytopenia; she did not consent to receiving biologics.

Despite their negative cosmetic appearance, no topical treatment is commonly recommended for these lesions. Our objective was to assess whether clinical benefit could be achieved by using a keratolytic topical agent and superficial scraping for this condition. A topical 50% urea-containing product under occlusion was applied daily to large and\/or thick hyperkeratotic seborrheic keratoses on the truck and extremities. The patients were instructed to digitally scrape the surface of the lesions in an attempt to reduce the thickness of the lesions. In a pilot nonrandomized open-label survey, patients expressed satisfaction with using this topical therapeutic technique. Hyperkeratotic seborrheic keratoses can be satisfactorily managed with topical agents and scraping with reasonable patient satisfaction.

He reported increased pruritus and scaling of lesions when exposed to the sun. He worked as a construction worker and admitted to frequent sun exposure. Physical examination revealed well-circumscribed erythematous to violaceous papules with raised borders and atrophic centers localized to the nose (Figure 1). He did not have lesions on the arms or legs. He did not report a family history of similar lesions. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the edge of a lesion on the right ala. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed acanthosis of the epidermis with focal invagination of the corneal layer and a homogeneous column of parakeratosis in the center of that layer consistent with a cornoid lamella (Figure 2). Furthermore, the granular layer was absent at the cornoid lamella base. The superficial dermis contained a sparse, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. No evidence of dysplasia or malignancy was seen. These findings supported a diagnosis of porokeratosis. The patient underwent a trial of cryotherapy with moderate improvement of the facial lesions.","1150":"A 45-year-old previously healthy man presented with minimally itchy spiny papular lesions of 3 years' duration and discharging nodular cystic lesions for the past 2 years. Initially, lesions appeared on his ears, followed by the gradual appearance of similar lesions over his face, back, and extremities. The lesions were not associated with photosensitivity. Over the years, the patient continued to have similar lesions without any significant response to various topical medications and oral antibiotics. There was no history of fever or any other systemic complaints and the patient denied any other significant medical problems in the past. Cutaneous examination revealed multiple, grouped, spiny papular lesions coalescing to form plaques at places over the ears, extremities, and trunk (Figure 1). Elongated, horny, follicular spires were noted on the top of the papular lesions. Multiple discharging nodular lesions with crusting were seen predominantly over the chest, abdomen, and back (Figure 2), and closed comedonal lesions were noted on the face and trunk. Multiple orange-brown scaly plaques were seen over the extensor aspect of the patient's thighs (Figure 1, inset). A few nails showed wedge-shaped thickening without subungual hyperkeratosis or other nail changes. Palms, soles, and oral mucosa were normal. Considering the atypical cutaneous findings, the clinical possibility of pityriasis rubra pilaris (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-associated type 6 PRP) was considered. Hematoxylin and eosin stain of skin biopsy specimens taken from the spiny papular and plaque lesions revealed marked hyperkeratosis with alternating orthokeratosis and parakeratosis with follicular keratotic plugging (Figure 3; Figure 3, inset). Irregular broad acanthosis was also detected in the epidermis. Dermis showed moderate perivascular lymphomononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. Thus, the skin biopsy was consistent with PRP. HIV serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with 3 different kits was found to be positive for HIV-1. The patient denied any risk factors associated with acquiring HIV infection, and laboratory values for complete blood cell count, routine serum biochemical profile, and lipid profile were normal. The patient was prescribed oral isotretinoin and asked to come for follow-up for CD4 T-cell count, but did not return.","1151":"A 68-year-old woman presented with recurrent mucocutaneous blisters of 6 years' duration and progressive loss of scalp hair of 2 years' duration. The disease had started as tense blisters associated with a burning sensation over the lower part of her back, gradually followed by involvement of her chest, upper part of her back, and arms. The blisters persisted for weeks before rupturing spontaneously. Four years later, she developed tense oral blisters, resulting in painful persistent erosions. At about the same time, blisters on her scalp developed, followed by erosions and hair loss. No other mucosal sites were involved. She had no symptoms of photosensitivity, joint pain, dysphagia, weight loss, or other systemic complaints. On examination, multiple tense bullae and well-defined deep erosions were seen over the hard and soft palates (Figure 1). Cutaneous examination revealed a few tense bullae on normal-looking skin over her abdomen (Figure 2 inset) and arms and areas of scarring at the site of healed lesions on her back. Her scalp had bullae of similar morphology, crusted erosions, and cicatricial alopecia at the site of previous lesions involving a large area of scalp (Figure 2). Examination of the other mucosae did not reveal any abnormality. Histologic studies with hematoxylin and eosin stain of a skin biopsy specimen revealed deroofed subepidermal bullae with dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate predominantly composed of eosinophils (Figure 3). Direct immunofluorescence of a biopsy specimen from perilesional skin revealed linear deposits of immunoglobulins M and G and of C3 at the dermoepidermal junction which was consistent with mucous membrane pemphigoid. This patient was prescribed prednisolone 30 mg daily and dapsone 100 mg daily, following which there were no new blisters. At 3 months' follow-up, previous erosions had partially healed.","1152":"A 41-year-old woman presented to our dermatology clinic in February 2005 with a chief complaint of numerous flesh-colored nodules on her back and abdomen. She initially noticed the lesions at age 17 years. The plaques had increased in size and number over time, but remained asymptomatic. The patient reported multiple similar lesions on a maternal uncle and a cousin. Her family history was also notable for cardiomyopathy, resulting in the death of her mother. The patient's past medical history was notable for poorly controlled type I diabetes, currently managed with an insulin pump; and coronary artery disease. The patient had undergone multiple cardiac procedures before the age of 40 years, including quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and placement of 9 cardiac stents. Her ejection fraction on cardiac catheterization in November 2004 was 65% with no wall motion abnormalities. On physical examination, numerous spongy, discrete, flesh-colored plaques and nodules were seen concentrated across the upper part of her back between the scapulae as well as underneath the breasts and across the flanks (Figure 1). All lesions were asymptomatic. Prior workup of this patient had included plain films of the long bones and hands, which were within normal limits. A biopsy from lesional skin on the back highlighted by trichome stain showed an increased number of markedly thickened and eosinophilic dermal collagen bundles compared with adjacent normal skin. Immunohistochemical studies with anticollagen type I and type III antibodies confirmed that the increased collagen material consisted of type I collagen fibers, which is the same type of collagen found in normal dermis. The elastic fibers, highlighted by Verhoeff-van Gieson stain (Figure 2), were diminished and haphazardly arranged. No increased cellular component or inflammatory infiltrate was observed. These findings were consistent with a collagenoma. Further analysis of the lesional tissue by electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural appearance of the collagen fibers, including arrangement and diameters, were not significantly different from that of the normal tissue (Figure 3).","1153":"Case 1: A 58-year-old man presented with a solitary asymptomatic nodule on his thumb (Figure A). After trauma with a rusty nail approximately 20 years ago, he had developed a small papule, which had enlarged gradually for a few days initially before stabilizing. His personal and family medical histories were unremarkable. Dermatologic examination revealed a 1-cm crater-like nodule on the left palmar area. This was a firm and nontender lesion that was fixed to the overlying skin but moved freely from underlying structures. There were no similar lesions elsewhere on his body. Case 2: A 52-year-old man presented with a nodular lesion on the left palmar surface of his thumb. The 0.8-cm lesion was lightly colored, with a central cup-shaped epidermal depression and thin epidermis. The patient described an insect bite to the area 15 years earlier as the precipitating event. The firm and nontender lesion was fixed to the overlying skin but moved freely from underlying structures (Figure B). Case 3: A 36-year-old man consulted for a nodular lesion, located on his left palmar surface, that had not enlarged or changed since appearing 3 years ago. He described mechanical trauma to the area as precipitating the lesion. Clinical examination revealed a 0.6-cm, well-circumscribed nodule, with a dome shape and colored skin. Clinically, the nodular lesion appeared to be a benign tumor (Figure C). In each case, the nodule was excised totally and histopathologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed, nonencapsulated nodule within the mid-dermis. Thick, acellular collagen bundles were arranged randomly in short fascicles through the center of the lesion. Cellular areas consisting of histiocytes and fibroblasts with a storiform pattern at the periphery of lesion were observed, but nuclear atypia and mitotic activity were not. Results of immunohistochemical stain with CD34 were negative, but in all cases were strongly positive for Factor XIIIa. Slight epidermal hyperplasia was present with orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and flattened rete ridges in the overlying epidermis (Figure A-1, Figure B-1, Figure C-1). The subcutaneous fat and adjacent skin were normal. No folliculosebaceous units at the periphery of the lesion were seen, but a few eccrine sweet glands were noted.

It was, therefore, thought worthwhile to precisely review its origin and mechanism of action. Its topical application in the form of 0.03% to 0.1% ointments is rapidly effective and safe in pediatric and adult patients. Its use in atopic dermatitis ever since has been approved in Japan, the United States, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent. Thus, its local immunosuppressive action was fairly intriguing. Accordingly, its indications\/uses were extended to cover several inflammatory dermatoses. Vitiligo, psoriasis, alopecia areata, contact hypersensitivity, lichen planus, pyoderma gangrenosum, ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, and skin grafting\/transplant are a few unapproved indications and uses, in addition to miscellaneous dermatoses. At present, its therapeutic efficacy other then atopic dermatitis is confined to case studies, and large studies are warranted. At this point in time, therefore, it is conceivable that tacrolimus use should be carefully evaluated and used only when the conventional treatment has failed to yield favorable results.

To demonstrate that isotretinoin is converted into retinoid and improves the appearance of the photoaged skin. Fifty women aged 40 to 60 years, phototype I, II, or III according Fitzpatrick, were selected to receive 20 mg of isotretinoin orally 3 times a week for a 3-month period. Patients underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation. Two biopsies and photographic control were performed. Patients were requested to use only topical photoprotecting agents during the treatment. Improvement in photoaging clinical parameters were evaluated through pictures taken and also through an evaluation form. Anatomopathologic parameters were obtained by comparing collagen degeneration and skin trophism. Results. Thirty patients fully complied with study requirements and were adequately analyzed. From the anatomopathologic data, an improvement of photoaging in 20 patients was observed. Isotretinoin improves photoaging with few adverse events because of the low dose used and to the short treatment duration.

A retrospective review of hospital records from 1999 to 2006 in the dermatology department of a large municipal medical center found 8 patients who met the criteria for DRESS syndrome: drug-induced generalized eruption, associated systemic involvement (lymph node or visceral), and presence of eosinophilia (eosinophil count &gt; or =1500\/microL and\/or circulating atypical lymphocytes). There were 4 men and 4 women, aged 19 to 53 years, with a mean age of 38 years. A sex difference was found in 3 parameters: (1) age, younger age in women; (2) time interval between drug intake and rash, shorter in women; and (3) the culprit drug: carbamazepine in 2 men and 2 women, salazopyrin in 2 women, and phenytoin in 2 men.

The lesions were asymptomatic, had appeared several years before her consultation, and had remained stable in size. Similar lesions on her trunk and extremities had spontaneously resolved before presentation. She had no significant medical history and was not on any medications. Cutaneous examination was remarkable for a few scattered, well-demarcated, slightly raised pink papules and plaques with no scale, ranging from 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. The lesions were distributed on the right cheek, right temple, left lower eyelid, and neck area. The rest of the cutaneous examination was unremarkable. A punch biopsy was performed from a lesion near the left premandibular area. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimen revealed superficial perivascular dermatitis with a slight increase in the number of fibroblasts (Figure 2). Colloidal iron staining was diffusely positive with replacement of collagen with mucinous material in the dermal layer (Figure 3). Laboratory values for a complete blood cell count, metabolic panel, serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and antinuclear antibody were within normal limits.

Before the appearance of CA, he experienced acute orchiepididimitis and a Candida infection. The patient was immunologically examined, and the lower level of lymphocytes, slightly reduced level of IgM, and C4 complement were revealed. Results from a human immunodeficiency virus examination were negative. After the therapeutic failure mentioned above, photodynamic therapy (PDT) was initiated using 20% aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) in a gel. The photosensitizer was applied to lesions and 10 mm of surrounding skin in a 1-mm-thick layer under occlusive dressing for 3 hours and then removed with saline and nonwoven gauze. The site was immediately irradiated with noncoherent red light with an emission spectrum of 580 to 680 nm wavelength (Medeikonos PDT-Model 200, Medeikonos AB, Sweden). The total light dose was 50 J\/cm(2); light intensity ranged from 70 to 90 mW\/cm(2). Because of persistent fluorescence during photodynamic therapy, the treatment was repeated 10 times in 2-week intervals with a follow-up of 1, 3, and 6 months after its completion. After the last PDT treatment, the persistent fluorescence disappeared completely. The absence of fluorescence corresponded with a healed clinical finding without scarring and pigmentation (Figure 2). The period from the initiation of PDT to the consolidation of CA was 22 weeks. During PDT treatment, the patient felt only mild burning, which disappeared after the illumination stopped.

Lipomas are usually benign adipose tumors with as-yet unexplained pathogenesis and etiology. A link between soft tissue trauma and the formation of lipomas has been described, with the latter being named posttraumatic lipomas. Twenty-three cases of posttraumatic lipomas in 19 patients treated at our institution between August 2001 and January 2005 were reviewed with regard to medical history, magnetic resonance imaging findings, intraoperative findings, clinical chemistry, and histology. The mean age of the patients was 50.0 years (+\/-15.5). The average time between soft tissue trauma and lipoma formation was 2.6 years (range, 0.5-6.0 years). Sixteen of the 19 patients reported extensive and slowly resolving hematoma formation after the traumatic event. Nine of 23 lipomas were found on the upper extremities, 3 on the lower extremities, 9 on the trunk, and 2 on the face. All tumors were located epifascially. Twenty-two lipomas were removed by simple excision and, in one case, aspiration lipectomy was performed. Pathology demonstrated capsulated and noncapsulated benign adipose tumors in 23 cases. The average body mass index, amounted to 30 kg\/m(2) (+\/-7.6 kg\/m(2)). Seven patients without known bleeding disorders presented with an elevated partial thromboplastin time. The pathogenetic link between soft tissue trauma and the formation of posttraumatic lipomas is still controversially discussed. There are 2 potential explanations to correlate soft tissue trauma and adipose tissue tumor growth. The first is the formation of so-called posttraumatic pseudolipomas by prolapsing adipose tissue through fascia resulting from direct impact. A second possibility points toward lipoma formation as a result of preadipocyte differentiation and proliferation mediated by cytokine release following soft tissue trauma and hematoma formation.

Since no formal dose-response studies have been conducted, the authors analyzed phase 3 data to determine whether a dose-efficacy relationship exists. Standard parametric regression analyses were used to estimate the correlations between dose (mg\/kg body weight) and overall drug exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) in a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study and between dose and efficacy (mean change from baseline in total inflammatory lesion count at week 16) in 2 pooled phase 3 clinical efficacy studies. Additional regressions were run at each visit for the clinical efficacy studies to determine whether results differed across visits. A regression analysis was also performed in a subset of patients who showed a greater efficacy response. We found overall drug exposure (AUC) to have a highly significant correlation with dose (mg\/kg) (r=0.49; P=.006). In contrast, clinical efficacy did not correlate with dose at any of the visits at week 3 (r=0.01; P=.85), week 6 (r=0.04; P=.53), week 12 (r&lt;0.01; P=.98), and week 16 (r=0.03; P=.64) or among the subset of patients who showed greater clinical benefit.

She was started on zinc supplement (50 mg daily) for 6 months and her diet was modified. The hair loss stopped in 3 weeks. Follow-up in 4 months showed no evidence of alopecia, with normal-looking hair.","1192":"A 22-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented to the Vanderbilt University Dermatology Clinics with a 5-year history of painful, red plaques and nodules on her shins and tops of her feet. She had initially been seen by a rheumatologist, who diagnosed her with erythema nodosum (EN) and prescribed oral prednisone. After 1 month of therapy, the condition had not improved and she discontinued the treatment. She had undertaken no additional therapy in the interim. At the onset of her condition, she was taking no medications, using only etonogestrel\/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring for contraception. Her condition did not change after beginning this hormonal contraception. Her lesions were constant, with variable waxing and waning and without any discernible precipitants. They were tender to palpation but were otherwise without symptoms. She denied any history of fever, joint pain, fatigue, cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, mucosal ulcerations, foreign travel, infectious exposures, or illicit drug use. Clinically, her anterior legs displayed moderately well demarcated patches and nodules with dusky erythema. The lesions were tender to palpation but were not present on the feet or above the knees. Darkened, bruise-like areas were also appreciated and corresponded to older, quiescent lesions. Results from a chest x-ray, complete blood cell count, and metabolic panel were normal. She declined a biopsy. She was treated with supersaturated solution of potassium iodide, indomethacin, methotrexate, and dapsone, all without benefit. She was then begun on etanercept 25 mg administered subcutaneously twice weekly. After 1 month she noticed the lesions beginning to fade with a concomitant decrease in their discomfort, and by 4 months she was clear of her disease. Results of all monitoring blood work were normal. At 6 months, her disease had resolved and her etanercept dose was reduced by half without any flare of her condition. She has continued 25 mg weekly for 12 months without developing any new lesions.","1193":"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the lower gastrointestinal tract but potentially involving the skin, musculoskeletal system, and eyes. The origin remains unknown, although diverse etiologic agents have been proposed. Characteristic pathologic appearances include the formation of \"skip\" lesions (discrete regions of inflamed bowel separated by uninvolved mucosae), aphthous ulceration, and fistulation; these signs relate to the presence of an underlying granulomatous transmural inflammation. Cutaneous and oral lesions frequently occur in CD. They may be classified as specific manifestations (in particular, perianal fissures, abscesses, sinuses, and fistulae in ano) with a granulomatous noncaseating inflammation on histologic examination, and nonspecific manifestations (eg, erythema nodosum, neutrophilic dermatoses) with a nonspecific histologic pattern. The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and histopathologic features. Therapy is mainly aimed at the control of the acute disease and prevention of relapse through the use of mesalazine, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and very recently, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies.","1194":"A 72-year-old white man presented with a large cutaneous tumor on his back. The patient said the lesion, mostly asymptomatic, had increased in size for about 7 years. Physical examination revealed a vegetating mass (Figure 1), partially ulcerated, measuring 30 x 20 cm, which easily dripped serum and blood, with small necrotic areas and a sclerotic border. Perilesional skin appeared edematous, probably owing to inflammation and impaired lymphatic flow. Clinically, there was no evidence of lymph node involvement. His family history was noncontributory. Hematologic examination revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia. Laboratory test results showed hyperuricemia and hypercholesterolemia. The patient's history revealed mild hypertension, ischemic cardiopathy treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and anticoagulant drugs, and moderate chronic renal insufficiency. Histologic examination of a biopsy specimen taken from the margin of the lesion displayed a superficial area of ulceration and invasion of the deeper dermis and subcutaneous tissue (Figure 2A and Figure 2B). The tumor mostly showed an adenoid pattern: gland-like structures and cystic spaces sometimes containing amorphous or granular material, surrounded by strands of basaloid cells devoid of any peripheral palisading (Figure 2C). In some areas, the adenoid pattern coexisted with infiltrated areas characterized by thin and elongated strands or cords of basaloid cells with irregular and jagged peripheral contours within a fibrous or edematous stroma (Figure 2D). Basaloid cells often revealed nuclear atypia, marked pleomorphism and hyperchromatism (Figure 2C and Figure 2D). Therefore, a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, adenoid subtype, was made. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 10-cm wide thickening of the subcutaneous layer on the lumbar region, with a partial neoplastic infiltration of the muscle fascia. No evidence of metastases was found with a total body computed tomography scan. Because the patient was taking anticoagulant drugs and had unstable renal and cardiac function, surgical treatment was at least temporarily excluded, and the patient was referred for radiation therapy.","1195":"A 28-year-old man with a diagnosis of vitiligo universalis for 6 years presented with reddish polygonal papules that had developed on his left hand first and then on his right hand. On dermatologic examination, porcelain-white hypopigmented appearance was observed all over his body, and there were violaceous, flat-topped papules changing from 2 to 5 mm in diameter localized on the hypopigmented areas of the dorsum of both hands and flexor sites (Figure 1). The physical examination and laboratory investigations including hemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum biochemistry, and urinanalysis were normal. Antibodies to thyroid tissue, hepatitis viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, nuclear, and streptolysine were negative. Repeated IgA levels in serum were found to be decreased; however, the other immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) and C3, C4 and cryoglobulins were in normal ranges. Histopathologic examination of the polygonal papules revealed hyperkeratosis, focal thickening of the granular layer, and irregular acanthosis in triangular saw-tooth pattern. The basal layer was invaded by the lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate and had numerous necrotic keratinocytes. The infiltrate in the upper dermis was band-like and sharply demarcated at its lower border. There were also a few melanophages in the upper dermis. Melanocytes were decreased in number, and in some areas they were absent at the basal layer of epidermis. Clinical and histopathologic diagnosis were consistent with lichen planus and vitiligo (Figure 2).","1196":"A 60-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a complaint of a dermatitis that had recurred 2 or 3 times a month for the past 5 years. No trigger episode or obvious pattern of recurrence was noted. She reported some itching or burning as a prodromal symptom. Recurrence has been at multiple sites, in a dermatome pattern, including areas around the arm, face, back, abdomen, knees, and ears. Each occurrence is at a different anatomic site (and she only has lesions at this 1 site during each occurrence. For example, after formation and resolution at 1 site (ie, the right medial forearm) the patient will then have a later recurrence at another site (ie, the upper left part of the back). The patient has no complaints of fevers, chills, or adenopathy. Medical history includes type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Results of a basic laboratory screening at the time were all within normal limits. No other contributory history was noted. On examination, the medial arm just proximal to the elbow had clusters of vesicles (Figure). Viral culture performed on the lesion confirmed our suspicion of the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV). The patient was started on valacyclovir and asked to return if no improvement was noted. To date the patient has not returned to the clinic.","1197":"","1198":"","1199":"","1200":"","1201":"The authors present part I of a review of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, a rare systemic proliferative disease of histiocytes of unknown cause.

The authors discuss the historical, epidemiologic, and clinical aspects of this disease.","1202":"The treatment of verrucae with bleomycin injections has not become a routinely adopted form of therapy in dermatologic practice since its use was originally described in 1980 because of the adverse effects and complications that have been associated with it. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the results and the incidence of adverse effects from the use of bleomycin in clinical practice in a retrospective study of patients presenting with verrucae and to demonstrate the convenience and ease of the methodology that was used in obtaining these results. Patients' lesions were injected with bleomycin every 3 to 4 weeks until the lesions had been eliminated or the injections were discontinued because of adverse effects or complications. There were 211 patients in the study, and 224 lesions were treated. After 1 treatment, 47.6% of the lesions were cleared; another 38.8%were cleared after 2 treatments; and another 9.8% were cleared after 3 treatments. In total, 96% of lesions were cleared after 5 treatments. A small number of temporary adverse effects were noted: 3 patients had local chemical cellulitis, 2 patients had formation of sterile abscesses, 1 patient had postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and 1 patient had localized pain. No local or systemic complications were observed. Therapy with intralesional bleomycin is a relatively rapid and convenient form of therapy, compared with other available treatments, from the point of view of both the patient and the physician. ","1203":"Pemphigus, an immunoblistering disorder, is reported with equal or near equal frequencies in men and women despite prominent female predominance in prevalence ratios of the vast majority of autoimmune diseases. To assess a possible correlation between pemphigus and intake of sex hormones in a cohort of pemphigus patients. A prospective online survey using a specially designed questionnaire was conducted among patients with diagnosed pemphigus in the United States during a 1-year period from September 2005 through September 2006. A total of 249 pemphigus cases were enrolled, 158 women (63%) and 91 men (36%). The female-to-male ratio was 1.7:1. Age at onset of the disease ranged from 16 to 85 years, mean 4.5.4+\/-12.9 [corrected] years for both sexes (not statistically significant): 45.3 for women and 45.7 for men. At the time of pemphigus diagnosis, 12% (20 of 158) of the women and 4% (4 of 91) of the men reported using hormone replacement therapy. At the time of disease onset, 46% (20 of 43) of the postmenopausal women took hormone replacement therapy. Possible questionnaire self-reporting biases. The finding of a female predominance among pemphigus patients is attributed to the immunopathogenesis of the disease that makes women more susceptible to this and other autoimmune disorders and to the strikingly high proportion of hormone replacement therapy users found among postmenopausal women. ","1204":"","1205":"","1206":"A 35-year-old man presented with a 7-year history of gradually enlarging plaques on his face and trunk. The first lesions had developed on both sides of the forehead and the left cheekbone (Figure 1). Four years later similar lesions appeared on his neck and back. He presented a histologic report of a biopsy specimen from a facial plaque performed 5 years earlier that was diagnostic for granuloma faciale. He had different treatments such as topical steroids and cryotherapy without improvement. The appearance of new lesions on his trunk and the gradual enlarging of the old lesions convinced the patient to seek further treatment. Physical examination revealed dusky, violaceous plaques and papules, 0.5 to 2 cm, well-circumscribed, slightly elevated, and located on the face and trunk, with mild pruritus (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, VDRL test, antinuclear antibody test, biochemical parameters, and chest x-ray, did not reveal any abnormalities. A skin biopsy taken from the upper part of the back showed similar features to the facial lesion, detected 5 years before, revealing a dense, polymorphous infiltrate involving mid and deep dermis and displaying a diffuse and perivascular pattern (Figure 3A). A narrow grenz zone of normal collagen was consistently observed between dermal infiltrate and epidermis as well as around the pilosebaceous follicles (Figure 3A). The infiltrate mainly consisted of eosinophils and lymphocytes, but neutrophils (often displaying leukocytoclasis), macrophages, and plasma cells were also present (Figures 3B, 3C). Some mast cells were also identified by staining with toluidine blue (Figure 3D). Perivascular infiltrates were often seen, sometimes penetrating vessel walls and in association with leukocytoclasis. Hyalinization of vessel walls, extravasation of red blood cells around capillaries, and nuclear dust were also noted. The epidermis did not show any remarkable change except for slight acanthosis. A diagnosis of granuloma faciale with extrafacial lesions was made, and a systemic therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily for 6 weeks) was recommended.(1,2).","1207":"The dermatology staff was called to evaluate abnormal hair on a 22-month-old Hispanic girl whose parents were first cousins. Her medical history was significant for leptomeningitis with subsequent neurologic devastation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recurrent respiratory infections. Her hospital course was complicated by sepsis, liver dysfunction, pan-cytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She had developed normally for the first year of life. At 13 months she became progressively lethargic and developed floppy muscle tone; a delay in mental and motor milestones was recognized. Results of a metabolic workup were negative. On examination she was noted to have generalized excessively fair skin when compared with her parents. She had silver-gray hair (Figure 1) and white eyebrows and body hair. Her maternal grandfather and granduncles had silver hair since childhood, but were without health problems. A maternal family member was said to have light skin. The presumed diagnosis before pathologic examination was Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Hematoxylin and eosin stain tests revealed prominent melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. The melanocytes were large and distended with a large volume of melanin (Figure 2). The adjacent keratinocytes were completely devoid of melanin. Application of Masson-Fontana ammoniac silver stain highlighted prominent melanocytic melanin and a relative paucity of melanin in the adjacent keratinocytes (Figure 3). Microscopic examination of her hair revealed clumps of melanin of various sizes and shapes irregularly distributed throughout the hair shaft. Ultrastructural examination of the epidermis showed the melanocytes were distended by an accumulation of large stage IV mature melanosomes. Peripheral blood smear failed to show abnormal granules, even after repeated examination. Based on the clinical features and the pathologic findings, a diagnosis of Griscelli syndrome type 2 was made.","1208":null,"1209":"A 45-year-old man with AIDS presented with extensive erythema and scaling involving the face, trunk, and upper and lower extremities, and mild nail dystrophy. The patient had been diagnosed with psoriasis 2 years previously, and at the time of presentation was using emollients and topical corticosteroid creams with little improvement. He was receiving zidovudine, lamivudine, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, acyclovir, rifabutin, and hydroxyzine. Pertinent laboratory data included CD4 lymphocytes (10 cells\/mm(3)), viral load (32,000 copies per mL) white blood cell count (3.4 x 10(3)\/microL), hemoglobin (13.5 g\/dL), and platelets (204 x 10(3)\/microL). Because of the extensive eruption and lack of response to topical agents, the patient was started on acitretin 25 mg daily. The patient had shown no signs of improvement 4 weeks later and was noted to have brownish gray crusted plaques involving the beard area, neck, upper part of the back, arms, trunk, genitals, and thighs in addition to his erythroderma (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Microscopic examination of scales from the upper part of the back revealed numerous scabies mites and eggs. He was then treated with lindane shampoo on the scalp and beard area and permethrin 5% cream to the body. The patient returned 2 weeks later with some improvement after thrice-weekly applications of this regimen; however, scrapings from the trunk once again revealed live scabies mites. Microscopic examination of scales that had fallen on the examination table revealed multiple mites and eggs. The patient was then given permethrin 5% cream, which he applied 3 times a week for 2 weeks, and 1 dose of oral ivermectin, 200 micro\/kg. This resulted in a marked decrease in crusting and scaling. With resolution of the scabies lesions, the patient displayed marked erythema and scaling of the trunk and extremities consistent with generalized psoriasis (Figure 3). Treatment with acitretin resulted in gradual resolution of the erythroderma. A few months later, the patient presented with nodules on the upper part of the back, which on biopsy revealed a scabies mite (Figure 4).","1210":"A 40-year-old man visited Haiti in the winter. His visit was uneventful, and he went swimming in the ocean. A week after his return he developed a small \"pimple\" on his right fifth finger. This condition progressed for several weeks, with new lesions developing over the extensor surface of his forearm and in the antecubital fossa. He had tender axillary adenopathy. The patient started a new job when he returned from Haiti, working 4 days per week in a greenhouse. He denied any fever, chills, or night sweats. He was in good health without any underlying chronic health problems. Physical examination revealed a small eschar over the distal phalanx of the patient's right fifth finger (Figure 1). There were 2 erythematous nodules over the extensor surface of his right forearm (Figure 2) as well as over the antecubital fossa (Figure 3). A punch biopsy was performed and results showed suppurative granulomatous dermatitis. Sporothrix schenckii was grown from the specimen.","1211":"","1212":"Case 1.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cutaneous findings in patients with CRPS I. Eighteen patients with CRPS I were included in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Of the 18 patients with CRPS I, 9 (50%) had hyperhidrosis, while hypohidrosis was present in 2 patients (11.1%). Eight patients (44.4%) had hypertrichosis, and 1 patient (5.6%) had hypotrichosis. Five of the patients (27.8%) had nail changes. These cutaneous changes are not rare in CRPS I and generate difficulties for the patient; therefore, they should be prevented during the early stages of CRPS I with use of an effective treatment. ","1217":"Pressure ulcers are classified into 4 distinct stages, which allows comparisons between institutions and even countries. Recently, attempts have been made to single out so-called moisture lesions from the early stages of pressure ulcer lesions as a distinct entity. To investigate the justification for this development, 14 histopathologic samples from patients with both incontinence and pressure ulcer lesions were studied in an attempt to delineate differences in the pathophysiology and histopathology. Two distinct histopathologic pictures emerged: an ischemic pattern and a pattern of irritation. The latter appeared to be associated with lesions that clinically fit the description of moisture lesions, but this association was not absolute. There is no justification for singling out moisture lesions from pressure ulcer lesions. The distinction may even be dangerous when proper preventive measures for the development of pressure ulcers are not taken because of the existence of a possible moisture lesion.

When the child was 1 year old, the swelling appeared as a minute raised skin eruption the size of a pearl at the back of the neck. It was painless and progressive, continuing to increase in size until it reached the size of a walnut. At age 2 years, a minor surgical intervention was undertaken to remove the swelling, but a year later, it recurred at the same site. The size continued to increase until it reached the present size. Examination of the afflicted skin surface showed the presence of a globular, nonreducible swelling measuring 7.5 cm x 5 cm located on the upper posterior portion of the neck. Both the swelling and the skin over it were mobile and nontender. Otherwise, the boy's skin surface was without blemishes. On palpation, the swelling was plexiform, resembling a bag of worms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 1.5T MR (Signa, GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, England) using T1 and T2 weighted fast spin echo and short tau inversion recovery sequences in the axial and sagittal planes. The images were marked by a well-defined, homogeneous signal intensity lesion in the subcutaneous plane of the nape of the neck. The lesion appeared isointense in T1W images and hyperintense in T2W images with few flow voids within the lesion. Based on the MRI findings, a diagnosis of superficial plexiform neurofibroma was considered. Results of routine liver and kidney function blood examination tests were within normal limits. Surgical resection was done under general anesthesia. As soon as the skin was excised, the swelling started bleeding profusely, but bleeding stopped almost immediately on the complete excision of the swelling. No cavities were present in the mass, and the underlying structures were normal. The wound was closed with nonabsorbable monofilament nylon suture. The postoperative period was uneventful. In addition to initial excision biopsy, all of the resected tissue material was subjected to serial sectioning for microscopic pathologic examination. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections showed unremarkable epidermis with slight hyperkeratosis. Upper dermis showed circumscribed, lobular proliferation of spindle cells in a loose fibular background distorting much of the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Subcutis showed numerous thin-walled, ectatic blood vessels lined with prominent endothelium. Intervening tissue consisted of wavy bundles of collagen lined with elongated thin cells with tapering and wavy nuclei. The nuclear chromatin was bland without significant polymorphism or raised mitotic activity. A few nerve twigs were also seen within the tumor, which was infiltrating the surrounding fat.","1222":"CASE 1: A 38-year-old teacher presented with a 3- to 4-week history of a linear, erythematous, vesicular, and pruritic eruption of her left wrist. She had been wearing a new elastic bracelet for 4 weeks before the onset of her eruption. Although there was no history of allergy to rubber products or jewelry, an allergic contact dermatitis to rubber was suspected. Patch testing to rubber chemicals and the elastic bracelet revealed no reactions at 48, 72, and 96 hours. She stopped wearing the bracelet and used a corticosteroid cream with rapid resolution of the problem. The patient resumed wearing the bracelet, and there has been no recurrence in the past 2 months. CASE 2: A 12-year-old boy presented with a 1-month history of an itchy, scaly, erythematous 1-cm patch over the midline of his lower lip. The patient complained of tiny blisters initially with persistent erythema, mild scaling, and associated pruritus. The patient plays the saxophone and he had been practicing more intensely (3 to 4 h\/d) for a musical competition. Allergic reaction to his wood reed was suspected, but patch testing with a moistened portion of his reed and reed shavings in a drop of water revealed no reaction at 48 and 72 hours. Treatment with hydrocortisone 1% cream bid for 3 days led to complete resolution of the dermitis and pruritus. Playing the saxophone 1 h\/d has not led to any recurrence. CASE 3: A 33-year-old woman presented with erythema, scaling, and pruritus of 1 month's duration beneath her engagement and wedding rings, which were worn together on her left fourth finger (Figure 3). Although she had no history of previous sensitivity to earrings, watch clasp, blue jean rivets, or other jewelry, allergic contact dermatitis to nickel was suspected. Patch testing was performed to the common metal allergens nickel, cobalt, chromium, and gold. Readings at 48 hours and 1 week revealed no positive reactions. The patient wore her rings on the right hand for 1 week and used fluocinonide 0.5% cream twice daily for 1 week with resolution of the dermatitis. She has subsequently begun wearing the rings again on her left hand with care to dry her hands and rings after washing, and there has been no recurrence of her dermatitis.","1223":"A 53-year-old black man was diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung and treated initially with 4 cycles of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin and external-beam radiation therapy with a good clinicoradiologic response.

His lung cancer recurred 10 months later, when he was found to have bone metastases. Second-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed 500 mg\/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks was commenced. A week prior, the patient was started on folic acid 1 mg orally daily and given an injection of vitamin B12 1000 microg intramuscularly that was continued every 3 cycles thereafter. Dexamethasone 4 mg orally twice daily was given around the time of chemotherapy administration to prevent the dermatitis associated with the drug. The patient denied taking other drugs. Two months into his second-line chemotherapy, he developed multiple, concomitant, transverse and longitudinal black lines in all of his fingernails and toenails. After an interval of 3 months, he presented a complex pattern of nail hyperpigmentation, from combined dense horizontal and longitudinal streaks in some nails to diffuse black discoloration in others (Figure). Other associated changes included koilonychia, dystrophy, and friability of nail plates. Along with normal results of a hepatorenal panel and normal serum vitamin B12 and folate levels, no metabolic or endocrinologic alterations were present to explain the nail pigmentation and dystrophic changes. Results of his mycologic examination and cultures came back negative. When questioned, he denied taking any other drugs including other alternative medicine approaches or vitamin supplements, particularly retinoids, well known for causing severe nail dystrophy.","1224":"A 70-year-old woman presented for evaluation of an eruption localized to the area covered by her partial upper denture. Her medical history and physical examination were otherwise unremarkable. She originally had a metal upper partial denture, which she used for many years without difficulty. Four years before presentation, she developed a painful eruption affecting only the tissue covered by the upper partial denture. Contact dermatitis to metal was suspected, and a new upper partial denture constructed primarily of acrylates was fashioned. When she transitioned to the new denture, the inflammation in her oral mucosa persisted and perhaps worsened, despite an excellent fit. Examination revealed striking erythema and mild edema sharply localized to the areas where the partial upper denture contacted the gum ridge. Patch testing was performed and revealed allergies to multiple acrylates, including methyl methacrylate. A swab from the gums was sent for yeast culture. No Candida was detected. Based on suspected candidal overgrowth on the denture, the patient was advised to begin applying nystatin ointment between the gums and the denture, and to start soaking the dentures nightly in chlorhexidine 0.12% solution. In addition, because the relevance of the acrylate allergy was unclear, her dentist was contacted and it was recommended that the dentures be boiled to induce polymerization of any residual un-reacted methacrylate monomers. The patient had a 90% improvement in the clinical appearance and in symptoms at an 8-week follow-up appointment. Due to logistic issues, the dentures had not yet been boiled. The improvement, despite the dentures not having been boiled, was felt to demonstrate that the acrylate allergy was not relevant. The patient has continued to slowly show further improvement over 6 months of follow-up.","1225":"International guidelines recommend resistance testing of maternal virus for all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy leads to maximal virologic suppression, thus minimizing the risk of drug resistance, but it is available only in developed countries.

Pruritic score was calculated for each patient before treatment and 1 month after. After treatment, the mean pruritic scores +\/- SD of the hydroxyzine and doxepin groups were 16.7+\/-2.3 and 17.8+\/-2.5, respectively. The severity of pruritus was decreased in 80% of patients in the hydroxyzine group and 75% in the doxepin group (P=.786). Eighteen patients in the hydroxyzine group and 14 patients in the doxepin group reported sedation.

Laboratory examination showed hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase, and serum alanine aminotransferase; normal activities of creatinokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aldolase; an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern; negative anti-DNA and anti-Scl70; and normal serum complement levels (C3, C4, and CH50). Urinalysis results were within normal limits. Skin biopsy histopathology showed hyperkeratosis, edema of the upper epidermis, scattered inflammatory infiltrate, and focal accumulation of mucin in the form of acid mucopolysaccharides. Deep asymptomatic nodules on the inner upper limbs appeared later. Histopathology of these lesions showed focal areas of lobular panniculitis in the subcutaneous tissue, with lymphoplasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate without vasculitis (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Case 2. A 29-year-old white housewife presented with an erythematous violaceous rash on her face, neck, chest, and lower extremities. Clinical examination showed red to violaceous well-demarcated aching plaques on the internal surface of the thighs and tips of the fingers; periungual erythema and digital petechiae; Raynaud's phenomenon; and bilateral ulnar and cervical enlarged lymph nodes. Laboratory examination showed elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aldolase; negative venereal disease research test results; an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:1024 with speckled pattern; negative anti-DNA and anti-Scl70; and normal serum complement levels (C3, C4, and CH50). Urinalysis results were within normal limits. Histopathology of the deep asymptomatic nodule on the inner left thigh showed lobular panniculitis with a scattered inflammatory infiltrate and diffuse fat necrosis, in addition to calcium deposition between the lipocytes and microcysts without vasculitis (Figure 3).","1239":"A 7-month-old healthy white boy presented for evaluation of a papule on his right ear. His mother reported a small cut-like lesion at this site shortly after birth that had gradually grown over time. The patient was born full term via repeat cesarean section. On physical examination, located on the right superior helix, there was a 5-6 mm, pink, firm papule with a rough scaly surface and peripheral erythema (Figure 1). The lesion was shave excised and sent for histologic analysis. Microscopic examination revealed a defect of the epidermis with underlying fibrin deposits (Figure 2). Subjacent to the ulcer, there was chondroid tissue, granulation tissue with prominent vascularity, and an extensive amount of amorphous calcified material throughout the dermis extending to the base of the specimen (Figure 3). The clinical and pathologic findings were consistent with a subepidermal calcified nodule (SCN), an uncommon idiopathic calcinosis. The lesion was surgically removed with good results.","1240":"An 82-year-old man with hypothyroidism presented with an ulcerated nodule on the dorsum of his left hand (Figure 1). The lesion had been present for about 3 months. Similar lesions were present along the lymphatic distribution of the dorsum of his left forearm, proximal to the first lesion, as well as the dorsum of his right forearm. Laboratory findings were normal. Immune complexes, complement 3, and complement 4 were negative. A biopsy from an ulcerated nodule was taken for both histologic examination and culture. Hematoxylin and eosin sections showed a nonspecific chronic granulomatous reaction. No fungi were detected by periodic acid-Schiff stain and methenamine silver stain. Culture of tissue obtained from a skin biopsy of 1 lesion placed directly on Sabouraud agar produced colonies of Sporothrix schenckii (Figure 2). The diagnosis of lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis was confirmed.","1241":"A series of 20 patients aged 4-16 years presented with lamellar ichthyosis at the dermatology unit of King Faisal Hospital at Taif in western Saudi Arabia. Though they had come from different families, they all belonged to the same tribe that was confined to a rural area in the precincts of Taif. The tribe is known for consanguineous marriages. The affected children are from 5 sibships. All the children presented with generalized thick dark scales. The history revealed that they all were born with a thick membrane around them, which was shed soon after. Gradually over months and years there was development of generalized scaling. A prototype is shown in the Figure. The scales had become darker and thicker with the passage of time. There was no pruritus. Teeth and mucous membranes were normal. None of the patients had erythroderma. The associated findings in some of the children were ectropion and alopecia. Contractures including pseudoainhum were also observed in some children. None of the patients' parents was found to be affected with a similar condition. There was no improvement with age. Skin biopsies from several of the patients revealed only hyperkeratosis. All had to be managed with topical emollients since they could not afford oral retinoids.","1242":"","1243":"","1244":"","1245":"","1246":"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, previously known as nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, is a novel fibrosing disorder characterized by prominent cutaneous and systemic fibrosis in patients with renal failure. Although initially descriptions of this disorder was described to be purely cutaneous, numerous subsequent reports have shown remarkable systemic involvement with fibrosis of numerous internal organs, including striated muscles, myocardium, microvasculature, lungs, and others, accompanied by elevation of systemic inflammation markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The cutaneous manifestations are characterized by erythematous to browny skin induration with a peau d'orange appearance, plaques, nodules, and papules. Histopathologically, there is dermal and subdermal thickening with abundant collagen fibers and mucin deposits and a striking increase in the number of spindle-shaped fibroblastic cells. The disorder is clinically distinct from scleromyxedema, systemic sclerosis, and other cutaneous fibrosing syndromes. The cause is unknown, and currently there is no uniformly effective treatment.","1247":"Contribution of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to pregnancy mortality rates is difficult to estimate; however, it appears to be one of the leading causes of death, at least in developing countries. Prenatal HIV testing affords the best opportunity for the prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. Rapid HIV testing substantially increases the proportion of women who obtain HIV results compared with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing, thus maximizing perinatal HIV interventions. Pregnancy appears to have no effect on the course of HIV disease. Infections due to a variety of pathogens influence the clinical course of the HIV infection and may complicate pregnancy and increase maternal mortality. The main risk factors for mother-to-child HIV transmission are high maternal viral load and CD4 cell count &lt;700 cells\/mm3. The main protective factor is antiretroviral therapy.","1248":"Despite onychomycosis being an established entity, only a few studies are available from the Indian subcontinent. The authors investigated the comprehensive pattern of the condition. To investigate the epidemiologic, clinical, and mycologic factors associated with onychomycosis in 50 patients using a prospective study design. Fifty patients with potassium hydroxide-positive tests were evaluated according to a predetermined protocal recording details of epidemiologic, clinical, and mycologic characteristics. The collected data were analyzed to determine the correlation of various parameters. Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, total dystrophic onychomycosis, and superficial white onychomycosis variants of onychomycosis were identified, mostly in men 21-30 years of age (mean age, 34.5 years). Epidemiologic characteristics were instrumental to either initiate, perpetuate, or disseminate the disease process. Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes were the main causative dermatophytes; yeasts and molds were less common. Recognition of onychomycosis is less difficult providing the clinician is aware of the entity. Should the etiologic diagnosis be made, its eradication is desirable to surmount its implication in the society at large.

The author describes 2 patients who received botulinum toxin type A injections during pregnancy. The first patient was a 34-year-old woman who received 54 units of botulinum toxin type A to treat periorbital lines (crow's feet) unaware that she was 6 weeks pregnant. She had a healthy term baby delivered by cesarean section; Apgar scores were 9\/10. The second patient was a 37-year-old woman who received 65 units of botulinum toxin type A to treat facial dynamic lines (forehead, glabelar, and periorbital), unaware that she was 5 weeks pregnant. She had a healthy term baby delivered by cesarean section; Apgar scores were 9\/10. The 2 patients were injected only once in the first trimester. Both cases did not have any complications or detectable adverse effects on the fetuses.","1251":"A 57-year-old Hispanic man with a personal and family history of bullae and photosensitivity presented with a fungating, ulcerated squamous cell carcinoma on his left hand (Figure 1). Physical examination showed conjunctival injection, ectropion, symblepharon, urethral stricture, loss of teeth, short stature, and nail dystrophy. There was reticulated erythema, atrophy, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, and telangiectasia of sun-exposed skin of the face, neck, and hands consistent with poikiloderma (Figure 2). In addition, there was foreshortening of the left thumb and sclerodermoid changes of his hands (Figure 3). Radiation therapy was applied to shrink the tumor before a local excision was performed. However, a local recurrence followed and axillary lymph nodes became clinically palpable, necessitating amputation and lymph node dissection. Extensive histologic evaluation of the specimen obtained following left arm amputation and lymph node dissection showed moderate-to-poorly differentiated deeply invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Two of 3 axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma. A random biopsy of the trunk showed epidermal atrophy, telangiectasia, a perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and pigment-laden macrophages consistent with poikiloderma. Electron microscopy illustrated extensive reduplication of the basement membrane, with loops, curls, and free extensions of the basal lamina in the superficial dermis; reduced numbers of hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils; and a basement membrane focally devoid of basal cells (Figure 4). On the basis of the clinical features and the characteristic basement zone changes, a diagnosis of Kindler syndrome was made.","1252":"A 15- year-old Caucasian girl presented with a 1-week history of necrotic ulcers on her bilateral lower extremities, associated with fever and malaise. She had had similar ulcerations on and off over the past 3 years. She had a medical history of Graves' disease, diagnosed in 1999, for which she was taking methimazole (MMI). On physical examination, there were multiple necrotic ulcers with elevated, inflamed borders and an overlying eschar on the bilateral distal extremities (Figure 1). There was one hemorrhagic, flaccid bulla on the lateral aspect of the ankle. Her complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio were within normal limits. Histopathology revealed a neutrophilic vasculitis involving small as well as medium-sized blood vessels. The overlying epidermis and upper dermis showed necrosis (Figure 2). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive at 1:160. Perinuclear (p-) antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was positive at 1:320. Cytoplasmic ANCA was negative. The patient did not meet any clinical criteria for a diagnosis of lupus erythematosus. Direct immunofluorescence revealed IgM, complement C3, and fibrin in small- and medium-caliber blood vessels in the dermis, consistent with a leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small- and medium-caliber blood vessels (Figure 3). MMI was stopped and the patient was given prednisone, tapered over 5 days. Her thyroid function remained stable, and she did not develop new necrotic ulcers. One month later, the patient developed urticarial lesions on her lower extremities. Histopathology revealed a lymphocytic vascular reaction. No eosinophils or neutrophils were seen. These newer urticarial lesions resolved. The patient underwent debridement of the thick, necrotic ulcerative eschars. To date, her lesions have resolved (Figure 4). An ANA drawn 5 months after withdrawal of MMI was negative, and p-ANCA was 1:67.","1253":"A 41-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of pruritus and a generalized dermatitis that developed initially on the head and spread to the trunk, legs, and buttocks. The pruritus caused extreme discomfort and was not relieved by antihistamines or topical steroid treatment. The patient denied flushing, syncope, and vomiting. Her medical history included asthma treated with salmeterol\/fluticasone propionate inhaler, and status post silicone breast augmentation. Physical examination revealed a papular dermatitis on the trunk and extremities composed of lesions up to 0.5 cm in diameter, surrounded by excoriation marks (Figure 1). There was no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Darier's sign was negative. Results of complete blood count, peripheral blood film examination, and liver function tests were all with normal limits. A biopsy specimen taken from a lesion and stained with hematoxylin-eosin showed telangiectasias, with an increased number of mast cells around blood vessels (Figure 2). Positive Giemsa (Figure 3) and c-kit stain (Figure 4) indicated an increased number of mast cells. Bone marrow aspiration and total body CT performed to rule out systemic involvement showed no pathology. Protein electrophoresis was normal. Serum tryptase and histamine were within normal limits, and 24-hour urine collection for histamine was normal. Narrow-band UV-B treatment was begun 3 times weekly, reduced to twice weekly after 2 months, and then stopped. The first few treatments resulted in significant relief of the pruritus and regression of lesions. After 3 months without treatment, the patient remained free of pruritus and lesions.","1254":"A 56-year-old man presented with a cutaneous lesion on his right hand (Figure 1). Approximately 6 weeks previously, he had traveled to Costa Rica for missionary work. During his travel he used a diethyltoluamide-containing insect repellant, but spent one night in the jungle without a mosquito net. Four weeks after his return, he noted a 3 x 2.5-cm ulcer with raised edges and surrounding erythema on the dorsum of his right hand. The patient recalled applying insect repellant with his right hand to other exposed areas of his body but was remiss in applying it to the right hand itself. On examination, the patient was noted to have an ulcerated nodule near his right earlobe (Figure 2) and a second 2 x 1-cm ulcer on the volar aspect of his right wrist (Figure 3). There were no mucocutaneous lesions noted. During the next several weeks, numerous nodules developed in a sporotrichoid pattern on the extensor surface of his right arm (Figure 4). Skin biopsy was performed at the time of initial evaluation and revealed cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania panamensis. After discussing the different treatment options, miltefosine was administered orally for 28 days. The patient experienced an excellent response to therapy.","1255":"","1256":"Cosmetic disfigurement of the earlobe, including laxity and sagging skin, comes with aging. Restoring the earlobe volume is a procedure indicated for patients seeking a youthful facial appearance. Hyaluronic acid is a good choice for this procedure. Most fillers on the market today are supplied with a small needle, yet a larger-gauge needle allows the introduction of the product under lower pressure, making it easier and faster to fill tight areas. This article describes a useful approach to enhance the hyaluronic acid injection, resulting in a fast and effective method to restore earlobe volume.","1257":"","1258":"Systemic agents such as methotrexate and cyclosporine are commonly used in the treatment of psoriasis. Long-term continuous use is not recommended due to potential organ toxicity, myelosuppression, and carcinogenicity. Abrupt cessation of systemic agents without tapering can lead to flare-up and rebound of psoriasis. The addition of a biologic agent during transitional therapy from a systemic agent is a good strategic maneuver to prevent a potential rebound complication. Even with a gradual cessation of systemic agents, the psoriasis will eventually relapse if biologic agents are not added to the treatment regimen. No additional toxicities or adverse events are evident during combination therapy with a systemic agent and a biologic agent.","1259":"The aim of this study was to examine the clinical and histopathologic effects of pentoxifylline on psoriasis, compared with placebo. Sixty-one outpatients with active psoriasis were randomly assigned to either of 2 groups: one was given pentoxifylline 400 mg tid PO, and the other, placebo. Fifty-six patients concluded the study. They were evaluated clinically and by laboratory parameters before and after 8 weeks of treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies were taken. Initial sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Further cuts were immunostained for cytokeratins 10, 14, and 16. Clinical and histologic improvement did not show statistically significant differences between the groups. No laboratory abnormalities or serious reactions related to the drug were observed. No statistical difference was seen when the treatment group was compared with the control group. Pentoxifylline is a well tolerated and safe drug, but its efficacy in psoriasis appears to be limited.

On physical examination, a cutaneous nodule was noted on the umbilical region and the patient was referred to the dermatology clinic. The patient was reexamined and an erythematous nodule was observed in the umbilicus measuring 2.5 cm in diameter. The patient denied pain, change in bowel habits, or weight loss. There were no other abdominal masses, no sign of ascites, and no regional lymphadenopathy. A skin biopsy from the nodule showed mucinous adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for carcinoembryonic antigen, and negative for cytokeratin (CK)7 and CK20. These results were consistent with a Sister Mary Joseph's nodule and led to the diagnosis of an occult colon carcinoma. The patient had no risk factors for colorectal carcinoma. The patient underwent surgery in another hospital, and died 3 months after the initial diagnosis of Sister Mary Joseph's nodule. CASE 2: A 73-year-old woman was referred to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a painful, ulcerated, 3-cm lesion in the umbilicus (Figure 1). She was otherwise asymptomatic. A skin biopsy showed neoplastic glandular cells infiltrating among collagen bundles (Figure 2). Stainings for mucin and for CK7 were positive, while staining for CK20 was negative. An abdominopelvic CT scan demonstrated a 3.5-cm space-occupying lesion in the liver. Results of gastroscopy, colonoscopy, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, and mammography were normal. Serum levels of the tumor-associated protein CA125 were elevated to 164 units, while those of CA 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen were within normal range. A gynecologic examination and a transvaginal ultrasound were normal. The patient had no personal or family history of any malignancy or any risk factors for developing a carcinoma. The patient was scheduled for a palliative resection of the umbilical nodule, combined with a laparoscopic inspection in search of the undetected primary tumor. She refused surgery and was lost to follow-up. She died 4 months after the initial diagnosis of umbilical metastasis. CASE 3: A 51-year-old man was aware of a silent mass in his umbilicus for 2 years without seeking medical advice. Following 2 weeks of increasing pain in this area, he was referred to the emergency room for a suspected incarcerated umbilical hernia. Surgery revealed a mass attached to the fascia and peritoneal fat. The mass was removed and diagnosed as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, staining positively for carcinoembryonic antigen, and negatively for CK20, CK7, prostate-specific antigen, and prostatic acid phosphatase. Both gastroscopy and colonoscopy failed to detect the primary tumor. An abdominopelvic CT scan was normal, but a CT scan of the chest disclosed a nodule measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm in the lower lobe of the right lung. On bronchoscopy, it was found to be an invasive adenocarcinoma, consistent with a primary tumor of the lung. The patient was a heavy smoker (45 pack-years). The patient received 4 cycles of combined chemotherapy with carboplatine and gemcitabine, with no improvement. A month later, the patient complained of abdominal pain. Following demonstration of intra-abdominal spread of disease by CT scan, a second line chemotherapy was instituted with paclitaxel. A month later the patient's condition deteriorated and he complained of cough, sweating, and pain along the right leg. A bone scan revealed bone metastases in the right femur and left tibia. Two weeks later he was admitted to the hospital with intestinal obstruction and underwent laparotomy. He had massive intra-abdominal spread of cancer and ascites. Only a palliative colostomy was performed. The patient died 3 weeks later, 9 months after the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung.

He was initially prescribed doxycycline, topical tretinoin, and topical clindamycin solution, with the later addition of a benzoyl peroxide preparation to his regimen. The patient returned 6 months later after having been diagnosed with CF (cystic fibrosis) by sweat testing and genetic testing. His skin condition had not responded adequately to prior therapy, so all acne medications were discontinued. The 84-kg patient was started on 80 mg (0.95 mg\/kg\/d) of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) daily. The patient's dose was decreased to 40 mg\/d 2 weeks later following an episode of blood in his stool and epistaxis. At the 1- and 2-month follow-up visits, the patient reported improvement in his acne and mentioned that his lung secretions seemed reduced. His acne cleared after 4 months of therapy, so the isotretinoin was discontinued. The patient and his mother noted that no respiratory infections had occurred during the course of therapy. The patient's acne relapsed nearly 2 years later, so isotretinoin was restarted at 60 mg\/d. During the next 7 months while on the drug, he experienced no further episodes of epistaxis or bloody stools and his acne had resolved by the end of therapy. The patient and his mother again reported fewer bronchopulmonary secretions and no infections requiring antibiotics during treatment with isotretinoin. This was unusual because he had experienced numerous respiratory infections requiring antibiotics during the prior 2 years. Since discontinuing the drug, the patient has had intermittent pulmonary infections and exacerbations in the symptomatology of his CF.","1266":"An 18-year-old white man with a \"rash\" on his forehead, neck, and upper part of the back for more than 5 years presented to the dermatology clinic complaining of chronic irritation and burning in these locations.

He was treated by his primary care physician for contact dermatitis, and the areas partially responded to mild topical corticosteroids and emollients. Symptomatic worsening of the lesions, including increasing burning pain and a clear discharge, subsequently led to a primary care diagnosis of impetigo, which was treated with oral antibiotics. Again, there was partial improvement while taking the antibiotics but no resolution, and the areas of involvement continued to expand.

The mean cumulative irritancy index of adapalene combinations was significantly lower relative to tretinoin and tazarotene regimens (all P&lt;.01). Test areas exposed to tretinoin or tazarotene were also more likely to be discontinued for severe irritation than those exposed to adapalene. There were no serious adverse events. No significant difference in the irritancy potentials of tazarotene and tretinoin combination regimens was observed. Adapalene gel 0.1% has tolerability superior to both tazarotene cream 0.05% and tretinoin microsphere 0.04% when used in topical combination therapy.

The skin changes were accompanied by fever (100.4 degrees F [38 degrees C]) and malaise. The patient was convinced that the dermatitis was induced by the consumption of \"spoilt\" pork sausage (bad smell, changed taste) approximately 24 hours earlier. Clinical examination revealed a woman with phototype III skin, black eyes, and black hair, in good general health. Widespread, symmetrical, moderately intense erythema and isolated or coalescing targetoid lesions studded with discrete, pinhead-sized, nonfollicular pustules in the center or at the periphery were distributed over her face, trunk, groins, and upper and lower extremities (Figures 1). On the neck and abdomen, lamellar desquamation was observed (Figure 2). Palms, soles, scalp, mucous membranes, hair, and nails were not affected. Nikolsky's sign was negative. The patient complained of very slight skin burning and itching. The pregnancy was proceeding without any complications and her obstetric status was normal. The woman had neither any accompanying diseases, nor previous personal or family history of psoriasis, nor any known allergies. She had taken no systemic medication (not even vitamins). She had three pregnancies; two ended with the delivery of healthy babies and one of them was aborted at her will. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis (13.2 x 109\/L), neutrophilia (8 x 109\/L), anemia (hemoglobin, 108 g\/L), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (68-110 mm\/h). The results from the following investigations were normal: urinalysis, renal and hepatic function, serum albumin, Ca, Na, K, aspartate aminotransferase titer, cryoprotein, hepatitis B surface antigen, and serum markers for syphilis. Bacterial and fungal cultures of pustular content were sterile. A skin biopsy specimen of lesional skin revealed subcorneal pustules containing leukocytes and necrotic keratinocytes and a mixed perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with isolated eosinophils in the dermis (Figure 3). The patient was treated with systemic methylprednisolone in gradually reduced doses, fluocinonide cream 0.05%, and emollients. As a result, her fever disappeared and her erythema faded. Frequent obstetric examination and cardiotocography were normal and showed no evidence of placental insufficiency. At 40 weeks' gestation, the patient spontaneously gave birth without any complications to a healthy boy. She was discharged with complete resolution of the skin lesions, preceded by massive desquamation of the epidermis. The 1-year follow-up of the patient revealed no relapses or new pustular eruptions.","1279":"A 23-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Dermatology 4 days postpartum with multiple disseminated pustules. A week earlier, she had received 500 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg clavulanic acid for pharyngitis. After three doses, she noticed the first pustules appear on the chest and back, and the antibiotic treatment was discontinued. Three days later, during the 37th gestational week, she delivered her second child prematurely, but in generally good condition. After delivery, her skin lesions began to spread, and the patient developed fever up to 39 degrees C (102.2 degrees F). Her medical history was significant for similar pustular lesions at age five, diagnosed as a bacterial skin infection despite negative skin cultures. Antibiotics were introduced with no clinical improvement over several months. Her skin lesions resolved after discontinuation of antibiotics. No personal or family history of psoriasis was present. On admission, generalized pustules and flaccid blisters with pus on an erythematous background were present (Figure 1). The patient complained of burning of the skin lesions and fever (38.2 degrees C [100.8 degrees F]) but was otherwise in good condition. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (15,000\/mL) with granulocytosis (82%) and an extremely high C-reactive protein level (323.4 mg\/L; normal range, 0-7 mg\/L). Bacteriologic culture of the pus was negative. The histopathology revealed a subcorneal blister filled with neutrophils and a few epidermal cells. In the dermis, a scant perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate was noted (Figure 2). Direct immunofluorescence revealed small amounts of IgM at the dermoepidermal junction. Because of the very diffuse distribution of pustules, two doses of hydrocortisone 200 mg IV b.i.d. for 2 days was administered, followed by prednisone 40 mg q.d. with rapid tapering. Rapid improvement of skin lesions was observed and the patient's skin practically cleared within 7 days. Corticosteroids were discontinued after 14 days.","1280":"A 17-year-old girl previously in good health presented with a 2-month history of recurrent, high-grade fever; general fatigue; anorexia; a 10-kg weight loss; and multiple, painful, reddish skin lesions on the lower abdomen. Some lesions were ulcerated, with an oily yellowish brown discharge. A systemic review was unremarkable other than bleeding from the nose. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. On examination, the patient was pale, jaundiced, and febrile (temperature of 39 degrees C). She had enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary and inguinal areas. There was moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Local skin examination revealed multiple erythematous, tender, and firm subcutaneous nodules of variable size (1-2 cm) on the lower abdomen. Some nodules were ulcerated, with oily yellowish brown discharge and overlying ecchymosis (Figures 1 and 2). Mucous membranes were free of lesions. Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (&gt;80 mm\/h), normal renal function tests, abnormal hepatic function tests (alanine aminotransferase 172 U\/L, aspartate aminotransferase 229 U\/L, alkaline phosphatase 725 U\/L, and total bilirubin 100 mmol\/L [normal range 0-18 mmol\/L]), conjugated bilirubin 45 mmol\/L (normal range 0-5 mmol\/L), and high triglycerides 855 mg\/dL (normal range 20-200 mg\/dL). Prolonged prothrombin time, 26 seconds (normal range 13-16 seconds); prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, 61 seconds (normal range 26-38 seconds); positive disseminated intravascular coagulation studies evidenced by low fibrinogen, 74 mg\/dL (normal range 160-350 mg\/dL); and positive fibrinogen degradation products were also noted. Throat, midstream urine, and blood culture results were negative. Serologic tests for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus serologic values revealed evidence of past infection. Tuberculin and Coombs tests were negative. The alpha1-antitrypsin level was normal. Antinuclear and anti-smith antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and cryoglobulins were negative. CT showed enlarged lymph nodes in the axillary and inguinal areas, bilateral small pleural effusion, moderate hepatosplenomegaly, severe fatty infiltration of the liver, and thickening of lower abdominal subcutaneous tissue. A liver biopsy showed steatohepatitis. Bone marrow aspirate and trephine were normal. A deep punch biopsy of a nodule from the right lower abdomen revealed lobular panniculitis with atypical lymphocytes and large macrophages with cytophagocytosis (\"beanbag\" cells) (Figures 3 and 4). Immunohistochemistry showed that these atypical cells were positive for CD3, CD8, granzyme B, and perforin, and negative for CD56. T-cell gene rearrangement studies on skin lesions revealed a monoclonal T-cell receptor (gamma-chain) gene rearrangement, supporting the diagnosis of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. On presentation, the initial treatment included 6 U of fresh frozen plasma, 2 U of packed red blood cells, and 2 g IV fibrinogen for 3 consecutive days. The patient was started on prednisolone 60 mg orally once daily and cyclosporine A 5 mg\/kg\/d orally in two divided doses. The fever and other systemic symptoms and skin lesions resolved within 2 weeks after the treatment. The prednisolone dose was tapered gradually, and a maintenance dose of cyclosporine A was continued. The patient's condition remained in remission at 12-month follow-up; there was no evidence of clinical relapse.","1281":"","1282":"","1283":"One well accepted and popular method worldwide for trichloroacetic acid peels is the Obagi Blue Peel technique (Obagi Medical Products, Long Beach, CA). The peel solution is prepared by mixing a fixed volume of 30% trichloroacetic acid with the commercially available Blue Peel base. The authors suggest modifications for performing the peeling faster and less expensively: 1) preparing a larger volume of peel solution from each tube of Blue Peel base; 2) using higher concentrations of peel solution to reduce the number of coats necessary for reaching the desired depth of peel; and 3) storing the solution, as there is no need to adhere to the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the solution immediately before conducting the peel procedure to ensure homogeneity of the solution. The prepared solution can be stored at least 1 year.","1284":"The clinical reaction pattern acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is increasingly recognized today as drug intake details are more meticulously recorded and diagnostic guidelines are formulated. Nevertheless, the diagnosis and etiology remain unclear. This examination of the clinical and histologic features of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, undertaken in a retrospective study of 13 patients in an urban medical center, was aimed at determining the underlying mechanism of the etiology of the disease. Findings include a female predominance and the overwhelming prevalence of acetaminophen as the culprit agent, adding two more components to what is known about acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. The possible mechanisms of the disease are discussed, enlightened by its appearance in two women in the study who were pregnant when the reaction first erupted.","1285":"","1286":"Alopecia areata is a form of hair loss believed to be due to an anti-hair-bulb autoimmune process in which CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes affect the peribulb area. Alopecia universalis is the most severe form of alopecia areata and manifests itself as a complete loss of all body hair. The authors present the case of a 44-year-old psoriasis patient with a 20-year history of alopecia universalis who failed to respond to etanercept in terms of skin psoriasis and alopecia universalis, while reporting improvement in arthropathy. While tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors succeeded in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders, reports of alopecia areata failures and this one of alopecia universalis demonstrate resistance to such treatment. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors seem to not represent an effective treatment modality for alopecia universalis. The understanding gained from this experience should redirect the aims of alopecia areata therapy toward alternate mechanistic interventions.","1287":"Helicobacter pylori, a common cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer, has been associated with several extragastrointestinal diseases. Many studies have shown a positive relation between H. pylori infection and both chronic idiopathic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. The study included 20 patients diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria and 20 with atopic dermatitis. A randomized sample of 20 healthy individuals was selected as a control group. H. pylori infection was assessed using the C-urea breath test, and anti-H. pylori IgG antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the chronic idiopathic urticaria group, the urea breath test titer was positive in 75% of patients, and anti-IgG antibodies were also detected in 75% of patients. In the atopic dermatitis group, titer was positive in 70% and antibodies were detected in 65% of patients, while in the control group, the urea breath test titer was positive in 55% and antibodies were seen in 20% of patients. This difference was statistically highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) in the case of anti-H. pylori antibodies in relation to chronic idiopathic urticaria and significant (p &lt; 0.05) in the case of atopic dermatitis. These results provide some evidence of a relationship between H. pylori infection and both chronic idiopathic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. Treatment of infection demonstrated by reduction in C-urea breath test and anti-H. pylori antibody titers resulted in partial improvement of clinical symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis.

The infant's parents were concerned mainly because of its appearance, and they related that the child was essentially asymptomatic. There was no history of trauma to the area, and the parents denied any complications during delivery. The lesion appeared as a violaceous polypoid papule in the umbilical depression. A biopsy was performed and sent for histologic evaluation. The dermatopathology report revealed the presence of ectopic intestinal mucosa consistent with omphalomesenteric duct remnant. We fully discussed the situation with the parents and referred the child to a pediatric surgeon for complete evaluation and removal of any ectopic tissue.","1293":"A 41-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of purpuric lesions followed by superficial, painful ulcers and development of lesions on the lower legs and on the dorsa of the feet, particularly in the summer. The patient was asymptomatic during the winter months. On physical examination she had irregular, scleroatrophic, white-ivory, coalescent lesions on a livedoid basis, with purpuric and, in some lesions, pigmented borders with numerous telangiectatic capillaries. These lesions were localized on the medial sides of the lower legs and on the dorsa of the feet (Figure 1). Laboratory investigations were normal or negative, including complete blood cell count, platelets, coagulation indexes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum immunoglobulins, antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipids, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, circulating immunocomplexes, complement fractions (C3, C4), cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, and Rose-Waaler reaction. The only laboratory abnormality was an elevated fibrinogen level (472 mg\/dL). Doppler velocimetry excluded a chronic venous insufficiency. Thoracic x-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. A digital photoplethysmograph revealed functional Raynaud's phenomenon. A biopsy specimen taken from a purpuric lesion showed an atrophic epidermis with parakeratosis and focal spongiosis. An increased number of small-sized vessels were observed within a sclerotic dermis. Most of the vessels in the upper dermis were dilated and showed endothelial swelling; some were occluded due to amorphous hyaline microthrombi (Figure 2). There were fibrinoid deposits around the vessels with thickening of the vessel walls. Extravasated erythrocytes were found throughout the upper and mid-dermis. There was a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate but no vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescence showed a perivascular microgranular deposit of IgM (+), C3 (++), and fibrinogen\/fibrin (+++). On the basis of clinical, serologic, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings, a diagnosis of idiopathic atrophie blanche was made. The patient was treated with dapsone (50 mg p.o. q.d.) and pentoxifylline (400 mg p.o. t.i.d.) with pain relief and complete resolution of the ulcerations after 6 weeks of therapy.","1294":"An 80-year-old man presented with a localized tumor of the right occipital scalp. The tumor was a 1-cm, bright red-purple, ulcerated, and crusted exophytic nodule on a smooth base (Figure 1). The lesion had grown asymptomatically over 18 months except for profuse bleeding induced by minimal trauma. It was extirpated with the clinical diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma vs. renal metastasis to the scalp. The patient's medical history included a transurethral prostatic resection 3 years earlier and, 1 year later, a right nephrectomy for a 2-kg kidney tumor verbally reported as \"benign.\" The patient also had a 2-year history of untreated high blood pressure. Histopathologically, the excised tissue was an exo-endophytic nodule of a solid form composed of pleomorphic neoplastic cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, surrounded by fibrous collagen septae, blood vessel proliferation, and areas of hemorrhage (Figures 2 and 3). The histopathologic diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma was supported by immunohistochemistry with positive epithelial membrane antigen staining (Figure 4). Cytokeratins 7 and 20 were nonreactive. Laboratory studies revealed hematuria and elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, but no malignant cells were observed in five urinary cytologies. Renal ultrasound showed the presence of two simple cysts in the left kidney and data compatible with chronic inflammatory disease.","1295":"","1296":"","1297":"A 48-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital with low-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, nonproductive cough with dyspnea, bilateral knee pain, and swelling that progressed slowly over 6 weeks. She was a 30-pack-year smoker, and had received outpatient antibiotic therapy with clarithromycin and then cephalexin without improvement. The admission chest radiograph showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and an effusion was seen on knee radiographs. She was treated with levofloxacin, cefepime, and methylprednisolone with some improvement, but fevers persisted up to 104 degrees F\/40 degrees C. She also developed multiple painful skin nodules (Figure 1) and an enlarging painful tongue ulcer (Figure 2). Her bilateral knee swelling and pain also worsened, and a bone scan showed increased activity. Skin biopsy showed acute and chronic inflammation with an abscess that contained \"yeast\" (Figure 3). Fungal culture from the skin lesion and joint fluid aspirate grew Blastomyces dermatitidis. Urine antigen and blood antigen enzyme-linked immunoassays for B. dermatitidis were positive.

They are divided into toxic and immunologic food reactions. The awareness of toxic food reactions among adverse reactions to food is essential for correct diagnosis. Enzymatic food intolerance, adverse reactions to food or food additives, pharmacologic food intolerance, psychosomatic factors, food allergy with classic symptoms (anaphylaxis, urticaria-angioedema), atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis (protein), upper and lower respiratory symptoms like rhinitis or asthma, and gastrointestinal disorders (oral allergy syndrome, colic, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) are discussed. Target organs throughout the body-ear, eye, pharynx, skin, lung, joints, and muscles-can be involved. The gold standard in diagnosis is a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge test. The diagnostic tools available for most food-related disorders are the skin-prick test and radioallergosorbent test. The treatment of food-induced urticaria consists of elimination of the offending food or substance from the diet, use of antihistamines, and immunotherapy.","1302":"The therapeutic efficacy of the tretinoin products Tretin-X (Triax Pharmaceuticals, Cranford, NJ) and Retin-A (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) in the treatment of acne vulgaris was compared in four bioequivalence studies. Four double-blind, three-treatment, parallel-group studies randomly assigned 1642 adolescents and adults, 12-40 years of age, with mild-to-severe acne vulgaris to receive topical tretinoin therapy with Tretin-X, Retin-A, or placebo (drug vehicle) as 0.1% cream (study 1), 0.025% cream (study 2), 0.025% gel (study 3), and 0.01% gel (study 4) once daily for 84 days. The primary efficacy measures were overall acne severity and the number of inflammatory lesions. The secondary efficacy measure was the total number of lesions. In each trial, Tretin-X and Retin-A were clinically equivalent according to all primary and secondary end points at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, a finding also demonstrated by the averaged scores from Weeks 2 through 12. Moreover, each active treatment was significantly more efficacious than placebo at the conclusion of the study (p&lt;or=0.05). Both of the Tretin-X and Retin-A formulations compared in each study were well tolerated. The severity of erythema and peeling did not differ significantly among the three groups studied. The four bioequivalence studies demonstrated that Tretin-X and Retin-A tretinoin products behaved similarly in patients with mild-to-severe acne vulgaris and were thus clinically bioequivalent. Both treatments were well tolerated, and their associated adverse events were similar to those with placebo. ","1303":"There is accumulating evidence on the role of pesticides in the etiology of pemphigus vulgaris (PV). To determine whether chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, is involved in the immunopathology of PV. Normal human skin biopsy specimens incubated with progressively diluted chlorpyrifos solutions were used as indirect immunofluorescence substrates for sera from two PV patients previously exposed to the agent and from healthy controls. Involvement of T-cell lymphocytes was assessed by release of interferon-g in the presence of chlorpyrifos. In one PV patient, immunofluorescence was strongly positive for the specimen incubated with the pesticide and weakly positive for the specimen incubated with medium alone. Immunofluorescence was negative in the patient under immunosuppression with prednisolone and in all controls. Both patients tested positive on interferon-g assay; controls tested negative. Findings suggest an immunopathogenic role of chlorpyrifos in PV. Interferon-g cytokine assay with the pesticide combined with immunofluorescence tests may provide an in vitro diagnostic tool in suspected pesticide-induced\/exacerbated pemphigus.

His chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin HCL, bleomycin, dacarbazine, and vinblastine, with prophylactic administration of a granulocyte colony stimulating factor. He had developed postchemotherapy complications of possible cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis that required wound debridement. The wound and tissue cultures were negative. Biopsies taken at the time revealed a dense inflammatory infiltrate consistent with an abscess. Over the course of 2 months, the wound healed with systemic antibiotics. The patient was reluctant to resume chemotherapy for his Hodgkin's disease because of his previous presumed skin infections. However, positive emission tomographic scanning revealed disease progression. Doxorubicin, bleomycin, dacarbazine, and prophylactic pegfilgrastim (a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), were administered. Vinblastine was excluded from the new regimen. Shortly after chemotherapy and an injection of pegfilgrastim, the patient developed poorly defined, rapidly progressive erythema, edema, and pain in his right forearm. He presented to the emergency room, was evaluated by the orthopedics service, and taken to the operating room for debridement of suspected necrotizing fasciitis. When the dermatology service consulted the following day, the patient had developed an erythematous, edematous, tender plaque on his chest. After developing two additional lesions that began to ulcerate despite treatment with imipenem, vancomycin, clindamycin, rifampin, and gentamicin, the patient consented to a skin biopsy. His wound cultures continued to be negative.","1308":"A 40-year-old Chinese-American woman with breast carcinoma metastatic to her lungs presented with a 3-month history of erosions on her inner thighs (Figure 1) and medial left shoulder. Faint livedo reticularis was evident on her legs as well. She had difficulty in walking and raising her shoulders. Her cutaneous examination was also notable for cuticular erythema (Figure 2) and mild periorbital erythema and edema. She had no systemic or rheumatologic complaints other than some difficulty in swallowing. Her blood chemistry values were notable for a creatinine kinase of 564 IU\/L (5-200 IU\/L), alanine aminotransferase 161 U\/L (0-40 U\/L) and aspartate aminotransferase 93 U\/L (0-40 U\/L), and an antinuclear antibody titer of 1:2560. Other blood chemistries and antibody serologies (anti-Jo-1, anti-Mi-2 and other anti-tRNA synthetase, anti-Ro\/SSA, anti-U1RNP, anti-PM\/Scl, and anti-Ku) were within normal limits. A biopsy specimen was obtained from an area of intact skin close to a right thigh ulceration that showed subtle vacuolar alteration at the dermo-epidermal junction with occasional necrotic keratinocyte (Figure 3). Melanophages and telangiectases were present. Within the subcutis there was fibrin deposition and neutrophils. A diagnosis of dermatomyositis was made. The patient received oral prednisone 20 mg three times a day, and her ulcerations resolved. Her creatinine kinase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase values returned to normal over the course of 3 weeks, but her antinuclear antibody was unchanged. Radiographic studies concurrently noted that her breast cancer had recurred in her lungs; plans were made to treat her with chemotherapy. The patient was lost to close follow-up, but it was learned that her erosions had reoccurred while her prednisone was tapered and resolved when her dosage of prednisone was increased.","1309":"A 43-year-old white man presented with an 8-month history of redness and swelling on the back of the neck.

Review of systems was negative for polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and bone pain. His medical history included depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and microdiscectomy. His medications included sertraline and omeprazole. Physical examination revealed a 20-cm erythematous, indurated plaque on the posterior part of the upper back and neck (Figure 1). A lack of skin wrinkling was noted with lateral pressure. Biopsy revealed a periadnexal and mild interface dermatitis with an increase in connective tissue mucin as demonstrated with colloidal iron (Figures 2A and 2B). Serum protein electrophoresis, hemoglobin A1C, and antinuclear antibody titer were within normal limits. A diagnosis of tumid lupus erythematosus mimicking scleredema was made. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started at a dose of 200 mg and, at 2 months' follow-up, the patient's symptoms and appearance were improved.","1310":"A 59-year-old man with a 35-year personal and positive family history of psoriasis was admitted to our department for treatment of psoriatic erythroderma. The patient had commenced therapy with enalapril 10 mg b.i.d. for the treatment of hypertension approximately 6 weeks before hospitalization. Five weeks after the initiation of enalapril, his psoriasis began to flare, and for a period of about 1 week it reached the extent of erythroderma. The patient did not associate the psoriatic flare with other factors such as infections, trauma, or stress. The patient presented with diffuse erythema and pronounced desquamation covering his entire trunk, scalp, and extremities (Figure). Nearly 100% of the body surface area was involved. The palms and soles were also affected, displaying erythema, hyperkeratosis, and painful fissures. The nails showed pits, oil spots, and subungual hyperkeratosis. The patient also had psoriatic arthritis affecting the interphalangeal joints of his fingers. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated creatinine level of 180 mmol\/L, a blood urea nitrogen level of 10.8 mmol\/L, and a uric acid level of 716 mmol\/L. Urinalysis showed proteinuria of 1.5 g\/24 h. The patient's renal condition was diagnosed as chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, most probably related to his dermatologic disease. Allopurinol and dietary measures were recommended. Following treatment with methotrexate and replacement of enalapril therapy, the erythema and scaling gradually subsided and became confined to his pre-eruptive chronic plaques (approximately 5% of body surface area). Rechallenge with enalapril was not performed.","1311":"The patterns of sexually transmitted infections vary tremendously in different parts of the world. Generalizations need to be taken with care.

Research on the role of streptococcal antigen in psoriasis has been hampered by a potential molecular mimicry between streptococcal epitopes and human epidermal keratin. Evidence of microbial product was sought in skin biopsies of psoriasis patients thought clinically to have either streptococcal carrier state or gastrointestinal candidal colonization. A polyclonal antibody to streptococcal-derived exoenzymes unlikely to share antigenic structures with normal human skin, and an anticandidal antibody, were used with linked streptavidin biotin amplification stain. The predicted microbial product appeared heavily in lesional epidermis, but unexpectedly also as a thin deposit along the skin basement membrane zone (SBMZ) of apparently unaffected skin. Staining was negative for nonpsoriatic subjects. The findings support a direct effect of microbial antigen in psoriasis. They also suggest an important role for SBMZ as a very large adhesive surface in the first step of a process of percutaneous epidermal elimination of foreign antigens and microbial toxins. The many autoimmune phenomena seen so often at the SBMZ are probably a physiologic part of this important immune function. Efforts to enhance the adhesive properties of SBMZ should be exploitable for both diagnostic and therapeutic benefit.

The annual incidence rate of pemphigus vulgaris was 5\/100,000, with a 1.6:1 ratio of incidence in women compared with men. The mean age of onset was 41.1+\/-13.7 years. In 74% of patients, the initial presentation of the disease was mucosal involvement, and in the remaining 26% the disease initially presented on the skin. Iranian patients have a relatively young age of onset of pemphigus and a higher incidence among women than men, which may reflect geographic, cultural, dietetic, or racial differences in the clinical and biologic behavior of the disease.

Born after a 39-week, 2-day normal twin gestation to a 37-year-old healthy multiparous mother, the prepartum history for \"Baby B\" was significant only for amniocentesis at 17 weeks' gestation, where three needle insertions were required for obtaining amniotic fluid from \"Baby B.\" During amniocentesis, performed under ultrasound guidance by an experienced obstetrician, the amniocentesis needle was misplaced in the fetal abdomen in one of the failed attempts. No evident adverse sequelae were noted and the pregnancy proceeded without complication. As the baby gained weight, by 6 weeks of life two indentations appeared on the skin, becoming more pronounced as the baby became chubbier. Aside from this finding, the baby was otherwise healthy. Close examination revealed nontender skin-colored focal puckering on the right anterior lower abdomen and the right flank. No induration, fluid exudation, or fistulous opening was evident. At 13 months of age, the lesions remained stable and asymptomatic.","1339":"Case 1: A 33-year-old man with a 14-year history of localized skin disease on the face and scalp was evaluated at the department of dermatology. The physical examination revealed plaques with papules, pustules, and a golden yellow crusting on the forehead, cheeks, upper lip, and chin (Figure 1). The scalp presented fine, whitish scales. At the beginning of his disease, the patient presented large red and painful purulent boils. The 14-year clinical course of these lesions was characterized by partial remissions and recurrences, but he did not specify any treatment related to improvement. The clinical diagnosis given for the scalp lesions was seborrheic dermatitis. For the facial lesions, many differential diagnoses were considered, among them: seborrheic dermatitis, acneiform dermatitis, impetigo, folliculitis, seborrheic pemphigus, and demodicidosis. The histopathologic study of a biopsy taken from the cheek (Figure 2) showed superficial spongiform dermatitis with neutrophils and folliculitis that are compatible with the diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis. Both Gram and periodic acid-Schiff stains were negative. Follow-up of the patient was not possible since he did not come back. The disease in this patient initially manifested at age five by the presence of recurrent ganglionic abscesses. At age 15, he presented a pulmonary abscess of a left lobule that was surgically removed; at this point the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease was established. At age 28, an exploratory laparotomy was performed due to peritonitis and multiple hepatic abscesses. At that time, he was treated with antibiotics (mainly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and interferon-g. The patient had two brothers who died due to complications of chronic granulomatous disease. In addition, both his mother and sister presented a history of discoid lupus-like lesions. Case 2: Coincidentally, his 27-year-old sister was seen in our department of dermatology 5 years before, presenting infiltrated and erythematous plaques with fine scales (Figure 3) on the right side of the nose and the left annular finger. No other cutaneous or mucous lesions were seen. She referred onset in childhood with similar lesions on sun-exposed areas that disappeared without scarring. A biopsy was performed and the results were compatible with the diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus (Figure 4). Direct immunofluorescence was not available. At that time, she did not mention the family history of chronic granulomatous disease. Clinical follow-up was not possible, but his brother referred that she afforded complete remission only with sun protection.","1340":"","1341":"","1342":"","1343":"","1344":"","1345":"Dermatophytosis is an infection of the hair, skin, or nails caused by a dermatophyte, which is most commonly of the Trichophyton genus and less commonly of the Microsporum or Epidermophyton genera.

During the subsequent 4 weeks, the lesion continued to grow rapidly, and she was referred for excision of the lesion using the Mohs microscopically controlled technique. A tender 10x12 mm (120 mm2) erythematous nodule with a keratin-filled central umbilication was present on her left nasal ala (Figure 1). Treatment options were discussed. The left nasal ala was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine and the keratoacanthoma was circumferentially infiltrated with 10 mg of methotrexate (0.8 mL of 12.5 mg\/mL methotrexate) using a 30-gauge needle. The total amount of methotrexate injected was divided among several injection sites: the peripheral shoulder of the lesion (such that there was blanching of the entire rim) and under the center of the lesion at a depth clinically judged to be the deepest area of involvement. Within the next 7 days, the tumor began to decrease in size and ulcerate centrally. Examination 2 weeks after the initial injection showed a 71% reduction in the area of the tumor, which now measured 35 mm2 (7.0x5.0 mm). The tumor was injected in a similar manner as before with 5 mg of methotrexate. After another 2 weeks, the tumor had continued to shrink. It was flat without nodularity and measured 12 mm2 (4.0x3.0 mm); the tumor area was 66% less than 2 weeks earlier and 90% less than its original size. The residual tumor was again injected with 4.5 mg of methotrexate. There was complete clinical involution of the tumor when the patient returned for evaluation 6 weeks after her initial injection of methotrexate (Figure 2). A biopsy of the lesional area to confirm histologic resolution of the keratoacanthoma was not performed since there was no visible residual tumor.

She had never experienced similar episodes in the past. She denied shortness of breath, tightening of the throat, swelling of the tongue, generalized cutaneous eruption, urticaria, or pruritus. She also denied symptoms consistent with facial paresis. Her past medical history was significant for hepatitis C infection, coronary artery disease, and hypertriglyceridemia. She had a 15 pack-year smoking history and denied both alcohol and drug abuse. She had never received a blood transfusion and was HIV negative. Physical examination disclosed a tender, swollen, and erythematous lower lip with induration, oozing, and crusting (Figure 1). Pinpoint openings evident throughout the lip surface exuded a clear, sticky, mucoid secretion. Tongue, parotid glands, and regional lymph nodes were normal. The working diagnosis was angioedema secondary to lisinopril. The presumptive offending drug was discontinued, and conservative therapy (topical clobetasol ointment, oral ranitidine, and oral fexofenadine) was initiated. Despite treatment, signs and symptoms persisted unabated. One week after initial presentation, a punch biopsy of her lower lip was taken to rule out granulomatous cheilitis and sarcoidosis. Histopathology included diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, minimal microabscess formation, and notable absence of granulomata. There was neither hypertrophy nor detectable abnormality of the salivary glands, with the exception of infiltrating mononuclear cells. Based on the clinical history and compatible pathologic findings, a diagnosis of cheilitis glandularis was made. Specifically, crusting and erosion clinically suggested a diagnosis of the superficial suppurative subtype of cheilitis glandularis. The patient received oral penicillin (dicloxacillin, 1.0 g\/d) combined with oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 1.0 g\/d). Within 2 weeks of starting the antibiotics, the lip swelling significantly decreased (Figure 2) and the patient was left with a mildly indurated nodule at the labial commissure.

Most of the reactions were foreign-body granulomas. The type of granuloma and the characteristics of the agent were determined, contributing to the histologic identification of the material used. In the cases involving Restylane and Aquamid, it was possible to identify the material using Alcian blue stain and by the presence of necrosis.

A retrospective analysis of files of 103 patients who have been clinically diagnosed to have allergic contact dermatitis and have been patch tested using a standard technique with a Northern American Contact Dermatitis Group series. Sixty-two patients (60.2%) showed positive reactions to one or more substance. The most common allergens were nickel sulfate, fragrance mix, and neomycin sulfate. There was an increased frequency of positive reactions to fragrance mix and a significant decrease of frequency of thimerosal positive reactions. Increased awareness of allergens and their potential sources may help to limit the usage of these chemicals in manufacturing consumer products.

It had started with a pinhead-sized blister at the margin of the upper eyelid and was progressive in nature. Intense redness of the right eye, lacrimation, and severe pain confined to the right forehead were the major complaints. She had been under medical care ever since, without any tangible outcome. Its refractory nature impelled the ophthalmologist to seek dermatologic consultation, for apparently the diagnosis seemed to have eluded the consultant. Accordingly, she reported on March 2, 2004 for the opinion of severe incessant itching, profuse lacrimation, and pain that was confined only to the right eye and forehead. The very fact that she had reported with continuous rubbing of the right eye re-enforced the suspicion of the episode being an exclusive expression of pemphigus vulgaris of the eye that probably was the reason for ineffectiveness of the drugs given thus far to her. Examination of the right eye was marked by intense inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, apparent in the form of severe redness (Figure 1). The conjunctiva was studded with several scattered minute erosions. Corneal opacity and cataract were its accompaniment, whereas the left eye was normal. Mucous membrane of the oral cavity was thoroughly scanned for blister and\/or erosions but was normal. The rest of the skin surface was also unaffected. Nikolsky's sign was elicited by asking the patient to rub the eye. In fact, this was responsible for periodic recurrence of the episode. Tzanck test was performed by preparing, fixing, and Giemsa staining the smear from one of the erosions over the conjunctiva. The stained slides were examined under oil-immersion, which revealed plentiful acantholytic cells characterized by large nucleus containing nucleoli and occupying almost the entire eosinophilic cytoplasm and basophilic cell wall. The two biopsies from the conjunctiva were also taken with the help of a 3-mm punch. One of the biopsies was subjected to serial sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain and examined by light microscopy. The presence of split\/cleavage in the epidermis (intraepidermal) above the basal (suprabasal) was cardinal. The cleavage was filled with acantholytic cells of characteristic morphology (vide supra) (Figure 2). The other biopsy was subjected to direct immunofluorescence and was found complementary to the preceding microscopic pathology. Routine investigations comprising total and differential leukocyte count, liver and kidney function tests, chest skiagram, and electrocardiogram were normal. The preceding findings were fairly conducive to form the diagnosis of erosive conjunctivitis emanating from pemphigus vulgaris. Accordingly, pulse therapy (intermittent high-dose) containing 100 mg dexamethasone in 5% glucose daily by slow IV infusion on 3 consecutive days, along with 500 mg of cyclophosphamide on Day 1 only followed by continuous low-dose 50 mg cyclophosphamide, was administered.

The patient was previously treated with oral corticosteroids (25 mg\/d) in a gynecological department with temporary response. On our examination, she presented linear excoriations with hemorrhagic crusts localized on the trunk, buttocks, and upper and lower limbs. Biopsy specimen from the lesional area of the right buttock submitted for routine histology documented a mild perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes and monocytes with rare eosinophils on superficial dermis. Indirect and direct immunofluorescence (performed on perilesional skin) were negative.

The surgeon appropriately diagnosed the ala nasi nodule as a squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma type, but requested an opinion from dermatology for the proximal nasal bridge indentation that he suspected to be a morpheaform or erosive basal cell carcinoma possibly requiring Mohs micrographic surgery. Upon further questioning, the patient revealed that he has had persistent erythema and problems with facial flushing for many years, particularly with alcohol, coffee, and moderate exercise. He infrequently develops papulopustular lesions. Closer clinical inspection revealed a mild erythema, telangiectases, and a hypertrophied nose.

The lesions are usually located on the central and lateral side of the face. The condition is most often seen in young adults of both sexes, and diascopy may reveal apple-jelly nodules. Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei has clearly been defined into four histopathologic groups: epithelioid cell granuloma with central necrosis; epithelioid cell granuloma without central necrosis (sarcoid\/foreign body reaction); epithelioid cell granuloma with abscesses; and nongranulomatous, nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate. While in early lesions granuloma is absent and lymphocytes and a few neutrophils surround the follicles, fully developed lesions show well formed granuloma surrounding ruptured hair follicles, often with large numbers of neutrophils. Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei must be differentiated from other conditions; to facilitate this, in Part I of this paper the histopathologic undertones were delineated into early, intermediate (first stage, second stage, and third stage), and late stages.

Despite being well informed regarding sun protection and the skin cancer risks related to sun exposure, teenagers usually make little use of sunscreens and remain out in the sun for long periods. Besides the social appeal and the impression that a nice tan provides a healthy appearance, the tendency to deny long-term risks seems to influence sun exposure behaviors in this life period. Due to the strong relation between skin cancer and sun exposure in childhood and adolescence, it is important to encourage the adoption of photoprotection measures early in life. Adolescents have difficulty accepting guidance through official educational messages, and very few of them follow family recommendations. Celebrities, fashion, and the entertainment industry exert a greater influence on their choices. Thus, it is fundamental to incorporate photoprotection counseling into the medical routine, in an adolescent-driven way. This article reviews peculiarities of sun protection in adolescence and discusses the type of advice to be given to patients in this age group.","1382":"Lyell's syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis, is a rare, potentially life-threatening mucocutaneous disease, usually provoked by the administration of a drug and characterized by acute necrosis of the epidermis. The drugs most frequently incriminated are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chemotherapics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants. An immunologic response to immunocomplexes formed by metabolites of the causal drug and the common tissue antigens is thought to be responsible for this disorder. Preceded by fever, general malaise, and other flu-like symptoms, bullous and erosive lesions involve oral, ocular, and genital mucosae; and vast areas of the skin with extensive dermoepidermal detachments. The loss of fluid and electrolytes and supervening infections lead to a severe general condition, often with fatal outcome. Treatment is based on the administration of fluids, electrolytes, and albumin. The use of systemic corticosteroids is controversial. Plasmapheresis and hyperbaric oxygen proved to be useful.

It showed little classical steroidal activity but reduced sebum secretion in the rat. In the hamster flank organ, it reduced the stimulant effect of testosterone but not 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone after topical administration, but had little oral activity. Human studies showed that topical administration significantly reduced sebum secretion. Acne symptoms were reduced in many patients who showed enthusiasm for the treatment.

The discomfort and embarrassment of hand dermatitis in any of its forms may compromise a patient's quality of life, causing frustrated attempts to identify the cause of the disease and engendering disappointment with treatment failures. The authors assessed the severity scores for each patient, personal and familial histories of atopy, coexisting conditions, triggers of irritation, types of treatments, and their success rates. The authors administered a comprehensive survey to 50 consecutive patients presenting with eczematous dermatitis on the ventral aspect of the hands. The authors used a novel hand eczema severity index and a questionnaire that assessed personal and familial histories of atopy as well as coexisting conditions, triggers, and sources of irritation; types of treatments employed; and success rates. Patients were also encouraged to complete a composite quality of life assessment. Results reveal a high frequency of personal and familial atopy, a 58% prevalence of contact allergy, a 67.4% history of hay fever, 25.6% cases of asthma, and a 44% incidence of fungal infection, which was one of the most common coexisting conditions.

In fact, although survival rates are no different from that of the general population, localized scleroderma may be associated with development of substantial disability, as occurs in deep morphea and in pediatric patients (disabling pansclerotic morphea of children). We report a case of morphea profunda affecting a young man with severe, rapidly progressive, widespread skin involvement and focus on the eventual systemic evolution of such cases. A 40-year-old man was admitted in 2002 for progressive subcutaneous indurations, preferentially involving the right side of the trunk. His health was altogether good, with the exception of a beginning chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy. There was no family or personal history of dysmetabolic, cardiovascular, neoplastic, or cutaneous disease. Three years earlier, the patient had noted the appearance of two infiltrated, intensely red lesions on the right laterocervical and paraumbilical regions. These had been interpreted as subcutaneous lipomatosis on the basis of an ultrasound scan. The lesions had become progressively larger, while their surface had assumed a scleroatrophic appearance. Thereafter, other lesions had developed on his chest and lower limbs, mostly distributed on the right side of the body. Clinical examination revealed well demarcated, depressed sclerotic plaques with ivory-colored centers and erythematous borders (\"lilac ring\") localized on the neck, chest, and lower abdomen and limbs (Figure 1). They were bound to the deeper structures and arranged in a band-like linear distribution on the right side of the chest and abdomen where they extended horizontally for more than 10 cm in diameter. These lesions were totally asymptomatic. In addition, arborizing telangiectasias were evident on the neck and upper chest (Figure 2). Laboratory investigations provided normal range of erythrocyte sedimentation rat and C reactive protein levels and other inflammation markers. Antinuclear antibody, antidouble-strand DNA, antimitochondrial, anti-extractable antigens (anti-centromere, anti-Scl-70, anti-U1RNP), and anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were negative. Circulating immunocomplexes binding C1q were substantially increased. Oesophageal x-rays and lower limb electromyography were within normal limits; ventilatory function testing revealed a mild obstruction consistent with the beginning of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although nailfold capillaroscopy documented nonspecific findings of connective tissue disease (mega-capillaries, segmentary dilatation and destruction), the laser-Doppler flussimetry revealed few signs of microcirculatory abnormalities, in absence of Raynaud's phenomenon. An abdominal wall ultrasonography, performed on a sclerotic plaque, documented thinning of the subcutaneous tissue, with increase of the fibrous component and lower fascia and muscle retraction. The biopsy specimen from the abdominal region included fascia and the subcutaneous tissue (previously obtained from the lower abdomen) with epidermal atrophy, a thickening and homogenization of collagen bundles in the deep dermis and hair reduction. A perivascular lympho-monocytic and plasmacellular infiltration with a dermo-epidermal distribution was present. Moreover, septal fibrosis with a perivascular lymphoplasmacellular inflammatory infiltrate was documented within the abdominal rectus muscle. The diagnosis of morphea profunda was made on the basis of clinical and histopathological findings. A therapeutic regimen based on amino benzoic potassium (Potaba; Glenwood, LLC, Glenwood, NJ), oral prednisone, and topical clobetasol was started. After several months of follow-up, the patient had obtained only moderate improvement of the clinical findings.","1390":"A 21-year-old white man in otherwise excellent general health was referred for a painful, progressive, facial eruption with associated fever, malaise, and cervicofacial lymphadenopathy. The patient reported that a vesicular eruption progressed from the left side of his face to also involve the right side of his face over the 48 hours preceding his clinic visit. He also reported some lesions in his throat and the back of his mouth causing pain and difficulty swallowing. Four to 7 days before presentation to us, the patient noted exposure to his girlfriend's cold sore. Additionally, he complained of a personal history of cold sores, but had no recent outbreaks. Physical examination revealed a somewhat ill man with numerous vesicles and donut-shaped, 2-4 mm, crusted erosions predominantly on the left side of the bearded facial skin. There were fewer, but similar-appearing lesions, on the right-bearded skin. The lesions appeared folliculocentric (Figure). Cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy was present. Oral exam showed shallow erosions on the tonsillar pillars and soft palate. Genital examination was normal. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable. A Tzanck smear of vesicular lesions was positive for balloon cells and many multinucleated giant cells with nuclear molding. A viral culture was performed which, in several days, came back positive for herpes simplex virus. The complete blood cell count documented a white blood cell count of 8000\/mm3 with 82.6% neutrophils and 9.0% lymphocytes. Based on the clinical presentation and the positive Tzanck smear, the patient was diagnosed with herpes simplex barbae, most likely spread by shaving. The patient was started on acyclovir 200 mg p.o. five times daily for 10 days. Oxycodone 5 mg in addition to acetaminophen 325 mg (Percocet; Endo Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford, PA) was prescribed for pain relief. A 1:1:1 suspension of viscous lidocaine (Xylocaine; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE), diphenhydramine (Benadryl; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY), and attapulgite (Kaopectate; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) was given as a swish and spit to relieve the oral discomfort. Good hygiene, no skin-to-skin contact with others, and no further shaving to prevent autoinoculation were stressed. He was advised to discard his old razor.","1391":"","1392":"A 28-year-old white man presented to the Emergency Department with a 24-hour history of an eruption on his extremities, trunk, and face. The patient was known to be HIV positive with a CD4 count of 527 and a viral load of 20,300. He denied fever, chills, malaise, and headache. His social history was significant for the fact that he was in a monogamous homosexual relationship. He had no recent travel, pet exposures, or sick contacts. Physical examination revealed stable vital signs and no documented fever. A maculopapular eruption was present on his face, trunk, and extremities (Figures 1 and 2). There was no palmar or plantar involvement. He was treated with diphenhydramine and topical 2.5% hydrocortisone and advised to return if his condition did not improve. Twelve days after the initial evaluation, the patient consulted us again due to progression of his dermatitis. He had no additional complaints other than an eruption on both palms but neither sole. (Figure 3). The eruption now demonstrated erythematous pink-red oval macules and papules 1-2 cm in size distributed on his scalp, face, trunk, and arms. A few papules contained fine collarettes of scale. Further questioning revealed that the patient had experienced a tender rectal ulcer 2 months previously. A punch biopsy and rapid plasma reagin were performed. The histopathologic examination revealed interface dermatitis with lymphocytes, plasma cells, occasional neutrophils, and a prominent lymphoplasmacytic perivascular dermatitis with infiltration of the vessel walls. Warthrin-Starry and Steiner methods demonstrated spirochetes at the dermal-epidermal junction and in vessel walls, consistent with Treponema pallidum (Figure 4). Rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent Treponema antibody were both reactive with a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) of 1:16. The patient was diagnosed as having secondary syphilis and treated with 2.4 million units of IM benzathine penicillin for 3 weeks. His eruption resolved after the initial treatment and he did not experience a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.","1393":"A 32-year-old black man presented with two separate eruptions on his penis (Figure). He has had a 10-year history of asymptomatic 1-3 mm shiny papules on the shaft of his penis. He also has had one asymptomatic verrucous brown plaque 1.5 cm in diameter on his penis. A small shave biopsy was performed for each process. The former showed lymphocytes and histocytes in the papillary dermis in a \"ball-in-claw\" relation to the rete ridges of the epidermis. The latter showed an acanthotic epidermis with papillomatosis. Diagnoses of lichen nitidus and condyloma acuminata were respectively made. As the shiny papules did not bother the patient, but he wanted to be rid of the verrucous plaque, only the latter was treated. Liquid nitrogen was applied to the plaque. The patient was also given podofilox 0.5% gel to apply to the condyloma overnight on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, with a 4-day respite. This cycle was to be repeated for 3 more weeks. He was examined several more times and treated with cryotherapy and podofilox gel with the near disappearance of the condyloma over 4 months.","1394":"Many early studies examining the relationship between tobacco and the development of plaque-type psoriasis suggested a significant positive correlation; however, the majority of these initial studies failed to control for alcohol consumption and presented inconsistent results. The objective of this manuscript is to perform a literature review of articles assessing the relationship between smoking and psoriasis while controlling for confounders such as alcohol consumption. Alcohol-controlled studies suggest that women who are smokers have an up to 3.3-fold increased risk of developing plaque-type psoriasis. Men who are smokers do not exhibit such an increased risk, but studies have shown that smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day by men who are psoriasis patients may be associated with a more severe expression of disease in their extremities. In addition, smoking among both men and women who are psoriasis patients has been shown to reduce improvement rates. These data demonstrate the importance of discouraging smoking, particularly among psoriasis patients.","1395":"Not all scars are the same. They vary from normal skin scars to distinct types of abnormal scars, such as hypertrophic and disfiguring keloids. Physicians need to identify different types of skin scars and treat them appropriately. Misdiagnosis and mismanagement of scars can be costly for both the patient and physician. Patients with scars often face aesthetic, physical, psychological, and social consequences that result in substantial emotional and financial costs. This article reviews the spectrum of abnormal scar types and problems associated with scarring.","1396":"Dercum's disease (adiposis dolorosa, lipomatosis dolorosa morbus Dercum), is a rare disorder resulting in painful fatty deposits around the upper legs, trunk, and upper arms. The portrait painted of Dercum's disease is very complicated, with many other disorders seen associated with the disease. There are no clear pathological mechanisms known, although it is suspected that there is either a metabolic or autoimmune component involved. Here, the authors review the literature to date, including some information from their own studies. In particular, the authors will look at the different strands of evidence pointing to the pathological mechanism of the disorder.","1397":"Since its clinical discovery, lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei has sporadically been reported to have different modes of clinicopathologic expression. The purpose of this study was to work up a list of histopathologic undertones and to project and propagate lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei as an exclusive entity. An upcoming Part II of this study will present an overview of the disease. All patients visiting the outpatient clinic conforming to hitherto accepted clinical features were included to study patients' age and sex, duration of the disease, and above all, conduct a detailed histopathology review. Using the detailed information obtained, an endeavor was made to organize the disease into early, fully developed, and late lesions. The details of the various parameters were of great help in evolving this modus operandi. The clinical as well as histopathologic features of lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei are fairly distinct and facilitate visualizing the entity as a spectrum comprising early, fully developed, and late lesions. Further studies are called for. ","1398":"Rosacea is a common disease, which is often resistant to treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors have been efficacious in the treatment of other inflammatory disorders of the skin, and tacrolimus has been reported as an effective treatment option for erythrotelangiectatic rosacea. Because of the benefits seen with tacrolimus in previous publications, we investigated the efficacy of a closely related compound, pimecrolimus, in patients with erythrotelangiectatic, papulopustular, and edematous rosacea. Twelve patients with erthryotelangiectatic or papulopustular rosacea who had failed conventional therapy were treated with topical pimecrolimus cream twice daily for 12-18 weeks. No patients had used any other treatment for rosacea within 30 days of the start of therapy. During the course of the study, no other topical or systemic treatment of rosacea was allowed. Ten of 12 patients showed substantial improvement of erythema, while five of six patients with a papulopustular component noted at least an 80% decrease in the number of lesions. It appears pimecrolimus may be efficacious in the treatment of erythrotelangiectatic and papulopustular rosacea and may be considered in patients with recalcitrant disease. ","1399":"Combination therapy with a topical retinoid and an antibiotic is recognized as a rational and effective approach for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Adapalene, a naphthoic acid derivative with anti-inflammatory and receptor-selective retinoid properties, is safe and well tolerated. While the combination of adapalene with oral or topical antibiotics has been shown to deliver a superior and faster response than an antibiotic alone, the clinical benefits of a combination of adapalene and doxycycline, the most frequently prescribed oral antibiotic for acne in the United States, have yet to be evaluated. In a 12-week study, the efficacy and safety of the combination of adapalene gel 0.1% with doxycycline was compared with doxycycline alone for the treatment of severe acne. Subjects were randomized to receive doxycycline once daily in the morning and either adapalene or vehicle once daily in the evening. At Week 12, the combination adapalene-doxycycline was significantly superior to doxycycline alone for change from baseline in total (p&lt;0.001), inflammatory (p=0.02), and noninflammatory (p&lt;0.001) lesions. Significant differences in total lesions were observed as early as Week 4 (p=0.04). Both treatments were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. The study demonstrates that the combination of adapalene and an oral antibiotic provides a superior and faster benefit than antibiotic therapy alone and should be considered at the initiation of treatment.

The face, palms, soles, eyes, and mucous membranes were spared. Both parents were unrelated Saudis. There was no history of any preceding eruption or any associated systemic abnormality, except for recurrent oral ulcers in both patients for several years. The younger one also had one episode of genital ulcers. Dermatological examination of both parents and the patients' three brothers and one sister were normal with no history of oral ulceration. Examination revealed few aphthous ulcers in either cases, but no joint or eye symptoms. Pathergy testing in both cases was negative. Ophthalmological examination and consultation revealed no signs of Behcet's disease. Routine blood tests did not show any abnormalities. Skin biopsies were taken from pigmented and normal skin in both patients. Histopathological examination of pigmented skin in both cases revealed basal cell hyperpigmentation with pigmentary incontinence. Similar features but in milder form were seen in the biopsies of normal skin in both cases.","1403":"","1404":"","1405":"Integrative medicine is becoming more popular, not only in developing nations, but also in countries such as the United States. Acupuncture, which is practiced more than any other kind of alternative medicine, is based on the philosophy and culture of old Chinese healing. Pressure, massage, and touch healing depend on stimulation by the fingers rather than needles, although they are based on acupuncture principles. Touch has social, educational, cultural, and humanitarian aspects. Touch therapy has been shown to have excellent effects on children's growth, development, and emotional well-being. In adults, a 15-minute rubdown by fingertips can lead to relaxation and sleep. It is also useful for premature babies. Such therapies were practiced in the Old World, but have been rediscovered in the New World. They represent some aspects of the old, noble art of healing.","1406":"A 44-year-old woman presented with an 18-month history of a pruritic dermatitis in the axillae bilaterally, beginning in the springtime. There was no history of significant hyperhidrosis. The patient did not recall any change in deodorant, soap, detergent, or other topical products. Her family history was unremarkable for anyone with similar symptoms. Physical examination revealed hyperpigmented plaques on an erythematous base in both axillae. The inframammary and intertriginous folds were free of lesions. Histologic examination taken from the left axilla was notable for mild digitate papillomatosis, compact hyperparakeratosis with large nuclei, and retained keratohyaline granules within the stratum corneum (Figure), consistent with axillary granular parakeratosis. A periodic acid-Schiff stain was negative for hyphae. Patch testing utilizing the thin-layer rapid-use epicutaneous test (T.R.U.E. Test, Mekos Laboratories, Hillerod, Denmark) was unremarkable. The patient was initially treated with fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream without notable improvement. She then received Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin injections to the axillae (50 U\/axilla) with complete resolution of the rash within a few days. At 6-months' follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic.","1407":"A healthy 19-year-old black man without any methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus risk factors developed axillary boils after he began lifting weights at the university gym in Houston, TX. He presented with a large tender erythematous fluctuant abscess of his right axillae and a superiorly located smaller painful red indurated nodule; the surrounding cellulitis extended into the adjacent tissue (Figure). The abscess was incised, drained, and cultured. Empiric treatment with cephalexin 500 mg q.i.d. was given for 7 days. The culture grew methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Susceptibility testing of the S. aureus isolate was performed by Laboratory Corp. of America (Houston, TX); the Vitek system (Biomerieux, Hazelwood, MO) was used, and the specimen was incubated for 8 hours. Confirmation of methicillin resistance was performed using a methicillin-resistant S. aureus plate and the specimen was incubated for 24 hours. In addition to resistance to methicillin, the bacterial isolate was also resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and penicillin. The S. aureus strain had intermediate susceptibility to levofloxacin and was susceptible to clindamycin, gentamicin, rifampin, tetracycline, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. The infection persisted and the antibiotic was changed to double strength trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, taken twice daily for 15 days. In addition, topical care included lesional and intranasal application of mupirocin 2% ointment and daily cleaning of the area with 10% povidone-iodine liquid soap. The skin infection completely resolved without recurrence within 2 weeks.","1408":"","1409":"","1410":"","1411":"","1412":"","1413":"Cutaneous changes may indicate the presence of or herald the incipient development of internal malignancies.

To study the nature of cells present in MR lesions by studying the immunohistochemical profile of three new cases and reviewing 23 cases reported in the literature. MR histiocytic cells are positive for vimentin, CD68, and CD45, negative for S-100 protein, CD34, and XIIIa factor, and weak reactors for thrombomodulin. Small activated histiocytes are MAC387 positive. Lymphocytes, mainly CD4+ cells, are found in MR infiltrates. The MR immunophenotypic pattern does not suggest a type I or type II dendrocyte or a Langerhans cell origin. On the other hand, it points to a different cell derived from the monocyte-macrophage line. CD4+ cells may be responsible for activating the proliferation of histiocytic cells. Small histiocytic MAC387+ cells are likely to become the MR multinucleated giant cells.

Hair and nails are predominantly epithelial structures derived from primitive epidermis and made up of keratinous fibrils embedded in a sulfur-rich matrix. It was first noted early in the 20th century that the nail unit was comparable in several respects to a hair follicle sectioned longitudinally and laid on on its side. The epithelial components of hair follicle and nail apparatus are differentiated epidermal structures that may be involved jointly in several ways as congenital and hereditary anomalies and acquired conditions such as alopecia areata, lichen planus, iatrogenic causes, and fungal infection. Multielemental characterization of human hair and nails shows that even after sample washing, many elements are enriched in the surface of the nails.","1430":"Three patients with follicular mycosis fungoides (FMF), a rare variant of folliculotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, are discussed. Follicular involvement in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma commonly presents clinically with alopecia, follicular cysts, or comedo-like lesions usually associated with follicular mucinosis and strong epidermotropism. In contrast, FMF, in a strict sense, has been defined as a lymphocytic infiltration of hair follicles in the absence of both epidermal invasion and follicular mucin. Case 1 shows a clinically stable form of FMF characterized by circumscribed alopecia and its persistent resistance to topical therapeutic approaches. In contrast, Cases 2 and 3 demonstrate that classic mycosis fungoides lesions and FMF can occur simultaneously and that transitions occur from mycosis fungoides to FMF and vice versa. These observations strengthen the concept that FMF and mycosis fungoides represent just two variants of one entity of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In Case 3, rapid progression into tumor-stage mycosis fungoides and the follicular infiltration was controlled with bexarotene. Because it was previously suggested that FMF may have a worse prognosis compared with classic mycosis fungoides, this impressive response to bexarotene is of great clinical interest and may spark new studies employing this novel retinoid for FMF treatment.

These lesions appeared a year ago. There was no previous history of this condition. On examination, the patient showed confluent infiltrative follicular lesions on the frontoparietal and occipital scalp (Figure 2). Some lesions evolved into erosions that developed in ivory white scleroatrophy within weeks. These lesions were localized both in and outside of are as affected by alopecia androgenetica and were associated with mild pruritus. Histopathologic examination, performed on an early lesion of the vertex, documented a mild thinning of follicular epithelium associated with an intense lymphohistiocytic perifollicular infiltrate. The damage of the basal cell layer was limited to the follicle, while epidermis was intact. In particular, follicular keratinocytes under the isthmus showed a very intense degeneration exactly where the infiltrate was the most prominent. The damage of the hair sheath was under the isthmus and involved the lower portions of the follicles (including the hair bulbs). The inflammatory infiltrate was exclusively represented by perifollicular lymphohistiocytes. Finally, a connective fibrotic shell with numerous fibroblasts formed a sheath around the atrophic follicle (Figure 3). Results of laboratory investigations (including complete blood cell counts, basal thyroid-stimulating hormone, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin levels, B and C hepatitis markers, antinuclear antibodies, and cultural examinations) were negative.We diagnosed the patient with fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution.","1434":"A 6-year-old boy was brought to his primary care provider by his mother, who complained of a pruritic rash near his right eye. The eruption was described as a small, erythematous, slightly scaly plaque at the lateral margin of the right eyelid. The child was in good health and took no medications. The diagnosis of eczema was made; the patient was treated with pimecrolimus cream b.i.d. to the affected area. After 2-3 days of treatment, the itching and erythema completely resolved; however, a rough and scaly plaque persisted. After 1-2 weeks of treatment, the itching gradually returned, and the lesion began to increase in size. Multiple, similar lesions appeared several centimeters from the initially affected area. Pimecrolimus was discontinued; topical nystatin\/triamcinolone ointment was prescribed. The eruption continued to spread, and the patient was referred to dermatology for further evaluation. The patient presented to the dermatology clinic with multiple annular, scaly papules and plaques with central clearing. Excoriations and mild inflammation were noted around all affected areas (Figure). A potassium hydroxide examination of the lesions revealed numerous hyphae. The nystatin\/triamcinolone ointment was discontinued; oral griseofulvin was prescribed. The eruption improved dramatically after 3 weeks and eventually cleared completely after 5 weeks of treatment.

The patient applied a topical multivesicular cream formulation of 6% salicylic add (Salex, Healthpoint Ltd., Fort Worth, TX) to one foot b.i.d. The physician was blinded as to which foot was treated. After 2 weeks of treatment, it was apparent that the patient was applying the cream to the right foot, as evidenced by reduced dryness, scaling, and hyperkeratosis (Figure2). The patient continued treatment of the same foot for an additional 2 weeks, revealing a dramatic improvement of the right heel,which appeared smooth and soft and devoid of pain. No irritation was associated with treatment; the patient commented that this was the best her heel had been \"in years.\" Subsequently, the patient treated both heels with salicylic acid 60%, multivesicular cream. A second patient, a 25-year-old woman, was treated for ichthyosis vulgaris and hyperkeratosis of both heels. She presented w ith multiple painful fissures and hyperkeratosis of the posterior heels bilaterally (Figure 3).

The obvious clinical diagnoses of genital warts on the left and Bowenoid papulosis on the right were confirmed by punch biopsies, which showed epithelial hyperplasia with diffuse cell vacuolization (koilocytes)in the left biopsy and moderate nuclear dysplasia in the right one (Figure 2). Human papillomavirus phenotyping was not performed. Interestingly, the patient reported a clear medical history of herpes progenital is (only one episode) that had involved the right side of his glans and prepuce 4 years ago. An immunomodulating treatment with imiquimod was started in the attempt to cure both the genital warts and Bowenoid papulosis lesions (imiquimod was applied three times a week for 8 weeks).

Most recently, he was admitted to the intensive care unit, where he required intubation and mechanical ventilation support following respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. At that time, an attempt was also made to place an arterial line in the left radial artery. The patient had multiple areas of ecchymosis on both arms. A large bulla was found on the lateral aspect of the left wrist several days after the attempted arterial line placement. Subsequently, the lesion drained serosanguineous fluid, and, during the next 2 days, it ulcerated with necrosis extending around the wrist and to the elbow. He was started on ampicillin\/sulbactam and clindamycin for presumed necrotizing fasciitis. The surgical service performed a very limited debridement,which was partially limited by his coagulopathy from liver disease. The initial tissue culture was positive only for Enterococcus faecium. At the time of the consultation, his temperature was 95' F (35 degrees C), pulse 82 bpm, respirations 16 BPM, and blood pressure 101\/56 mmHg. He was awake but not oriented or responsive. His cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable. Abdominal exam disclosed ascites. His extremities were all grossly edematous with multiple ecchymoses. His left forearm had a circumferential area of ecchymosis and necrosis with macerated margins, sparing only the lateral ulnar epicondyle, and involving deeper structures of subcutaneous fat and muscle(Figures 1-2 showing evolution of the lesion in a period of 1 week). Small tissue clippings were taken from the edge of the lesion and placed on culture plates. By the next morning, the patient's tissue culture grew a mold, later identified as Rhizopus.

Her previous treatments included: multiple topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, pimecrolimus 1% cream, and cyclosporine with no improvement of her symptoms. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she was on no other oral medications, including over-the-counter products. On physical examination, multiple erythematous, scaly patches were present on the chest, abdomen,back, and upper extremities. Lichenification of both antecubital fossa was present. Extensive excoriations on her arms and abdomen were also noted. Although the patient had a long-standing history of presumed atopic dermatitis, she had never undergone a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy was performed which demonstrated a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils and dermal edema (Figures 1, 2). The biopsy was suggestive of possible hypersensitivity dermatitis. The patient then underwent patch testing. The following patch tests were applied to normal back skin using IQ chambers:North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) expanded standard, textile, fragrance trays, and ingredients found in her products (Chemotechnique, Malmo, Sweden). A total of 89 patches were applied, removed at 48 hours, and read both at 48 and 96 hours. At 48 hours, a total of 70 allergens were positive, 69 of those allergens were in a petrolatum vehicle. There were 50, 3+ reactions to sites of allergens in petrolatum (Figure 3). There were only two sites with petrolatum that were negative: budesonide (a corticosteroid) and melamine formaldehyde. In contrast, all of the sites where there were allergens in liquid vehicles were negative, with the exception of a 1+ reaction to cocamidopropyl betaine. At 48 hours,four additional patch tests were applied to plain petrolatum. Two of these patches were in plastic IQ chambers and two in aluminum Finn Chambers. At 48 hours, all four of the sites showed 3+ reactions (Figure 4). By 96 hours, all of the patch test sites that were positive at 48 hours, and much of the surrounding skin, showed a diffuse \"angry back\" reaction, which made an accurate 96-hour reading impossible.","1451":"A 56-year-old Jewish woman of Ashkenazi origin had a history of tuberculosis since the age of 1 year, contracted while she was in hiding in Poland during the Holocaust. She developed bronchiectasis in 1972 for which she was being treated 4 times a year for 1-month periods with 600 mg\/d rifampin. During the Persian Gulf War in February 1991, a month after a rifampin treatment, she was admitted to the dermatology department with cutaneous and oral mucous eruptions. Physical examination revealed crusting bullae and erosions on the trunk and lower limbs. The mucous membranes were affected in the vagina, oral cavity, and pharynx. Histologic and immunofluorescence studies on a biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. There was no family history of the disease. Systemic treatment with prednisone,100 mg\/d, resulted in regression of the eruption within a month, and the dose was tapered to 10 mg every second day. Although she received anti-tuberculosis treatment, the steroids caused an exacerbation of the tuberculosis, and after a massive hemoptysis in 1993, a right upper and middle lobectomy was performed. The operation put an end to the vicious cycle of drug-induced pemphigus outbreaks by eliminating the need for rifampin, but the patient reported the appearance of new lesions during periods of emotional stress.","1452":"In 2002, a 38-year-old woman was referred to the department of dermatological sciences for the evaluation of erythematous-infiltrated lesions with prominent purpuric and erosive components distributed on her face, upper chest, and extensor surfaces of the limbs, which developed over a 3-month period. In 1997 the patient suffered from polyarthralgia (proximal interphalangeal,knee, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal joints) associated with morning stiffness. In 1999 she was admitted to a psychiatric unit for depression with episodes of lipothymia. In the same year, since she developed diffuse and persistent urticarial manifestations with angioedema and livedo reticularis of the limbs in association with anticardiolipin antibodies, vasculitis was proposed. Upon examination, erythematous-infiltrated and erosive lesions in association with serohemorrhagic crusts were present on the face,neck, chest, upper trunk, and extensor surfaces of the upper limbs and thighs (Figures 1-3). Telangiectasias were especially evident on the cheeks, where prominent edema conferred her face a moon-like appearance (Figure 1). Laboratory investigations disclosed microcytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, proteinuria (30 mg\/dL), positive antinuclear antibodies (1:80) with diffuse fluorescence pattern, lowered complement levels (C3: 31 mg\/dL, C4: 3 mg\/dL), circulating immunocomplexes binding Clq, and high titers of anti-TSH receptor antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence was negative for the detection of anti-basement membrane zone antibodies. Histological examination of the lesional skin of the shoulder documented epidermal atrophy, marked vacuolar degeneration of the basal cell layer, colloid bodies, and a perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration of the upper and deep dermis (Figure 4). Direct immunofluorescence performed on affected skin showed junctional granular deposition of IgG, C3,and Clq in association with perivascular C3 and Clq deposits in the upper dermis; direct immunofluorescence on sun-protected,non-lesional skin showed similar immunological deposition both at the basement membrane zone and in the perivascular dermis.Based upon the clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic findings, we proposed the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with maculopapular and erosive skin lesions. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone IV (pulse therapy, 250 mg) tapered over 10 days and later continued p.o. After a few weeks, significant improvement of cutaneous manifestations was noted.","1453":"","1454":null,"1455":"A 35-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of vesiculopustules on erythematous bases on and in proximity to her lips (Figure 1). The patient had noted burning and itching in the area of these vesiculo-pustules before they developed. She had no systematic symptoms and had not noted similar vesiculopustules in this location in the past. A Tzanck smear was done that revealed multinucleated giant cells. A viral culture was performed. The patient was diagnosed with herpes labialis and received valacyclovir 500 mg b.i.d. for 5 days. One week later, the eruption was noted to have resolved, at which time the results of the viral culture showed growth of Herpes Simplex Virus-1. Thereafter, the patient was lost to follow-up.","1456":"While the quest for youth continues, the public has turned away from traditional surgical procedures and toward less invasive ones. Fillers and nonablative resurfacing have become more desirable than face lifting and laser resurfacing.

The verdict is still out.","1457":"","1458":"A 54-year-old man of Persian origin presented to our department with a 1-year history of ulcers on the right leg that had been unresponsive to numerous topical treatments, accompanied by lymphedema of the right leg. Medical history included hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which had not been further investigated. He was treated for 20 years with testosterone IM once monthly, which he stopped a year before the current hospitalization for unclear reasons. The patient reported no congenital lymphedema. Physical examination revealed two deep skin ulcers (Figure 1) on the right leg measuring 10 cm in diameter with raised irregular inflammatory borders and a boggy, necrotic base discharging a purulent hemorrhagic exudate. Bilateral leg pitting edema and right lymphangitis with lymphadenitis were noted. He had low head hair implantment, sparse hair on the body and head, hyperpigmentation on both legs, onychodystrophia of the toenails (mainly the large toe and less prominent on the other toes), which was atrophic lichen-planus-like in appearance and needed no trimming (Figure 2), normal hand nails, oral thrush, and angular cheilitis. Other physical findings were gynecomastia, pectus excavatum, small and firm testicles, long extremities, asymmetrical goiter, systolic murmur 2\/6 in left sternal border, and slow and inappropriate behavior. The patient's temperature on admission was 39 degrees C. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth. Results of laboratory investigations included hemoglobin (11.2 g\/dL), hematocrit (26.8%), normal mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin volume, and red blood cell distribution width (16%). Blood smear showed spherocytes, slight hypochromia, anisocytosis, macrocytosis, and microcytosis. Blood chemistry values were taken for iron (4 micro g\/dL [normal range 40-150 micro g\/dL]), transferrin (193 mg\/dL [normal range 220-400 mg\/dL]), ferritin (1128 ng\/mL [normal range 14-160 ng\/mL]), transferrin saturation (1.5% [normal range 20%-55%]), serum folate (within normal limits), and vitamin B12 (within normal limits). Direct Coombs' test equaled positive 2 + IgG. All these values indicated anemia of chronic diseases combined with hemolytic anemia. Further blood work-up tested antinuclear antibody (positive &lt;1:80 homogeneous pattern), rheumatoid factors (143 IU\/mL [positive &gt;8.5 IU\/mL]), C-reactive protein (286 mg\/L [normal range 0-5 mg\/L]), anticardiolipin IgM antibody (9.0 monophosphoryl lipid U\/mL [normal range 0-7.00 MPL U\/mL]) and antithrombin III activity (135% [normal range 74%-114%]). Results of other blood tests were within normal limits or negative, including lupus anticoagulant, beta2 glycoprotein, anticardiolipin IgG Ab, anti-ss DNA Ab, C3, C4, anti-RO, anti-LA, anti-SC-70, anti-SM Ab, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, TSH, FT4, anti-T microsomal, antithyroglobulin, protein C activity, protein S free, cryoglobulins, serum immunoelectrophoresis, VDRL, hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B antigen, and human immunodeficiency virus. Endocrinological work-up examined luteinizing hormone (22.9 mIU\/mL [normal range for adult men 0.8-6 mIU\/mL]), follicle stimulating hormone (49.7 mIU\/mL [normal range for adult men 1-11 mIU\/mL]), testosterone (0.24 ng\/mL [normal range for adult men 2.5-8.0 ng\/mL]), bioavailable testosterone (0.02 ng\/mL [normal range for adult men &gt;0.6 ng\/mL]), and percent bioavailable test (8.1% [normal value &gt;20%]). These results indicate hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was 6 U (normal value 5-20 U\/mL). Karyotyping performed by G-banding technique revealed a 47 XXY karyotype, which is diagnostic of Klinefelter's syndrome. Doppler ultrasound of the leg ulcers disclosed partial thrombus in the distal right femoral vein. X-rays and bone scan displayed osteomyelitis along the right tibia. Histological examination of a 4-mm punch biopsy from the ulcer border revealed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, hypergranulosis, and mixed inflammatory infiltrate containing eosinophils compatible with chronic ulcer. Multiple vessels were seen, compatible with a healing process. Direct immunofluorescence of the biopsy revealed granular IgM in the dermo-epidermal junction. Indirect immunofluorescence was negative. Thyroid function tests showed normal thyroid stimulating hormone and free throxine4. Multinodular goiter was seen on thyroid scan and ultrasound. Thyroid fine needle aspiration was compatible with multinodular goiter (normal follicular cells, free colloid, macrophages with pigment). IV treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 g t.i.d. was administered for 2 weeks, with a decrease in temperature and normalization of the leukocyte level. Oral antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was continued for 10 more days, followed by 25 days of ciprofloxacin for the osteomyelitis. Local treatment included saline soakings followed by application of Promogran (Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) and Kaltostat (ConvaTec Ltd., a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, New York, NY) with slight improvement. At the same time, the patient was treated with warfarin sodium due to deep vein thrombosis under international normalized ratio 2-3. The patient was treated with IM testosterone once monthly for 1 year, which resulted in a reduction in the diameter and depth of the leg ulcers (Figure 3). Blood tests were not performed for follow-up of the immune state.","1459":"","1460":"In Part I of the review (July\/August 2004), the anatomy of hair follicles, the diagnostic approach to diseases leading to hair loss, and nonscarring alopecias were discussed. In this article (Part II of II), the focus is on scarring alopecias (dissecting folliculitis, folliculitis decalvans, lichen planopilaris, lupus erythematosus) in regard to pathogenesis, clinical findings, and current options of treatment. Most important for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells within the follicular bulge that communicate with the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla. These structures may be destroyed by systemic autoimmune disorders as well as by granulomatous diseases. To prohibit permanent damage of hair follicles, early diagnosis and the correct treatment are necessary.","1461":"Mohs micrographic surgery has been used for the treatment of tumors other than basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Parameters to be considered when deciding on a treatment include location, size, growth pattern, and recurrence rates. It is important to consider that sometimes the high-risk nature of the tumor is more significant than the need for tissue sparing. Modifications to the Mohs micrographic surgery technique may be used to ensure diagnostic accuracy and confirm complete removal of the lesion (e.g., immunohistochemical staining and paraffin-embedded sections).","1462":"Air bags, fitted in the majority of new automobiles, are safety devices activated when a sudden deceleration causes the ignition of a propellant cartridge containing sodium azide. The bag is inflated by nitrogen liberated during the combustion. Deployment releases various high-temperature gases, including nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and produces sodium hydroxide, a highly irritant alkaline substance. In about 7%-8% of cases, air bags cause dermatologic injuries such as traumatic lesions, irritant dermatitis, and chemical and thermal burns. Nondermatologic lesions, such as ocular damage (alkali keratitis, corneal abrasions), ear lesions, bone fractures, and contusive damage can also be caused by air bag deployment.","1463":"","1464":"","1465":"A 52-year-old woman in good health with a family history negative for dermatologic diseases presented to our department with thickening and dystrophy of all her fingernails and toenails that started when she was born. She also had hyperkeratosis on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet that was confined to sites of pressure and recurrent plantar blisters that began appearing at puberty. The patient reported marked pain while walking from such plantar involvement. Her medical history revealed a persistent hoarseness; palmoplantar hyperhidrosis; and the appearance of numerous cysts on her back, neck, and scalp since she was 20 years old. These latter lesions had been diagnosed as multiple steatocystoma on the basis of the histologic features. Upon examination, all of her fingernails and toenails appeared shortened, thickened,and dystrophic (Figures 1-3). In addition, they presented subungual keratosis and a yellowish-gray color. Hyperkeratosis and small ulcerations were present on the perionychium. Palmoplantar keratoderma was evident, especially on the soles,in association with superficial erosions (Figure 4). Keratosis pilaris was evident on the extensor surfaces of the forearms as well as on the anterior surfaces of the legs. Multiple nodules were detected on the patient's neck, trunk, and axillary regions(Figure 5). They consisted of multiplex steatocystoma and were characterized by a hemispheric shape, a normal-appearing skin color, and by an elastic consistency on palpation. Oral and dental changes were not detected, although hair anomalies were evident. Laboratory parameters disclosed eosinophilia and increased total IgE levels. The results of serum protein electrophoresis was normal, as were those concerning hepatic and renal functions. The ophthalmology examination showed neither corneal dyskeratosis nor cataracts. The neurologic-psychiatric visit revealed slight mental retardation.","1466":"A 4-year-old girl presented to the dermatology clinic with complaints of erythematous skin lesions on her face, extremities,forearms, and joints. The patient was a product of a full-term, normal pregnancy and delivery and was born to healthy parents. The parents are cousins. The condition started a few months after birth with small, hyperkeratotic patches on her cheeks. These lesions did not respond to the treatment that was given. The condition progressed and a few months later similar skin lesions started to appear on her forearms and knees. Different types of treatment, such as topical antibiotics,emollients, topical steroids, and systemic antihistamines, have been tried without any benefit. Some lesions showed variable exacerbations and remissions. There was no family history of a similar problem, although her older brother showed marginal hair loss without any skin lesions. On physical examination (Figures 1-3), hyperkeratotic erythrodermic plaques of variable thickness with sharply demarcated borders were seen on cheeks, extensor surfaces of forearms, and on the knees. The palms,soles, nails, and teeth were normal. The hair showed normal appearance, but there was no hair growth on the margins of the scalp. The laboratory investigations showed normal complete blood count and normal serum zinc and ferritin levels. Urine microscopy and examination was normal. Skin biopsy was taken and histopathology showed nonspecific features of hyperkeratosis with moderate papillomatosis and acanthosis (Figure 4). A diagnosis of erythrokeratodermia variabilis was made and the patient was started on emollients as treatment. There was not much improvement with the treatment.","1467":"A 2-year-old boy presents with a 4 x 3-cm, darkly pigmented nevus on his back.

The parents are concerned about the melanoma risk in their child's congenital nevus.","1468":"A 40-year-old Hispanic man presented for treatment of dermatitis on his elbows and knees that had been evident for 5 years (Figure 1). He also had scaling plaques on his scalp. He had not been treated previously. He did not have any other medical problems and did not complain of arthritis. A clinical diagnosis was made of psoriasis and he was prescribed clobetasol propionate ointment with salicylic acid 6% in petrolatum that should be applied in the evening to his elbows and knees and calcipotriene ointment with clobetasol that should be applied in the morning. For his scalp, he was prescribed betamethasone valerate foam 0.12% to be applied directly to the scalp once a day and told to use a tar shampoo contain-ing 4% neutar solubilized coal tar extract (1.0% coal tar) three times a week. He followed this regimen for 2 weeks and the plaques became much less keratotic. He continued his scalp regimen. He then started using calcipotriene ointment and clobetasol propionate ointment together twice a day. Three weeks later the plaques were much flatter and less erythematous. The patient was instructed to apply clobetasol propionate to the affected areas twice a day on Saturday and Sunday and calcipotriene twice a day Monday through Friday. At this point, his scalp was almost clear and the patient was told touse the foam as necessary and to continue the shampoo.","1469":"A healthy, 53-year-old man presented with a small, soft, nontender mass of his right upper arm that progressively grew larger and more firm during the 6 weeks before evaluation.","1470":"A 50-year old African-American woman presented to her physician's office seeking treatment of excess hair and secondary hyperpigmentation of her chin.

He was alert, oriented, and in no distress. His oropharynx was dry, his neck was supple, and cervical lymphadenopathy was absent. He had tachycardia, bilateral wheezes, and rhonchi with prolonged expirations. There was a diffuse vesicular eruption enveloping his entire body with involvement sparing his palms and soles (Figures 1 and 2). Laboratory values showed a hemoglobin of 16.0 g\/dL and a white blood cell count of 7100 cells\/pL, with 39%neutrophils, 23% bands, and 35% lymphocytes. His platelet count was mildly decreased to 86,000 x 103\/pL. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. A diagnosis of acute varicella-zoster virus pneumonia (varicella pneumonia) was made, and the patient was started on IV acyclovir (10 mg\/kg every 8 hours). Upon further questioning, the patient stated that his daughter had been diagnosed with \"chickenpox\" 7 days ago. The patient had numerous exposures to chickenpox in the past but had never developed clinical expressions of varicella. He was not at risk for HIV infection, not having multiple sexual partners, IV drug abuse, or blood transfusions. During the 1 day of in-hospitalization, his fever abated and the pulmonary signs diminished. Following discharge, IV acyclovir was replaced by valacyclovir to complete a 7-day course of therapy.","1472":"","1473":"Hair follicles are unique structures with exceptional regenerative potential. They are believed to be crucial for epidermal homeostasis and reepithelialization after damage to human skin. Like other, more active and quickly proliferating organ systems, hair follicles may be easily disturbed in their normal growth cycle by systemic and local influences, including specific skin diseases. This may lead to hair loss, a very common complaint in men and women. The difficulties in reviewing the diseases of hair follicles lay in the long list of different etiologic factors (infectious, autoimmune, inflammatory, neoplastic, physical, chemical, congenital) and a still missing classification system according to etiopathogenetic principles. In this article (Part I of II), the structure and function of hair follicles, the diagnostic approach to diseases causing hair loss, and the most common nonscarring alopecias (telogen effluvium, anagen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, and alopecia areata) are reviewed in regard to pathogenesis, clinical findings, and current options of treatment.

It is feared that certain rogue states and terrorist organizations may have illicitly acquired the virus with the intent of unleashing it as an agent of bioterrorism. The United States and other nations have begun vaccinating individuals in the military and health care workers who might become exposed. Primary care providers and dermatologists will be called upon to evaluate potential index cases and vaccination reactions. In this report, the authors review the essential clinical aspects of smallpox and potential reactions to smallpox vaccination. Special attention is given to eczema vaccinatum, which can occur in vaccinees and their family contacts with active or quiescent atopic dermatitis or a personal history of eczema.","1475":"Mohs micrographic surgery is a highly effective technique for the removal of some skin cancers. The technique is founded on the idea of excision with minimal margins (sparing normal tissue) and immediate histologic examination of horizontal frozen sections of the specimen while the patient waits. By doing this, a Mohs surgeon is able to examine the margins. If residual tumor is present, subsequent excisions are performed until it is completely removed. In cases of aggressive tumors, recurrent tumors, or in which the lesions are present in high-risk anatomic locations (H-zone of the face) or functionally important areas (e.g., digits, genitals), the preferred treatment is Mohs micrographic surgery.","1476":"","1477":"","1478":"","1479":"","1480":"","1481":"","1482":"","1483":"","1484":"","1485":"","1486":"","1487":"","1488":"This review is intended as an update on modern trends in the global impact and epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus infection for physicians who are not acquired immunodeficiency syndrome experts.

Depending on the concentration, some have been shown to be effective as peeling agents and for rejuvenation. Glycolic acid and lactic acid are the alpha-hydroxy acids most frequently used in cosmetics, although there are many others used in combination. Some of the most striking advances in dermatology have followed the off-label use of drugs, which is widespread and unavoidable, but a well founded scientific approach to an individual patient's pathology must be emphasized as the number of products, regimens, and adjuncts increases exponentially in the cosmetic field. In this article the authors review some unapproved uses of alpha-hydroxy acids.

A histology-based cross-sectional study was conducted for the years between January 1985 and December 1998 within the Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Department of Pathology, Addis Ababa University. The data were retrieved from the department's archives and all dermatologic cases fulfilling bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic etiologies were included in the study. Formalin fixed, and paraffin embedded tissues were stained with the routine hematoxylin and eosin staining procedure and visualized under light microscopy. Out of 162 cases of chronic specific infective-parasitic dermatoses diagnosed, the mean ages for men and women were 31.5 (SD, 16.6) and 25.1 (SD, 14.3) years respectively and the peak age group was 20-29 years (30.2%). Moreover, the ratio of men to women was 1.1:1. The most commonly diagnosed dermatosis was wart (38.9%), followed by cutaneous tuberculosis (17.9%), and cutaneous leishmaniasis (14.2%). The most frequently involved region was the lower limb (46.3%), followed by the face (23.5%). This study tried to surface the frequency distribution of the histopathologically-proven dermatoses that are prevalent in our part of the world. The lower limbs being the most frequent sites of dermatoses, their predisposing factors need to be addressed in our communities in order to lessen the effects of these dermatoses. This study may act as a baseline for similar investigations that may be undertaken in the future. ","1536":"Glomus tumor is a benign neoplasm of uncommon occurrence in daily practice, more frequently observed as a single painful lesion, at the distal phalanges of the fingers. Multiple presentation is very rare, with fewer than 200 reports, usually presenting as small angiomatous lesions with discrete pain. The study's objective was to analyze the epidemiologic, clinical, therapeutic, and histopathologic aspects in a series of six cases of multiple glomus tumors. All patients were men, between 12-45 years of age. The tumor was congenital or appeared between 3-25 years of age. The clinical picture oscillated between three to 10 lesions, as macules, nodules, or tumors, with colors varying from bluish, brown-bluish, violet, to normochromic. The lesions were detected in the trunk and one or more members, not affecting the head, hands, and feet. Pain was discrete or absent. Incisional biopsy for histopathologic evaluation with the hematoxylin-eosin staining confirmed the diagnosis of glomus tumor in all cases. It showed the characteristic glomus cells and vascular spaces. The complete excision of the tumorous plaque was performed in one patient and a complex corrective procedure is still to be performed for one aberrant tumor in another case. The other patients received advice about their disease and were asked to periodically return. Because this is a very uncommon illness, the present series allowed the demonstration of the wide variety of epidemiologic and clinical aspects described in the literature, with the presentation of elements that may improve its recognition and diagnosis.

It can be argued that all the stigmata of rosacea are manifestations of an inflammatory process: neutrophilic dermatosis. For this reason, treatments that block neutrophil involvement in the development of rosacea, such as topical metronidazole and systemic antibodies, should be considered first-line therapy for all stages of the disease.","1547":"Various means of skin injury in athletes are examined, supplementing those discussed in Cutaneous Manifestations of Disease Part 1 (November\/ December). Skin injury due to mechanical means such as corns, calluses, talon noir (calcaneal petechiae), tennis toe, joggers nipples, and piezogenic pedal papules will be discussed followed by a thorough discussion of environmental means of skin injury. There are a variety of ways that the environment may affect athletes both during competition and years after the competition is finished. The discussion will conclude with a look at performance-enhancing drugs and their effect on an athletes skin, and how the practitioner can better appreciate and perhaps prevent the long-term sequelae of drug abuse.","1548":"During the past decades, a number of new scientific evidences have been provided allowing a better understanding of the nature of cutaneous melanoma. New scientific methods, such as dermoscopy, have been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pigmented skin lesions and early recognition of melanoma. Aggressive approaches for the surgical treatment of melanoma have been shown to be useless and have been replaced by more conservative surgical protocols and by sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the advanced stage of melanoma, new chemotherapy protocols and immunotherapy have been proposed, whereas the role of vaccines is still under investigation. In this review, the authors present an up-to-date overview of the epidemiologic, clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic aspects of melanoma that can be used as a practical guide for the management of this tumor.","1549":"The goal of this study was to compare live and digital image examination of hospitalized dermatology consultation patients. A medical student digitally imaged patients with a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). A resident reviewed these images and the student recorded the differential diagnosis. Digital examination was followed by live dermatologic examination by the dermatology resident and then by a supervising board certified dermatologist. The diagnoses in 29 of these cases were compared with definitive diagnostic tests (e.g., skin biopsy). Montefiore Hospital, Bronx, NY Patients. In March, 2000, 48 of 58 consecutive hospitalized patients for whom dermatology consultations were requested and from whom consent for photographs could be obtained. The accuracy and consistency of the examiners top (up to three) digital diagnoses, (up to three) live diagnoses, and histopathologic diagnoses were compared. Eighty-one percent (38\/47) of resident digital consult diagnoses agreed with live resident diagnoses. Live resident diagnosis agreement with live supervising board certified dermatologists diagnosis was 90% (18\/20). Resident digital image diagnosis correlation with definitive diagnostic test results was 76% (22\/29). Live supervising board certified dermatologist diagnosis correlation with definitive diagnostic test results was 73% (14\/19). Digital image review results in reliable and accurate diagnosis compared to live consultations.

Signs have often been named after the initial observer. They may indicate either dermatologic or systemic illness and aid the examiner in diagnosis and relevant investigations. Some are specific, some have been described in other conditions, and few have lost their relevance. Most of the signs are related to the pathogenesis of the disease but the cause of some is not clear.","1561":"","1562":"Nevus of Ota, or nevus fuscoceruleus ophthalmomaxillaris, is a dermal melanocytic hamartoma that presents as bluish hyperpigmentation along the first or second branches of the trigeminal nerve. Extra-cutaneous involvement has been reported, especially ocular involvement. Nevus of Ota affects between 0.014%-0.034% of the Asian population. Clinical differential diagnoses include facial cafe-au-lait patch, spilus nevus, and acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules. Previous treatment modalities, including cryotherapy and microsurgery, can be associated with scarring. In the last decade, the use of Q-switched lasers has revolutionized the treatment of this condition. This review summarizes the clinical, histologic, and management aspects of this dermal melanocytic hamartoma.","1563":"Although challenging, effective laser surgery in patients with darker skin tones can be achieved despite a higher inherent risk of untoward side effects. While the incidence of undesirable postoperative sequelae has decreased with the development of advanced laser technology and individualized treatment parameters, these risks may never be eliminated completely. Consequently, thorough patient preoperative preparation and education regarding the risks of cutaneous laser therapy will remain an essential component of treatment in darkly pigmented patients. In the future, as more refined laser techniques evolve, the ability to safely and effectively treat these patients will improve.","1564":"","1565":"","1566":"","1567":"","1568":"","1569":"","1570":"","1571":"","1572":"The dermatologic manifestations of complementary therapy include reactions to herbs used orally and topically for treating skin disease, cutaneous reactions to drugs used orally and topically for treating other diseases, and reactions to alternative interventions.

Herbal medicines may be misidentified and contaminated with a variety of substances. The following review identifies and categorizes therapies according to their common uses with their adverse reactions.","1573":"Homelessness is a rising problem with socioeconomic roots that affects millions of people around the world. Homeless people suffer from a wide range of health problems and, consequently, have high rates of morbidity and mortality. Various infectious and noninfectious skin conditions have been described among the homeless, with trauma, superficial fungal infections, and foot problems being the most prevalent. Poor hygiene conditions, exposure to harmful environmental agents, and impaired access to health care may further exacerbate these skin diseases and lead to serious and occasionally life-threatening situations. As an integral part of the medical care for the homeless, dermatologic care is essential in diagnosing and managing their skin diseases, in preventing more serious complications and in improving the overall health status of the homeless population.","1574":"The acronym PEMPHIGUS is suggested to encompass the numerous factors involved in the pathogenesis and course of the disease. In the following review the authors present studies documenting these factors. The acronym can serve as a handy tool to direct the physician's investigation of a case of pemphigus, aiding in its diagnosis and in the prevention of future flare-ups.","1575":"A teledermatology system was established in a dermatology urgent-care clinic staffed by dermatology residents in the emergency department. These residents had previously lacked attending dermatology supervision. Resident physicians took digital pictures of patients' lesions and downloaded the images onto a network personal computer (PC). The images were stored on the hospital's server and then viewed within 5 minutes by an attending dermatologist, in a different location, using a network PC with monitor. Resident and attending physicians discussed the cases over the telephone. Patient acceptance was assessed via separate written surveys. Fifty-one patients, approximately 10 resident physicians, and two attending dermatologists participated in the study. Patient acceptance of the teledermatology system was high (93%). Teledermatology may prove a viable means of evaluating dermatologic complaints in the emergency department. ","1576":"Scalpel blade sampling of a lesion with clinical suspicion of superficial mycosis may eventually harm the patient, especially anxious children, and when sampled from areas such as the neck and the genitals. In these cases--provided that an acceptable level of confidence in results can be warranted--vinyl tape skin strippings, or strip cultures, could be preferable. Eighty-five patients presenting with scaly lesions clinically suspected of superficial mycoses were randomly included in this study. Thin, crystal clear vinyl tape strips were firmly applied to lesions, pulled up, and then attached glue-face down to glass slides, on which a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide\/40% dimethyl sulfoxide solution had previously been placed. Once scales were cleared, microscopic examination was performed. For specimens yielding negative results, further scales were scraped from lesions, cleared, and examined in the conventional manner. Patients with proven negative results in both techniques have been considered a control group. Sixty cases of superficial mycoses were confirmed (dermatophytosis, 38; candidiasis, 12; tinea versicolor, 10). Of these, 59 (98.33%) yielded positive results on vinyl tape preparations, with clear visualization of organisms' structures. The technique failed to demonstrate fungal elements in a single case, subsequently diagnosed as tinea capitis. The additional 25 patients were regarded as our control group. In addition to improved patient compliance, ease of performance, and low cost, the technique seems appropriate for using in an office environment during a routine medical visit. Whenever vinyl tape specimens yield negative results, a scraping-sampled preparation should be provided.

Although pathophysiologically distinct, both conditions have major inflammatory components. Consequently, topical and systemic antimicrobial agents are routinely prescribed for extended periods. Emergence of resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes, adverse events, and compliance issues associated with chronic systemic tetracycline use have led to new treatment approaches. At subantimicrobial doses, tetracyclines reduce inflammation via anticollagenolytic, antimatrix-degrading metalloproteinase, and cytokine down-regulating properties. Subantimicrobial dose (SD) doxycycline (Periostat 20 mg) has clinical utility in periodontitis and has been investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the treatment of moderate facial acne as well as in an open label study in the treatment of rosacea. The results of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline treatment in early trials support its benefits and further investigation in acne and rosacea.","1590":"Suboptimal medication adherence is one of the major reasons for treatment failure among patients with acne vulgaris. Motivating patients to adhere to treatment, especially during the maintenance phase, remains a challenge. Although the literature on medication adherence in the acne vulgaris patient population is sparse, the available literature on patients with dermatologic and nondermatologic disorders suggests that a multifactorial approach, combining nonpharmacologic interventions and effective, well tolerated, and simplified drug regimens, appears to be associated with the greatest success. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate the patient for underlying affective disorders (e.g., depression) that can undermine adherence. The dermatologist can play a major role in enhancing patient adherence by prescribing adherence-enhancing therapeutic regimens and by forming a therapeutic alliance with patients.","1591":"Acne is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous units. Traditional etiologic factors include increased sebum production, ductal hyperkeratosis, abnormality of the microbial flora within the pilosebaceous unit, and mediators of inflammation. Recent developments do not refute these familial elements, but rather refine particular aspects. Interleukin-1a influences hypercornification of the infundibulum as well as the inflammatory response by inducing the production of vascular endothelial growth factor in dermal papilla cells and follicular keratinocytes of the pilosebaceous unit. New retinoids have been developed based on controlling cellular proliferation and differentiation in the pilosebaceous unit by their action on nuclear receptors of cells. Dermal inflammation is not due to presence of bacteria, but from biologically active mediators produced by Propionibacterium acnes. The environment within the pilosebaceous unit is probably more important than the absolute number of P. acnes organisms. Indeed, the major role of the sebaceous gland appears to be supplying P. acnes needed nutrients. Moreover, the microbiologic principle of biofilms appears to be applicable to P. acnes in acne.","1592":"Chemical warfare agents are potentially accessible to even underdeveloped nations because they are easily and inexpensively produced. This means that they are ideal for use by terrorists and in military operations against civilian populations and troops. In terms of cutaneous injury, vesicants-mainly sulfur mustard-are the most significant chemical warfare agents. Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of the lesions produced by sulfur mustard have led to the research and development of barrier creams as well as pre- and post-exposure therapies to moderate the damage and accelerate healing. Part I of this paper will discuss the history and classification of chemical agents; Part II, which will appear in the September\/October 2003 issue of SKINmed, will discuss characteristic manifestations of exposure to chemical agents, as well as prevention and therapy.","1593":"Axillary hyperhidrosis can be a source of social isolation and embarrassment. The available treatments are either ineffective or have intolerable side effects. The search for a simple, long-lasting, and safe treatment has led to the use of botulinum-A toxin injections in those with excessive axillary hyperhidrosis. Fifteen patients participated in this study. All had a history of axillary hyperhidrosis of 1-6 years duration and were using different types of therapies without any benefit. Each patient was injected intradermally with 125 units of botulinum-A toxin (Dysport, Spenywood Pharmaceutical) in 5-6 points over an elliptical area on each side. Patient follow-up was performed using the iodine-starch test. A total of 14 out of the 15 patients had complete anhidrosis 1 week after the injection. This result lasted for periods ranging from 1-6 months. No side effects were encountered. Intradermal injection of botulinum-A toxin seems to be a safe, rapid, and effective method of treatment in axillary hyperhidrosis.

Thus, there have been efforts by the United States in cooperation with other concerned nations to develop animal models to understand the pathophysiology of the injuries induced by these agents, and to develop suitable animal models for testing of pre-and post-exposure protectants and therapies. Sulfur mustard remains the most significant chemical warfare agent that produces cutaneous injuries. Institution of standard recommendations prior to threatened exposure or after exposure are something that we need to be aware of in the world we live in. In addition, pre-and post-exposure therapies now being studied offer hope for moderating the mortality and morbidity that can result from chemical exposure.","1605":"Over the past three decades, laboratory and clinical research findings have shown that T cells are the primary mediators of psoriasis pathogenesis and that psoriasis can be treated by eliminating these T cells or interfering with their activation or activity. Based on these observations, many new biologic therapies to treat psoriasis are now in development. These agents, developed primarily through recombinant DNA techniques, are designed to target T cells and the immunologic cascade associated with their activation. Four basic strategic approaches that focus on the steps involved in the immunopathology of psoriasis are: 1) elimination of the pathogenic T cells; 2) inhibition of T-cell activation, proliferation, and migration; 3) immune deviation to down-regulate the type 1 (TH1) response predominant in psoriasis; and 4) blockade of cytokine production. The goal of these new therapies is to improve the treatment of psoriasis, particularly moderate to severe disease, with agents that are well tolerated and safe for long-term use.","1606":"Cutaneous vasculitis can present with a variety of lesions and associated symptoms. It is important for the clinician to be able to recognize vasculitis lesions and know when to pursue further laboratory studies that will determine the extent of the disease process in a patient.

The prevalence, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of latex allergy are summarized in this review.","1619":"Erectile dysfunction is one of the prime challenges confronting the treating physician. Its prevalence is directly proportional to aging. It is imperative to comprehend the intricate mechanism of erection in order to individualize the approach to management. Thus, it is appropriate to evaluate the etiology of erectile dysfunction. Normal aging, as well as psychogenic, vascular, neurogenic, and endocrinologic causes and\/or those due to structural abnormalities of the penis should be considered when evaluating details to determine its probable cause. An increasing use of drugs, a legacy of civilization, has considerably compounded the problem. Therapy for erectile dysfunction, apart from psychosexual counseling, includes medical treatment by alpha adrenoceptor antagonists, dopamine agonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, sublingual apomorphine hydrochloride, or hormone therapy. Transdermal or transurethral corporeal drug delivery are other possible treatment modalities. Vacuum devices and surgical approaches are considered relevant only in refractory cases.","1620":"This article presents a review of the literature on oral lichen planus, focusing on important aspects of its epidemiology, etiopathogeny, and clinical manifestations. The oral form is an important clinical presentation of lichen planus. It may precede or accompany the skin lesions, or it may be the only manifestation of the disease. Dermatologists, dentists, otorhinolaryngologists, and other specialists who deal with the oral cavity must be aware of this disease so they can diagnose, treat, and keep these patients under observation.","1621":"","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"Antibacterial agents may cause a variety of untoward reactions.

Both in vivo and in vitro tests are becoming useful for the diagnosis of the causative agent in drug eruptions. The drug hypersensitivity syndrome may be associated with thyroid abnormalities often occurring months after the drug has been withdrawn. Symmetrical small joint polyarthritis, fever, and malaise may be the presenting findings in a patient with drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Exanthematous drug eruptions without high fever, mucosal involvement, or joint symptoms often resolve without discontinuation of the drug. The differential diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis depends on the percentage of epidermal detachment.","1631":"Autoimmune vesiculobullous skin diseases are a common occurrence in dermatology practice and do have gender differences. While most dermal antigens and autoantibodies in these diseases have been identified, the etiology and clinical characteristics of the autoimmunity remain obscure, such as why more than 70% of autoimmune diseases are more frequent in women. Researching gender differences and the mechanisms of autoimmune diseases will shed light on the answers to such questions.","1632":"Teledermoscopy uses telecommunication technologies to transfer images of pigmented skin lesions via the Internet for teleconsultation. Clinical and dermoscopic images of 66 and 43 pigmented skin lesions achieved in two consecutive studies were sent by e-mail to dermatologists with different degrees of experience in dermoscopy for a telediagnosis. All lesions included in these studies were surgically excised and diagnosed histopathologically. The diagnostic concordance between the face-to-face diagnosis and the telediagnosis was 91% in the first study, whereas, in the second study, it varied from 76.7%-95.3%. The accuracy of the diagnoses in both studies was not related to the quality of the images, but did highly depend on the level of diagnostic difficulty of a given pigmented skin tumor and on the level of experience of each observer. Teleconsultation of dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions via e-mail provides a similar degree of diagnostic accuracy as face-to-face diagnosis when the diagnosis is made by a dermatologist confident with dermoscopy.
