geocode all residence addresses from Lazio Health Information System in order to obtain a geographical regional database. a semiautomatic and multistep geocoding procedure using several tools and software. all residence addresses of resident population of Lazio Region (Central Italy) in 2020. geographic coordinates at residence addresses and accuracy level of geocoding procedure for more than 1 million of addresses. the 99% of residence addresses in the Lazio Region have been geocoded thanks to the purposed procedure; almost 94% of the addresses have been geocoded with a good level of accuracy (more than 56% at civic number level).

However, some general critical issues have been reported concerning national community health information systems, but no detailed study was found after a non-systematic review in Medline database and institutional websites. to assess uniformity and comparability of health information collected by the national health information Systems for Home Care (SIAD), Nursing Homes (FAR), and Hospices (HOS) in Italy, three healthcare settings sharing patients with common conditions and healthcare needs. information was gathered from current Technical Regulations Papers of the Italian Health Ministry. All variables of the three Information Systems were ordered on the basis of the characteristics provided by the ministerial documents into a single grouping model created for the purpose and their distribution compared among and between the Systems. According to the grouping model, the variables were divided in two main groups: System Variables for administrative, bill, and identification-personal data and the Pathway Variables for patient's conditions and provided healthcare data. Common information content variables among all systems and between two of them were then identified, highlighting those with also identical terminology and allowed values. On the basis of the percentages of common and identical variables, uniformity in content and terminology was then calculated among all systems and between two of them. Besides, levels of content and terminology agreement have been calculated with Cohen's K matching the three Systems in all possible combinations of pairs. there are 70 variables in SIAD, 45 variables in FAR, and 34 in HOS. System variables are nearly the half in FAR and HOS, 22 (48.9%) and 17 (50.0%) variables, respectively. Pathway variables are prevalent only in SIAD, with 55 variables (78.6%). Only SIAD and HOS use ICD-9-CM, with 2 (2.8%) and 9 (26.5%) variables, respectively. The three Systems share 18 common variables, with other 16 common between just two of them. Considering the common variables, the total number of variables used by all the Systems is 97, with 23 System variables (23.7%) and 74 Pathway variables (76.3%). Overall, content uniformity among the three Systems is 18.5%, but becomes 60.9% considering only the System variables and 5.4% for the Pathway variables, with respectively 14 and 4 common variables. Among the common variables, 11 have the same denomination and allowed values, with an overall terminological uniformity of 11.3%. Being all of them System variables, no terminological uniformity has been found among the three Systems.The level of content agreement was fair for the couple FAR-HOS (K Cohen 0.26), but null for HOS-SIAD and SIAD-FAR (K Cohen -0.20 and &lt;0.01). Null was also the level of terminological agreement in all the possible pairs of matched systems (K Cohen all negative). content and terminology uniformity of National Health Information Systems in Italy for Home Care, Nursing Homes, and Hospices has been found to be poor, with little reference to standardised classification systems and a scarce level of comparability of the information gathered in the three healthcare settings, although similarity in patients' characteristics and provided health services. Data comparability among them is mainly limited to administrative and identification-personal information, with little possibility of comparing information on patients' conditions and provided healthcare in the three settings. This scarce uniformity might undermine the contribution of national Health Information Systems in the development of community healthcare services in Italy and limit the potential of epidemiological research in this area. Also in the light of the establishment of new national Health Information Systems for Primary Care and Community Hospitals, a methodological reassessment of languages, codes, and evaluation tools used by community health services and information systems is needed. ","3":"to evaluate and validate the adoption of an algorithm for the identification of cases of congenital anomalies (CAs) to improve the performance of the Congenital Malformations Registry of Sicily Region (Southern Italy). an algorithm was used to identify congenital anomalies on a sample of hospital discharge records (SDO) with ICD-9-CM code between 740-759 on any of the diagnoses within the first year of life, together with a sample of healthy births equal to 5% of total births for the same period. The identified cases were evaluated through the clinical record analysis. the analysed sample was composed of 4,271 cases identified between June 2013 and December 2014 along with 3,993 SDO without any code of MC (5% of the total volume of births in the same period). positive predictive value (VPP) and negative predictive value (VPN) were computed by means of the comparison between the algorithm outcomes and the clinical record verification. 4,271 potentially malformed records involving 3,381 subjects born in the Sicilian territory have been identified. Among the hospital discharge records that it was possible to verify, the application of the algorithm led to the exclusion of 924 cases: of these, 62 proved to be false negatives (VPN: 93.3). The valid cases were 1,179, while the cases to be evaluated 617: the comparison between algorithm and clinical record analysis led to a VPP of 91.7 and 72.1, respectively, for valid and to be evaluated. the tested algorithm proved to be a useful tool for identifying SDO potentially related to congenital anomalies.

Questions regarded nutritional knowledge and habits, smoking habit, physical activity, self-efficacy, and barriers to change. Anthropometric and sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. With single and multiple regression models, differences between subgroups and ranked predictors of students' attitudes towards healthy behaviours were analysed. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. a total of 554 subjects completed the survey (participation rate: 42%; completion rate: 88%). Students showed good nutritional knowledge (73%), but some deficiencies related to low fruit\/high sweets consumption, and a lack of basic macronutrients information. Only 30% of the students led a very active lifestyle and physical inactivity was greatest among overweight\/obese students. Sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy diet were mainly associated with modifiable risk factors, e.g., being overweight and smoking. this study provides evidence that health profession students have good knowledge, but their health-related lifestyle is a concern, especially given the role of prescribers that they will play. Structured programmes need to be developed to address the modifiable risk factors associated with detrimental behaviours manifest already during the university years.

Lower mortality was observed in the age groups 0-29 years (-30%) and 40-49 years (-13%). In 2020, COVID-19 represents the fourth cause of death in Rome after malignant tumours, diseases of the circulatory system, and respiratory diseases. Excess mortality was observed from stroke and pneumonia (both in men and women), from respiratory diseases (in men), from diabetes, mental disorders, dementia and Parkinson's disease (in women). On the contrary, mortality is lower for all cancers, for diseases of the blood and haematopoietic organs and for the causes of the circulatory system. The follow-up analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects residing in Rome shows that a share of deaths (about 20%) reports other causes of death such as cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumours, and diseases of the respiratory system on the certificate collected by the Italian National Statistics Institute. the 2020 mortality study highlighted excesses for acute and chronic pathologies, indicative of possible delays in the diagnosis or treatment of conditions indirectly caused by the pandemic, but also a share of misclassification of the cause of death that is recognized as COVID-19 death.

The activities have been organized on six specific objectives: 1. Development and field testing of guidelines for the surveillance of invasive mosquito species; 2. Creation of risk maps for Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika viruses based on the quantitative monitoring of Aedes albopictus populations; 3. Shaping web platform models assisting the sharing of data from\/to actors involved in the integrated surveillance of West Nile at the regional level; 4. Developing communication formats dealing with vector borne diseases addressing citizen and specific categories; 5. Approaching the cost-benefit analysis in the view to assist decision makers; 6. Sero-surveillance on arboviruses not included in the Ministry directive (Tick Borne Encephalitis and Toscana virus). The achieved results are presented and the acquired experience is made available to promote the adoptions on a larger scale of the approaches and methods to be certainly adapted in the specific contexts. The one health approach seems suitable to address the necessities emerging in this field by taking into consideration the different triggers shaping the dynamics we are observing.","55":null,"56":"in 2017, the Italian Ministry of Health funded the project \"Analysis of the activities of the network of the Family Care Centers (FCCs) to relaunch their role\" aimed at updating the state of the art of the national FCCs. The project was coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health (INIH). The present paper focuses on a selection of the project's results. to describe some characteristics of the regional and Local Health Unit governance of the FCCs, and the care offered by the FCCs in different fields of activity. online census survey on three organizational levels of the FCCs: regional governance, coordination at the Local Health Unit level, and at the single FCC level. Data were collected through dedicated web forms via a national network of reference professionals. all the Italian Regions and Autonomous Provinces, 207 Local Health Unit coordinators, and 1,859 FCC's professionals were involved. Nineteen Regions (response rate: 100%), 183 coordinators (response rate: 88.4%), and 1,557 FCCs professionals (response rate: 83.7%) participated in the survey. the project found a lack of FCCs and of FCCs health professionals throughout the country compared to the national reference standards for these services, and a great interregional variability in the FCCs governance. Women's health according to a life-course approach is the centre of the FCCs activities, although assistance modalities differ by geographic area. to relaunch the FCCs role, it is urgent to strengthen their network throughout the country, their multidisciplinary teams, and their integration with other social and health services.

Respondents were recruited through a snowball sampling. PTSD symptoms were assessed using a validated screening tool, the SPAN (Startle, Physiological arousal, Anger, Numbness) questionnaire. the study population is composed of 6,687 participants, of whom 71.5% were females. The mean age of the sample was 48.7 years. Globally, 43.8% of the participants reported symptoms of PTSD, especially females. PTSD prevalence showed a decreasing trend across age groups. The likelihood of PTSD symptoms was higher among those who increased alcohol consumption, decreased physical activity, and experienced restless sleep. a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms emerged from this survey, especially among women and younger subjects. Preventive strategies should be implemented to protect the mental health of the most vulnerable citizens in a period of emergency. ","58":"","59":"This Catalogue is a collection of information on the use of raw asbestos and asbestos-containing materials used in several industries and occupational activities, with particular attention to the situation of Tuscany, a region of Central Italy. The work was developed at the Institute for Cancer Research, Prevention and Clinical Network (ISPRO) of Florence, where epidemiologic research and surveillance activities have been developing since 1988 and where the coordination and evaluation of the regional health surveillance programme provided to past asbestos workers started in 2016 and is still ongoing. The Catalogue aims at being a working tool for all health professionals engaged in examining and classifying the occupational asbestos exposures of subjects both affected by diseases that could be associated to this carcinogen and examined within the regional health surveillance programme. It is necessary for the health personnel engaged in the above-mentioned activities to know or to have the possibility to find exact and detailed data on asbestos exposure by occupational sector. These data are briefly described in the 29 factsheets this Catalogue consists of. In each factsheet, the presence and every use of asbestos are described, with reference to a precise occupational sector. Several occupational sectors can be considered together because of analogies on asbestos exposure. Occupations are considered on the basis of existing evidence on the use of raw asbestos or asbestos-containing materials (as semi-finished or finished products or as auxiliary materials in production processes). Besides the presence and use of asbestos, a description of the possible exposures of workers is reported. Sources of information were scientific and grey literature as well as the 7,187 occupational histories of mesothelioma registered by the specific Tuscan registry. Some factsheets have been revised and enhanced by Italian experts on the asbestos exposure with a specific competence in the examined sectors. Each factsheet includes also questions to be addressed to workers in order to examine in depth their possible asbestos exposure. For those who would like to expand their knowledge on this topic, references are reported both at the end of each factsheet and at the end of the volume. In all industrialized countries, also in those which have not already banned asbestos use, a decrease in the use of this material and in the relative exposure have been observing since the end of the Seventies, few years after the general consensus within the scientific community on asbestos carcinogenicity. This decreasing trend has been becoming greater and greater since the end of the Eighties, when more restrictive regulations have been approved and applied, especially in occupational settings. Nevertheless, nowadays asbestos-related diseases are still diagnosed due to past exposures, although during next decade a decreasing incidence of malignant mesothelioma - the cancer most specifically related to this carcinogen and characterized by a very bad prognosis and the longest latency - could be observed. Particular attention will be paid to jobs regarding renovation of old buildings containing asbestos and to decontamination activities. In conclusion, this Catalogue is a working tool - although it is not exhaustive and could be upgraded with new information - for all professionals engaged in asbestos risk prevention activities as health personnel, personnel of insurance companies, employers, and employee representatives.","60":"Fifty years after the event, Italy introduced legislation to compensate malformations in children - now in their sixties - born to mothers who had been prescribed the antiemetic drug thalidomide for morning sickness. However, compensation has been denied to people 'only' damaged in one half of their body as opposed to those with bilateral malformations. The present study reviews the papers describing case series of children born with 'thalidomide embryopathy' in the UK, Germany, and other countries around 1960. Most clinical series were not organized on the basis of inclusion\/exclusion criteria, thus allowing for probable selection and information biases on maternal use of thalidomide. In any case, they included a sizable number of children with a unilateral limb defect born from mothers certainly exposed to thalidomide during the relevant pregnancy. In many of these children, limb defects were associated with visceral malformations, as frequently observed following exposure to thalidomide in utero. Similarly, later literature reviews were not bias-free in their choice of articles, as is the case of a recently proposed 'diagnostic algorithm' for thalidomide-caused specific malformations and of the advice by the Italian National Institute of Health ruling out the possibility of thalidomide producing unilateral limb defects. Overall, the scientific evidence suggests that thalidomide can cause unilateral limb defects.","61":"Sinonasal cancers (SNC) are rare tumours with predominant occupational aetiology associated with exposures to specific carcinogens. In Italy, SNC incidence has been under compulsory surveillance since 2008, through the National Sinonasal Cancer Registry (ReNaTuNS), a nationwide cancer registry coordinated by the National Institute for Insurance Against Accidents at Work (Inail). The ReNaTuNS has a regional structure with local registries, established at Regional Operating Centres (CORs). Currently, seven Italian Regions are active in SNC search and, together with Inail, have recently released a new version of the national guidelines for keeping the Registry (available on the Inail website). The aim of this text is to present the new guidelines, an updating version, and to underline the relevance of this tool in enforcing the role of the ReNaTuNS, considering the high occupational fraction of SNC and the unicity of the Italian Registry, which collects all the information available on occupational exposures of each SNC case registered. It is recommended that the active search for SNC cases and the analysis of exposure become a systematic and well-organized activity to prevent or reduce risks of exposure and to support and improve the efficiency of the compensation and welfare system.","62":"Pleural mesothelioma clusters from outdoor environmental exposure have been highlighted also in Italy and, on the basis of epidemiological surveillance coordinated by the Italian National Mesothelioma Register, their frequency has been estimated at about 4.5%. Epidemiological studies and evaluations of some regional mesothelioma registers have made it possible to highlight that the dispersion of asbestos fibers in the outdoor environment was the only ascertained cause of mesothelioma in subjects from asbestos-cement factories, from the Balangero mine (Piedmont Region), from some serpentine rock quarries with tremolite outcrops in the Southern Apennines and in Alta Val di Susa (Piedmont Region); from chrysotile and serpentine caves in Valmalenco (Lombardy Region). Furthermore, cases of pleural mesothelioma were clearly caused by environmental pollution from fluoroedenite fibers in Biancavilla (Sicily Region). On the other hand, regional mesothelioma registers have also reported other circumstances of environmental asbestos exposure, like in the case of steel industry, shipbuilding, chemical plants, railway lines, and repair\/demolition of railway carriages. However, these reports have not found confirmation on the basis of ad-hoc studies and it is likely that there is a lack of homogeneity in the assessment of individual cases. Apart from the scenarios which have been the subject of ad-hoc studies, the assessment of the causal role of environmental exposure to \"in place\" asbestos in the onset of pleural mesothelioma is problematic without an effort to more carefully examine the circumstances of possible exposure, harmonization of the attribution criteria used in the individual regional registers, analytical assessment of the impact of such exposure on the risk of onset of mesothelioma.","63":null,"64":"communicating breast cancer screening (BCS) limits and overdiagnosis implies providing complete and balanced information to allow informed decision-making. to describe women's perceptions, preconceptions, and information preferences regarding the breast cancer screening (BCS) programme paper and web information materials of the Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan Area of Milan (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy). qualitative, descriptive study. participants' voluntary recruitment took place in the registration departments of three hospitals.

For each city, the survey was carried out in Urban (U), Sub-Urban (SU), and Extra-Urban (EXT) areas. Data were aggregated by three geographic areas: North, Centre and South. monitoring of the use of mobile phone when driving. the prevalence of mobile phone use when driving is 5.6% in the North, 4.1% in the Centre, and 6.3% in the South. The stratification by urban area also shows similar values (U: 5.3%; SU: 5.1%; EXT: 7.4%). a considerable prevalence of use of mobile phone when driving is observable throughout Italy, with substantially homogeneous values in different territories and in areas with different levels of urbanization. This behaviour increases the risk of road traffic accidents, according to scientific literature. Despite normative sanction of this behaviour, the prevalence is still high, even though comparable to what observed in other industrialized countries. Multilevel actions could be implemented, effective according to scientific literature, not limited only to the regulatory-sanctioning ones. The reduction of the use of the mobile phone while driving can have a significant impact for public health and traffic safety, because on the prevalence data of this study it is possible to assess that potentially up to 24,000 accidents\/year could be avoided in Italy.

Vital status and causes of deaths were ascertained through the official records of the municipalities and the Tuscany Mortality Register. The follow-up period for PAT cohort was from 01.01.1984 to 31.12.2015 and for LIF cohort was from 01.01.2003 al 31.12.2015. the total cohort included 2,732 males and 326 females: the PAT cohort included 1,602 males and 106 females, and the LIF cohort included 1,130 males and 220 females MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: general and cause-specific Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the entire cohort and for the PAT and LIF sub-cohorts.

","78":"to analyse the association between smoking behaviour and economic crises in Italy between 1993 and 2015. ecological study, carried out on data of the Italian National Institute of Statistics, by means of fixed-effect panel regressions. the rate of smoking prevalence (disaggregated by gender and age) and the unemployment rate (disaggregated by gender and referring to individuals aged 15 or more) were collected for each of the twenty Italian regions. Also, percentage fluctuations of the national real gross domestic product (GDP) were collected to identify the years of severe economic crisis. number of people who smoke per 100 people with the same features. among men, increased regional unemployment rate was associated with increased smoking behaviour only in the group aged 25-34 years. Differently, severe economic crises were associated with increased smoking in almost all age groups, except for men aged 15-24 years. A 1-point decrease in GDP was associated with 0.75 more smokers aged 15 years or more. The highest coefficient was reported among men aged 35-44 years, where a 1-point decrease in GDP was associated with 1.16 more smokers (every 100 men). This age group is also featured by the second highest prevalence of tobacco smoking (36.8%). Among women, a 1-point increase in the regional unemployment rate was associated with 0.08 less smokers every 100 women. Similarly, periods of severe economic crisis at national level were associated with reduced smoking behaviour among women aged 15 years or more, specifically those aged 15-24 years. Differently, women aged 25-34 and 65 years or more showed an association similar to that reported among men. In these groups, a 1-point decrease in GDP was associated with 0.67 and 1.08 more smokers every 100 women. While among the latter the prevalence of tobacco smoking is the lowest, among the former it is the third highest prevalence (21.69%). Therefore, increased smoking behaviour due to economic crises seems to occur especially among women aged 25-35 years old, as happens among men. men in almost all age groups and women aged 25-34 and 65 years or more represent vulnerable groups in which smoking behaviour may increase in times of economic hardship. Therefore, specific policies should be implemented to prevent this occurrence, as well as the negative health outcomes of tobacco smoking.

The epidemic curve initially showed a trend with a low incidence level interrupted in August 2016 with the onset of a large epidemic, in the period between August 2016 and December 2017, involving 3,428 cases mostly adult men exposed to homosexual intercourses (MSM). Since January 2018, the trend of the cases has been decreasing even though its level is still higher than the pre-epidemic period. Based on the analysis of the epidemic curve, three periods characterized by different trends in the monthly number of notified cases were identified: January 2015-July 2016 (pre-epidemic period), August 2016-December 2017 (epidemic period), January 2018-December 2019 (post-epidemic period). In the last observation period, cases show different characteristics compared to the previous periods. They are mainly males under 18 years (p=0.026), subjects travelling to Morocco (8.9% vs 15.9%; p&lt; 0.001) or being in contact with an infected person (p&lt; 0.001). The multivariate analysis confirmed a significantly higher probability for cases notified in the post-epidemic period, compared to the pre-epidemic, to be secondary cases or to have traveled to Morocco. Compared to the pre-epidemic period and the epidemic period, there was a higher percentage of subjects who received a single dose of anti-hepatitis A vaccine (p=0.001). Taking into account only secondary cases reported in the third period, the percentage of cases with incomplete vaccination rises to 31%; in this group, a single dose of the vaccine was administered at a median of 11.5 days before the onset of symptoms. vaccination is of paramount importance for the prevention of hepatitis A in all risk groups, including adult males exposed to same-sex sexual intercourse and travelers to areas at high-medium endemic level, especially children, as the timeliness in the vaccination of contacts is fundamental and crucial for interrupting the chains of infection. The observed increase in secondary cases and the delay in the administration of doses lead to a reflection on the need for greater promotion of vaccination, but also highlight the critical issues in the organization of vaccination services, mainly in the areas that have reported the greatest number of cases.

A total of 20,756 women with data regarding maternal height and weight at the start of pregnancy were included in the analysis. gestational outcome variables studied were gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, premature birth, and still births. Outcomes considered during labour and delivery were type of delivery, induction, episiotomy and post-partum haemorrhage. Neonatal outcomes were birth weight, Apgar score, need for resuscitation, and hospitalisation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Lastly, exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was analysed. considering the population of pregnant women, 68.3% of women were classified as normal-weight, 9.5% as underweight, 16.0% as overweight, and 6.3% as obese. Maternal excess weight and obesity were seen to be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, caesarean section, induction, post-partum bleeding, foetal macrosomia, and the need for neonatal resuscitation and hospitalisation in the NICU. Infants born to overweight and obese mothers were also less likely to be breastfed. excess weight and obesity are important risk factors for health and contribute to the onset of complications during pregnancy and adverse perinatal and long-term outcomes. Programming and implementing public health promotion schemes aimed at preventing excessive weight gain in the reproductive age could significantly improve maternal and foetal health. ","82":"the exposure to a coal-fired power plant has been shown to increase mortality both for cardiovascular and respiratory causes among an exposed cohort in comparison with a cohort of unexposed. Hazard ratios between 1.30 and 1.90 were found for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. to estimate the individual life shortening among the exposed due to power plant emissions. survival for cardiovascular and respiratory disease in the exposed vs unexposed groups was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. For each gender and exposure, a fictitious cohort with a cumulative 30-year follow up was built combining three subcohorts of age at entry of 55-64, 65-74, and 75-84 years, with 10 years of follow up each. Survivals at 10 years in the 55-64-year subcohort were used as initial risks for 65-74-year subcohort; then, survivals at 10 years of the 65-74-year subcohort were used as initial risk in the 75-84-year subcohort. Eventually, 30-years cumulative follow up cohorts were obtained by gender and exposure. Individual life-shortening in people exposed was estimated as time from death of an exposed subject to the subsequent time when the unexposed cohort reached the same risk of the exposed subject at that time of the death. Here, it is proposed a method to take into account causes other than those considered. 144,018 subjects aged 55-74 years at entry of both genders belonging to the open cohort of residents of 12 municipalities (including Savona) from 2001 to 2013 in the area where the coal-fired power plant of Vado-Quiliano (Liguria Region, Northern Italy) is located. individual life shortening. after 5 years of follow up, the individual life shortening due to cardiorespiratory causes varied between 972 and 1,822 days for males and from 612 and 1,578 days among females. Taking into account other causes of death, reduces slightly (3% for males of 75 years at death) the estimate of life shortening found in this study. The comparison between the cohorts requires that the exposed and unexposed groups are comparable, except for the exposure, and that causes other than those considered are taken into account. Socioeconomic status had been found to have little effect on cause-specific death risk indicating that, at least in terms of socioeconomic status, the exposed and unexposed groups were similar. Taking into account causes other than those considered slightly reduced the found estimates (3% at age 75 in males). According to the proposal, the life-shortening for the considered causes is easy to calculate and provides an individual indicator of damage. Inferring from group statistics individual estimates could be the most controversial point of this approach. The proposed estimates are the most credible estimate of individual damage for each occurred death among the exposed people. an increased hazard ratio for a wide series of causes is equivalent to a life shortening among the exposed. A method to produce reasonable estimates of life-shortening is proposed as the effect of exposure at individual level. This approach is simple and do not require sophisticated statistical tools. It appears a promising approach for other settings.

We explore the reasons for this - often simplistic - conclusion and offer suggestions on how to extend the assessment focus from just the plant to an appropriate impact area. For many assessments, the conclusions are easily predictable: the application of available risk functions to modest increases in pollution, in the presence of numerically small populations in the areas of greatest fallout and considering rather rare health outcomes, can only result in quantitatively modest health impacts. This is the classic situation of low sensitivity of the observation system due to the impossibility of containing the type II error (false negatives) since we cannot increase the exposed population at will. The risk is to give the green light to an industrial plant in which the apparently null or very limited damage is simply not properly detectable. There is hardly any trace of these elements in the HIA scoping phase. In environmental complex territories, the renewal or authorization of a new plant should consider not only the impact of the individual plant, but also the health profile of the population concerned and the context in which the industrial project is located. An 'HIA area' is therefore configured, aimed at the complex of environmental pressure factors that insist on the same area of impact of the plant. Epidemiology focuses on the exposed population, considers the 'current' state of health, hazard, and risk information from toxicology, and estimates individual exposure and the effects of exposure. The 'HIA area' can assess the impact of the complex of persistent emission sources, considering in the analysis the health status of the exposed population and the presence of specific vulnerabilities. The proposal is in line with what is already foreseen in the Essential levels of care and Environmental technical performance of the National Health Service.A basic condition is the establishment of functions dedicated to integrated environmental and health surveillance to update the health profile and carry out the 'HIA area' as an accompanying tool for local strategic planning.

Despite this severe biological risk during the first epidemic phase, some institutional operating protocols and recommendations have shown limitations and contradictions and, therefore, they must not be repeated.

In developing countries, large epidemics spread mainly through contaminated water; in developed countries, hepatitis E has always been considered a sporadic disease, closely associated to the travels to endemic areas, especially in Southeastern Asia. In the last years, this perception is significantly changing, because of an increasing number of autochthonous cases reported in many European countries. to describe the epidemiological picture of hepatitis E in Italy from 2007 to 2019. descriptive study based on the cases reported to the special surveillance of acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA); case-control analytical study for the analysis of risk factors associated with hepatitis E. hepatitis E cases reported to SEIEVA in the period 2007-2019. number of cases notified by year, percentages of cases exposed to known risk factors, odds ratios. from January 2007 to June 2019, 385 hepatitis E cases were notified to SEIEVA. The annual number increased from 12 in 2007 to 49 in 2018, the increasing trend continued in 2019, when 39 cases were observed in the first 6 months of the year. Northern and Central Regions reported most of the cases; only a few were diagnosed in Southern Regions. Based on SEIEVA data, the trend of hepatitis E notifications has increased according to the increasing propensity to the differentiated diagnosis, at least until 2018. However, only 46% of suspected cases are tested to detect the presence of anti-HEV IgM antibodies, during the observation period; the percentage of tested cases is significantly lower in the South than in Northern and Central Italy (p&lt;0.001). The reported cases have a median age of 48 years (range: 5-87) and are mostly males (80%); 32% was observed in foreign citizens mainly from endemic areas of South Asia (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan). In 72.5% of cases, the infection was contracted in Italy. The most frequent risk factor is the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat, especially sausages (70% of cases), significantly associated with hepatitis E risk (OR 3.0; IC95% 1.4-6.1). Other important risk factors are wild boar sausages consumption (40% of cases, OR 4.6, not statistically significant), and travels to endemic areas during the six weeks before the disease (31% of cases, OR 3.2; IC95% 1.6-6.4). hepatitis E can now be considered as endemic even in industrialized countries. In Italy, from 2007 an increasing number of cases has been reported. However, the real impact of HEV infection is still underestimated due to the limited number of clinical centres which perform tests for the search of anti-HEV IgM antibodies in cases of acute hepatitis. An ad hoc surveillance has been activated in January 2019 in some Local Health Units\/Regions and extended to a national level starting from January 2020. This initiative is necessary in order to better dimension the burden of the disease associated with HEV infection, to study its epidemiology, and to increase awareness of this infection among health professionals.

Indeed, the movement of live animals and of the means of transport is one of the main risk factors in the spread of diseases and this is particularly relevant in areas with high stocking density. statistical analysis on movements of pigs entering Lombardy was carried out. Data on pigs' movements and farm characteristics were collected from the National and Regional databases. Social Network Analysis (SNA) was used to analyse the flows of pigs to Lombardy, to identify the holdings and geographical areas that are central in the trading network and that could have a role in the introduction of swine pathogens into the region. data on pigs' movements introduced into Lombardy in 2016 were analysed. Lombardy is a region of Northern Italy with intensive livestock husbandry. The pig sector is of particular economic relevance also in view of the processing industry, suited to the production of high quality pork products. Annually about 1.8 million pigs are introduced into the region also to satisfy the request of the processing industry for the production of pork products. in this study, the farms that buy pigs from outside the region were identified as well as the territories where the largest number of pigs are introduced. The analysis was carried out also considering certain factors related to the movement of animals, which can be relevant for the transmission of pathogens, such as number of commercial partners, number of exchanged animals, and number of shipments. in 2016, 1,782,568 pigs were introduced into Lombardy; by using SNA, it was possible to highlight a complex trade network of pigs, mainly involving the Northern regions. Indeed, the pigs were mostly purchased from Emilia Romagna (33.4%), followed by Veneto and Piedmont. These regions have been the most closely analysed in this study. SNA was also used to identify Lombardy territories (provinces and municipalities) which, based on the number of introduced pigs, are potentially most exposed to the introduction of pathogens from outside the region. Mantua and Brescia provinces resulted the most exposed area. Italy is one of most important European producers of pigs and about 50% of national pig assets is present in Lombardy; furthermore, about 1.8 million pigs are introduced yearly into the region. Currently, the region is free from the main diseases of pigs and the introduction of an epidemic disease into the pig population could adversely affect the entire productive sector. For this reason, an analysis of the movements of pigs entering the region was carried out to identify the areas (provinces, municipalities) and holdings most exposed to the risk of introduction of pathogens. This information is relevant for the veterinary authorities to plan appropriate control activities (official controls, surveillance, biosecurity, and vaccination, where possible) in order to enhance disease prevention and promote early detection.

Adherence to a clinical study can become highly problematic and invalidate the possibility of answering a scientific question and the validity of a project. In the current pandemic situation, randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal tool to reach the expected scientific evidence, due to a number of problems. It is preferable to use a sequential or adaptive design. Furthermore, study protocols should implement innovative approaches that also include the involvement of participants in the decision-making process.

At the same time, climate change has become part of our everyday life. The resulting question is whether this 'allergic epidemic' is linked to this aspect. It is assumed that the causes of the increase of respiratory allergies are mainly related to environmental factors and lifestyle: first, the improvement of social and health conditions and related hygiene hypothesis; secondly, lifestyle change and anthropogenic activities, which have caused an alteration in the balance normally existing between soil, water, and atmosphere, giving rise to the phenomena of climate change. In fact, it has been demonstrated that they can influence beginning, duration, and intensity of the pollen season, as well as the allergenicity of pollen. The consequence is both an increase in frequency and intensity of allergic symptomatology in subjects previously affected by allergy, and a promotion of the sensitization of the airways to allergens present in the atmosphere in predisposed subjects. Several intervention strategies aiming to mitigate climate change and reduce anthropogenic emissions and, consequently, respiratory allergies are possible and can be implemented on an individual and social level. It follows that the allergist cannot solve the problem of the progressive increase of respiratory allergies on his own. Anyway, his role can have both clinical and educational purposes with a special commitment to reduce health impact due to environmental risk factors.

Subsequently, an algorithm was developed to obtain a relative risk assessment (RRA). in order to validate the proposed methodology, data of 80 livestock farms in a polluted area, enrolled in a previous study, were subjected to the RRA. Results of RRA were compared with contamination data. seven RFs were included in a mathematical formula used to classify each farm. a scoring system was produced for each RFs and an algorithm was developed to obtain RRA which is an estimate of the farm probability of having POAO contamination in comparison to other farms located in the same area potentially affected by chemical pollution based exclusively on site-specific environmental characteristics. In the case study used for validation, a significant relationship between RRA and contamination data was found. the proposed methodology is a useful tool to support the authorities responsible for the food safety in carrying out the monitoring of POAO in areas subject to environmental risks.

Exposure to contaminants and the resulting health risks often regard socioeconomic deprived communities or the most disadvantaged subgroups, generating conditions of environmental injustice.

It describes how the national epidemiological surveillance system of communities residing close to industrially contaminated sites (named SENTIERI) and local epidemiological surveillance systems can be implemented to document local conditions of distributive injustice (inequalities in harmful exposures and consequent health risks). Furthermore, it analyses the mechanisms for generating and maintaining marginalities that prevent local communities from participating in decision-making processes (procedural injustice). Finally, after having identified and described the dimensions of community capacity, which concern both to the understanding of the adverse effects of environmental contamination and to the capability of promoting interventions against environmental injustices, it proposes an environmental justice promotion approach that starts from mapping the dimensions of community capacity as a premise to the identification of interventions for community empowerment.","133":"Barbara Pacelli, a young Italian epidemiologist, passed away unexpectedly in September 2019.

Screenings were cost-effective when extended to newborns\/relatives of pregnant women (Chagas disease) and were cost-effective for unvaccinated women in low-vaccination rates regions (rubella), immigrant women reporting no\/uncertain vaccination history (varicella), and first-generation immigrants (HCV). promoting inclusion in pregnancy healthcare programmes or in targeted screening campaigns could be effective in cost saving for health services. ","138":"socioeconomic inequalities in reproductive outcomes have been consistently reported in several countries. In a European collaborative study conducted in 2012 whose aim was to investigate the association between socioeconomic position (SEP), measured through maternal education, and preterm delivery inconsistent results were found for the NINFEA birth cohort. However, NINFEA contributed to that study with the first 2,500 pregnancies only, and estimates were not adjusted for any potential confounders assuming that SEP is a distal exposure, that could not be affected by other preterm risk factors. to investigate the relationship between SEP and the reproductive outcomes using the entire NINFEA cohort and compare the results with the population-based Piedmont Birth Registry (PBR), accounting for potential baseline collider bias both in the cohort and in the registry. observational study. 5,323 NINFEA singletons, whose mothers registered into the study before the 36th week of gestation, were analysed. Analyses on maternal education were replicated in the 2011 PBR of 35,318 singletons live births. Factors affecting the likelihood of being a member of the NINFEA study or becoming pregnant in the general population were treated as potential confounders to adjust for baseline collider bias. the association of maternal education and a recently developed household income indicator with both preterm delivery (&lt;37th weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (&lt;2,500 gr) were analysed. in the NINFEA cohort, low SEP was positively associated with both preterm delivery and low birth weight, with slightly stronger associations for household income, especially on low birth weight. Results were consistent with those obtained in the PBR data, where an inverse relationship between maternal education and the two reproductive outcomes was found. In both populations, there was confounding due to maternal age and parity, showing that independently of the nature of the source population, baseline factors that affect the probability of being a member of such source population have to be accounted for to allow causal inference. low SEP is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes in a contemporary Italian population.

Among pregnant women, there has been an increase in schooling, a reduction in employed women, and a stabilization of the percentage of immigrant women from countries with strong migratory pressure. Foreigners and inactive women show greater risks of poor prenatal care and less adherence to screening; education has greater impact on pregnancy outcomes. The trend towards greater adherence to the guidelines appears to be related to the introduction of the pregnancy Agenda, in turn associated with a greater use of public health services. social inequalities persist in prenatal\/perinatal care and pregnancy outcomes. The results of this study support the hypothesis that offering quality and low-threshold services, such as family health centres, could be a first effective measure to tackle inequalities.

The screening history and Census data recorded into the Piedmont screening archive were used. positive baseline HPV test, positive triage cytology (low-grade lesions, ASC-US, L-SIL and high-grade lesions, H-SIL, ASC-H, AGC, Cancer), attendance at one-year HPV test repeat, referral and attendance to colposcopy at first and test repeat, and detection rate at first and test repeat, for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade &gt;=2 (CIN2+) and &gt;=3 (CIN3+), overall detection rates. women performing cervical screening through volunteer NGOs (WASVO) are disadvantaged in terms of diagnostic indicators compared to women accessing via the NHS. WASVO are 60% more likely to be positive at the first HPV-test (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.6; 95%CI 1.2-2.0); their likelihood of being referred to colposcopy is double (adj PR 2.1; 95%CI 1.3-3.4); attendance rate to one year HPV test repeat is lower (adj PR 0.2; 95%CI 0.1-0.5); detection rates at first HPV screening test both for CIN2+ (adj PR 2.1; 95%CI 0.9-4.6) and CIN3+ (adj PR 2.1; 95%CI 0.9-5.1) is higher, even if statistical significance is borderline for the latter results. those responsible for screening programmes should establish and maintain collaborative relationships with local volunteer NGOs and migrant organisations for promoting strategies to raise awareness on cancer prevention among subgroups that are not captured in the main screening programs. ","141":"to characterize healthcare for refugees and asylum seekers. a quali-quantitative study with semi-structured interviews was carried out with key informants of the regional clinics which provide health assistance to refugees and asylum seekers during the first phases of arrival. key informants of 14 health centres were interviewed across the 9 provinces of the region. the study investigated the different healthcare interventions and the quality of the relationships among the main actors involved in providing healthcare to refugees and asylum seekers. three healthcare models were identified: one involved Local Health Units (LHUs), one based on the recruitment of NGOs, and the last one formed by the combination of LHAs and General Practitioners. Challenges in guaranteeing a good level of health assistance were reported at all levels, such as specific barriers in accessing health and social services, fragmentation and lack of coordination amongst services and the poor quality of care for vulnerable groups. the healthcare for asylum seekers is characterized by various critical issues, mainly related to accessibility and coordination of health and social services. In order to guarantee health equity, it is necessary to strengthen the primary health care system and improve local governance.

Women who suffered SGBV have a higher prevalence of diseases than their counterpart (more blood, digestive, neurological, psychological, genital diseases, and AIDS), are more frequently pregnant, and asked more frequently for a voluntary interruption of pregnancy. the low prevalence of SGBV identified suggests that underreporting and under-recognition of the phenomenon are possible. This highlights the need to offer a psychological support to all migrant women at their arrival in the Italian hubs, also when they do not report violence.

Higher perinatal mortality rates among immigrants compared to Italians (3.6 vs 2.3 x1,000). Higher standardized rates (x1,000) among immigrants compared to Italians of avoidable hospitalisation (men: 2.1 vs 1.4; women: 0.9 vs 0.7) and of white triage codes in emergency (men: 62.0 vs 32.7; women: 52.9 vs 31.4). study findings show differences in access and outcomes of healthcare between Italians and immigrants. National monitoring system of indicators, coordinated by INMP, represents a useful tool for healthcare intervention policies aimed to health equity.

Compared with Italians, immigrant men and women had a weaker and non-significant inverse educational gradient in mortality, which did not change substantially after the adjustment for occupational class. the results support the status inconsistency hypothesis, which may be partly responsible for the observed flattening of the educational gradients. The macroarea of origin appears to be a key determinant of mortality inequalities. Therefore, the use of educational qualification in exploring health inequalities among immigrants should be always complemented with other indicators of socioeconomic position and migratory history.

Fixed-effects panel regressions were run to test the association between male and female suicide rates and the rate of growth of the credit-to-GDP (CTG) ratio. The buffering role of social protection measures was investigated. The observation period was from 1990 to 2014. regional male and female rates of suicide. male suicide rate is influenced by the rate of growth of the CTG ratio: a one-unit decrease in the latter is associated with 1.26 more suicides every 10,000 people. This marginal effect was significant at 1% for men, but not significant for women. Unemployment rate and periods of mass job loss were not associated with the outcome. With respect to SPMs, only public unemployment spending was able to moderate the association between suicide rate and rate of growth of the CTG ratio. A one-unit increase in the rate of growth of public unemployment spending was associated with 0.12 less suicides every 10,000 people, but only among men. Younger and older men were more affected by credit reduction, namely those aged 15-44 years and 75 years or more. Differently, women were not influenced by credit reduction, but only by increased UR in the group aged 55-64 years. access to credit is a major determinant of psychological well-being for men, but not for women. The rate of growth of the CTG ratio may be more useful than other macroeconomic indicators at identifying the mental health outcomes of economic crises.

The characteristics of people or population groups have been explored and can produce inequalities on health which included individual and context socioeconomic status. using available information sources and study results have explored the effects of the disadvantage on health in the region: mortality, morbidity, oncological incidence, reproductive health, and some of their determinants. the Sicilian population tends to aging. Migration flows tend to compensate the reduction in births in Sicily and it increases the proportion of younger people and women in childbearing age. The proportion of large families tends to get smaller, whereas the proportion of single-component ones increases; the population groups with low education, unemployment, poverty, and income increases. Starting from the first thousand days of life, to continue in the other classes of the population, the different distribution of risk factors on health was identified according to different levels of deprivation. the Sicilian equity profile has systematized and consolidated previous experiences on the effects of disadvantage on health. Prevention interventions, oriented towards equity, should be based on the results of this study and should take care of the general aspects of actions and, at the same time, focus on vulnerable population groups.

For each municipal statistical area, the distribution of the exposures as well as rates and Bayesian Relative Risks of the outcomes were plotted on the city map. To evaluate the association between social determinants and health outcomes, Spearman correlation coefficients were estimated. residents in the city of Bologna aged &gt;=18 years in the period 2011-2015, grouped into 90 statistical areas. a North-South divide was apparent for most of the socioeconomic and ill-health indicators, with a high concentration of adverse outcomes in the North-Western part of the city. Adherence to cancer screening represented an exception, being greater in the areas with higher proportion of unfavourable health outcomes. An inverse association between education level and health outcomes was found. Low family income was weakly to moderately correlated with health outcomes. Proportion of residents in council houses and of the teenage foreign population showed a moderate to strong association with all outcomes, but mortality and screening adherence. an ecological analysis based on data that are routinely collected by local health and social institutions can be effective in revealing the geographical patterns of health inequalities. When accompanied by strategic choices aimed at bridging knowledge and action, this approach may facilitate the direct engagement of local actors towards health equity.

The association is stronger for the residents of ex-Bastogi, a compound particularly marginalised and socially disadvantaged, where excesses in hospitalisation, emergency care admission, and mortality of +60%, +150%, and +140%, respectively, occurred. the excesses of hospital use, emergency care visits, and mortality observed among the residents of marginalized urban areas suggest the need to reorganize the preventive and primary care services considering the socioeconomic disadvantage in such housing contexts.

The Census includes several individual information, such as gender, age, education, residential neighbourhood. Data and cause of death were collected from mortality register. Real estate prices (euros\/m2) were available for each neighbourhood. adjusted Cox regression models (hazard ratios - HRs and 95%CIs) were used to estimate the association among individual education, real estate price in the neighbourhood, and mortality. the subjects selected were 2,051,376 (54% women, 22.5% with high education level). During the follow-up, 127,352 subjects died. Taking into account gender, age, marital status, and real estate prices, education level was strongly associated with all-cause mortality; compared to highly educated the higher mortality, risk was 35% (95%CI 32%-37%) for low education level and 16% (95%CI 14%-19%) for medium education level. Taking into account the same factors and education level, each increase of 1,000 euros in price\/m2 was inversely associated with mortality (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.96-0.97). there is an independent association between the two indicators and mortality in Rome.

The population was equally distributed across the three degrees of urbanisation, but the prevalence of highly educated subjects was lower in the sparsely populated areas than in cities (12.9% vs 27.7%). The higher risk of mortality among the low educated was greatest, particularly among males, in the cities (MRR 1.68; 95%CI 1.62-1.75), lowest in the intermediate density areas (MRR 1.47; 95%CI 1.40-1.55), and not negligible among women. The interaction between education level and degree of urbanisation was significant for all-cause mortality, mortality from cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumours, especially lung cancer, road accidents (only among men). Among women, there were signs of an effect modification on mortality from diseases of respiratory and digestive systems. this first application of the SLER revealed that the mortality gradient by education level is greater in the cities, especially among men.

In this unrelenting flow of information, Africa has been largely off the radar, escaping the attention of the scientific literature and the media. International agencies have been the exception: despite the still low numbers of cases and deaths, they have voiced concerns, often in catastrophic terms, on the health, economic and social impacts of COVID in African countries. These concerns contrast sharply with the optimistic view that Africa may be spared the worst consequences of the pandemic.This paper provides a snapshot of a crisis in evolution: its features could change as new data become available and our understanding improves. The paper examines the epidemic trends, the health impact, the containment measures and their possible side effects. Africa has a long experience of responding to epidemics: relevant lessons learned are outlined. The picture of the epidemic and its narrative are heterogenous, given the differing vulnerabilities of African countries and the diverse contexts within their borders. The paper, therefore, singles out selected countries as illustrative of specific situations and advocates for a transnational and subnational approach to future analyses.The virus has shown a strong capacity to adapt; therefore, a response strategy, in order to be effective, needs to be flexible and able to adapt to changes. The paper concludes with the recommendation that affected communities should be engaged in the response, to maintain or build trust. A lesson from the Ebola outbreak of a few years ago was that epidemiologists and community leaders learned, after initial difficulties, how to dialogue and work together.A summary update of the pandemic has been added, in view of its fast evolution.","156":"scientific literature indicates that there are sex, and gender differences in the development, symptomatology and evolution of different diseases, in the response to drugs and in the therapeutic pathways. Even in the COVID-19 epidemic some sex\/gender differences emerged. to analyze COVID-19 epidemic data by gender and age in Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden, characterized by having implemented different pandemic containment policies, with the aim of observing any characteristics that can be interpreted with the lens of sex\/gender differences. we used confirmed cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 for Italy, Spain, Germany, and Sweden from respective national surveillance databases. Mortality data for Italy were also analysed. The period of investigation was March-May 2020. As indicators, we used the case fatality ratio adjusted for time delay and SMR for mortality. women are more vulnerable to COVID- 19 infection in the 30-60-year age group. Case fatality ratio is higher in men than women, with a ratio men\/women equal to 1.7 in Italy, Spain, and Sweden and 1,4 in Germany. The ratio increases in the lower age groups. The analysis of the mortality data observed\/expected in Italy in the same period with respect to 2015-2019 shows a comparable excess with SMR equal to 132 for men and 127 for women. COVID-19 affects both genders with some differences in the incidence, higher in women, and lethality, higher in men. These differences highlight the need to better understand the sex\/gender and age interaction both for epidemiological surveillance and for a better gender-appropriateness of the ongoing prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This would be possible if all health indicators (symptoms, past illnesses, primary and hospital-level health care, hospitalization, etc.) were provided by age and gender. Analysis of the causes of death could help to better understand the increase in mortality for both genders, in particular for women, for whom a lower lethality for COVID-19 appears from data. ","157":"In the first stages of the pandemic, the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 were significantly higher in men than in women most likely as the effect of biological, hormonal, metabolic differences between the two sexes. However, gender-related differences in lifestyles and social roles can also greatly influence the course of disease. To fully understand the influence of gender in the COVID-19 outbreak, the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data must be enhanced to allow a better knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in men and women, not only from a biomedical point of view, but also considering the risk factors associated with the different roles that they play in the society.","158":"The area of mental health is directly affected by the pandemic and its consequences, for various reasons: 1-the pandemic triggered a global lockdown, with dramatic socioeconomic and therefore psychosocial implications; 2-mental health services, which treat by definition a fragile population from the psychological, biological and social points of view, have a complex organizational frame, and it was expected that this would be affected (or overwhelmed) by the pandemic; 3-mental health services should, at least in theory, be able to help guide public health policies when these involve a significant modification of individual behaviour. It was conducted a narrative review of the publications produced by European researchers in the period February-June 2020 and indexed in PubMed. A total of 34 papers were analyzed, which document the profound clinical, organizational and procedural changes introduced in mental health services following this exceptional and largely unforeseen planetary event.Among the main innovations recorded everywhere, the strong push towards the use of telemedicine techniques should be mentioned: however, these require an adequate critical evaluation, which highlights their possibilities, limits, advantages and disadvantages instead of simple triumphalist judgments. Furthermore, should be emphasized the scarcity of quantitative studies conducted in this period and the absence of studies aimed, for example, at exploring the consequences of prolonged and forced face-to-face contact between patients and family members with a high index of \"expressed emotions\".","159":"THE CONTEXT: among the community health services representing a resource to face the COVID-19 emergency, there are the Family Care Centres (FCCs). A national study coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, recently described their activities and needs, highlighting a large interregional variability in the number of centres and staff availability. Ante and post-natal care, cervical cancer screening and actions addressed at teenagers are the FCCs strategic activities. THE CF IN FRONT OF COVID-19: despite the need to limit the offer of care to the services that cannot be postponed during the lockdown, many FCCs have been exemplary in promptly reorganizing activities in the new context. The paper presents a selection of experiences carried out from March to June 2020 by some FCCs in different Italian Regions concerning FCCs strategic activities. CONCLUSIONS: the combined reading of some of the results of the ISS study and of the activities implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a measure of the ability of the FCCs to respond to the needs of the community and to adapt to change. These services based on an innovative health model deserve enhancement and support.","160":"During a pandemic, pregnancy and the postnatal period are complicated by multiple factors. On the one hand, worries about one's own health and the health of loved ones, in particular of the newborn child, can increase the risk of some mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety in the pregnant woman. On the other hand, as happened for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, given the need for physical distancing, the maintenance of the social and family network, so important for new parents in the perinatal period, is lacking. In addition, health services are forced to reorganize their offerings to ensure maximum safety for their operators and patients. This work proposes a model of screening and treatment aimed at identifying women at risk and providing them with effective and safe treatment.","161":"health literacy may contribute to the strategies to control the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as individuals need to acquire promptly new health information, understand the reasons behind recommendations, and adapt their behaviour accordingly. to investigate sociodemographic and disease-related factors that can influence self-perceived knowledge (poor\/medium vs high) about COVID-19 in women of the Italian NINFEA birth cohort. cross-sectional study. a web-based anonymous survey on COVID-19 was sent in April 2020 to women participating in the NINFEA cohort. A total of 3,129 women were included in the study. using multiple weighted logistic regression models, self-perceived knowledge level was analysed in relation with the following variables: age, education level, family size, cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases until 7 April 2020 by province, presence of COVID-19-like symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19 diagnosis. the prevalence of self-perceived poor\/medium knowledge was 57%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of self-perceived poor\/medium COVID-19 knowledge level was increased for low\/medium compared with high education level (OR 1.57; 95%CI 1.34-1.84), and decreased for SARS-CoV-2 testing (OR 0.25; 95%CI 0.16-0.39) and COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.20; 95%CI 0.07-0.60). There was no evidence of association between the other analysed variables and self-perceived knowledge level. the findings of this study suggest that low educational level is a determinant of low self-perceived knowledge on COVID-19 in middle-aged women.

Moreover, to investigate the association between lifestyle changes during the pandemic and sociodemographic characteristics. epidemiological investigation based on a cross-sectional study. between April 21st and June 7th 2020, an electronic questionnaire to collect information on physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, and eating habits during the period of home containment was made available on the web. Respondents were recruited through non-probabilistic snowball sampling. The link to the electronic questionnaire was disseminated through institutional websites, social networks (Facebook, Twitter), and messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and SMS. A total of 10,758 interviews were collected, of which 7,847 (73%) were complete for a minimum set of indicators (age, gender, and area of residence). reduction of physical activity, increase in alcohol consumption, increase in cigarette smoking, increase in consumption of unhealthy foods (processed meat, red meat or desserts) without increasing healthy foods (vegetables, legumes or whole grains) and, vice versa, increase in consumption of healthy foods without increasing unhealthy foods. the population under study consists of 7,847 people with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation: 13.9). Most of respondents are women (71.3%), 92.5% have a high school or university degree and 91% live in Northern Italy. During home containment, 56% of interviewees reported they had reduced the time devoted to physical activity. In particular, this happened among older people and those living in large cities. More than 17% of respondents increased their alcohol consumption, especially men, those highly educated and those living in large urban centres. Older age and residence in the Southern Italy represent, instead, protective factors for this outcome. Among smokers, 30% increased cigarette consumption during the period of home containment, on average of 5.6 cigarettes per day. A small proportion of former smokers (0.6%) resumed smoking. With regard to eating habits, 3 out of 10 respondents (29.9%) reported an inappropriate eating behaviour (increasing unhealthy food without increasing healthy ones). This behaviour was less frequent among men (adjusted Prevalence Ratio 0.80, p=0.005). A lower percentage of respondents (24.5%) increased the consumption of healthy foods without increasing the consumption of unhealthy ones. the results of this survey show that social isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had an impact on citizens' behaviours. In particular, it was found a noteworthy increase in sedentariness, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A meaningful proportion of respondents reported a worsening of eating habits, especially among women. However, for each of the behavioural risk factors investigated, small proportions of respondents with resilient attitudes were also found, namely, capable of taking advantage of social isolation for improving their daily habits. Studying changes in lifestyles during a pandemic, identifying population groups most at risk of adopting unfavourable behaviours, is a useful tool for policy makers to plan targeted and effective public health interventions.

In the period January-May 2020, the fewer screening tests performed in comparison with the same period of 2019 were: 472,389 (equal to 53.8%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for mammography screening; 585,287 (equal to 54.9%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for colorectal screening; 371,273 (equal to 55.3%) with an average delay of 2.8 standard months for cervical screening. The estimated number of undiagnosed lesions is 2,201 (95%CI 2,173-2,220) breast cancers; 645 (95%CI 632-661) colorectal carcinomas; 3,890 (95%CI 3,855-3,924) advanced colorectal adenomas and 1,497 (95%CI 1,413-1,586) CIN2 or more serious lesions. mass screenings need to be restarted as quickly as possible. In order to make up for the delay that is accumulating, it is necessary to provide for wider delivery times, greater resources, and new organizational approaches. It will also be essential to develop communication strategies suitable for promoting participation during this emergency.

At the end of the outbreak investigation, 18.4% of the employees were positive to the molecular test for SARS-CoV-2. Higher prevalence has been reported in the bovine slaughtering house and swine meat processing plant.In addition to lack of physical distancing and correct use of personal protective equipment, the spread of the virus has been eased by low level of literacy, indoor microclimate, intensive working time, and aerosol-generating procedures in specific areas of the processing plant where more positive cases have been detected. The analysis of this cluster may suggest specific actions to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.","165":"Systematic reviews have shown a prevalence close to 20% of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients, with nearly 40% of patients shedding viral RNA in their faeces, even if it may not be infectious, possibly because of inactivation by colonic fluid.According to current evidence, this virus is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and contact routes, including contaminated surfaces. The virus is quite stable on stainless steel, being detected up to 48-72 hours after application. Therefore, some individuals can be infected touching common contaminated surfaces, such as bathroom taps. Taps can be underestimated critical points in the transmission chain of the infection. Indeed, just by turning the knob, people leave germs on it, especially after coughing over their hands, sneezing, and\/or blowing their nose. After handwashing with soap, user take back their germs when turning the knob. Paradoxically, the following user collects the germs back on his\/her fingers by implementing a preventive measure, maybe before putting food into the mouth or wearing contact lenses.The Italian National Institute of Health recommends to clean and disinfect high-touched surfaces, but it is unrealistic and inefficient to do so after each tap use. As an alternative, new toilets should install long elbow-levers - or at least short levers - provided that people are educated to close them with the forearm or the side of the hand. This is already a standard measure in hospitals, but it is particularly important also in high-risk communities, such as retirement homes and prisons. It would be important also in schools, in workplaces, and even in families, contributing to the prevention both of orofaecal and respiratory infections.In the meantime, people should be educated to close existing knobs with disposable paper towel wipes or with toilet paper sheets.","166":"to study the cumulative incidence, the demographics and health conditions of the population tested for COVID-19, and to map the evolving distribution of individual cases in the population of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy). population-based observational study based on a record linkage procedure of databases included in the electronic health information system of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. the study group consisted of individuals who resided in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and who underwent COVID-19 testing from 01.03 to 24.04.2020. The study group was identified from the laboratory database, which contains all the microbiological testing performed in regional facilities. Tested people were categorized into positive or negative cases, based on test results. probability of being tested for and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. the cumulative probability of being tested for COVID-19 was 278\/10,000 inhabitants, while the cumulative incidence was 22 cases\/10,000. Out of 33,853 tested people, 2,744 (8.1%) turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Women were tested more often than men (337 vs 216\/10,000), and they showed a higher incidence of infection than men (25 and 19 infected cases\/10,000 residents, respectively). Both cumulative incidence and cumulative probability of being tested were higher in the elderly population. About 25% of infected people was hosted in retirement homes and 9% was represented by healthcare workers. Thirty seven percent of positive cases had hypertension, 15% cardiologic diseases, while diabetes and cancer characterized 11.7% and 10% of the infected population, respectively. The geographic distribution of positive cases showed a faster spread of the infection in the city of Trieste, an urban area with the highest regional population density. the COVID-19 pandemic did not hit the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region as hard as other Northern Italian Regions. In the early phase, as documented in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic particularly affected women and elderly people, especially those living in retirement homes in Trieste. ","167":"to evaluate the effects of a pre-existing condition of diabetes and of the use of antidiabetic drugs in the Sicilian population on different outcomes of the COVID-19 disease. a retrospective observational study based was used. Data deriving from the COVID-19 epidemic surveillance and from the collection of information on drugs consume by Sicilian residents. due to the data availability, the study was calibrated on the Region and included all population distinguishing by gender and age groups. the risks of cumulative incidence for COVID-19 were investigated in people who had diabetes comorbidities to incur a hospitalization for COVID-19, to be treated within an intensive care unit, and lethality. The role of previous antidiabetic drug treatments with respect to each study outcome was also investigated. in Sicily, from 01.03.2020 to 26.06.2020, a number of 172 cases of COVID-19 disease with diabetes comorbidity were diagnosed. The data did not show any difference in the cumulative incidence for COVID-19 between diabetics (64.2\/100,000 inhabitants) and non-diabetics (56.9\/100,000 inhabitants) patients. Diabetes increases the risk of hospitalization in the under 80 in both men and women (men: OR 2.62; women OR 4.31), for treatment in intensive care (men: OR 4,41; women: OR 7.74), and for death (men: OR 5.21; women OR 5.92).

Diabetes does not seem to represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sicily, while previous diabetes condition seems to determine greater risk of hospitalization, treatment in intensive care, and lethality among over 80. There are also gender differences with almost double risks in women for hospitalization and intensive care only. Among the antidiabetic drugs investigated, there was a risk for hospitalization and intensive care while protective for deaths.

The risk factors reported are several, including age, being male, and some chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. However, the relative importance of chronic diseases is still to be explored. to evaluate the role of chronic diseases on the risk to develop clinically evident (at least mild symptomatic) forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the LHU Toscana Centro. case-population study. 'case' is a subject with SARS-CoV-2 positive swab with at least mild clinical status, who lives in the LHU Toscana Centro area; 'controls' are all people residing in the LHU Toscana Centro area at 1 January 2020. People aged under 30 and patients living in nursing care homes are excluded from the analysis. the analysis assesses the effect of gender, age, neoplasm, and the main chronic diseases on the onset of an infection with at least mild symptoms by calculating odds ratios (OR) by multivariate logistic regression models (to produce adjusted OR by potential confounders). among the 1,840 cases, compared to the general population, the presence of males and over-60-year-old people is greater. Almost all the considered chronic diseases are more frequent among the cases, compared to the general population. A chronic patient has a 68% greater risk to be positive with at least mild symptoms. Many of the considered diseases show an effect on the risk of getting COVID-19 in a symptomatic form, which remains even adjusting by other comorbidities. The main ones include heart failure, psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, and rheumatic diseases. these results confirm evidence already shown in other studies on COVID-19 patients and add information on the chronic diseases attributable risk in the population, referred to the symptomatic forms and adjusted by age, gender or the possible copresence of more diseases. These risk estimates should guide prevention interventions by health services in order to protect the chronic patients affected by the pathologies most at risk. ","169":"the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in WHO European Region was reported at the end of January 2020 and, from that moment, the epidemic has been speeding up and rapidly spreading across Europe. The health, social, and economic consequences of the pandemic are difficult to evaluate, since there are many scientific uncertainties and unknowns. the main focus of this paper is on statistical methods for profiling municipalities by excess mortality, directly or indirectly caused by COVID-19. the use of excess mortality for all causes has been advocated as a measure of impact less vulnerable to biases. In this paper, observed mortality for all causes at municipality level in Italy in the period January-April 2020 was compared to the mortality observed in the corresponding period in the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Mortality data were made available by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Italian National Resident Population Demographic Archive and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat). For each municipality, the posterior predictive distribution under a hierarchical null model was obtained. From the posterior predictive distribution, we obtained excess death counts, attributable community rates and q-values. Full Bayesian models implemented via MCMC simulations were used. absolute number of excess deaths highlights the burden paid by major cities to the pandemic. The Attributable Community Rate provides a detailed picture of the spread of the pandemic among the municipalities of Lombardy, Piedmont, and Emilia-Romagna Regions. Using Q-values, it is clearly recognizable evidence of an excess of mortality from late February to April 2020 in a very geographically scattered number of municipalities. A trade-off between false discoveries and false non-discoveries shows the different values of public health actions. despite the variety of approaches to calculate excess mortality, this study provides an original methodological approach to profile municipalities with excess deaths accounting for spatial and temporal uncertainty.

The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models. during the outbreak peak, the nine provinces of the Emilia-Romagna Region were unequally hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, with Piacenza recording the highest COVID-19 absolute death toll and Ferrara the lowest. The overall and COVID-19 mortality burden was unequal also in terms of ecological socioeconomic measures. Percentage differences in the age-standardised mortality rates between the least and the most disadvantaged census blocks were greater for COVID-19 mortality than for overall mortality, suggesting that the Coronavirus outbreak has had a stronger impact on the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Although clear gradients were not always present, people living in the most disadvantaged census blocks experienced the highest absolute and relative risk of dying. Rate differences were larger among men, but mortality rate ratios were not always greater among men than women, especially for the COVID-19 mortality. these descriptive yet informative results are relevant to document inequalities and inform regional public health policies and interventions in case of new COVID-19 surges.

Most of the provinces that appeared at least once in the highest-risk group are neighbouring provinces in the Northern Regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Marche (in central Italy), where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. Temporally, most of these provinces remained in the highest-risk group for 4 or 5 weeks; those that entered the group later, improved faster. The overall RR curves for groups differed in magnitude, but also in the shape, which varied markedly also between men and women and, most importantly, in the highest-risk group. this study gives timely re-analysis of the Istat data at weekly level and provides a classification of the geographical and temporal characteristics of the excess mortality in the Italian provinces during the COVID-19 epidemics. As expected, the used clustering method groups the provinces that have similar RR values in the two gender-specific curves.

The data refer to the first four months of 2015-2019 and 2020, involving 7,270 municipalities, corresponding to 93% of the Italian population. the mortality rates in the first four months of 2015-2019 and 2020, age-adjusted, have been calculated together with the percent variation. The data were analysed by gender, age class (&lt;65; &gt;=65 years), Region, and geographical areas (Northern versus Central-Southern Italy). The overall daily mortality series have been represented as rates over 100,000 resident population. in addition to the geographical location, the age component was a major determinant of the mortality pattern. The greater increase in the overall mortality was evidenced among elderly subjects in the Northern Italian Regions most affected by the epidemic. In these areas, also gender component played an important role in determining the mortality excess: higher mortality rates in the first four months of 2020 are observed for males in comparison to female populations. this research reveals that the population components are an important issue in determining the COVID-19 mortality excess. For this reason, it is of primary importance to monitor mortality (overall and by COVID-19) by age and gender and to consider these components and the related factors (comorbidity, exposures affecting the lung) in the public prevention policies towards the protection of the most fragile population groups.

To describe the case fatality of COVID-19, we performed a record linkage with a database specially constructed during the epidemic to identify deaths that occurred in confirmed cases. mortality and excess mortality were analysed by comparing the number of observed deaths in the first 4 months of 2020 with the average deaths of the years 2016-2019 in the same calendar period and with expected deaths, estimated using a Poisson model. Furthermore, a measure of relative risk was calculated as observed\/expected ratio with a 95% confidence interval. the increase in mortality for all causes occurring in the study population in the first 4 months of 2020 was 48.8%, 30.8% for ages between 60 and 69, 43.9% for ages between 70 and 79, and 56.7% for subjects above 80 years of age. Focusing on the epidemic period, from 1 March to 30 April, the excess is quantifiable as more than 2-fold and mainly concerns the population over 60 years of age. The excess mortality was observed in all local health units (ASSTs). The highest increments were in the province of Lodi and the North-East of Milan (ASST Nord). In the ASSTs of Lodi and Melegnano-Martesana the mortality excess was detectable from March 15th, while for the other ASSTs the increase began in the first week of April. evaluation of overall mortality in the provinces of Milan and Lodi during the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic showed a significant excess compared to the first 4 months of the years 2016-2019, mainly in the population over 60 years of age.

The portion of excess mortality explained by COVID-19 decreases with age, decreasing to 51% among the very old (&gt;=85 years). In phase 2 (until June 2020), the impact was more contained and totally attributable to COVID-19 deaths and this suggests an effectiveness of social distancing measures. mortality surveillance is a sensible information basis for the monitoring of health impact of the different phases of the epidemic and supporting decision making at the local and national level on containment measures to put in place in coming months.

Regional hospital admissions and deaths without hospital admissions up to June 1st, 2020 were analysed. Determinants of the probability of a highly severe illness were investigated in terms of hospitalisations or death without hospital admission. COVID-19 patients were identified from regional epidemiological data warehouse. Demographical and clinical variables such as gender, age, patient's comorbidities, vaccinations, ARBs\/sartans prescriptions, and geographical residence variables were collected by linking different databases. Descriptive analyses were performed. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate the probability of hospitalisation or death, whichever came first. Model coefficients and odds ratios (OR) were reported. COVID-19 population in FVG had a mean age of 60 years and 59% were females. The study found that 37% had hypertension while patients with cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and cancer were around 15%; 22% of the cases were residing in retirement homes. Approximately 30% received flu or pneumococcal vaccination and a similar proportion of patients had at least one prescription of ARBs \/sartans in the previous 6 months. Statistical models showed a higher probability of a worst course of disease for males, elderly, highly complicated (in terms of resource use) subjects, in the presence of cardiologic diseases, diabetes, and pneumococcal vaccination. People living in retirement homes had a lower probability of hospitalisation\/death without hospital admission. The cohort was divided into two groups: COVID-19 patients infected in the territory and infected in retirement homes. Among COVID-19 patients infected in the territory, the probability of hospitalisation\/death was higher for males, for older individuals, and for those with comorbidities. Diabetes resulted to be a risk factor (OR 1.79; 95%CI 1.23-2.62), as well as pneumococcal vaccination (OR 1.64; 95%CI: 1.18-2.29), which is a likely proxy of fragile patients with pulmonary disease. The flu vaccination showed a potential protective effect with a 40% lower probability of hospitalisation or death (OR 0.62; 95%CI 0.44-0.85). Among the retirement homes cohort group, a higher probability of a bad course of disease emerged for males and for more complex patients. the greatest risk of hospitalisation\/death as a measure of more severe illness was confirmed for males, elderly, and for individuals with comorbidities. Flu vaccination seemed to have had a protective effect while pneumococcal vaccination likely identified a group of high-risk patients to be actively monitored.

Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time. comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort. for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods. discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models. age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED. the results of this study suggest that in few weeks of COVID-19 epidemic both management of the patients at the hospital level - and probably at territorial level resulting in a different population who accessed to the ED - and the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients changed. ","180":null,"181":"facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. to analyse the performance of a screening strategy proposed by the local government of Tuscany (Central Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. a simulation study is conducted to investigate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500,000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity 0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11,167 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1,132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Resources and false negatives increase with the prevalence. the analysed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low. The cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic, accounting for the fact that it may change over time. ","182":"since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of developing a serological test has emerged and a debate on test accuracy and reliability become an issue widely discussed in the media. The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation. to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value. the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test. at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial. the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions. ","183":"As the Coronavirus situation (COVID-19) continues to evolve, many questions concerning the factors relating to the diffusion and severity of the disease remain unanswered.Whilst opinions regarding the weight of evidence for these risk factors, and the studies published so far are often inconclusive or offer contrasting results, the role of comorbidities in the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients affected with COVID-19 appears to be evident since the outset. Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are under discussion as important factors affecting the severity of disease. Air pollution has been considered to play a role in the diffusion of the virus, in the propagation of the contagion, in the severity of symptoms, and in the poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that environmental particulate matter (PM) can trigger inflammatory responses at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, sustaining respiratory, cardiovascular, and dysmetabolic diseases.To better understand the intricate relationships among pre-existing conditions, PM, and viral infection, we examined the response at the molecular level of T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells exposed to different fractions of PM. T47D cells express several receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and ACE2, the main - but not the only - receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.PM samples were collected in an urban background site located in the Northern area of the City of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) during winter 2013. T47D cells were exposed to organic or aqueous (inorganic) extracts at the final concentration of 8 m3 for a 4-hour duration. Both the concentration and the exposure time were chosen to resemble an average outdoor exposure. RNA was extracted from cells, purified and hybridised on 66k microarray slides from Agilent.The lists of differentially expressed genes in PM organic extracts were evaluated by using Metacore, and an enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways maps, process networks, and disease by biomarkers altered after T47D treatment.The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in dysmetabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and hypertension through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) canonical pathway.On the basis of current knowledge, existing data, and exploratory experimental evidence, we tease out the likely molecular interplay that can ultimately tip the disease outcome into severity. Looking beyond ACE2, several additional key markers are identified. Disruption of these targets worsens pre-existing conditions and\/or exacerbates the adverse effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst appropriately designed, epidemiological studies are very much needed to investigate these associations based on our hypothesis of investigation, by reviewing recent experimental and epidemiological evidence, here we speculate and provide new insights on the possible role of environmental pollution in the exacerbation of effects by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

Therefore, there is a need for a homogeneous and applicable exposure assessment tool throughout the country.Experiences of high spatio-temporal resolution models for Italian territory already exist for PM estimation, using space-time predictors, satellite data, air quality monitoring data.This work completes the availability of these estimations for the most recent years (2016-2019) and is also applied to nitrogen oxides and ozone. The spatial resolution is 1x1 km.The model confirms its capability of capturing most of PM variability (R2=0.78 and 0.74 for PM10 e PM2.5, respectively), and provides reliable estimates also for ozone (R2=0.76); for NO2 the model performance is lower (R2=0.57). The model estimations were used to calculate the PWE (population-weighted exposure) as the annual mean, weighted on the resident population in each individual cell, which represents the estimation of the Italian population's chronic exposure to air pollution.These estimates are ready to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.","185":"The determinants of the risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2, contracting COVID-19, and being affected by the more serious forms of the disease have been generally explored in merely qualitative terms. It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.","186":"one of the most affected European countries by the COVID-19 epidemic is Italy; data show the strong geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic. to propose an analysis strategy to ascertain the non-random nature of the spatial spread of COVID-19 cases infection and identify any territorial aggregations, in order to enhance contact tracing activities in specific areas of the Lazio Region (Central Italy) and a large urban area as Rome. all cases of COVID-19 of the Lazio Region notified to the Regional Service for Epidemiology, Surveillance, and Control of Infectious Diseases (Seresmi) with daily updates from the beginning of the epidemic to April 27, 2020 were considered. The analyses were carried out considering two periods (the first from the beginning of the epidemic to April 6 and the second from the beginning of the epidemic to April 27) and two different levels of spatial aggregation: the entire Lazio region excluding the Municipality of Rome, where the 377 municipalities represent the area units, and the Municipality of Rome, where the area units under study are the 155 urban areas (ZUR). The Scan statistic of Kulldorff was used to ascertain the non-random nature of the spatial spread of infected cases and to identify any territorial aggregations of cases of COVID-19 infection, using a retrospective spatial analysis in two overlapping periods. analysis was conducted at regional level in the two survey periods and revealed the presence of 7 localized clusters. In the Municipality of Rome, a single cluster (Historic Centre) was identified in the first period which includes 7 urban areas, while in the second period two distinct clusters (Omo and Farnesina) were observed. Scan statistics are an important surveillance tool for monitoring disease outbreaks during the active phase of the epidemic and a useful contribution to epidemiological surveillance during the COVID-19 epidemic in a specific territory. ","187":"to describe the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on undetected cases and to evaluate different post-lockdown scenarios. the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions. Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection, determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one. mathematical models can provide useful insights for healthcare decision makers to determine the best strategy in case of future outbreaks. ","188":"to investigate the role of gender, age, province of residence, and nursing home residency on the risk of death for residents in the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) Region (Northern Italy) tested positive for Covid-19, considering recovery as a competing event. The secondary objective is to describe the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic in FVG and in the Regions of Northern and Central Italy in terms of incidence and mortality compared to the national data. retrospective cohort study. resident population in FVG in the period between 29 February and 25 June 2020. in order to describe the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in FVG, in terms of incidence and mortality compared to the national data, the standardized incidence (SIR) and mortality (SMR) ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated compared to the Italian population for the northern and central Regions of Italy and the autonomous Provinces (PA) of Trento and Bolzano. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on subjects residing in FVG to whom at least one naso-oropharyngeal swab (hereafter, named swab) resulted positive for Covid-19. For each subject included in the cohort, the observation period started with the first positive swab and ended with the first of the following events: death, recovery or censored, which means that at the end of the observation period the subject was still alive and positive. The cause of death was assigned to Covid-19 if a subject had not yet recovered at the time when the event occurred. Cohort members were considered recovered after two negative consecutive swabs. The sub-hazard ratio (SHR) was estimated by applying the regression model of competing risks by Fine and Gray, in which the event of interest was the death caused by Covid-19 and the competing event was recovery. The explanatory variables included in the multiple models are: gender, age at the beginning of the observation period, the Province of residence, and nursing home residency. The cause-specific hazard was estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. during the observation period, 3,305 cases and 345 deaths were recorded in FVG; SIR and SMR resulted, respectively, equal to 0.64 (95%CI 0.61-0.68) and 0.43 (95%CI 0.37-0.50). The FVG was the Northern Region one with the lowest incidence and mortality. The cohort consisted of 3,121 residents in FVG with at least one swab with a positive Covid-19 result during the study period. The SHR of dying for Covid-19 is equal to 16.13 (95%CI 9.73-26.74) for people with age 70-79 years and 35.58 (95%CI 21.77-58.15) with age &gt;=80 years respect those with age &lt;70 years. It is higher in males (SHR 1.71; 95%CI 1.34-2.17). There is no evidence that being resident in a nursing home affects the SHR (SHR 0.91 and 95%CI 0.69-1.20). As regards the province as an explanatory variable, the sub-hazard of death in the province of Trieste appears to overlap to the sub-hazard of Pordenone used as a reference; for the provinces of Udine and Gorizia the sub-hazards seem lower than the reference. while other Northern Regions and autonomous Provinces show higher standardized incidence and mortality compared with Italy, FVG and Veneto do not. In FVG, male gender and age are important determinants of death while there is no evidence that the condition of guest in a nursing home increases the sub-hazard of death. ","189":"about two months after the end of the lockdown imposed for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the contagion dynamics in the Tuscany Region (Central Italy) have been assessed from the beginning of the emergency to the end of June through a compartmental model, and future medium-long term projections have been produced. this study used a SIRD model in which the infection reproduction number R0 varied over time, according to a piecewise constant function. The fatality parameter and the time from contagion to infection resolution (death or recovery) were fixed to ensure parameter identifiability, and the model was calibrated on the Covid-19 deaths notified from March 9th to June 30th 2020. The uncertainty around the estimates was quantified through parametric bootstrap. Finally, the resulting model was used to produce medium-long term projections of the epidemic dynamics. the date of the first infection in Tuscany was estimated as February 21st 2020. The value of R0(t) ranged from 7.78 (95%CI 7.55-7.89), at the beginning of the outbreak, to a value very close to 0 between April 27th and May 17th. Finally, R0(t) rose, reaching an average of 0.66 (0.32, 0.88) between May 18th and June 30th. At the epidemic peak, estimated at the beginning of April, the notified infected people circulating in the region were just 22% of those predicted by the model. According to the estimated SIRD, under the hypothetical scenario that R0(t) slightly exceeds 1 from the beginning of October 2020, a new wave of contagion could arise by next spring. the estimated trend of R0(t) is suggestive of a strong effect of the lockdown in Tuscany and of a mild increase of the contagion potentially attributable to the easing of the containment measures. Medium-long term projections unequivocally indicate that the danger of a new epidemic wave has not been averted. ","190":"ethics committees (ECs) protect the rights, safety, and well-being of research participants and ensure the scientific correctness of clinical research. COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown from 9 March to 16 May 2020 have potentially influenced several activities, including ECs. to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on Italian ECs and their performance during the lockdown. cross-sectional survey. the survey was conducted in mid-June 2020 in Italy contacting all the 90 local ECs. amount and kind of activities performed during the lockdown, characteristics of submitted studies and adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications during the pandemic. Chi-square test was used to estimate the differences between territories with higher incidence (HI) and lower incidence (LI) of COVID-19. 258 questionnaires were collected from 46 ECs that participated in the study. Ten were excluded due to missing substantial data. Responses were divided into two groups according to location of EC: the HI (125 responses) and the LI (123 responses). Seventy-five percent of the HI describe an increase in the number of studies submitted, while 53% of the LI does not (p=0.001). Due to the pandemic and its effects on research, the 15% of participants belonging to HI territories reported that consideration and respect of research-related and general ethical principles could have decreased, as well the adoption of standard protocols of evaluation of research applications. EC secretariats located in HI Regions moved to smart working more than in LI ones (75% vs 59%; p=0.001). Where the EC workload increased significantly, it was reported that it was impossible to perform an accurate analysis of the submitted documentation, with the effect of providing a favorable opinion to studies of not excellent quality, though always ensuring the respect of ethical principles and patients' safety. COVID-19 impact on ECs has been heavier in HI territories, but smart working has been effective in ensuring EC activities and the subsequent activation of clinical studies potentially useful to face the pandemic. Clear differences arise between ECs belonging to the Italian Regions that have recorded a HI of COVID-19 cases compared to those located in Regions with a LI of cases. In some EC members' perception, the high number of studies in the most affected Regions together with the emergency experienced during the lockdown may have exposed ECs to the risk of decreasing the adoption of ethical principles and standard protocols of evaluation of research applications.

The cumulative weekly rate of client reports which were not already known as probable or confirmed cases (per 1,000 population) ranges from 3.54 to 6.84 cases in the 12th and 16th week, respectively. Among the 4,270 reports, 1,471 patients considered possible COVID-19 cases were identified due to the presence of ILI symptoms, even in the absence of a swab or a positive history for close contact with COVID-19 case. From the epidemiological investigation into the 1,471 possible cases, 2,514 close contacts were identified and quarantined at home. Of the 2,514 close contacts, 127 (5.05%) people developed symptoms during quarantine. the integration among primary care, GPs and FPS, and the Department of Prevention could be an element of success in the management of the COVID-19 emergency and in the return to a normal phase.

As a negative consequence of the COVID-19 epidemic, the activities of the project have suddenly slowed down; nevertheless, the COVID-19 epidemic represented an opportunity to apply the A&amp;F methodology and support the healthcare within the regional authorities in order to manage and monitor the impact of this new disease. The reaction to the crisis on behalf of EASY-NET was inconsistent across the participating regions for various reasons. Factors which influenced the reaction levels in relation to the rapidity and efficiency of the implementation of the A&amp;F strategies were as follows: the varying epidemiological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic in the various territories, the different clinical and organizational context and availability of expert research teams together with A&amp;F procedures which had already been tested before the start of the epidemic.","194":"This paper aims to describe the Italian obstetric surveillance system (ItOSS) preparedness as an element for a timely response to the new Coronavirus pandemic. ItOSS is a surveillance network that has been collecting data on maternal mortality and conducting population studies on obstetric near misses since 2013. At the beginning of the pandemic, ItOSS launched a new population-based project to monitor SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and post-partum and promptly give back information useful to clinicians and decision-makers. All the regions and autonomous provinces, for a total of 289 birth units (PN), joined the study. Data relating to pregnant or post-partum women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis addressing the maternities for outpatient visits or hospitalization were collected. The project methodology entails that each participating maternity reports the cases to ItOSS uploading data through an open-source platform. The on-line form includes sociodemographic and clinical data and maternal-neonatal outcomes. Biological samples to detect possible vertical transmission are also collected voluntarily. A total of 534 incident cases were reported from February 25th to July 10th 2020; 7 regions also collected biological samples for 227 cases; data collection is still ongoing.A preliminary analysis of the first 146 SARS-CoV-2 positive women who gave birth between February 25th to April 22nd shows an incidence rate of the infection equal to 2.1\/1,000 in Italy and 6.9\/1,000 in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). The brief time needed to setting up and operating the project, the national coverage, the adoption of shared tools for data collection, the quality and completeness of the information collected show how the availability of active networks like ItOSS represents a crucial element to hold a high level of preparedness in case of a health emergency.","195":"to describe the integrated surveillance system of COVID-19 in Italy, to illustrate the outputs used to return epidemiological information on the spread of the epidemic to the competent public health bodies and to the Italian population, and to describe how the surveillance data contributes to the ongoing weekly regional monitoring and risk assessment system. the COVID-19 integrated surveillance system is the result of a close and continuous collaboration between the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), the Italian Ministry of Health, and the regional and local health authorities. Through a web platform, it collects individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and gathers information on their residence, laboratory diagnosis, hospitalisation, clinical status, risk factors, and outcome. Results, for different levels of aggregation and risk categories, are published daily and weekly on the ISS website, and made available to national and regional public health authorities; these results contribute one of the information sources of the regional monitoring and risk assessment system. the COVID-19 integrated surveillance system monitors the space-time distribution of cases and their characteristics. Indicators used in the weekly regional monitoring and risk assessment system include process indicators on completeness and results indicators on weekly trends of newly diagnosed cases per Region. the outputs of the integrated surveillance system for COVID-19 provide timely information to health authorities and to the general population on the evolution of the epidemic in Italy.

","196":null,"197":null,"198":"The article compares two of the most followed indices in the monitoring of COVID-19 epidemic cases: the Rt and the RDt indices. The first was disseminated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the second, which is more usable due to the lower difficulty of calculation and the availability of data, was adopted by various regional and local institutions.The rationale for the Rt index refers to that for the R0 index, the basic reproduction number, which is used by infectivologists as a measure of contagiousness of a given infectious agent in a completely susceptible population. The RDt index, on the other hand, is borrowed from the techniques of time series analysis for the trend of an event measurement that develops as a function of time. The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population.The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects.The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices. The maximum correlation between Rt and RDt is reached at lag 7 with a value of R exceeding 0.97 (R2=0.944).The two indices, albeit formally distinct, are both valid; they show specific aspects of the phenomenon, but provide basically similar information to the public health decision-maker. Their distinction lies not so much in the method of calculation, rather in the use of different information, i.e., the beginning of symptoms and the swabs outcome.Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a judgment of preference for one of the two indices, but only to invite people to understand their different potentials so that they can choose the one they consider the most appropriate for the purpose they want to use it for.","199":"the ability to implement effective preventive and control measures is rooted in public health surveillance to promptly identify and isolate contagious patients. to describe some organizational aspects and resources involved in the control of COVID-19 pandemic. observational cross sectional study. a survey of methods and tools adopted by the competent service (Prevention department) in the Local public health units (LHU) of the regional Health services has been performed in May 2020. The survey collected data related to activities carried out during the month of April 2020 on the surveillance system for collection of suspected cases, their virological ascertainment, the isolation procedures and contact-tracing activities by means of an online questionnaire filled in by the public health structure of the regional health system. A convenience sample of Prevention departments was recruited. in 44 Prevention departments of 14 Regions\/Autonomous Provinces (caring for 40% of the population residing in Italy), different services were swiftly engaged in pandemic response. Reports of suspected cases were about 3 times the number of confirmed cases in the same month. Local reporting form was used in 46% of the LHUs while a regional form was available in 42% of the Departments (in 9\/14 Regions). In one fourth the forms were not always used and 2% had no forms for the reporting of suspected cases. Data were recorded in 52% of LHUs on local databases, while in 20% a regional database (in 7 Regions) had been created. A proportion of 11% did not record the data for further elaboration.

In 7% LHUs only positive specimens were recorded electronically. Local files were used in 27% LHUs. The interview with confirmed cases was carried out with a local questionnaire in 52% LHUs, while 14% stated that a standardized form was not used. The data collected about cases were recorded on a regional IT platform in 30% Departments (in 8 Regions) and in 41% data were registered only locally. For each confirmed case in April, a median of 4 contacts were identified. Only 13 (30%) Departments in 9 Regions have registered contact data on a regional database. Ten Departments (23%) have only hard copies, while 56% recorded data on local databases.

Several different tools (forms and electronic files) have been developed in each LHU and used for the same surveillance operational processes with a loss in local efficiency.

The highest gain (2.6 years) was attributable to the reduction of mortality for CVS, followed by TUM (males: 1.42 vs females: 0.83) and RESP (males: 0.4 vs females: 0.1). The causes responsible for the loss of LE were INF (females: -0.16 vs males: -0.07) and lung cancer in females (-0.13). the prompt treatment of acute CVS events and prevention (both primary and secondary) are responsible for the gain in LE. The reduction of mortality for TUM can be attributed to the evolution of diagnostic-therapeutic possibilities, but also to the implementation of the cancer screening programmes. Lung cancer was responsible for the loss of LE in Tuscan females; the targeted anti-smoke campaigns should, therefore, be intensified.

Smoking while driving a car in presence of minors decreased with increasing age (p=0.004) and education level (p=0.029) and was more frequent in Southern than in Northern Italy (OR 4.40; 95%CI 2.21-8.74). In 2017-2018, 16.2% of non-smokers reported being exposed to SHS in cars. Of these, 42.3% were exposed also in presence of minors. the tobacco control legislations adopted over the last 15 years, in particular the last one adopted in 2016, have largely contributed in reducing smoking in private vehicles, even in the presence of minors. This notwithstanding, 50% of Italian smokers smoke while driving and more than 15% of non-smokers are exposed to SHS in cars.

In the years 1974-1991, the incinerator burned hazardous chlorine-containing waste that resulted in the emission of dioxins. After 1991, it was exclusively fed with organic synthetic products not containing chlorine. the aim of this case-control study was to estimate the STS risk, for 1999-2014, in the population living in four Mantua districts located in the proximity of the industrial incinerator, compared to subjects resident in the remaining parts of Mantua province, regarded as non-exposed. the cases analysed were subjects with a first-incident diagnosis of STS between 1999 and 2014 resident at diagnosis in Mantua Province. Cases were selected using the 2013 criteria from the WHO classification. Cases of Kaposi sarcoma, PEComas and STS occurring in a previously irradiated field were excluded. For each case of soft-tissue sarcoma, four controls were randomly selected from all individuals resident in Mantua Province included in the Regional Health Service database in the years of incidence of each case (calendar year), and individually matched for gender and year of birth. Residential and occupational history (for employment in an oil refinery, and petrochemical and chemical plants) was reconstructed for all study subjects (cases and controls) since 1961. Subjects were considered exposed if they had lived in the four Mantua districts most affected by the incinerator emissions, on the basis of an atmospheric dispersion model and a dioxins biomonitoring survey. Four analyses were performed according to variously defined residential time windows. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated using conditional regression models adjusted for occupational history. 391 cases (203 males and 188 females) and 1,564 controls were included. The number of exposed cases and controls in the four analyses were 8 and 55, 8 and 60, 15 and 68, and 15 and 73, respectively. An increased STS risk was not observed in any of the analyses. in this study, no increased risk of STS was observed in subjects who had lived, in the study's time window, in the Mantua districts most affected by the incinerator emissions. The most likely interpretation of the present finding is a real STS risk reduction for subjects resident in the most recent decades in the Mantua districts most affected by the incinerator emissions, due to the cessation of burning chlorine-containing waste in the incinerator, development of some remediation plans, and implementation of new industrial procedures.

On the contrary, adults from low migratory pressure Countries show higher avoidable hospitalisation rates compared to Italians in every cohort, with the exception of Rome (RR 0.81; 95%CI 0.78-0.85), with RR ranging from 1.08 (95%CI 0.96-1.22) in Venice to 1.64 (95%CI 1.47-1.83) in Modena. Maternal and child health is the most critical area of health for immigrant population. Considering the importance that the issue of health equity has taken on in the political agenda, the data presented in this volume are a great asset, particularly in light of the long recession and the social crisis that have impacted the Country. ","260":"This paper aims to present useful elements for framing the issue of exposure to radio frequencies (RFs), in particular those related to telecommunications, and the possible effects on health also in the light of the rapid evolution of technologies (the advent of 5G). New developments in the field oblige us to reflect on the possible implications in terms of public health. Here, we have preferred to take stock and not to demand a systematic review. The development of telecommunications is creating great interest in all sectors for the possibility of new applications, but is also increasing concern for the effects on health not yet fully known, to the point that there is a growing mobilization against the introduction of 5G both at national and at international level. Epidemiological studies and metanalyses on the relationship between cancer and RFs, particularly those on mobile phones, still identify areas of uncertainty that need to be investigated, and studies on non-cancer effects are growing in number, suggesting the possibility of new risks. The relative scenarios that will open with the 5G trial are likely to change the overall exposure level of the population as a result of major changes in the network architecture. Therefore, it is important to adopt a strongly precautionary approach. Given the strong concerns of the population, the competent institutions should implement information and awareness programmes through adequate risk communication.","261":"to evaluate equity in the Lazio regional Health System, both in terms of unequal access to health care among individuals with different educational levels and of heterogeneity in hospital performance, between 2012 and 2017. retrospective cohort study. all patients living in Lazio region and discharged from a regional facility between 2012 and 2017 were enrolled. Three cohorts of hospitalizations were selected: acute myocardial infarctions with ST segment elevation (STEMI), hip fractures, and deliveries. the proportions of STEMIs with PCI within 90 minutes, of patients with a hip fracture who underwent surgery within 2 days, and of deliveries with primary caesarean section were evaluated, accounting for patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcome under study. These proportions were calculated by education and by hospital of admission. The heterogeneity among facilities was assessed through the median odds ratio (MOR). in Lazio region, between 2012 and 2017, an improvement of the quality of care was observed: in 2017, 50.4% of STEMI patients underwent to a PCI within 90 minutes, 54.4% of patients with a hip fracture underwent surgery within 2 days, and 26.2% of women had a C-section. In 2012, when comparing the adjusted proportions of outcomes by educational level, the probability of being treated with a PCI within 90 minutes for STEMIs and with surgery within 2 days for hip fractures was higher for graduated patients than for those with the lowest education. In contrast, graduated women had the highest risk of having a C-section. In 2017, there was no difference anymore between classes of education in STEMIs and C-sections, while in patients with hip fracture the difference was decreased, but still present. For hip fractures, a reduction of heterogeneity of hospital performances was also detected. in Lazio region, a reduction in inequalities in access to health care was observed for different clinical areas. The \"public disclosure\" of the PReValE results and the management strategy applied in mid-2013 could have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the conditions under study, helping to achieve a fairer access to health. ","262":"the Italian National Prevention Plan (PNP) posed the standard to be achieved by Italian Regions for the implementation of cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening: to invite all of the target populations and to increase the screening uptake up to 50%, 60%, and 50%, respectively, the standard defined by the Essential Levels of Care (LEA). Moreover, for cervical cancer screening, it requires the implementation of HPV-DNA test and, for breast cancer screening, the PNP demands for the definition of diagnostic and follow up pathways for high familial risk women. The PNP also set up a monitoring system to assess the impact of implemented policies. A conceptual model has been defined to facilitate interpretation of variation in outcome indicators. after a systematic review, the DPSEEA (Driving forces, Pressure, State, Exposure, Effect, Actions) was identified as the more appropriate framework to assess the results of preventive policies. Factors for each component of the model were identified and indicators that allow measuring the changing of each of these factors were defined. among the \"driving forces\", the trust in the health care system and the social capital were included. The presence of opportunistic screening, the competing private clinical activity, the commitment of General Practitioners and \"medical\" leaders, the attitude to cooperation and to patients' involvement, and the level of agreement between the positions of scientific societies and the recommendations implemented in organized screening programmes were included in the \"pressures\". In \"state\", the availability of technological and human resources, the level of management skills and of accessibility were identified. The \"exposure\" was defined as the coverage of active invitation of the target population and the uptake of screening tests. The \"exposure\" factors influence the \"effect\", described as the impact on anticipation of cancer diagnosis, on disease incidence (for cervical and colorectal cancer) and prognosis. The changing in screening programs performance modifies the impact of invitation coverage and test uptake (\"exposure\"). through the DPSEEA framework, we set up a logical conceptual model, which includes implementable actions and the mechanisms through which these actions should impact on the \"exposure\" (invitation coverage and screening uptake) and on the screening performance (quality). ","263":"the Italian health policies awareness on health inequalities (HI) issues is increasing. The National Plan for health prevention and promotion (2014-2018) (PNP) introduced in 2014 a clear political commitment aimed at reducing HI. During 2015, each Italian regions (IRs) elaborated and approved by law its prevention plan (PRP), according to the PNP. To support this process, a factsheet describing educational inequalities (EIs) in the exposure to risk factors (RFs) was provided with training for many IRs. an evaluation of the 21 PRPs was performed to assess the level of adherence to the national direction and to investigate the impact of the availability of regional health inequalities data. a checklist for the evaluation of the PRP was developed and discussed with experts. Frequency of success was calculated for each dimension investigated in the 21 PRPs. An overall score assessing the regional level of adherence to the national recommendation was computed. 21 PRPs and 194 programmes were assessed. 13 PRPs considered the need to address HIs and 8 declared to have used quantitative information on HIs for priority setting; 8 PRPs monitored the magnitude of HIs, but only 6 decided to set specific actions tackling such disparities. Overall, 4 IRs failed to comply with the national recommendation to include equity in the PRP, while 14 faced the challenge with different level of engagement in equity. There is an association between the adherence to the equity recommendation and the availability of a regional factsheet. thanks to the national commitment and to the effort of dissemination of evidence on HIs tailored to each IR, it has been possible to bring many IRs to incorporate in some way the issue of equity in prevention in the majority of their PRP. However, evidence of high level of HI is neither sufficient nor necessary to encourage decision makers to raise equity in their agenda.

Regional prevalence of risk factors was obtained by the national surveillance system PASSI for the years 2013-2016. absolute number of attributable deaths, joint attributable fraction, proportion of total deaths attributable to RFs (MAprop). about 191,000 out of 614,307 deaths occurred in Italy in 2016 were attributable to combined RFs (about 37% in males; 26% in women). Joint MAprop was between 33% in men (24% in women) from Val d'Aosta and 40% in men (31% in women) from Campania. In Italy, 17% and 6% of the total amount of deaths were attributable to smoking in men and women, respectively; 6% and 3% to alcohol abuse; 7% and 8% to overweight; 13% and 12% to dietary RFs, and 2% and 3% to low physical activity. The higher proportion of attributable deaths by age-group was recorded in people aged 40-59 years (43% in men; 28% in women). Regional differences in attributable deaths are confirmed by regional RF prevalence recorded by the PASSI surveillance system for the years 2013-2016. these are the first estimates of the number of deaths due to NCDs attributable to behavioural RFs estimated for each region and for Italy as a whole.

Considering the papers on IBD and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for IBD, 4 for CD, and 5 for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both IBD and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for IBD and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each disease only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's disease among IBDs, in one algorithm. the results of this review indicate that case identification for IBD and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies.

Half of these used healthcare data covering a time period between 2008 and 2014. More than 75% considered the age range 6-17 for asthma and &gt;=45 for COPD. About one-third of the articles used algorithms to estimate the occurrence of these diseases. Fourteen algorithms for asthma and 16 for COPD were extracted from the papers and characterized. The Drug Prescription Database (DPD) was used by almost all asthma case-identification algorithms, while only 7 COPD algorithms used this data source. The spectrum of active ingredients was strongly overlapping between the two diseases, with different combinations of drugs and administration routes, as well as specific number of prescriptions, follow-back years, and age ranges. Age class and chronic treatment were the main disease-specific traits that emerged from the algorithms. Three external validation processes have been performed for asthma and three for COPD. High accuracy levels have been found for asthma. COPD sensitivity analyses were unsatisfactory, while a high specificity was found for algorithms based on hospital discharge records. elements from the review on the use of healthcare administrative databases represent a useful tool to decide which algorithm to adopt, based on the algorithm's individual requirements, limits, and accuracy, taking into account the specific research objective.

Most articles were published in the last three years (2014-2017) and focused on a region-wide setting. Out of all pertinent articles, 3 original algorithms for PD, 4 for MS, and 4 for epilepsy were identified. The Drug Prescription Database (DPD) and Hospital Discharge record Database (HDD) were used by almost all PD, MS, and epilepsy case-identification algorithms. The Exemption from healthcare Co-payment Database (ECD) was used by all PD and MS case-identification algorithms, while only 1 epilepsy case-identification algorithm used this source. All epilepsy case-identification algorithms were based on at least a combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) and drug prescriptions. An external validation had been performed by 2 papers for MS, 2 for epilepsy, and only 1 for PD. the results of our review highlighted the scarce use of HADs for the identification of cases affected by neurological diseases in Italy.

Eighteen algorithms had a primary objective (5 hypertension, 12 HF, 1 congenital heart diseases). All the hypertension algorithms were based on the drug prescription database, except for one algorithm that also used the hospital discharge records and the exemption from co-payment database. As for HF, all the algorithms employed the hospital discharge record database and only two algorithms used another information source. The only algorithm identified for congenital heart diseases was based on the hospital discharge database. The algorithm identified for congenital heart diseases was validated, showing excellent performance. Conversely, only one hypertension algorithm was validated, and none of the HF algorithms were validated - even though 5 out of 12 algorithms were based on previous algorithms used at both national and international level. the findings of the present study showed wide use of Italian administrative databases for the detection of hypertension and heart failure cases. However, the validity of the algorithms in most cases has not been tested, highlighting the need for introducing stricter requirements to enforce the assessment of the validity of the algorithms used.

The setting of the studies was mainly regional for AMI and stroke, while the majority of IHD's papers was based on a national multicenter context. By screening full texts, a total of 17,5 and 28 original algorithms for AMI, IHDs and stroke respectively, intended for the above-mentioned objectives, were found. Moreover, 3 original algorithms for STEMI, 3 for NSTEMI, 8 for ischemic stroke and 3 for hemorrhagic stroke were identified. The hospital discharge diagnosis database (HDD) was used in all algorithms. In only a few cases the co-payment exemption registry, drug prescription database, and mortality registry database were used as additional algorithm components. For the same event, there was always a difference of &gt;=1 code. External validation was performed in only one case for AMI and stroke identification. a remarkable heterogeneity, in terms of both data sources and codes used, was observed for algorithms aimed to identify AMI, IHDs and stroke in HADs. This was likely due to the paucity of validation studies. Administrative data sources other than HDD remain underutilized. ","280":"diabetes mellitus (DM) and thyroid disorders (TDs) are two of the most prevalent and relevant endocrine disorders worldwide, and determining their occurrence and their follow-up pathways is essential. In Italy, due to the presence of a universal health care system, administrative data can be effectively used to determine these measurements. DM is an ideal model for surveillance with administrative data, due to its specific pharmacologic treatment, high rate of hospitalization, and specific care units. The identification of TDs, conversely, is more challenging: they are less frequently managed in a hospital setting, and even if the treatment is highly specific, subclinical forms often do not need any pharmacological treatment. to identify and to describe all DM and TD caseidentification algorithms by means of Italian Healthcare Administrative Databases (HADs), through the review of papers published in the past 10 years. this study is part of a project that systematically reviewed case-identification algorithms for 18 acute and chronic conditions by means of HADs in Italy.

The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, follow-back periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded. Algorithms were divided between those identifying type 2\/not specified DM and type 1 DM, and those created to identify hypo- and hyperthyroidism. of the 780 articles identified for DM, 77 were included and a further 14 papers were added by screening the references. For TD, 65 articles were identified through the search string and 5 of them were included. Of the selected articles, 64% and 80% were published after 2014 for DM and TD, respectively, and 33% (for DM) and 20% (for TD) used multicentric national or international data. Forty original algorithms for DM (29 for type 2 DM\/not-specified DM, and 11 for type 1 DM) and 9 for TD (6 for hypo- and 3 for hyperthyroidism) were extracted. In 6 algorithms, specific selections were made so as not to include gestational diabetes. With regard to type 2 DM, the most commonly used sources were the drug prescription database (DPD, 27 cases), hospital discharge record database (HDD, 23 cases), and exemption from healthcare co-payment database (ECD, 19 cases). Other sources were the ambulatory care services database (ACD), birth register, and mortality record database (MRD). Among the 11 algorithms to identify type 1 DM, 9 used DPD, 7 ECD, and 6 HDD; in one case ACD codes were added, and all 11 algorithms but one was applied to a population of young people (always &lt;35 years old). With regard to TDs, 2 algorithms from one paper for hypo and hyperthyroidism relied on DPD as the only source, the other 7 original algorithms combined DPD with HDD (5 cases), ECD (3 cases), and ACD (1 case). One paper identified autoimmune\/iodine deficiency hypothyroidism by subtracting iatrogenic hypothyroidism cases (identified through records of previous procedures from HDD and ACD) from the whole hypothyroid population (identified through DPD). External validation was performed for two algorithms for DM and none for TD. The first algorithm for DM was obtained through HDD only and its sensitivity ranged from 61% to 70%, the second had a sensitivity of 71%. Italian literature on the use of administrative healthcare data for case identification of diabetes is vast; the proposed algorithms are quite similar to one another, and the differences between them are rarely accompanied by clinical justification. On the contrary, the literature concerning thyroid disorders is relatively poor. Further validations of the proposed algorithms, as well as their further implementation, are needed.

In Italy, in the past 10 years, HAD-based case-identification algorithms have experienced a constant increase, with a significant extension of the spectrum of identifiable diseases. Besides estimating incidence and\/or prevalence of diseases, these algorithms have been used to enroll cohorts, monitor quality of care, assess the effect of environmental exposure, and identify health outcomes in analytic studies. Despite the rapid increase in the use of case-identification algorithms, information on their accuracy and misclassification rate is currently unavailable for most conditions. to define a protocol to systematically review algorithms used in Italy in the past 10 years for the identification of several chronic and acute diseases, providing an accessible overview to future users in the Italian and international context.

The methodology proposed may be applied to other systematic reviews concerning diseases not included in this project, as well as other settings, including international ones. Considering the increasing availability of healthcare data, developing standard criteria to describe and update characteristics of published algorithms would be of great use to enhance awareness in the choice of algorithms and provide a greater comparability of results.

The enormous potential of these tests is partially contingent upon the complexity of their design, which can lead to difficulty in interpreting results for the everyday customer. At present, the scientific community lacks a cohesive stance on the proper regulations for these tests. The lack of regulation is concerning both for the consumer and the field of personalized medicine. The problem is not purely scientific, but also legal. In the United States, numerous private companies have emerged introducing low-cost genetic and epigenetic kits: although individual companies can implement privacy protection policies, there is no federal law that imposes specific requirements. Since these kits are shipped around the world, the problem becomes global and in countries like Italy and Europe very strict privacy laws may represent a problem for autonomous use of these kits. The medical, scientific and legislative communities must work in tandem for the development of specific laws that include these new technologies, as well as precise guidelines for the correct use and validation of these resources. If used improperly, these new technologies could generate public health problems. Moreover, their misuse could also increase the amount of unreliable scientific information available to the general population regarding health issues.","285":"to evaluate time and spatial distribution of hospitalization due to neurological diseases in the province of Pavia (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy). ecological study. the study was performed on aggregate data of people residing in the province of Pavia in the period 2005-2014. hospital discharge records of neurological diseases and raw and standardized hospitalization rates. hospitalization due to neurological diseases in the Province of Pavia showed a slight decreasing trend in time.

Northern Italians and smokers with many economic difficulties were more likely to make a quit attempt, whereas heavy smokers were less likely. About 10% of attempters were abstinent for &gt;6 months: from 6% in Campania and Abruzzo to 17% in the Bolzano province. Attempters who smoked &lt;20 cig\/die had higher likelihood to be abstinent, compared to those smoking &lt;20 cig\/die. Attempters with many economic difficulties had the lowest likelihood to be abstinent (7%), with no differences by region, educational level, quitting method. Attempters with no economic difficulties recorded the highest cessation rates (12%). Among them, those from Northern Italy, Tuscany, Marche, and Lazio (Central Italy), and Apulia (Southern Italy) compared to attempters from most Southern regions, and those with high education level or using traditional quitting methods compared to those using electronic cigarettes or unaided were more likely to be abstinent for &gt;6 months. smokers with many economic difficulties in all Italy, and those with no economic difficulties residing in Umbria and in most Southern Italian regions, except for Basilicata and Puglia, recorded lower chances to quit. Regional differences may have two possible explanations integrating each other: Northern-Central regions are in a slightly more advanced stage in the tobacco epidemic; regions which developed specific tobacco control interventions in their Prevention Plans recorded higher quitting rates. Not-yet-implemented interventions could promote smoking cessation in smokers from Southern Italy and in those with lower socioeconomic status: reimbursement of smoking cessation treatments, a well-developed national Quitline linked to a webplatform and to mobile phone application or text-messaging, an opt-out smoking cessation service offered systematically to all smokers at every encounter in hospitals or health services.

Five areas - and related items - were listed: prevention, continuity of care, discrimination, research, key populations. Fifty-eight AIDS advocacy groups were identified and invited through e-mail to the survey, which lasted two months. Responders were asked to select a priority area and vote two items. Then, as second choice, they had to choose up to three items across the other areas. The final step of the prioritization process was the discussion of the survey findings with the advisory board. Italian HIV advocacy groups. thirty-seven groups responded (64%). The priority selected by most was prevention (around 80%), particularly preventive information addressed to teenagers and the general population. For the second choice, the most chosen items referred to discrimination and the continuity of care. The advisory board members underlined the need for a planned, organized, monitored, and evidence-based approach for HIV prevention information in different settings. different strategies to provide HIV prevention information should be proposed and monitored according to different targets, following an evidence-based approach. The stigma and discrimination against people with HIV and AIDS must be cleaned up to foster safe sex behaviours, providing education interventions at school. Wider structural issues have to be addressed, such as the availability and affordability of health services, contraceptive choices and condoms, poverty, and cultural gender norms. ","288":"the assessment of individual exposure to toxicants in industrially contaminated areas is difficult when multiple productions are actively close to residential areas. Two thermoelectric power plants (one recently converted to coal) and a large harbour have been operating since the Sixties in the area of Civitavecchia (North of Rome, Lazio Region, Central Italy). Detailed exposure assessment of pollutants from industrial sources, heating (biomass combustion), and urban traffic were not available. to assess the individual exposure of residents by using both dispersion models and human biomonitoring. cross-sectional study. residents in the area of Civitavecchia since 2001 aged 35-69 years were enrolled and their addresses were geocoded. Exposure assessment to power plants emissions (PM10), traffic (NOx), harbour (PM10), and biomass burning (PM10) was performed at individual residential address using Lagrangian dispersion models. The \"Ambiente e Biomarcatori a Civitavecchia\" study (Environment and biomarkers in Civitavecchia - ABC study) made available urinary concentrations of metals (i.e., Cd, Pt, W, Pd, Hg, Tl, Cr, Pd, Ni, As) in a sample of residents, while information on personal characteristics, lifestyles, work history, clinical history, and use of drugs was collected by interview. for each metal, a linear regression analysis was implemented to study the association between its log-transformed values (adjusted for urinary creatinine) and the linear terms of the estimated pollutants concentrations, adjusted for age, gender, period, and other risk factors (i.e., educational level, smoking habit, alcohol, BMI). Geometric Mean Ratios (GMR) and the corresponding confidence intervals (95%CI) were computed. in the ABC sample of 1,141 residents (42% male, mean age 53.5 years, SD 9.7), there was a positive association between PM10 from power plants and urinary cadmium (Cd) (GMR: 1.12; 95%CI 1.00-1.25), traffic pollution (NOx) and platinum (Pt) (GMR: 1.17; 95%CI 1.00-1.38), PM10 from biomass burning and Cd (GMR: 1.14; 95%CI 1.05-1.24), and tungsten (W) (GMR: 1.19; 95%CI 1.03-1.37) and palladium (Pd) (GMR: 1.11; 95%CI 1.00-1.23). Other associations observed did not reach statistical significance. although it may not be said that dispersion models can replace biomonitoring studies, they certainly represent an excellent tool for exposure assessment and, therefore, they may be used for the estimation of the individual exposure of populations living in industrially contaminated areas. ","289":"the mixed and complex nature of industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) leads to heterogeneity in exposure and health risk of residents living nearby. Health, environment, and social aspects are strongly interconnected in ICSs, and local communities are often concerned about potential health impact and needs for remediation. The use of human biomonitoring (HBM) for impact assessment of environmental exposure is increasing in Europe. The COST Action IS1408 on Industrially Contaminated Sites and Health Network (ICSHNet) decided to reflect on the potential and limitations of HBM to assess exposure and early health effects associated with living near ICSs. to discuss challenges and lessons learned for addressing environmental health impact near ICSs with HBM in order to identify needs and priorities for HBM guidelines in European ICSs. based on the experience of the ICSHNet research team, six case studies from different European regions that applied HBM at ICSs were selected. The case studies were systematically compared distinguishing four phases: the preparatory phase; study design; study results; the impact of the results at scientific, societal, and political levels. all six case studies identified opportunities and challenges for applying HBM in ICS studies. A smart choice of (a combination of) sample matrices for biomarker analysis produced information about relevant time-windows of exposure which matched with the activities of the ICSs. Combining biomarkers of exposure with biomarkers of (early) biological effects, data from questionnaires or environmental data enabled fine-tuning of the results and allowed for more targeted remediating actions aimed to reduce exposure. Open and transparent communication of study results with contextual information and involvement of local stakeholders throughout the study helped to build confidence in the study results, gained support for remediating actions, and facilitated sharing of responsibilities. Using HBM in these ICS studies helped in setting priorities in policy actions and in further research. Limitations were the size of the study population, difficulties in recruiting vulnerable target populations, availability of validated biomarkers, and coping with exposure to mixtures of chemicals. based on the identified positive experiences and challenges, the paper concludes with formulating recommendations for a European protocol and guidance document for HBM in ICS. This could advance the use of HBM in local environmental health policy development and evaluation of exposure levels, and promote coordination and collaboration between researchers and risk managers. ","290":"industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) have been recognised as a major public health concern since they involve exposure to multiple environmental stressors, normally distributed unevenly within population. The COST Action on Industrially Contaminated Sites and Health Network (ICSHNet) comprises a European network of experts and institutions to clarify needs and priorities for better characterising the impact on environment and health of ICS. evaluate the availability of information and studies concerning selected ICSs in participating Countries within the ICSHNet, with particular consideration on the accessibility to environmental, health and demographic data, and research and assessment tools. to evaluate the availability of data, an Action Questionnaire (AQ) was developed based on previous questionnaires used in different European projects and on expert consultation. The AQ, with 84 items organised in eight sections, was adapted to an on-line version using the software LimeSurvey. The survey was sent to 47 participants within the ICSHNet, to report over a list of 99 ICSs previously identified. information was gathered from 81 sites out of the initially selected 99, reported by 45 participants from 27 Countries (82% of Countries in the ICSHNet). The predominant polluting activities were waste disposal (46%) and chemical industries (37%), affecting all environmental media, but more extensively surface and groundwater (70%) and soil (68%). Main categories of contaminants affecting different media were heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons, but also BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and ambient air pollutants (e.g., particulate matter, SOx). Human health risk assessment was the most prevalent methodological approach for characterising impacts on health (32%), followed by epidemiological studies (26%), and health impact assessment (12%). The low reporting, both referring to data availability or methodologies, could be due to absence of data, or to the fact that the reporting person (many of them from the public health sector) did not know how to reach the environmental information. survey findings suggest that improving the collection and access to specific environmental, health and demographic data related to ICSs is crucial to meet the methodological requirement to better analyse the health impact of ICSs. ","291":"human exposure to mixtures of chemicals of toxicological interest, typically found in industrial contaminated sites (ICSs), has been associated with a broad range of different health outcomes. Deprived population groups endure most of the burden of disease and premature death associated to the exposure to those pollutants. Characterising the impacts on health of an ICS is a challenging process. Currently the two main methodological approaches used are Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) and Environmental Epidemiological (EE) studies. review existing guidance and scientific evidence for HHRA and EE studies applied to contaminated sites that orientate in selecting the most suitable methodological approach for characterising health impacts in ICSs according to the site characteristics, and the availability of environmental, health and sociodemographic data. HHRA has evolved into a more holistic approach, placing more emphasis in planning, community involvement and adapting the dimension of the assessment to the problem formulation and to the availability of resources. Many different HHRA guidelines for contaminated sites has been published worldwide, and although they share a similar framework, the scientific evidence used for deriving reference values and the variet of policy options can result in a wide variability of health risk estimates. This paper condenses different options with the recommendations to use those tools, default values for environmental and exposure levels and toxicological reference values that most suit to the population and characteristics of the ICSs under evaluation. the suitability to use one or another approach to assess the impact of ICSs on health depends on the availability of data, cost-benefit aspects and the kind of problem that needs to be answered. Risk assessment based on toxicological data can be very rapid and cheap, providing direct information when the intervention to protect the health of population is urgent and no suitable dose-response functions are available from epidemiological studies. Conducting EE studies provide a deeper insight into the problem of the exposure to industrial pollutants that do not require extrapolation from data obtained from toxicological studies or other population, addressing the community concern's more directly. Complementing the results obtained from different approaches, including those from public health surveillance systems, might provide an efficient and complete response to the impact of ICSs.

This update is part of an epidemiological surveillance programme carried out in NPCSs, promoted by the Italian Ministry of Health as a further step of a project started in 2006, when the health status of residents in contaminated sites was first addressed within the National Strategic Program \"Environment and Health\". The Report focuses on five health outcomes: mortality, cancer incidence, hospital discharges, congenital anomalies, and children, adolescents and young adults' health. A key element of SENTIERI project is the a priori evaluation of the epidemiological evidence of a causal association between the considered cause of disease and the exposure. When an a priori evidence is identified, it is given a greater importance in the comment of the study findings. The present update of the SENTIERI Project concerns 45 NPCSs including in all 319 Italian Municipalities (out of over 8,000 Municipalities), with an overall population of 5,900,000 inhabitants at the 2011 Italian Census. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and Standardized Hospitalization Ratios (SHRs), referring to a time window of 2006-2013, were computed for all the 45 NPCSs, using as a reference the corresponding mortality and hospitalization rates of the Regions where each NCPS is located. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were computed by the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM) for the 22 NPCSs served by a Cancer Registry. AIRTUM covers about 56% of Italy, with partly different time-windows. SIRs have been estimated using as reference population the 4 macroareas in which Italy is divided (North-West, North-East, Centre, South). Prevalence of congenital anomalies was computed for 15 NPCSs. An all-cause excess of 5,267 and 6,725 deaths was observed, respectively, in men and women; the cancer death excess was of 3,375 in men and 1,910 in women. It was estimated an excess of cancer incidence of 1,220 case in men and 1,425 in women over a five-year time window. With regard to the diseases with an a priori environmental aetiological validity, an excess for malignant mesothelioma, lung, colon, and gastric cancer, and for non-malignant respiratory diseases was observed. Cancer excess mainly affected NPCSs with presence of chemical and petrochemical plants, oil refineries, and dumping hazardous wastes. An excess of non-malignant respiratory disease was also detected in NPCSs in which steel industries and thermoelectric plants were present. An excess of mesothelioma was observed in NPCSs characterized by presence of asbestos and fluoro-edenite; it was also observed where the presence of asbestos was not reported in the legislative national decrees which define the NPCS areas. It is worth noting that, even if the presence of asbestos is not reported in many NPCSs legislative decrees, petrochemical plants and steel industries, for instance, are often characterized by the presence of a large amount of this mineral that, in the past, was extensively used as an insulating material. For the first time, the present Report includes a focus on the health status of children and adolescents (1,160,000 subjects, aged 0-19 years), and young adults (660,000 subjects, aged 20-29 years). Among infants (0-1 year), an excess of 7,000 hospitalizations was observed, 2,000 of which due to conditions of perinatal origin. In the age class 0-14, an excess of 22,000 hospitalizations for all causes was observed; 4,000 of them were due to acute respiratory diseases, and 2,000 to asthma. Data on cancer incidence for subjects aged 0-24 years were derived from general population cancer registries for twenty NPCSs, and from children cancer registries (age group: 0-19 years) for six NPCSs; 666 cases where diagnosed in the age group 0-24 years, corresponding to an excess of 9%. The main contributions to this excess are from soft tissue sarcomas in children (aged 0-14 years), acute myeloid leukaemia in children (aged 0-14 years) and in the age group 0-29 years, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer in young adults (aged 20-29 years). In seven out of 15 NPCSs, an excess prevalence rate of overall congenital anomalies at birth was observed. Congenital anomalies excesses included the following sites: genital organs, heart, limbs, nervous system, digestive system, and urinary system. The main findings of SENTIERI Project have been the detection of excesses for the diseases which showed an a priori epidemiological evidence of a causal association with the environmental exposures specific for each considered NPCS. These observations are valuable within public health, because they contribute to priority health promotion activities. Looking ahead, the health benefits of an improved environmental quality might be appreciated in terms of reduction of the occurrence of adverse health effects attributable to each Site major pollutant agents. Due to the methodological approach of the present study, it was not possible to adjust for several confounding factors reported to be risk factors for the studied diseases (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity). Even if excesses of mortality, hospitalization, cancer incidence, and prevalence of congenital anomalies were found in several NPCSs, the study design and the multifactorial aetiology of the considered diseases do not permit, for all of them, to draw conclusions in terms of causal links with environmental contamination. Moreover, it must be taken into consideration that economic factors and the availability of health services may also play a relevant role in a diseases outcome. A few observations regarding some methodological limitations of SENTIERI Project should be made. There is not a uniform environmental characterisation of the studied NPCSs in term of quality and detection of the pollutants, because this information is present in different databases which at present are not adequately connected. Moreover, the recognition of a contaminated site as a National Priority Site is based on soil and groundwater pollution, and the available information on air quality is currently sparse and not homogenous. Another limitation, in term of statistical power, is the small population size of many NPCSs and the low frequency of several health outcomes. A special caution must be paid in data interpretation when considering the correspondence between the contaminated areas and the municipality boundaries, as they do not always coincide perfectly: in some cases, a small municipality with a large industrial site, while in other settings only a part of the municipality is exposed to the sources of pollution. Furthermore, all available health information systems are currently accessible at municipality level. The real breakthrough is essentially comprised of the development and fostering of a networking system involving all local health authorities and regional environmental protection agencies operating in the areas under study. The possibility to integrate the geographic approach of SENTIERI Project with a set of ad hoc analytic epidemiological investigations, such as residential cohort studies, case control studies, children health surveys, biomonitoring surveys, and with socioepidemiological studies, might greatly contribute to the identification of health priorities for environmental remediation activities. Finally, as discussed in the last section of the report, there is a need to adopt, in each NPCS, a two-way oriented communication plan involving public health authorities, scientific community, and resident population, taking into account that the history, the cultural frame and the network of relationships specific of each local context play a major role in the risk perception perspective.

Data and evidence-based information can greatly reduce excessive fears and unreasonable emotional reactions. This paper presents many reasons for reassessing the issue of the school attendance of immunocompromised children in a more balanced perspective both in terms of absolute risk and of risk related to other common circumstances involving greater comparative risks. The whole community, the immunocompromised subjects, and their caregivers must be educated to face these circumstances every day, with measures and behaviours largely implementable by motivated and adequately informed people. Even physicians - and even more public health doctors - are called to take the responsibility to inform people in a balanced way, and to educate to implement the many evidence-based actions that can protect health, including protection from infectious diseases and their complications, with a commitment consistent with the potential of the available measures.","301":"Italy is one of the European Countries with the highest level of antimicrobial consumption, both in the community and in hospital settings, and with the highest prevalence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. In 2015, the Project \"Good practices for the surveillance and control of antimicrobial resistance\" was funded by the Italian National Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CCM): the aim was to promote integrated actions at national level to control antimicrobial resistance, favouring the transfer of existing good practices. The principal objectives of the project were: to describe the Italian scenario of good practices based on literature review; to improve the capacity of surveillance, through achieving consensus on a core set of indicators, including paediatrics, and through the strengthening of the national surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health; to define tools useful for priority setting; to evaluate the efficacy of intervention programme aimed at promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics among children for upper respiratory tract infections in the community; to set up training programmes on the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. Seven regions were enrolled in the project (Emilia-Romagna with the role of programme coordinator, Campania, Calabria, Lazio, Lombardy, Piedmont, Tuscany) and the Italian National Health Institute. The project allowed to document: the scarce spread of control practices at national level (out of 277 studies reviewed, only 6.1% of the cases were targeted to evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programmes); a significant variability among regions both in relation to antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance prevalence, with a worrying spread in some regions of several antimicrobial resistant organisms responsible for \"critical\" infections with great potential health impact; the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at promoting appropriate use of antibiotics in frequent infections for children in the community, such as pharingotonsillitis and acute otitis media (35% reduction of antimicrobial consumption between 2010 and 2017 in Emilia-Romagna; an inversion of the ratio amoxicillin\/amoxicillin-clavulanate); the need for new indicators to monitor antimicrobial consumption in hospital paediatric wards and of a new national system for timely identification of new antimicrobial resistance profiles; a positive evaluation of the training programme for veterinary physicians.

","321":"Pertussis vaccination has made an important contribution to the reduction in incidence of the disease, but internationally pertussis reawakens, even in highly vaccinated population groups. This resurgence seems to be attributable to various reasons: non-optimal efficacy of the vaccine; fairly rapid decay of protective antibody titers in part of the population and above all their inadequacy in preventing infections and transmission of the pathogen also from infected subjects; selective pressure of extensive vaccination with emergence of mutated resistant strains; substantial impossibility of obtaining a herd effect with the vaccines which are available nowadays. The present work analyses the state of scientific knowledge and illustrates various topics that may challenge a prevention based only on the paediatric vaccine obligation using a hexavalent vaccine. Public health strategies must be rethought, considering also different solutions that aim to fight the disease in a more targeted and potentially more effective way, avoiding major damage to people at greater risk. A currently tested strategy is the vaccination of pregnant mothers, but the experimentation of solutions less interfering with the bacterial ecology could be also considered; these solutions may only aim at avoiding major damage to subgroups at greater risk and should be integrated with initiatives to improve surveillance systems, microbiological diagnosis and lifestyle-based prevention.","322":"In the period 2015-2017 a Health Impact Assessment, HIA, was carried out in the Municipalities of Viggiano and Grumento Nova, in Val D'Agri, where since 2001 the oil first treatment plant, COVA, has been active.

Thirteen of the 630 authors (2.0%) declared a conflict. Two of these declarations (2\/630; 0.3%) referred to their employment relationship. This context does not seem to foster the independence of thought: only 0.3% of the authors indicated the working relationship among their conflicts of interest. In general, the declaration of the conflict of interest involved 2% of the authors. The need to discuss the conflict of interest, its awareness and its control should be a priority action of the scientific community, scientific associations, and scientific journals.

This investigation is preliminary to a more complete retrospective study on the cohort of soldiers affected by tumour (No. 6,104 cases) diagnosed in the period 1973-2017 and registered by the Epidemiological Defence Observatory (OED). cohort data were acquired by the Uranium Commission of the Chamber of Deputies (CUC, 2016-2018). For statistical and epidemiological reasons, mainly dictated by the number, completeness, and quality of information concerning patients (or deceased) and the study population. The survey was temporarily limited to male military aged between 20 and 59 during the period 1996-2012 (No. 3,663; 60% of the total). Military from the four Italian defence forces - Air force, Carabinieri, Army, and Navy - were, respectively, divided into two groups: those involved in at least one mission abroad (\"missionaries\"; No. 874; 24%) and all the others (\"non-missionaries\"; No. 2,789; 76%). Using the method of indirect rate standardization, the age-standardized incidence ratio comparing missionaries and non-missionaries (SIRm) and comparing missionaries and the general population considered as an external reference (SIR) were calculated, with respective 90% confidence intervals (95%CI). Similarly, the overall mortality risk among missionaries was investigated. considering the population of the non-missionaries, the analysis of tumour incidence (TM) by military forces identified excesses in the missionaries of the Air Force (SIRm: 126.7; 90% CI 107.9-147.9), Carabinieri (SIRm: 152.8; 90%CI 134.0-173.7), and the Army (SIRm: 116.2; 90%CI 108.1-125.6). Taking into account missionaries, there was an excess of risk for specific neoplasia: for hemolymphopoietic system in Carabinieri (SIRm: 150.1; 90%CI 106.0 - 207.1) and in the Army (SIRm: 109.0; 90%CI 93.9-125.9); for Hodgkin lymphoma in Air force (SIRm: 187.7; 90%CI 88.1-352.5), Carabinieri (SIRm: 187.3; 90%CI 87.9-351.8), and the Army (SIRm; 104.5; 90%CI 81.2-132.6); for leukaemia in the Army (SIRm: 142.4; 90%CI 107.5-185.4). Significant risk excesses were also observed in missionaries for stomach, testis, kidney, bladder, and thyroid tumours. On the other hand, for missionaries in the Navy, a statistically significant risk reduction for all tumours emerged (SIRm: 61.1; IC90% 51.0-72.6). Missionaries showed a higher mortality for all causes. this preliminary study confirms the need for an in-depth survey on the health status of Italian soldiers. In particular, the risk for diseases, even non-neoplastic and after 2012, should be investigated in the military over the age of 60, who has a greater risk of incidence and mortality, not only for tumour. All potential disease determinants, both environmental and personal, should also be studied.

For frequency outcomes, only women aged 28-64 years and 52-69 years were included for Pap test and mammography, respectively. 11.9% of women have Pap test at the recommended frequency, 48.5% at shorter intervals, and 19.6% at longer intervals than recommended, while 20.0% never had a Pap test at all (39.6% under-use). 41.1% of women have a mammography at the recommended interval, 18.4% at shorter intervals, and 20.2% at longer intervals, while 20.3% never had a mammography at all. For both tests, in the North-East higher appropriate coverage and less over-use are observed, while in the South more under-use is highlighted. Young, foreigners, single, less educated, and unoccupied women have, at the same time, more over- and under-use for Pap test. Foreigner women reporting economic difficulties and single women have more mammography over and under-use.

We computed cause-specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), stratified according to the type of employment (urea sector, caprolactam sector, and contract workers), with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). For internal comparison purpose, Cox regression models were used and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated, considering workers from the caprolactam area as a reference category. the cohort consisted of 1,467 workers; 114 were dead at the end of the previous follow-up. Among 728 workers residing in Manfredonia, we identified 619 people still alive and 93 deceased. Among 625 not-residents, 508 were alive and 93 deceased.

The study used the database of the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) developed by linking the 2011 Census with the Italian National Register of Causes of Death (2012-2014) for 35 groups of causes of death. Age, sex, residence, and education level information were collected from the Census. Life expectancy at birth was calculated by sex, Italian region, and education level. For the population aged 30-89 years, the following items were developed by sex: 1. provincial maps showing, for each cause of death, the distribution in quintiles of smoothed standardized mortality ratio (SMR), adjusted for age and education level and estimated with Bayesian models for small areas (spatial conditional autoregressive model); 2. regional maps of population attributable fraction (PAF) for low and medium education levels, calculated starting from age-standardized mortality ratios; 3. tables illustrating for each region standardized mortality rates and standardized years of life lost rate by age (standardized YLL rate), and mortality rate ratios standardized by age (MMRs). Males with a lower education level throughout Italy show a life expectancy at birth that is 3 years less than those with higher education; residents in Southern Italy lose an additional year in life expectancy, regardless of education level. Social inequalities in mortality are present in all regions, but are more marked in the poorer regions of Southern Italy. Geographical differences, taking into account the different population distributions in terms of age and education level, produce mortality differences for all causes: from -15% to +30% in women and from -13% to +26% in men, compared to the national average. Among the main groups of causes, the geographical differences are greater for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and accidents, and lower for many tumour sites. A clear mortality gradient with an excess in Southern Italy can be seen for cardiovascular diseases: there are some areas where mortality for people with higher education level is higher than that for residents in Northern Italy with low education level. The gradient for \"All tumours\", instead, is from South to North, as it is for most single tumour sites. Population attributable fraction for low education level in Italy, taking into account the population distribution by age, is 13.4% in women and 18.3% in men. The study highlighted important geographical differences in mortality, regardless of age and socioeconomic level, with a more significant impact in the poorer Southern regions, revealing a never-before-seen health advantage in the regions along the Adriatic coast. A lower education level explains a considerable proportion of mortality risk, although with differing effects by geographical area and cause of death. There are still mortality inequalities in Italy, therefore, representing a possible missed gain in health in our Country; these inequalities suggest a reassessment of priorities and definition of health targets.

However, it is important to recognize that such studies are not a substitute for public health measures to identify the source of exposure, reduce or eliminate it, and take measures to prevent future events. The merits of initiating an epidemiological study that directly examines the relationship between exposure and disease in the affected population need to be carefully considered. There may be benefits in responding directly to the community's concerns, providing information to help generate resources to address the problem, and offering an opportunity to learn more about the pollutant health effects. However, there are also costs in the form of financial burdens of the research and prolonged period required to conduct studies, raising unrealistic expectations about what a study will provide, and not utilizing quantitative risk assessment as a more rapid and potentially more informative alternative to a new study. Where data systems are in place, risk assessment combined with health surveillance may often be the most efficient, informative response to the exposure event. New epidemiological studies are most likely to be valuable: - when there is little prior knowledge about the pollutant; - when exposure and health outcome can be accurately measured; - when there is not strong confounding; - when the size of the exposed population is adequate; - when the health consequences of the exposure are observable soon after the exposure occurs. The balance between costs and benefits of research may vary across settings, depending in part on the economic resources available to pursue new knowledge versus managing a threat to public health and in part on the nature of available environmental health surveillance data collection systems. Before initiating an epidemiological study, it is important to be certain that the goals are attainable for the research and that the research itself will support - rather than interfere with - pursuit of needed public health actions.","366":"this paper is based upon work from COST Action ICSHNet.

Contaminated areas, especially of industrial origin, are of high concern due to complex mix of hazardous pollutants and their potential health impacts on human populations, notably in children. to describe cancer risk in children and young adults (YA) residing in national priority contaminated sites (NPCSs) in Italy and to provide a suitable framework for a development of cancer surveillance in industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) in Europe. this study is based on a collaborative work of the Italian Institute of Health (ISS) and the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM), in the context of the SENTIERI project (Epidemiological study of residents in National Priority Contaminated Sites). Incidence rates were standardised according to the European standard population. The number of observed cases was compared to the expected cases derived from the age-, sex-, and cancer-specific incidence rates of the national pool of AIRTUM registries for the period 2006-2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed.

Geo-referenced data on landfills from the European Pollutant and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) were combined with population density data (European Environment Agency dataset) and disease frequency data from European health for all database (HfA); uncertainty was assessed via simulation methods. Countries covered by the European Environment Agency's E-PRTR registry on contaminated sites were considered (European Union Member States plus four additional European Countries) for the period 2007-2014. Four outcomes, for which suggestive evidence is available, were included: - low birth weight; - congenital anomalies; - respiratory disease; - annoyance from odour. Firstly, they were analysed separately, in terms of excess number of cases, and then combined into disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). 1,544 landfill sites were considered. 29.3 million people (6% of the total population) live within 4 km from one or more of these sites. The number of yearly attributable cases associated with low birth weight, congenital anomalies, respiratory diseases, and annoyance from odour were estimated, respectively, at 1,239, 70, 33,039, and 1,582,624. Associated DALYs were 10,192, 958, 2,688, and 47,505, respectively; 61,325 in total. estimates indicate a sizable health impact, largest for annoyance from odour, given the high frequency of the outcome and in spite of its lesser severity compared to the other ones.

In addition, the terminologies were described and harmonization was proposed. we systematically searched PubMed and Web of Science to identify peer-reviewed reviews and original studies from January 1989 to December 2017. We used a qualitative approach for analysing the different elements (type of ICSs, Country of research, active years of working, distance from sources, pollutants, affected population, methods and tools, health outcomes, main founding, method stage, dose-response assessment, risk characterization) of included studies. We divided risk assessment methods used in the papers into four stages: semi-quantitative, quantitative, health impact, and health burden stage. a total of 92 relevant original papers at ICSs were found and analysed. In current practice, the health risks have been characterized mainly as hazard quotients or hazard indexes (23 studies), and as cancer risk probabilities (60 studies). Only 8 studies estimated the number of cases and one study evaluated years of life lost. hazard quotients and cancer probabilities are suitable for semi-quantitative and quantitative personal risk estimation, respectively. More comparable risk characterization on public health level requires specificity on the type of outcome and corresponding number of cases. Such data is needed for prioritization of action at low to medium risk sites. We found limited amount of studies that have quantified the health impact at industrially contaminated sites. Most of the studies have used semi-quantitative risk characterization approaches and the adopted methods are mostly of toxicological origin, while epidemiological analysis is almost lacking.

Assessment of the health impacts related to industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) is a major scientific challenge with multiple societal implications. Most studies related to associations between ICSs and public health do not provide established mechanistic links between environmental exposure and disease burden, potentially resulting in suboptimal risk management measures. to assess the potential of the exposome paradigm to overhaul ICS risk assessment and management leading to precision prevention and targeted interventions. we selected the second largest waste landfill in Europe and the data collected in the frame of the HERACLES study on the exposome and health and analysed them together with clinical evidence of neurodevelopmental perturbations following the exposome-wide association study paradigm using the exposome analysis tools; briefly, these pertain to refined exposure assessment, internal dosimetry, and human biomonitoring, multi-omics\/toxicity pathway analysis and advanced statistical tools for environment-wide association studies. Waste streams and the related contamination of environmental media are not viewed in isolation, but rather as components of the expotype, the vector of exposures an individual is exposed to over time. Thus, a multi-route and multi-pathway exposure estimation can be performed setting a realistic basis for integrated health risk and impact assessment. The study was located in the area around the landfill of Fili, outside Athens (Greece). Since 2012, 325 children were recruited and have been followed using a combination of human biomonitoring, advanced-omics analysis on biosamples, environmental monitoring for metals and organic contaminants, and dietary pattern information. The children were clinically tested for neurodevelopmental perturbations during different developmental stages and the results were analysed according to the exposome-wide association study methodology in conjunction with environmental exposure, but also socioeconomic, dietary, and metabolic determinants of internal exposure and health risk. using the exposome analysis tools, we confirmed that proximity to a landfill and the consequent soil contamination with metals are critical for children neurodevelopment. However, it was found that additional parameters such as parental education level, socioeconomic status, and nutrition contribute either positively or negatively on child neurodevelopment. the exposome concept comes to overhaul the nature vs. nurture paradigm and embraces a world of dynamic interactions between environmental exposures, endogenous exposures, and genetic expression in humans. In this context, the exposome paradigm provides a novel tool for holistic ICS health risk management. The effectiveness of the exposome approach is demonstrated in the case of Athens, the capital of Greece, where health effects associated to long term exposure to a major waste management facility (landfill) are presented.

Limitations in exposure assessment have substantially contributed to uncertainty about associations found in epidemiological studies. to examine exposure assessment methods that have been used in epidemiological studies on ICSs and to provide recommendations for improved exposure assessment in epidemiological studies by comparing exposure assessment methods in epidemiological studies and risk assessments. after defining the multi-media framework of exposure related to ICSs, we discussed selected multi-media models applied in Europe. We provided an overview of exposure assessment in 54 epidemiological studies from a systematic review of hazardous waste sites; a systematic review of 41 epidemiological studies on incinerators and 52 additional studies on ICSs and health identified for this review. we identified 10 multi-media models used in Europe primarily for risk assessment. Recent models incorporated estimation of internal biomarker levels. Predictions of the models differ particularly for the routes 'indoor air inhalation' and 'vegetable consumption'. Virtually all of the 54 hazardous waste studies used proximity indicators of exposure, based on municipality or zip code of residence (28 studies) or distance to a contaminated site (25 studies). One study used human biomonitoring. In virtually all epidemiological studies, actual land use was ignored. In the 52 additional studies on contaminated sites, proximity indicators were applied in 39 studies, air pollution dispersion modelling in 6 studies, and human biomonitoring in 9 studies. Exposure assessment in epidemiological studies on incinerators included indicators (presence of source in municipality and distance to the incinerator) and air dispersion modelling. Environmental multi-media modelling methods were not applied in any of the three groups of studies. recommendations for refined exposure assessment in epidemiological studies included the use of more sophisticated exposure metrics instead of simple proximity indicators where feasible, as distance from a source results in misclassification of exposure as it ignores key determinants of environmental fate and transport, source characteristics, land use, and human consumption behaviour. More validation studies using personal exposure or human biomonitoring are needed to assess misclassification of exposure. Exposure assessment should take more advantage of the detailed multi-media exposure assessment procedures developed for risk assessment. The use of indicators can be substantially improved by linking definition of zones of exposure to existing knowledge of extent of dispersion. Studies should incorporate more often land use and individual behaviour. ","372":"this paper is based upon work from COST Action ICSHNet. Public health surveillance (PHS) of industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) is likely to play a role in supporting the monitoring of harmful aspects of ICSs and related interventions. Environmental public health tracking (EPHT) has been proposed and developed as an approach to PHS when environmental factors affecting health are involved. to identify existing arrangements for continuous collection and analysis of environmental and health data to guide the development of an optimal EPHT approach which would support the characterization of the impact on health of ICS. a literature search was conducted in PubMed following a structured approach to identify methodological aspects relevant to surveillance of ICSs. In addition, eight further studies on this topic, mainly from three European Countries (Spain, Italy, and France), were included by the research team. the identified 17 examples of surveillance studies include a heterogeneous variety of industrial activities, covering from cross-national to local scenarios. Continuous monitoring systems for gathering environmental data related to ICSs were used only in two cases; a qualitative approach and\/or punctual sampling for soil, air, and water of local foodstuff took place in the rest. Exposure assessment was conducted according to four main methods: qualitative definition for the presence\/absence of a source, distance to a source, dispersion modelling, and biomonitoring. Health data relied on routinely vital statistics, hospital admission records, specific morbidity registers, and cancer and congenital abnormalities registries. our revision identified an overall lack of national surveillance programmes of ICSs, rather than gaps in individual dimensions of surveillance. The epidemiological approaches reviewed provided methods, some of which could be adopted for an EPHT in ICSs. However, a large proportion of examples suffers from poor exposure characterization, relying on a qualitative definition approach, which cannot account for the multiple pathways that take place in ICSs. Use of more individual data from health registries combined with improved environmental data collection and exposure assessment would improve future surveillance. ","373":"","374":null,"375":"Congenital anomalies (CAs) represent one of the main cause of foetal death, infant mortality and morbidity, and long-term disability. CAs have been object of systematic registration activity for a long-time in many geographical areas in Europe and worldwide. CAs are often associated with disabilities of different types and severity, including the developed Countries worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year approximately 3,2 million of children worldwide are born with a CA and approximately 300,000 newborns with a diagnosis of birth defect die within the first 28 days of life. In Europe, CAs are the leading cause of perinatal mortality: the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROC AT) network estimated a perinatal mortality associated with CAs of 9.2 per 10,000 births in 2008-2012. In Italy, the Ministry of Health estimates that, on the average of 500,000 births each year, about 25,000 present at least one CA. Moreover, approximately 25% of infant mortality is due to CAs and about 50% of infant mortality is attributable to perinatal morbidity, almost always of prenatal origin. Regarding long-term survival, a recent population study conducted between 1985 and 2003 in the UK estimated a 20.5-year survival of 85.5% of children born with at least one CA. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 3.3% of live births in the United States have a severe birth defect. Since CAs represent a significant public health issue, an effective primary prevention strategy should be a priority for public policies and healthcare system. Regarding aetiology, although in many cases the cause is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that CAs may be developed during the first trimester of pregnancy as a result of hereditary polygenic defects or of a gene-environment interaction. The aetiology is predominantly multifactorial, caused by complex interactions between genes and environment, which modify the normal embryo-foetal development, especially during the organogenesis phase. In particular, environmental factors (e.g., chemical toxicants, infection agents, maternal disease, and exogenous factors) can have preconceptional mutagenic action, postconceptional teratogenic effects, periconceptional endocrine disruption or epigenetic action. Regarding genetic causes, there are genetic chromosomal aberrations or dysgeneses. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors affect reproductive health by differentiating the exposure to the other risk factors as well as the access to prevention measures. In recent years, the importance of the environment as a major factor of reproductive risk has been highlighted. An individual may be exposed to pollutants present in the workplace and the population may be exposed to multiple sources of environmental contamination of water, soil, and air matrices. Pregnant women and the developing foetus are particularly sensitive to the effects of environmental exposure. The aim of the present working paper is to produce an updated review of the epidemiological evidence on the risk of CAs associated with environmental exposures, socioeconomic, and main individual risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, according to the approach proposed by Pirastu et al. 2010 in the framework of the SENTIERI Project (the Italian Epidemiological Study of Residents in National Priority Contaminated Sites). Literature search was carried out in PubMed, following the SENTIERI project criteria to evaluate evidence, by selecting articles in English or Italian language published from 2011 to 2016 regarding human studies. For this review, descriptive and analytical epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, and ecological), systematic reviews, and metanalyses reporting association estimates between the outcome and at least one of the risk factors were selected. As in Pirastu et al., the sources of environmental exposure have been classified into four macrocategories: industries, mines, landfills, and incinerators. The sources of individual exposure considered were: active and passive cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status (SES), occupational and environmental exposures related to air pollutants from vehicular traffic only. The obtained results were assessed according to the evaluation criteria on the epidemiological evidence related to the association between the outcome and exposures predefined and published by the SENTIERI working group (WG). For the evidence assessment, the SENTIERI WG criteria favoured firstly primary sources and quantitative metanalyses, secondly, consistency among sources. The evaluation of the epidemiological evidence for the association between outcome and the exposure has been classified into three categories: sufficient (S), limited (L), inadequate (I). Industries: during the period under review, six single studies evaluating the association between industrial sites exposure and the risk of CAs were found. The epidemiological evidence of association between outcome and exposure has been considered limited. Mines: from the bibliographic research, three single studies investigating possible cause-effect relationship between maternal residential proximity to mines and the risk of CAs have been collected providing inadequate epidemiological evidence. Landfills: during the period under review, one systematic review and one literature review evaluating the causal associations between maternal residential proximity to landfills and CAs were identified. The epidemiological evidence is limited and concerns almost exclusively sites containing industrial or hazardous waste. Incinerators: a systematic review has been selected; it concludes that the evidence for the association between maternal residential proximity to incinerators and CAs are inadequate. Cigarette smoking: the literature search identified eight systematic reviews with metanalysis, five multicentre studies, and ten single studies assessing the causal association between maternal and\/or paternal exposure to smoking and the risk of CAs in the offspring providing sufficient evidence for a causal association between maternal exposure to cigarette smoke and the risk of congenital heart defects, oro-facial clefts, neural tube defects, and gastrointestinal malformations. Alcohol: three systematic reviews with metanalysis, two metanalyses, one multicentre study, and four single studies were collected for the period under review. The acquired literature has provided limited epidemiological evidence for associations between alcohol consumption and CAs in the nervous system, particularly for anencephaly and spina bifida. Socioeconomic status: the evidence of an association with socioeconomic factors was inadequate due to an insufficient number of studies selected during the period under consideration. Occupational exposure: the literature search collected one metanalysis, eight multicentre studies, and five single studies. The epidemiological evidence for associations between paternal occupational exposure to solvents and neural tube defects and between maternal pesticide exposure and gold-facial clefts were judged limited. Air pollution: two systematic reviews with metanalyses, two multicentre studies, and nine single studies were selected by literature search; the epidemiological evidence for a causal association between air pollutants exposure and the risk of CAs is still to be considered limited. For future epidemiological studies, a better exposure assessment, using in particular more accurate spatial measurements or models, a standardized case definition, a larger sample and more accurate control of the recognized or presumed confounding variables are needed.

The quality was measured through a subjective evaluation expressed by the regional referent through scores from 1 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) regarding four indicators (regional coverage, timeliness, correctness, and completeness of the data). more than half of the regional systems use a computerized data collection method. Some of these regions have not completely adapted to the data collection form contained in the Decree and other regions declare a undernotification of the system. The majority of the regions record a slight notification delay by the reporting centres. Some regions report gaps in the completeness of the data received by the reporting centres. the main strengths of the HIV surveillance system are computerization of the systems and slightly reporting delay. Regarding the quality of the regional systems and its data, the study reports a good self-evaluation.

The present review shows, however, that the public health information available in humanitarian crises is, in general, inadequate and that its application is secondary to reasoning and incentives of a political nature, thus contributing to the recurrent failings of humanitarian action. This article reviews the causes of this state of affairs - cultural, political\/institutional\/methodological and ethical - that hinder the production, dissemination, and use of information for determining which interventions should be implemented or modified. Traditional epidemiological skills and methods are poorly suited to humanitarian contexts. The approaches and tools that have been introduced in crisis contexts require validation and improvement. There is a need for more field \"barefoot epidemiologists\" who are able to collaborate with anthropologists, demographers, and sociologists to better understand the priorities to be addressed in a crisis.

The Deliberation of the Regional Administration of Tuscany (No. 396\/2016) supports the programme, defined by a regional group of experts, and defines the public health services where the programme has to be implemented. The programme activities are classified in two levels: a first level for a basic health evaluation and a second level for in-depth analyses. The former asbestos workers, aged less than 80 years and with cessation of occupational asbestos exposure in the last 30 years, that might be included free of charge in the programme are about 5.600. The funds assigned to develop the programme from 2016 to 2024 were 2,044,808 euros. The Regional Administration of Tuscany decided to offer and guarantee a homogeneous programme in the whole region. The identification of a specific public health programme and the cooperation of social stakeholders, defined with specific regional agreements, might facilitate to overcome the problems which are still open, such as a broaden invitation to adhere to the programme, an extended knowledge on the service, and the application of a similar health programme for still-working former asbestos workers.","406":"Eleven projects within the LIFE programme (through which the Directorate-General for Environment of the European Commission provides funding for projects aim at protecting environment and nature) addressing environmental-health-related issues have been involved in a collaborative network called KTE LIFE EnvHealth Network.

The following factors have been investigated: sociodemographic and clinical data of the subjects, prescribing GPs' characteristics, and organizational environment of the LHA for whom the GP is working. For each procedure, prescription rate determinants have been estimated by a logistic regression modelling of the probability of receiving at least one prescription during the year. Hierarchical data structure has been managed. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and the Median Odds Ratio (MOR) were used as measures of variability due to GPs and LHAs. the degree of variability among LHAs and, within each LHA, among GPs was moderate (ICC for LHA: 0.009 and 0.004; ICC for GP: 0.015 and 0.014, respectively, for vertebral and joint MR). Prescribing probability was mainly explained by the demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects. Most of the GPs' characteristics did not show any relevant association.

This paper presents up-to-date evidence on this issue and illustrates a number of critical arguments that may question the opportunity of this choice. Particularly, while the disease is relatively mild in children aged between 1 and 9 years, the risk of worsening its consequences is progressive with age, becoming worst in the elderly, so the vaccination of children may increase the age of the cases. Some vaccine side effects are not trivial and the duration of protection is still uncertain, as well as the cost-effectiveness of mass vaccination and its long-term effects, referring to virus reactivation and to the incidence of Herpes zoster in the general population, which could be increased and anticipated in the long run. Varicella vaccination is not included in international eradication goals and very few Europeans Countries have considered it as a public health priority. A different rational choice could have been to offer a selective vaccination only to adolescents with a negative history of chickenpox; or at least to delay the beginning of the universal campaign in the Italian regions that had not started the mass vaccination yet, evaluating the results over time.

The included studies were published between 1975 and 2015, and the majority of them were conducted in Europe. We judged almost 50% of these studies to be at low risk of bias. The large majority (80%) of the comparisons were with placebo; only 8 studies included patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy comparing cannabis with other antiemetic drugs. Concerning the efficacy of cannabis (compared with placebo) in patients with multiple sclerosis, confidence in the estimate was high in favour of cannabis for spasticity (numerical rating scale and visual analogue scale, but not the Ashworth scale) and pain. For chronic and neuropathic pain (compared with placebo), there was evidence of a small effect; however, confidence in the estimate is low and these results could not be considered conclusive. There is uncertainty whether cannabis, including extracts and tinctures, compared with placebo or other antiemetic drugs reduces nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer requiring chemotherapy, although the confidence in the estimate of the effect was low or very low. In the included studies, many adverse events were reported and none of the studies assessed the development of abuse or dependence. there is incomplete evidence of the efficacy and safety of medical use of cannabis in the clinical contexts considered in this review. Furthermore, for many of the outcomes considered, the confidence in the estimate of the effect was again low or very low. To give conclusive answers to the efficacy and safety of cannabis used for medical purposes in the clinical contexts considered, further studies are needed, with higher quality, larger sample sizes, and possibly using the same diagnostic tools for evaluating outcomes of interest.

It was not possible to apply a best evidence approach to the study of liver cancer, and consequently it is not possible to distinguish between hepatic angiosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. The evidence of a causal link between vinyl chloride exposure and liver cancer is anyhow confirmed. The causal link between vinyl chloride exposure and lung cancer must be further investigated.

Both cause-specific and general mortality trends in Italians and in immigrants from DCs are lowering, while general mortality of immigrants from CHMRs seems to have risen in the last 5 years. Mortality of people from CHMRs for all causes, cardiovascular causes, and cancer is permanently lower than Italian population's mortality in the examined period, but the gap seems to progressively reduce. On the other hand, child mortality among immigrants from CHMRs, despite a declining trend, is consistently higher than Italian population's mortality. Following the SMR analysis, the only exceeding cause of mortality in people from CHMRs - compared to the Italian population - is homicide among men (SMR: 3.46; 95%CI 1.55-5.59). this study updates our knowledge on immigrants' mortality - and, indirectly, on their health status - in Tuscany. The gap between mortality of Italians and immigrants from CHMRs is reducing: this could be partially explained by a successful ongoing integration process. For future analyses, it would be important to obtain more complete data relative to non-resident immigrants' mortality, as their number is constantly increasing.

The annual rate ranges from 35.2 cases per 100.00 inhabitants in 2010 to 18.5 cases per 100.000 inhabitants in 2012. The median age of foreign-born patients was significantly lower than the one of Italian-born subjects (34 years; interquartile range - IQR: 28-41 vs. 63 years; IQR: 45-77; &lt;0.0001). The rate of cases in patients above 64 years and below 64 years was significantly different between Italian and foreign subjects (&lt;0.01); this dissimilarity remained significant even after stratification by gender. Males were the most affected, in line with regional and national data. The average delay between the date of onset of symptoms and the initiation of therapy was 59 days (IQR: 28-104). tuberculosis is a complex disease both from an epidemiological and a clinical point of view. This complexity is more relevant in areas where different ethnic groups live together.

These categories lose its meaning when used to study health phenomena. Rather, the epidemiological profile of such a heterogeneous population depends on the varying influence of health determinants in the life-course of migration. This article builds on those assumptions, and analyses the health of irregularly- staying immigrants by adopting a global approach to the migration phenomenon. The article aims at identifying cross-sectional elements of continuity and epidemiological dynamics in the different categories. Different factors, strictly interacting with each other, strongly influence the resulting picture. Specific push-factors primarily influence the starting phases (\"healthy migrant effect\") and the final stages of the migration process (\"salmon effect\"). These factors determine good health in these groups, but are also interwined with other dynamics, connected both with the social integration process (\"exhausted migrant effect\") and the relation with health services, which depends on the regional and local contexts of reference. Such dynamics have been thoroughly examined for \"economic migrants\" arriving on the Italian coasts. However, nowadays there is important evidence that the \"healthy migrant effect\" can be also applied to incoming international protection seekers, as demonstrated, for example, by the low prevalence of imported infectious diseases (including tuberculosis). Mental health deserves special attention and a particular final focus, for it is a topic still not adequately addressed, in spite of the high incidence of psychic problems, caused by violence endured either before or during the journey. In the framework of migration phenomena, health issues of irregularly staying immigrants stands hence as most vulnerable, due to the overlapping effects of departure and travel conditions, and of marginalization experienced by a wide group of them in the host Country. It is, therefore, essential to pursue a balanced management of this phenomenon - rich both in implications and in opportunities - by developing highly inclusive and evidence-based public policies.","484":null,"485":null,"486":null,"487":null,"488":"to compare Pap test and mammography uptake in 2005 and 2013 between Italian and immigrant women residing in Italy and to evaluate factors associated with probability of being up-to-date with screening testing in immigrant women. cross-sectional study based on data of \"Multipurpose survey on health and use of health services\" conducted in 2005 and 2013 by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat). the analysis includes the interviews of women included in the target age group for Pap test (25-64 years: No. 32,831) and mammography (50- 69 years: No. 16,459). Women resident in Italy with foreign citizenship are defined as \"immigrants\". standardized prevalence rates of women self-reporting having had a Pap test and a mammography in the absence of symptoms \"at least once in a lifetime\"; standardized prevalence ratio of up-to-date test uptake according to recommendation, i.e., in the last three years for Pap test and two years for mammography. A logistic regression model has been built to evaluate the association between up-to-date test uptake and demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural, and health service utilization factors in immigrant women. prevalence of Pap test and mammography uptake was lower in immigrants, both in 2005 and 2013. This difference reduced in 2013 due to a stronger increase in immigrants than in Italians, except for mammography. The increase in Pap test uptake among immigrant women was stronger in North-Eastern (+26,4%) and Central Italy (+26,4%), while in Southern Italy and in the Islands the increase was stronger among Italian women. Test uptake in immigrants increases with longer length of stay in Italy for both tests.

In the South of Italy, the uptake is very low also for Italian women, with prevalence lower than immigrants in Northern Italy. This phenomenon suggests that high accessibility to screening facilities is effective in increasing uptake in both Italian and immigrant women.

The main hypothesis explaining association between thunderstorms and asthma claims that thunderstorms can concentrate pollen grains at ground level; these grains may then release allergenic particles of respirable size in the atmosphere after their rupture by osmotic shock. During the first 20-30 minutes of a thunderstorm, patients suffering from pollen allergy may inhale a high concentration of the allergenic material dispersed into the atmosphere, which can, in turn, induce asthmatic reactions, often severe. Subjects without asthma symptoms but affected by seasonal rhinitis can also experience an asthma attack. All subjects affected by pollen allergy should be alerted to the danger of being outdoors during a thunderstorm in the pollen season, as such events may be an important cause of severe bronchial obstruction. Considering this background, it is useful to predict thunderstorms during pollen season and, thus, to prevent thunderstorm-related clinical event.

Analyses of the relationship between mortality\/CMs and ID-SENTIERI were carried out according to cause, region, gender, and demographic amplitude classes using a GAM-Poisson regression model. the mortality analyses show that, for the male population of the three regions under study, the relationship between ID and mortality is increasing for each outcome for municipalities with less than 50,000 inhabitants; while results for female population differ from region to region. The results of the CMs show growing associations, considering only municipalities under 10,000 inhabitants. the results of the study suggest that scientific evidence of an association between SES and health should be evaluated taking into account the gender, the study area, and the demographic size of the municipalities. For ID to be used as a confounding variable, it must be associated with the outcomes for which the influence of socioeconomic factors in the reference areas has been ascertained.

","537":"\"Nudge, or nudging, refers to a policy approach inspired by behavioral sciences: it promotes the conducts identified as desirable by regulators without applying prohibition and coercion. This approach has gained a lot of momentum in the domain of health policies. Policy strategies based on behavioral insights appear ideal as to implementing healthier life styles and public health programs while minimizing compliance costs: from organ donation to food choices, from fighting obesity and chronic diseases to screening policies. Nudging, however, is not exempt from problems, especially in the sector of health, where individual free and informed consent constitutes a founding principle. Cancer screening programs, and especially breast cancer population tests, represent an interesting example for nudging strategies which have been widely applied but have also raised serious criticisms. Despite having been widely adopted by health systems, from the United States to the European Union, breast cancer screening programs keep raising debates about their actual impact on reducing mortality, risks of overdiagnosing and unnecessary or harmful treatments. In challenging the validity of screening programs, these controversies also affect their efficacy. Nudging has therefore been seen as a potentially useful tool in increasing participation, even though the extent of its actual impact remains ambiguous and problematic. For nudging to represent a relevant, powerful policy instrument its legitimacy requirements need to be identified. These concern the \"right place\" of behavioral-based measures within the traditional regulatory framework.

Exposure to asbestos has been linked with cancer at several levels of the gastrointestinal tract, and it has been documented, in an animal model, a direct cytotoxic effect of asbestos fibres on the ileum. It has been recently described a possible link between asbestos and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and asbestos fibres have been detected in humans in histological samples from colon cancer and in gallbladder bile. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of an enterohepatic translocation of asbestos fibres, alternative to lymphatic translocation from lungs. In animal models, asbestos fibres ingested with drinking water act as a co-carcinogen in the presence of benzo(a) pyrene and, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC ), there is evidence pointing to a causal effect of ingested asbestos on gastric and colorectal cancer. The risk seems to be proportional to the concentration of ingested fibres, to the extent of individual water consumption, to exposure timing, and to the possible exposure to other toxics (i.e., benzo(a)pyrene). Furthermore, the exposure to asbestos by ingestion could explain the epidemiological finding of mesothelioma in subjects certainly unexposed by inhalation. In conclusion, several findings suggest that health risks from asbestos could not exclusively derive from inhalation of fibres. Health hazards might also be present after ingestion, mainly after daily ingestion of drinking water for long periods. In Italy, a systemic assessment of the presence of asbestos fibres in drinking water is still lacking, although asbestos-coated pipelines are widely diffused and still operating. Despite the fact that the existence of a threshold level for health risks linked to the presence of asbestos in drinking water is still under debate, the precautionary principle should impose all possible efforts in order to revise health policies concerning this topic, and a systematic monitoring of drinking water to quantify the presence of asbestos is certainly needed in all regions.

The results of this report will be communicated to national and local institutions, as well as to NPCSs resident populations.","561":"in Italy, National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) are defined as of concern for remediation; most of them are sites with a long-lasting industrial activity. the study aims to estimate the burden of disease from mesothelioma in NPCSs. mesothelioma incidence in the period 2000-2011 was estimated for the populations residing in the 39 Italian NPCSs. Data were taken from the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM). NPCSs were ranked into risk groups (RGs) on the basis of the presence of the following asbestos-exposing activities: 1. asbestos-cement plants; 2. asbestos mines; 3. harbours with shipyards; 4. illegal dumping sites containing asbestos; 5. petrochemicals and\/or refineries, and\/or steel plants; 6. chemical plants and\/or landfills without explicit mention of asbestos. For the population residing in each NPCS, crude rates per 100,000 per year and number of observed minus expected cases (Obs-Exp) by gender were computed. Expected cases were calculated using the age-class rates of a reference population (the geographical macroarea of every NPCS). For every RG, the meta-analytic estimate of the attributable proportion (AP), i.e., the proportion of cases attributable to the local context, was computed, being the AP for each NPCS expressed as (Obs-Exp\/Obs) x100. the total number of mesothelioma cases estimated in the considered period of 12 years is 2,741 (2,048 males, 693 females). The total number of Obs-Exp cases was 1,531 (1,178 in males, 353 in females). In males, crude rate ranges from 71.5 in the RG1 to 3.0 in RG4, while in females it ranges from 48.4 in RG1 to 0.6 in RG4. In males, AP in RGs from 1 to 3 is over 65%, in RG4 is 59%, in RG5 is 30%, in RG6 is -14%. AP in females gradually drops from 95% in RG1 to -64% in RG6. the burden of mesothelioma in populations residing in NPCSs is high, with an AP gradient consistent with the a priori RG. This burden impacts on females in a different way: rates are lower than male ones; AP is similar to male ones in the RGs 1 and 3. ","562":"Mesothelioma incidence has been analyzed in National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) to estimate the health impact of asbestos exposure on resident people. The burden of professional and environmental exposures has been identified through data of the Regional Operational Centres (CORs), made available by the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM). An excess of mesothelioma incidence is confirmed in sites with a known past history of direct use of asbestos, such as Balangero, Casale Monferrato, Broni, Bari-Fibronit, and in coastal areas, where shipyards, harbours and other industries that involved a wide use of asbestos are represented (e.g., Trieste, La Spezia, Venice, and Leghorn). An excess of mesothelioma has been observed in settings where the asbestos is not mentioned as contaminant in the decree that included these sites among NPCSs, such as Cengio and Saliceto in Northern Italy; Falconara Marittima and the Bacino Idrografico Fiume Sacco in the Central Italy; the Litorale Domizio Flegreo and Agro Aversano, Milazzo, and Gela in the Southern Italy. Observed excess in the various NPCSs confirms the large-scale occurrence in contaminated Italian sites of a significant amount of total mesothelioma cases observed at national level. The analysis of occupational risk in epidemiological studies with an ecological design helps in defining the contribution of different factors to the overall risk.","563":"In the framework of SENTIERI Project, this study is aimed to identify excess risks of malignant mesothelioma (MM) in Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) included in the national environmental remediation programme and to discuss the results by means of data available from the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM). Re- NaM has a regional structure with Regional Operational Centres (CORs) in charge of identifying mesothelioma incident cases and defining the asbestos exposure modalities thought an individual questionnaire. Starting from the 44 NPCSs selected in SENTIERI Project, we excluded Calabria and Sardinia Regions from the analyses (3 NPCSs). Furthermore, for 2 sites (Emarese in Valle d'Aosta and Tito in Basilicata) no incident MM cases have been detected in the considered period. Incident cases of MM and Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIR), with corresponding 90% confidence intervals, have been estimated in each NPCS, for both gender, in the period 2000-2011. Age-standardized rates of Italian geographical macro-areas (North- East, North-West, Centre, South and Islands) have been used to estimate expected cases. For every analyzed site, the occupational and non-occupational asbestos exposure modalities are discussed.","564":"The purpose of the SENTIERI-ReNaM Project is to analyse the incidence of mesothelioma in Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) in order to estimate the health impact of asbestos on resident populations, disentangling the role of occupational and environmental exposures. SENTIERI Project has provided the relevant information on geographic and demographic structure of NPCSs and on existing sources of contamination. The Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM), that covers the whole country through its Regional Operational Centres (CORs), has made available the procedures for estimating the incidence of mesothelioma in NPCSs and for assessing occupational and environmental asbestos exposure of the individual cases. The synergy between these two epidemiological surveillance systems lay also the ground for communication programmes with the affected communities.","565":"The purpose of SENTIERI-ReNaM Project is to describe mesothelioma incidence in the Italian National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs). The present report deals with 39 NPCSs (20 in Northern Italy, 8 in Central Italy and 11 in Southern Italy). Asbestos is specifically mentioned in the regulatory acts of recognition for 10 NPCSs and it is the only agent that has determined environmental contamination in 3 of them (Casale Monferrato, Broni, and Bari). The timeframe of the study is 2000-2011 for 34 out of 39 sites. The corresponding reference periods for the sites of Latium, Campania, Umbria, and Bolzano Province are, respectively, 2001-2011, 2005-2011, and 2006-2011. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) for mesothelioma, with their corresponding 90% Confidence Intervals, have been estimated for all sites. The interpretation of the study findings has been based on anamnestic information made available by the Italian National Mesothelioma Registry (ReNaM), and completed thanks to knowledge derived from the international scientific literature. In men, mesothelioma incidence has shown excesses in 27\/39 sites and defects in the remaining 12; in women, excesses have been reported in 20 sites, defects in 15, and no cases have been detected in the remaining 4 sites. The highest annual incidence rates have been observed in the sites characterized only by the presence of asbestos- cement factories (Broni and Casale Monferrato): respectively, 98.0 and 68.6 per 100,000 per year in men, 72.1 and 45.8 in women. Besides these two sites, the highest rates have been observed in the sites with naval shipyards: 13.2 in men and 2.5 in women. Excesses of mesothelioma incidence have been confirmed (with respect to previous observations) in the sites of Broni, Casale Monferrato, Balangero, and in the coastal areas of Trieste, La Spezia, Venice, and Leghorn. Balangero has been the major European chrysotile quarry, while the other sites are characterized by the presence of naval shipyards with demonstrated use of asbestos before it was banned in 1992. An excess of mesothelioma incidence has also been confirmed in the site of Biancavilla, characterized by the presence of the fluoro-edenite fibrous amphibole, classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). An increased incidence of mesothelioma was also observed in the areas where no direct use of asbestos had previously been documented, like Cengio and Saliceto (chemical industry), Falconara on Sea (oil refinery), and Litorale Domizio Flegreo and Agro Aversano (a large area including multiple hazardous waste dumping sites). These findings show that a relevant proportion of Italian mesothelioma cases is concentrated in NPCSs. About 1,500 extra cases of mesothelioma have been estimated in the overall series of 39 sites (2000-2011), corresponding to 125 extra cases per year. The excess has concerned the sites with manufacture of asbestos-cement products, but also the areas with asbestos quarries, naval shipyards, illegal hazardous waste dumping sites with asbestos-containing materials, petrochemical industries, refineries and steel plants. In some sites, particularly Casale Monferrato and Broni, analytical epidemiological studies have shown the causal role of not only occupational, but also environmental exposures, with special reference to paving of gardens and courtyards with asbestos-cement industry by-products. The main novelty generated by the collaborative SENTIERI-ReNaM Project concerns the detection of significant mesothelioma excesses not only in sites where asbestos is explicitly reported as a source of contamination, but also in a number of areas defined \"of national interest\" for environmental cleanup due to other sources of pollution. This confirms that the range of economic activities and working and living environments affected by asbestos exposure is very wide and it is not restricted to the industrial sectors characterized by the direct use of this material.","566":"Communication is an essential but complex aspect of the management of a suspected cancer cluster. In this paper, it is summarized how this issue has been addressed in the guidelines on the management of cluster developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in the US and by the Institut de Veille Sanitaire in France. The US guidelines recommend a communication strategy that includes a basic plan, which must be adapted to all steps of the process, a transparent communication, the involvement of the local community, the definition of the subjects involved, and the development of the necessary tools. The French guidelines emphasize that the management of these alarms is both a health and a policy issue, highlighting that this fact has important implications in the communication strategy. Guidelines are useful tools; however, they can lead to an excessive use of proceduralization if the ability to detect features of each cluster is not improved. It is therefore essential to create the opportunity to discuss and share experiences among stakeholders who are actually entitled to respond to these alarms. Some experiences of cancer cluster in Tuscany are used as examples.","567":"Statistical analysis represents a critical point in cluster analysis, because a methodology able to take into consideration the complexity of this analysis has not yet been developed. However, a common approach in statistical analysis of a suspected cluster is a necessary tool for public health operators who have to face population worries and requests. We propose an approach for the analysis of clusters and discuss the main limitations and strengths of the used methods. To this aim, we present, as a case study, the spatial clustering analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases among children in Rome between 2000 and 2011. Cases were selected through a record linkage of three different health and administrative current databases. Cases were geocoded at 3 spatial resolutions: 20 districts (D), 155 neighbourhoods (NB), and 5,812 census areas (CA). Indirect standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were computed for the NBs with Rome average incidence rate (IR) of ALL as reference and then smoothed by Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) model. General clustering was tested by Tango statistics, whereas localized clustering was detected through two different statistics: Besag and Newell's, and Kulldorf and Nagarwalla's. Both general and local clustering were tested at city level, using NBs as area units, and at district level, using CAs as area units. We identified 194 ALL cases in the 0-14 age group (IR: 43.7x1,000,000). SIRs ranged between 0.00 and 18.1 among NBs. After smoothing, a significant excess of cases was identified only in 3 Ds. At city level, no general clustering was highlighted (Tango's test p-value: 0.08), while both tests for local clustering were significant in one of the 3 Ds with the highest SIRs. Finally, at district level, although no general cluster was founded, a total of 7 clusters were identified in the 3 Ds with the highest SIRs, each cluster being composed by a number of cases ranging between 2 and 6. Results indicate the presence of clusters in some areas of Rome, which are evident only when the finest spatial resolution is used. This standardised procedure is an important tool to properly analyse potential clusters.","568":"This paper describes the conceptual framework and the critical issues of investigations of clusters of childhood cancers and defines an investigative model for the health authorities responsible for assessing a suspected cluster, taking into account the guidelines available and considering the most recent advances of the Geographical Information System and of the specific statistical methodology. Three main investigation phases are identified: the first consists in the preliminary study on the health of population living in the area where the cases are defined and aetiological hypotheses are formulated; the second is the cluster evaluation study using statistical methods assessing the spatial heterogeneity and collecting information about potential risk factors; the third is the analytical epidemiological study to test aetiological hypotheses suggested by the previous phases. The residential cohort approach is the most valid to date to assess long-term effects, and allows to reconstruct the lifetime residential history from the population registry. The researchers' decision on how detailed about a suspected cluster the investigation has to be needs to take into account both the level of alarm in the population and the limited resources available. The concern about a suspected cluster of cancer cases should always be addressed, even if this implies to acknowledge limits of research and uncertainty in results interpretation.","569":"Since the first report of a possible cluster of childhood leukaemia in 1963, many studies have shown a tendency to clustering in space and\/or in time of this disease. This paper summarizes the studies about clusters of childhood leukaemia in the international context and in Italy, and discusses the aetiological hypotheses particularly in reference to exposures in the area of residence. Thirty-three cluster studies have been identified through a literature search performed using the PubMed bibliographic database, websites of main national and international health authorities, and relevant reviews published on this topic. Most of leukaemia cluster studies were conducted following an alarm in the nearby areas of a point source of toxic substances as nuclear power plants, chemical-industrial sites, military bases, broadcasting antennas. As alternative explanation, in several clusters an infectious aetiology was hypothesized (population mixing or delayed infection hypothesis). The uncertainty associated with cluster investigations underlines the importance of applying rigorous methods and transparent decision making, involving parents of children with cancer and the local community, and taking into account all potential aetiological factors, especially those for which a biological plausibility exists.","570":"We developed an algorithm to select incident cases of lymphatic and haematopoietic system in children, in order to create a timely and accurate database of incident cases to answer the needs of cluster analysis. This group of cancers is by far the most frequent in the paediatric age. The procedure has been applied to identify incident cases in children aged 0-14 years, resident in Rome (Central Italy), and diagnosed between 2000 and 2011. The algorithm links hospital discharge records (SDO), the hospital registry of the Italian Association of paediatric haematology and oncology (AIEOP), and the Population Registry. We identified 391 cases of cancers of lymphatic and haematopoietic system; among them, the most frequent pathology is the lymphoid leukaemia, which represents 52% of total cases, followed by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (21% of total cases). Results correspond to data from literature and to the estimates from the Italian Association of cancer registries (AIRTUM), giving value to the used procedure.","571":"The study of cluster requires the ability to identify, with accuracy and completeness, the health events of interest and their geographical location and time of occurrence. For rare and complex diseases, such as childhood cancers, it is possible to observe a significant health migration from the place of residence, which makes the detection even more complex. The best tool to identify these rare diseases is represented by cancer registries (CRs). In fact, CRs collect, through many sources, information related to tumours that arise in the population resident in their areas of activity. The number of the sources of information has increased thanks to the computerization of health services. The availability of multiple sources of information increases the completeness of data collection overcoming the limits of a single source, and makes it possible to describe the diagnostic-therapeutic course and the outcome of the cases. Among all data sources, for childhood cancers the model 1.01, which summarize the clinical information of the cases treated in one of the Italian Association of paediatric haematology and oncology (AIEOP) centres, is relevant. Moreover, CRs produce reliable and comparable data due to the use of international rules and classifications for the definition of the topography and morphology of cancer, for the date of diagnosis, and for quality checks. In Italy, the Italian association of cancer registries (AIRTUM) coordinates the activities of 45 population CRs, both general and specialized (by age or tumour type). AIRTUM involves a population of over 6.7 million citizens under the age of 20 years, approximately 60% of the total resident population. AIRTUM plays a role of coordination, support, and harmonization for Italian CRs through training, accreditation, and a shared database, it promotes and participates in national and international collaboration involving scientific societies (AIEOP, Italian Association of medical oncology - AIOM, Italian Federation of volunteer-based cancer organisations - FAVO) and institutions (Italian national Institute of health, Italian national cancer institute of Milan) and performs analysis on key epidemiological indicators (incidence, mortality, survival, and prevalence). The AIRTUM database contains 19,650 cancer cases in child\/ adolescent patients diagnosed from 1967 to 2011. The epidemiology of childhood cancers has been the subject of two AIRTUM monographs published in 2008 and in 2013 in collaboration with AIEOP; the latter includes specific contributions on polluted sites, on the psychological side, and on the experience of the parents of young cancer patients. The collaboration between different professionals, needs, and knowledge is the policy followed by AIRTUM to build up a complete picture of cancer epidemiology, even of childhood cancer, in Italy.","572":"Since 1972, children affected by cancer took advantage from multi-centric diagnostic and therapeutic protocols produced by the Italian Association of paediatric haematology and oncology (AIEOP). At the beginning, these protocols were used in few well-trained centres, later in almost all Italian haemato-oncological centres. The need of a careful monitoring of his own activity induced AIEOP to achieve, in 1989, an Italian hospital- based registry (database Mod.1.01) of malignant tumours diagnosed and treated in the participating centres, with the aim to quantify the number of cases diagnosed and treated in the different centres, the agreement (or not) to official diagnostic- therapeutic protocols, and the extraregional migration. The database Mod.1.01, which is available via web to the current 55 AIEOP centres since 2000, recruits annually about 1,400 children (0-14 years) and 200 adolescents (15-19 years). While the first accounts for over 90% of expected subjects, the latter are only 25%. Leukaemias (30% of cases) are the most frequent childhood cancers, followed by central nervous system (CNS) tumours and lymphomas, 18% of cases both. In children, leukaemias (34%) are prevalent, mostly acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (26%), followed by CNS tumours (18%); in adolescents, lymphomas (30%) are prevalent, mostly Hodgkin lymphomas (22%), followed by bone sarcomas (16%). The recruitment of registered cases in AIEOP protocols is overall good both for children (70%) and for adolescents (60%), achieving outstanding results in leukaemia protocols. Extraregional migration of patients for diagnosis and therapy is decreasing over time, being currently about 20%, higher in adolescents, in solid tumours, and in residents in South Italy and in the islands. On the contrary, an increase of subjects born and resident abroad who are hospitalised in AIEOP centres for diagnosis and treatment, accounting at present for 5% of all cases, was observed. The results confirm that the database Mod.1.01 can be a valid tool able to contribute to epidemiologic research on childhood cancer in Italy.","573":"","574":"A recent US cohort study estimated 500 cancer cases attributable to exposure to CT out of 600,000 children aged &lt;15 years who underwent a computed tomography (CT) to head or abdomen. This review synthetizes the evidence on the association between exposure to ionizing radiation through CT and cancer risk. Five cohort studies were identified. Three studies show clear increases in cancer risk among children and adolescents who underwent at least one CT. All studies had methodological limits, among which the lack of an individual level estimate of dose-organ specific absorbed by patient and problems of statistical power. Results from on-going large international studies will allow a more accurate risk estimation.","575":"We present an updated summary on risk factors for childhood malignancies, following to previous reviews published on Epidemiologia&amp;Prevenzione and largely based on the monographs of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Ionizing radiations are certain carcinogens, with evidence in humans, from studies both on children and on adults. Evidence specifically regarding childhood cancers is available also for other carcinogens, such as tobacco smoking, some solvents, some occupational activities of parents, and some viruses (HIV and EBV). For most carcinogens, information specifically regarding childhood cancer risks is limited, but it is enough to suggest the reduction of exposure, according to a precautionary approach. Available evidence can be helpful in evaluating reports of possible clusters of disease and the association with putative causes.","576":"This paper introduces a Monograph on childhood cancer clusters addressed to Italian public health workers, paediatricians and paediatric oncologists, and the general public. Two issues have been underlined in most definitions of cancer clusters reported in the literature over the last 30 years. The first is the need for an unbiased methodological approach for the detection and the interpretation of clustering and of individual clusters. The other is the responsibility for scientists and public health workers to unravel suspicious events and to interact with the population in circumstances which may turn out to be false alarms. The relative weight given to epidemiological methods and to risk perception has varied between definitions of clusters given in different periods. In the field of childhood cancer clusters, epidemiological research has produced very little fresh knowledge. However, it is recognized that this is not a sufficient reason for refusing to pay attention to reports of perceived clusters. Models of spatio-temporal interactions according to Birch et al. (2000) are taken in consideration: the literature offers a very limited number of circumstances fitting such models. In Italy, over the years, only two childhood cancer clusters have been reported in the indexed literature, both of them regarded cases of acute lymphatic leukaemia and occurred in Sardinia in the Eighties and in the area of Roma in the Nineties. A possible reason for the paucity of reports (compared, for instance, to the UK scenario) is the limited availability of health statistics.","577":"","578":"","579":"","580":"","581":null,"582":null,"583":null,"584":null,"585":null,"586":null,"587":null,"588":null,"589":null,"590":null,"591":"","592":"","593":"","594":"","595":"","596":null,"597":"As part of the strategies to promote health in urban areas, the Italian Society of Hygiene (SItI) has updated its recommendations for healthy, safe and sustainable housing.

This paper brings forward a multi-methodological approach for assessing the quality of open spaces by the assignment of a composite score. The study combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) with the aim of proposing urban quality maps. Open spaces, including green and walkable areas, streets and squares are evaluated with respect to the following attributes: accessibility, liveability, vitality, and identity.

A dialogue among communities, urban planning, and prevention know-how is a prerequisite to develop a system of policies suitable to promote healthy lifestyle in general and, specifically, active lifestyles. The 2015-2018 Lombardy PRP pursues its aims of health promotion and behavioural risk factors for NCDs prevention through programmes that implement their own setting networks (Health Promoting Schools - SPS; Workplace Health Promotion - WHP) and develop new networks. Sedentary lifestyle prevention and active lifestyle promotion are performed through the approach promoted by the Healthy Cities Programme (WHO), encouraging two main processes: 1. creating integrated capacity-building among health and social prevention services, academic research, and local stakeholders on different urban planning and design issues; 2. promoting community empowerment through active citizens participation. Through this process, Lombardy Region aims to orient its services developing evidence-based programmes and enhancing advocacy and mediating capacity skills in order to create a profitable partnership with non-health sectors.

","602":"Enrico Modigliani (1877-1931) was an Italian paediatrician of the early Twentieth century whose work anticipated modern concepts of maternal and child health. Convinced of the importance of creating a network of health and social care for children born out-of-wedlock, he began by providing care to single mothers and their babies at his home on Sundays. In 1918, in Rome, he established the Institution for Maternal Assistance, which aim was to provide single mothers with basic health information as well as tools to face their socioeconomic situation. The Opera encouraged breastfeeding and maternal acknowledgement of the child and promoted the establishment of lactation rooms and nurseries within factories. Moreover, women were supported to find a job which was compatible with their situation. In the first five years of activity, over 1,000 unmarried women were assisted; 95% of them acknowledged their children and 52% found a job. The infant mortality rate fell to 11%, which was much lower than the 35% observed at the time among the social classes which Modigliani called the most miserable. This article reviews Modigliani's paper, in which the paediatrician reported the first five years of activity of the Institution of Maternal Assistance and where he largely focused on the social factors surrounding illegitimate motherhood.

Systematic reviews of epidemiological and individual studies reporting association estimates between the outcome (CHDs) and at least one of the risk factors were selected. studies on industries and landfills exposures provided limited evidence of increased risk of CHDs associated with the proximity of maternal residence to the sites. Inadequate evidence was found for positive association between exposure to mines or incinerators and risk of CHDs. Regarding maternal cigarette smoking, literature provided sufficient evidence of an increased risk of CHDs in offspring. A limited evidence of an increased risk of CHDs among pregnant women working in agriculture or exposed to solvents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emerged. Sufficient epidemiological evidence emerged for the association between CHDs and maternal exposure to high concentrations of NO2 and SO2. meta-analysis results should be interpreted with caution as they are based on a few studies, some of which are subject to high heterogeneity.

Quality of death certificate reports has been improved over time, but they are still inaccurate, making it difficult to assess time trends in mortality. to evaluate the accuracy of the topographic coding of causes of death and to estimate the mortality time trend for cervical cancer through the method of incidence-based mortality (IBM) using cancer registry (CR) data. from the mortality registry (MR), we extracted data on deaths for cervix uteri cancer, corpus uteri cancer, and uterus cancer not otherwise specified (NOS) referred to residents in Reggio Emilia (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) from 1997 to 2013. Deaths were checked with the CR to verify the topographical site of the primary tumour. Furthermore, by using CR data, we constructed a cohort of incident cervical cancer cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 with a 5-year follow-up. We calculated cause-specific IBM (excluding ovary) and IBM for all cause, crude and standardized, and annual percentage change (APC). out of 369 deaths for uterine cancer, 269 were reported in the RT: 32 for cervix uteri cancer, 76 for corpus uteri cancer, 161 for uterus cancer NOS. 28 of the 32 persons who died for cervical cancer were incidents for cervix uteri cancer. 63 of the 76 who died for corpus uteri cancer were incidents for corpus uteri cancer. Of the 161 who died of uterus cancer NOS, 80 were incidents for corpus uteri cancer, 45 for cervix uteri cancer, 28 for uterus cancer NOS, 5 for vagina cancer, and 3 for cancer of other non-specified organs. Applying these proportions of misclassification, we can estimate that the real number of cervical cancer deaths is 2.4 folds the number of cases reported in the MR as cervical cancer. IBM for all causes decreased significantly over the years (APC: -9.5; 95%CI -17.1;-1.1); cause-specific IBM decreases, but not significantly (APC: -5.1; 95%IC -16.1;+7.3). There is no improvement in survival (r2=0.02; p=0.6), while the incidence shows a decrease (APC: -6.6;95%CI -10.0;-3.0). mortality for cervical cancer is still underestimated by deaths certificates: for each reported case, there are other 1.4 cases that are reported with other less specific causes.

As a consequence, relevant differences in the estimates have been frequently found, even for nearby cities with similar environmental and sociodemographic characteristics. This article aims at showing the variability of effect estimates for small- to medium-size cities in relation to the extent of the considered time frame, highlighting quantitatively the caution that must be taken in interpreting and communicating the results derived from short time series of data.

For the period before ICD-10 implementation (1970-2002) and when Istat data (2004-2005) are lacking, mesothelioma deaths were estimated through statistical models (logistic, Poisson). National incidence and mortality data were compared during the overlapping period (2003, 2006-2008). the mortality curve strongly rises from 1970 and seems to be smoothed in the last years. Mortality caused by mesothelioma and incident cases with certain diagnosis are overlapping, as are mortality due to pleural cancer other than mesothelioma and mesothelioma incidence with uncertain diagnosis (probable\/possible). this epidemiological analysis of deaths encoded as pleural tumour suggests to carefully investigate space-temporal distribution before excluding they could be mesotheliomas.

Sex ratio was not significantly modified in comparison with local and regional values. Several indicators in each area were similar when compared with the local reference population or with regional population. Stillbirths were significantly higher only in Augusta-Priolo area vs. the local population (OR: 2.26; CI95% 1.07-4.80), and slightly higher vs. regional population.

In the case of the L'Aquila earthquake this risk seems to emerge within the urban planning on two levels of dwelling: at a landscape level, where there has been a change in the shape of the city towards a sprawling-sprinkling process; at an architectural level, on the problematic relationship between the politics and the poetics of cultural heritage protection and the goal to get restoration works capable to ensure the citizens seismic safety. ","621":"Since 2010, the Cartolab Laboratory research team (Department of Human Studies, University of L'Aquila) has been investigating the social geography in the post-earthquake period through the analysis of the territorial changes and new sociospatial configurations occurred in the everyday life of the L'Aquila inhabitants. Accordingly, this paper aims to describe the principal results of researches concentrating on the use of leisure time and leisure places in the post-disaster period in L'Aquila. The paper uses an action-research\/participating- participatory (RAPP) methodology. The paper presents the monitored changes occurred in leisure time and places, and compares them with the conditions before the earthquake. Primary data have been retrieved by surveys and interviews. Results indicate that acceleration of fragmentation and dispersion of inhabitants are the main characteristics of the new sociospatial configuration in the post-disaster period in L'Aquila. ","622":"to consider perceptions and narratives of the inhabitants of L'Aquila about their context of life, in order to point out what kind of relationship is present in L'Aquila, between the territory and its inhabitants after the earthquake; to evaluate how and where symptomatic attitudes about a widespread discomfort in social interactions have been generalized. since 2010, the joint work by the research team of the \"Cartolab\" laboratory and pedagogy area (Department of Human Studies, University of L'Aquila) has developed and applied a participatory research methodology. This methodology is both an inquiry used by experts to increase the participation of people who experience the everyday life in L'Aquila, and a tool to draw moral, ethical and political considerations in order to activate change in social and political dynamics at the urban scale. During 2013, the methodology of Participatory- Participating Research Action (PPRA) was implemented through cycles of territorial meetings involving citizens and municipal administrators. These meetings have been promoted and organized with the Office of Participation of the Municipality of L'Aquila. the PPRA aimed to assess: 1. the social, political and economic quality of the territory evaluated by people involved in the survey, with reference to life conditions, living context, and future projections of self and of the territory; 2. the perception of the security. Through a qualitative\/quantitative approach, the data collected through questionnaire and public meetings have involved 309 young (16-30 years old) and 227 adults (31-85 years old) for the first aspect, and 314 citizens (16-80 years old) for the second aspect, respectively. the results highlight a socioterritorial discomfort emerging in L'Aquila for a relevant part of the population. This discomfort is shaped by a negative rating on life conditions and context: adults provide poor quality evaluations about the present and cannot figure out some kind of vision for the future. From the point of view of young people, even though the spatial projection into the present appears more objective and pondered over real data, the projection into the future turns out even more pessimistic then the adults' one. Finally, the discomfort is shaped by a deterioration in the state of coexistence; and a high perception of insecurity, especially among those who live in the new residential earthquake- proofing complex called CASE. the quality of the relationship inhabitantterritory has important consequences about the comfort of the population in the present and in the future. Such relationship may have an influence on individual and collective behaviours. Therefore, territorial and local governments are required to provide for measures preventing such discomfort. This implies to bring attention on topics that target individuals such as fear, loneliness, alcohol abuse, as well as communities, such as vandalism of public goods and spaces. ","623":"The use of mortality data in L'Aquila public health post-earthquake experience considered as a population's health status indicator is completely missed. The deficit of regional and local epidemiological network in the period preceding the earthquake has clearly revealed a lack of specific activity, for example public reporting of morbidity and mortality in the seismic crater. This absence of a systematic use of current statistics needs a serious reflection concerning investments that regional public health needs to carry out on this topic.

The respondents were 569 elderly, equally represented by gender; 57% was 65-74 years old, 25% was 75-79 years old, and 18% was more than 80 years old. the study showed that the negative perception of health status is significantly associated with delocalization, female gender, more advanced age, low education, and living with a person not belonging to the family unit. Among people who perceive health in a negative way and live in temporary housing, the inability to perform daily activities, and therefore a lower degree of self-sufficiency, was detected more frequently. Even the presence of certain chronic degenerative diseases (even if self-reported) contributes to the negative perception. This is associated with a decrease in the ability to perform daily activities. the living conditions and the traditional determinants of old age negatively affect the perception of health status. Relocation and the absence of infrastructure change everyday life and affect judgment on one's health. ","626":"to assess the presence of a characteristic coping strategy profile in a wide sample of preadolescents following a traumatic exposure (i.e., L'Aquila earthquake). we have investigated the coping strategies through the Brief-Cope Coping Orientation towards Problems Experienced - new Italian version (COPE-NVI) devised to measure coping strategies on five levels: problem-oriented coping strategies, avoidance strategies, social-support strategies, positive attitude, transcendent orientation. 129 preadolescents exposed (75 females and 54 males) and 107 non-exposed to the trauma (54 females and 53 males), age-ranged 11-14 years, coming from L'Aquila and from another Italian region far away from the epicentre of the earthquake. The trauma exposure was assessed through a checklist considering the presence of negative factors such as death of relatives and friends and displacement from home. Participants were tested collectively at school during school time in accordance with their teacher. An exclusion criterion was the presence of psychic disorders following or preceding the trauma. the need to develop a diagnostic protocol including coping measures aim to planning preventive actions for avoiding post-traumatic diseases. the trauma exposure without consequent psychiatric disorders causes a high heterogeneity within coping dimensions, such phenomenon does not happen in the non-exposed group. Coping strategies are not affected by age and gender, but only by the exposure to the trauma. Furthermore, death of relatives\/friends and displacements from home predict the use of specific coping strategies (i.e., social-support strategies and transcendent orientation). coping is a dynamic process of adjustment to critical events that requires to direct cognitive and behavioural resources. The trauma exposure modifies coping strategies and dimensions. This study shows the importance to use coping tools for helping people in using positive and active resource of coping.

They need emergency assistance and immediate structured support according to definite protocols and quality standards. We recommend to establish national guidelines for taking-in-charge people with autism after an earthquake. The adaptive behaviour of participants with autism declined dramatically in the first months after the earthquake in all the dimensions examined (i.e., communication, daily living, socialisation, and motor skills). After relatively stable conditions returned and with immediate and intensive post-disaster intervention, children and adolescents with autism showed a trend towards partial recovery of adaptive functioning. As to the impact on services, this study indicates the need for supporting exposed caregivers at high risk of burnout over the first two years after the disaster and for an immediate reorganisation of person-tailored services. ","628":"Altered sleep is a common and central symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In fact, sleep disturbances are included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for PTSD. However, it has been hypothesized that sleep disturbances are crucially involved in the aetiology of PTSD, rather than being solely a symptom arising secondarily from this disorder. Therefore, knowing the long-term effects of a trauma can be essential to establish the need of specific interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders that may persist years after a traumatic experience. In one study we showed, for the first time, that even after a period of two years people exposed to a catastrophic disaster such as the L'Aquila earthquake continue to suffer from a reduced sleep quality. Moreover, we observed that sleep quality scores decreased as a function of the proximity to the epicentre, suggesting that the psychological effects of an earthquake may be pervasive and long-lasting. It has been widely shown that disruption of sleep by acute stress may lead to deterioration in memory processing. In fact, in a recent study we observed alterations in spatial memory in PTSD subjects. Our findings indicated that PTSD is accompanied by an impressive deficit in forming a cognitive map of the environment, as well as in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The fact that this deterioration was correlated to the subjective sleep disturbances in our PTSD group demonstrates the existence of an intimate relationship between sleep, memory consolidation, and stress. ","629":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a chronic anxiety disorder. The continued efforts to control the distressing memories by traumatized individuals, together with the reduction of responsiveness to the outside world, are called Emotional Numbing (EN). The EN is one of the central symptoms in PTSD and it plays an integral role not only in the development and maintenance of post-traumatic symptomatology, but also in the disability of emotional regulation. This disorder shows an abnormal response of cortical and limbic regions which are normally involved in understanding emotions since the very earliest stages of the development of processing ability. Patients with PTSD exhibit exaggerated brain responses to emotionally negative stimuli. Identifying the neural correlates of emotion regulation in these subjects is important for elucidating the neural circuitry involved in emotional and empathic dysfunction. We showed that PTSD patients, all survivors of the L'Aquila 2009 earthquake, have a higher sensitivity to negative emotion and lower empathy levels. These emotional and empathic deficits are accompanied by neural brain functional correlates. Indeed PTSD subjects exhibit functional abnormalities in brain regions that are involved in stress regulation and emotional responses. The reduced activation of the frontal areas and a stronger activation of the limbic areas when responding to emotional stimuli could lead the subjects to enact coping strategies aimed at protecting themselves from the re-experience of pain related to traumatic events. This would result in a dysfunctional hyperactivation of subcortical areas, which may cause emotional distress and, consequently, impaired social relationships often reported by PTSD patients.

Data on health-related quality of life, depressive disorders, behaviour risk factor, and adoption of preventive measures were collected through telephone interviews in 2007-2008, in 2010, and in 2011-2014. the prevalence of individuals who declared to have economic difficulties increased after 3-5 years from the earthquake (8% in 2010 vs. 14% in 2011-2014). Nevertheless, health-related quality of life improved (decrease of unhealthy days: 7 in 2010 vs. 5 in 2011-2014), while the prevalence of depressive symptoms decreased so that it reached the national average rates (16% in 2010 vs. 7% in 2011-2014). Lack of physical activity, a serious consequence of the first period after the earthquake, became less habitual (39% in 2010 vs. 27% in 2011-2014), probably due to an improvement in the urban redevelopment. The prevalence of smoking and harmful use of alcohol is high (34% and 21%), mostly among young adults. 3-5 years after the earthquake of L'Aquila, compared to 2010 the quality of life related to health is improved (except in people with at least one chronic disease), and the frequency of depressive symptoms decreased, a sign of an extended recovery from conditions caused by the earthquake, despite of an increasing economic difficulties. On the other hand, we must emphasize critical elements, such as the high prevalence of smoking and consumption of alcoholic beverages other than as part of the meals, especially among young people, and very frequent physical inactivity, particularly among the elderly, although lower than in 2010.

They are also usually excluded from the urban planning process. At the same time, in recent years construction of buildings has been developed with insufficient regard to environmental health requirements, proper exposure to sunlight and winds, comfort, building materials, consumption of resources, and waste production. To deal with these issues, an interdepartmental working group was set up under the direction of the Department of Prevention of the LHA of Empoli (Tuscany Region, Central Italy), with members of the Regional Environmental Protection Agency, along with experts of the 15 Municipalities included in the LHA territory and members of other local institutions. The objective of the Working Group was to define and propose as mandatory a set of rules for local governments aimed at regulating construction activities according to criteria of environmental sustainability, eco-efficiency, comfort, and healthiness of living areas, at the same time encouraging the responsible use of natural resources, the reduction of energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources in order to place environmental safety and health at the heart of all building activities. Experts of six Municipalities joined the working group and the regulation framework was adopted (and made legally binding) in 8 out of 15 Municipalities, with an almost complete overlap with participation in the working group.

Our review indicates that, although proponents of the TTIP claim that the treaty will produce benefits to health-enhancing determinants such as economic growth and employment, evidence shows that previous trade liberalization policies are associated with increasing economic inequities. By reducing Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and by promoting increased cooperation between US and EU governmental agencies in the pharmaceutical sector, the TTIP could result in improved research cooperation and reduced duplication of processes. However, the TTIP chapter on Intellectual Property (IP) and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) that expand and extend patent monopolies, and delay the availability of generic drugs, are likely to cause underutilization of needed medications among vulnerable populations. The TTIP's Investor to State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) arbitration system, a mechanism that allows transnational companies (TNCs) to sue governments when a policy or law reduces the value of their investment, is likely to generate a negative impact on regulations aimed at increasing access to healthcare, and reducing tobacco, alcohol consumption, and diet-related diseases. The Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS) of the TTIP is expected to weaken regulations in the food and agricultural sectors especially in the EU, with potentially negative effects on food safety and foodborne diseases. Finally, the ISDS is likely to infringe the ability of governments to tackle environmental problems such as climate change deemed to be the most important global health threat of the century. Our review concludes by discussing policy implications and the effect of the TTIP on democracy, national sovereignty and the balance of power between large TNCs and governments. It also discusses the adoption of an evidence-based precautionary principle approach in dealing with the health impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as well as the harmonization of regulations, norms, and standards toward stronger health and environmental protection.

The stations of Signa, Scandicci, and Firenze-Bassi, located in a further South area, were considered representative Believing that air quality of the Plain could be evaluated by these stations is a stretch. In this text the author show the inconsistency of the conclusion of the Report through correlation graphs comparing daily means of PM10 detected in the disposed stations and in the active ones, showing relevant differences between the reported values and the days when the limits are exceeded. The discrepancy is due to the fact that uncertainty of theoretical estimates is greater than the differences recorded by the stations considered as a reference and the areas they may represent. The area of the Plain has a population of 150,000 individuals and it is subject to a heavy environmental pression, which will change for the urban works planned for the coming years. The population's legitimate request for the analytical monitoring of air pollution could be met through the organization of participated monitoring based on the use of low-cost innovative tools.

A cohort study of 1,588 asbestos workers recruited from 2000 onward during statutory health examinations in Veneto and followed-up for lung cancer mortality until December 2010 was executed. A literature search on methods of follow-up of asbestos workers (imaging, spirometry, and questionnaires) and diagnosis of non-malignant (asbestosis and pleural plaques) and malignant (lung cancer) asbestos disease was done. A consensus, i.e., a process of agreeing on one result among the participants, was made. 19 Italian Regions (North: Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardia, Piemonte, Valle d'Aosta, Autonomous Province of Trento, Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria; Centre:Toscana, Umbria; South and Islands: Calabria, Abruzzo, Puglia, Campania, Basilicata,Marche, Sicilia, Sardegna), Department of Occupational Medicine at Italian National Institute for Compensation ofWork-Related Diseases and Accidents (INAIL), and Department of Cardiac, Thoracic, and Vascular Sciences at University of Padova. analysis of current regional experiences on health surveillance; retrospective estimate of asbestos exposure; data collection and analysis of a cohort of asbestos workers; search of the relevant literature; final report with the consensus document. the results obtained in each of the above areas of research, along with the relevant findings of the literature, were presented and discussed among the participants. The several phases of expression and evaluation of the participants' opinions were conducted according to an iterative method of investigation (Delphi method), which allows a progressive converging of different views into one shared result. based on all the above, a consensus has been reached on a proposal for an Italian national protocol of health surveillance for asbestos workers.

","658":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and it would be essential to have effective tools to diagnose the disease in its early stages, to identify individuals at highest risk of developing the disease, and to set personalised therapies. The effectiveness of screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT (LDCT) in heavy smokers was demonstrated, in terms of reduction of cause-specific mortality, in recently published data by the study National Lung ScreeningTrial (NLST). In Europe, the introduction of LDCT as screening in individuals at risk is the object of a debate until the results of European randomized trials, expected in 2015-2016, are published. One problem is the high rate of calls for investigations when there is a noncalcified nodule, and it is therefore essential to be able to more accurately identify malignant nodules. The development of specific biomarkers appears to offer promising prospects. Recent advances in genetics and genomics have led to a series of studies aimed at the identification of molecular markers for the diagnosis, the assessment of the risk of developing lung cancer, the molecular characterisation of the different stages of the disease and the personalisation of therapy. Subjects enrolled in trials evaluating LCDT as a test for early detection of lung cancer represent the ideal population in which to study a combined bioinstrumental approach of screening (molecular test and LDCT). This paper reports on the state of knowledge on the possible use of biomarkers in the early detection of lung cancer and molecular analysis conducted within the project ITALUNG, a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect on tumour-specific mortality of LDCT, which provided a collection of biological materials from the subjects enrolled. ","659":"In approaching the asbestos-related diseases with CT, both the malignant diseases and the non-malignant disease are to be considered. In the recent publication of the Helsinki Criteria research activities are encouraged in the field of lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) in exposed workers and initiatives of data pooling and study protocols standardization are stimulated. Herein, we propose a review of the literature in the light of the Helsinki statement focused on the different techniques of imaging with CT and on the different fields of application in the asbestos-related disease. ","660":"Lung cancer still remains a high mortality disease in the face of developments in diagnostic and therapeutic methods that occurred in the last 20 years. The analysis of the experiences from the first studies - in which chest X-ray (CXR) was adopted, associated or not with sputum cytology - has failed to show a reduction in lung cancer specific mortality. Subsequent screening studies that have introduced the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) have revealed a large number of early-stage lung cancers, thus potentially curable; however, this has not allowed us to demonstrate a decrease in lung cancer-specific mortality. With the results of the American study National Lung ScreeningTrial (NLST), published in 2011, for the first time a lung cancer-specific mortality reduction by 20% thanks to the use of LDCT compared to RXT, was highlighted. However, a false discovery rate of 96.4% was also described with an overdiagnosis that can be up to 78.9% for bronchioalveolar lung cancer. Due to the high sensitivity of LDCT, able to identify a non-calcified pulmonary nodule in one subject on two, it becomes necessary to avail instruments to more accurately identify suspicious nodules. Until some time ago, the possible use of lung tumour markers was not viable in view of the poor organ specificity. The study and development was, then, pushed to organ- and tissue-specific markers such as microRNA (miRNA), noncoding RNA sequences involved in many processes and expression of oncogenic activity of the microenvironment. The use of biomarkers such as circulating miRNA implemented in LDCT screening has highlighted a reduction of 5 times for the rate of false positives, going from 19.4% to 3.7%, with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 81%, and a negative predictive value of 99%. The need to appropriately use the available resources commensurate with the disease to treat will push more and more towards the implementation of LDCT biomarkers based screenings, stable and easily reproducible, as circulating miRNAs, obviating to problems such as false positives, unnecessary procedures of invasive surgery for benign lesions, and optimizing the cost benefit ratios.The development of new specific biomarkers appears to offer new promising prospects.","661":"Lung cancer is the first cancer mortality cause in Italy. In last decades, incidence rates have been falling down, but the annual number of deaths is stable because of population ageing. Survival rates for population-based lung cancer cases were at maximum 17% in the last decades. In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has published the results of the evaluation of efficacy of low-dose CT scan screening compared with chest X-ray showing a 20%cause-specific mortality reduction, based on the randomization, screening, and follow-up of about 53,000 subjects in USA. In Europe, 7 randomized studies are ongoing: the Nelson study, with about 16,000 people enrolled, is the largest one and its results are expected to be published soon. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommended screening for lung cancer. CT Scan screening will be made available within Medicare to high-risk subjects until 74 years or 80 years of age. In Europe, recommendations continue to discourage screening for lung cancer in all member Countries. The implementation of organised screening in Europe is conditioned by an health technology assessment aimed to the identification of the risk profile, performance of screening (false positive rates), and overdiagnosis harm. All the potential harms of screening must be balanced with expected benefits and evaluated in a formal cost-benefits analysis. Better strategies aimed to selective lung cancer screening of high risk subjects, including asbestos workers, must be evaluated in prospective studies.

Early retirements have been requested by a fraction only in the position of submitting it. subjects who have been exposed to asbestos should be the target of a post-occupational surveillance, and further work is suggested to identify subjects at high risk of LC because of smoking habits and more heavy exposure to asbestos, in order to develop programmes for primary and secondary cancer prevention. ","663":"Asbestos-related lung cancer is an important and partly unrecognized public health problem. The present review summarizes the knowledge regarding some specific aspects of the association between asbestos and lung cancer. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of lung cancers in a population that are attributable to asbestos exposure. However, this number is likely to greatly exceed the number of mesotheliomas. Epidemiological studies suggest that there is a linear relationship between cumulative exposure to asbestos and risk of lung cancer. Observed differences between different types of asbestos are lower than previously believed. This highlights the necessity of banning all types of asbestos worldwide. Risk of lung cancer changes with passing time from asbestos exposure, with the strongest effect observed 10-15 years after the exposure. This highlights the importance of quitting asbestos exposure as soon as possible, even for individuals with a long-term past exposure. Quitting smoking is the most important preventive action to be taken by individuals with a past exposure to asbestos. Results of recent studies show that smoking cessation is associated with a substantial reduction of lung cancer risk among individuals exposed to asbestos. This highlights the importance of promoting smoking cessation programmes specifically targeted to individuals with a past exposure to asbestos.

The excess in winter deaths seems to be attributable to the peak in influenza rather than to low temperatures. Summer excess mortality was attributed to the heat waves of July and August 2015. The lower mortality registered in Italy during summer 2014 (-5.9%) may have contributed to the greater excess registered in 2015.

The proportion, however, always remains lower in the whole period after the age of 70 and in women. The short term prognosis in hospitalised AMI cases shows an improvement over time, which, however, disappears when stratified by type of AMI. This trend is mainly related to the different weight that STEMI and NSTEMI have on incidence over time (increase in attack rates for NSTEMI and reduction for STEMI, with worst prognosis). results confirm the important changes in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of acute coronary disease in Tuscany, previously identified in the international literature. Differences in coronary reperfusion treatment of hospitalised cases still persist by age and gender. Additional efforts are needed to ensure equity in access to the best treatment for AMI.

The volunteers are asked to send clinical information about their condition from diagnosis onwards, on their weight and other anthropometric measures, lifestyles and nutrition through online questionnaires. Moreover, the women enrolled in the study, after login, can access evidence-based information and results obtained during the project (individual and whole community data). Volunteers can also contribute to the growth of knowledge about lifestyles to be adopted by sharing recipes, movement strategies, how to manage the change in daily practice, which will be judged by the researchers to verify the compliance with the recommendations provided before networking.

Starting from the analysis of the World Declaration for Nutrition adopted by FAO and WHO in 1992, the main European regulatory measures adopted on the issue are analysed and some reflections are offered about their normative status (hard and soft law), as well as on some problematic aspects and implications. Moreover, the contribution focuses on two major European strategies in regulating nutrition, namely the health-in-all-policies and whole-of-government approaches, characterized by the combination of heterogeneous legal instruments together with the coexistence of actions undertaken by public and private actors. The framework thus conceived - though noteworthy and commendable for several reasons - turns out to be problematic in achieving the desired goals: health protection and citizens' well-being. ","697":"","698":"","699":"Recently, a great deal of research in the field of neuroscience and human microbiome indicates the primal period (from preconceptional up to the early years of a child's life) as crucial to the future of the individual, opening new scenarios for the understanding of the processes underlying the human health. In recent decades, the social representation of infant feeding moved in fact from the normality of breastfeeding to the normal use of artificial formulas and bottle-feeding. Even the scientific thinking and the research production have been influenced by this phenomenon. In fact, a clear dominance of studies aimed to show the benefits of breast milk compared to formula milk rather than the risks of the latter compared to the biological norm of breastfeeding. Mother milk affects infant health also through his\/her microbiome. Microbial colonisation startes during intrauterine life and continues through the vaginal canal at birth, during skin to skin contact immediately after birth, with colostrum and breastfeeding. The microbial exposure of infants delivered by the mother influences the development of the child microbiota, by programming his\/her future health. However, rewriting the biological normality implies also a health professional paradigm shift such as departing from the systematic separation mother-child at birth, sticking at fixed schedules for breastfeeding time and duration, as it still happens in many birth centres. Breastfeeding has economic implications and the increase of its prevalence is associated with significant reduction of avoidable hospital admissions and medical care costs, both for the child and for the mother. Success in breastfeeding is the result of complex social interactions and not simply of an individual choice. However, any successful strategy must be oriented to the mother empowerment. Therefore, health professionals and community stakeholders have to learn and practice the health promotion approach, particularly avoiding prescribing appropriate breastfeeding behaviours to the mothers, but emphasizing her needs and preferences and her values system.

Stratified cluster sampling (with third grade classes as units) was used; information was collected using questionnaires completed by children, parents, teachers and head-teachers. consumption of breakfast, mid-morning snack, fruit and vegetables, sweetened and gassy drinks; school initiatives to promote healthy dietary habits. 31% of children have an adequate breakfast and 8% skip this meal; 52% consume an energy-dense mid-morning snack; 25% do not eat fruit and vegetables daily; 41% drink sweetened\/gassy beverages daily. The unhealthy dietary habits are more common among children who have less educated parents or live in the South (more deprived area of the Country).

In the schools of the South nutritional education and involvement of parents are more frequent, while the distribution of healthy food and refectories are less common. the high frequency of unhealthy dietary behaviour and their geographic and social inequalities show that there is a great potential for improvement.

The longitudinal analyses here reported have measured risks through the use of multivariate Cox regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. the longitudinal analyses of EPICOR indicate that Mediterranean-oriented dietary habits, measured through specific indicators and the consumption of various typical food, are able to reduce coronary and cerebrovascular risks, and that this protection is possible even nowadays, although many changes in diet have occurred in the last decades in Italy. Habitual consumption of plant origin products, including all foods with low glycemic index, is an advantage for cardiovascular risk. the EPICOR Project is the largest, long-lasting Italian study on the relationship between diet and cardiovascular diseases.

Mean meat consumption in Italy is equal to 770 grams\/week; gender and geographical variations exist: 69 per cent of the adult population are habitual bovine meat consumers; males have an average intake of over 400 grams\/week in all areas of Italy (with the exception of the South), while females have lower intakes (360 grams per week), with higher consumption in the North-West (427 gr) and lower in the South of Italy. Four scenarios of reduction of bovine meat consumption (20%, 40%, 50% e 70%, respectively) have been evaluated and the number of avoidable deaths by gender and area of residence have been estimated. GHG emissions attributed to bovine meat adult consumption have been estimated to be to 10 gigagrams CO2-eq. from low to high reduction scenario, the percentage of avoidable deaths ranged from 2.1% to 6.5% for colorectal cancer and from 1.6% to 5.6% for stroke.

Data are also available for the eight regions that piloted varicella immunization. The 2012-2014 PNPV first introduced a \"lifecourse\" approach to vaccination at the institutional level, and has been a milestone for prevention in the Italian health policy agenda. However, infant vaccine coverage rates have been decreasing over the last years, as has influenza immunization in the elderly. HPV vaccine coverage has been increasing for all birth cohorts, but is still far below the targets set in the Plan. Promising preliminary data show that pneumococcal and meningococcal C conjugate vaccines were well introduced in regional immunization schedules. The 2012-2014 PNPV objectives have only been partially met, due to several factors, in particular increase in vaccine hesitancy. Strengthened efforts are needed to promote immunization. The new National Immunization Prevention Plan should introduce new vaccines and extend immunization programs to other target populations on the basis of the most recent scientific evidence available.

The prevention of infectious diseases among migrants, especially those residing in communities, is an important concern for public health authorities, since infectious diseases eliminated in Europe may still be widespread in the migrants' countries of origin, and other diseases may have a higher incidence than in European countries. Thus immigrants may contribute to the burden and spread of infectious diseases. We describe the Apulian model of management and prevention of infectious disease among the population of Asylum Seeker Centres (CARA). It consists of a number of activities: surveillance of Poliovirus circulation, tuberculosis screening, seroprevalence studies of viral hepatitis and HIV, an immunization program for children, and syndromic surveillance. All the activities are organized and carried out by the Regional Observatory for Epidemiology among refugees hosted in the Bari Palese CARA. Surveillance of Poliovirus circulation has been carried out periodically since 2008 by assessing the presence of wild poliovirus or Sabin-like poliovirus in stool samples and seroprevalence studies. Data did not show circulation of poliovirus and indicated a good level of immunization against polio among refugees. Seroprevalence studies of viral hepatitis and HIV were carried out in 2008 and involved 529 refugees; 44 individuals (8.3%) were HBsAg positive, 24 (4.5%) were anti-HCV positive, 8 (1.5%) were HIV positive. Tuberculosis screening started in 2009 after a refugee's death due to tuberculosis and has been ongoing since then. The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is used and cutipositive migrants are examined by chest X-ray. Around 50% of migrants have been found to be cutipositive and 10% showed TB sequelae. Syndromic surveillance and an immunization program began in 2011 because of the significant increase in migration flow following civil unrest in North Africa; respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea were the most frequent notified syndromes. The immunization program involved 129 children coming from 23 countries: all received the appropriate vaccinations. The program also includes an annual special session to vaccinate all refugees against flu.

These figures represent 8.5% of all incident cases of cancer in Italy. The implementation of anti-HBV vaccination programs in countries with high endemicity resulted in a significant impact on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the availability of antiviral drugs is a real opportunity to drastically reduce the cases attributable to HCV. Primary prevention of cervical cancer mainly involves HPV vaccination; two vaccines (bivalent and quadrivalent) are available and a new vaccine (9-valent) has recently been approved by the FDA. Secondary prevention is based on screening programs that include Pap smear cytology and\/or HPV test. To reduce the burden of HIV-associated cancers, prevention programs include primary prevention of HIV infection, early diagnosis and treatment, restoration of immune function, reduction in the prevalence of associated infections and risk factors, and secondary prevention. To date, anti-HBV and anti-HPV vaccinations, eradication of H. pylori infection, treatment of HCV and HIV carriers with antivirals, and HPV-related cancer screening prove to be the most effective strategies for the prevention of infection-associated cancers.

This has made it possible to use them as indicators to identify lines of priority in prevention planning. The theoretical model has been tested in an analysis of 35 work accidents which occurred in a firm in Mantova. the model has been evaluated in comparison to the analysis which was previously used to examine cases of work-related accidents and it has proved to be more efficient in the move towards establishing preventative action at the beginning of a chain of events.

Mortality and incidence for several subgroups of causes, incidence of acute myocardial infarction and stroke, and prevalence of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic cardiopathy and diabetes were estimated. The ADMS-Urban model was adopted to define three different exposure areas based on PM10 emissions from the motorway: A (highly exposed), B (moderately exposed) used as a comparison for the analysis, C (unexposed). Hazard ratios (HR) for incidence and mortality were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for calendar period, age, gender, and instruction level. The relationship between the exposure area and prevalence was investigated by multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for the same covariates. compared with B area (23.25%of the population under study), people living in A area (3.16% of the population under study) had an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction (HR: 1.43; 95%CI 1.03-1.97) in females, and prevalence of ischemic cardiopathy (odds ratio - OR: 1.12; 95%CI 1.01-1.26) in both genders. Results were borderline for COPD in males (OR: 1.17; 95%CI 0.97-1.41).

The Service impact on the detection rate (DR) was evaluated, comparing the DR pre- (2005-2008) and post-Service (2009- 2012) within breast screening; the DR was computed through histological diagnosis made during colposcopy (pre-Service method) or through the worst diagnosis between the latter and that reported from excision histology (post-Service method) within cervical screening (data available for department 1, year 2013). Some hints on human resources employed in pre- and post-Service periods were reported. within mammography screening, the Service obtained 53.1% of extra-department medical charts and 45.8% of extra-region ones; the percentage of missing diagnoses changed from 5.5% (pre- Service) to 3.7% (post-Service). The age standardised DR for malignant tumours in the post-Service period is 1.3 times the DR of the pre-Service period per 1,000 screening tests. Within cervical screening, 51.7% of histological reports was recorded. Crude DR for high-grade lesions changed from 3.9 (pre-Service) to 4.7 (post-Service) per 1,000 screened women. The system centralisation did not imply an increase in the dedicated personnel. the Service is an operational core which coordinates the collection of clinical data, impacting on process indicators without an increase in human resources at departmental level.

This yielded first the concept of participatory science and later the wider concept of participatory research. Throughout Europe, numerous collective experimentations have generated countless interactions, and new interfaces between the world of research and civil society are constantly being created. But in spite of the proliferation of these experiences, a paradox slows down their acknowledgment and legitimation. On the one hand, these interactions often go unseen and unrecognized by the institutions, public policies, and even at times their very creators. On the other hand, scientists, are still overwhelmingly wary of civil society and, perceiving only its intellectual deficit and lack of comprehension, they fail to consider the study and development of these interactions as being of primary importance. The Sciences and Society Alliance, which was recently founded in France, provides a platform where these collaborative experiences can be collected, studied, supported, communicated, and institutionally acknowledged. The launch of this process,which is soon to be European in scope, answers the need to bring science into the democratic path tread by the societies that create it. In its ability to compose diversity, this process is an example of deep democracy.

Data on CRCs diagnosed in Italy from 2000 to 2008 in subjects aged 40-79 years were collected by 23 cancer registries. Incidence rate trends were evaluated as a whole and by macro-area (North-Centre and South-Islands), presence of a screening programme, sex, ten-year age class, anatomic site, stage at diagnosis, and pattern of diagnosis (screen-detected, non-screen-detected). The annual percent change (APC) of incidence rate trends, with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), were computed. The study included 46,857 CRCs diagnosed in subjects aged 40-79 years, of which 2,806 were screen-detected. The incidence rates in the North-Centre were higher than in the South and on the Islands. During the study period, screening programmes had been implemented only in the North-Centre and had a significant effect on incidence rates, with an initial sharp increase in incidence, followed by a decrease that started in the 3rd-4th years of screening. These incidence rate trends were exclusively due to modifications in the rates of stage I cases. After screening programmes started, incidence increased in all anatomic sites, particularly in the distal colon. The differential figures introduced by the implementation of screening programmes warrant a continuous surveillance of CRC incidence and mortality trends to monitor the impact of screening at a national level. ","770":"The impact of organized screening programmes on colorectal cancer (CRC) can be observed at a population level only several years after the implementation of screening. We compared CRC characteristics by diagnostic modality (screen-detected, non-screen-detected) as an early outcome to monitor screening programme effectiveness.

Linkage with screening datasets made it possible to divide the cases by geographic area, implementation of screening, and modality of diagnosis (screen-detected, non-screen-detected).We compared the main characteristics of the different subgroups of CRCs through multivariate logistic regression models. The study included 23,668 CRCs diagnosed in subjects aged 50-69 years, of which 11.9% were screen-detected (N=2,806), all from the North-Centre of Italy. Among screen-detected CRCs, we observed a higher proportion of males, of cases in the distal colon, and a higher mean age of the patients. Compared with pre-screening cases, screen-detected CRCs showed a better distribution by stage at diagnosis (OR for stage III or IV: 0.40, 95%CI: 0.36-0.44) and grading (OR for poorly differentiated CRCs was 0.86, 95%CI: 0.75-1.00).

Despite the availability of well-functioning screening programmes throughout the country, the follow-up protocol after an abnormal Pap test and negative colposcopy is not clearly defined in Italy, and there is no uniformity of indications. HPV testing for oncogenic human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) has a high negative predictive value (NPV) and high positive predictive value (PPV) for CIN2+ and its employment can reduce follow-up assessments. In order to provide indications about the management of women with ASC-US+ and the follow-up of women with cytological abnormalities and negative colposcopy, a literature analysis was carried out, taking into consideration European and American guidelines and good practice recommendations from the most important scientific associations and regulatory agencies. GISCi (Italian Group for Cervical Screening) drafted recommendations for the management of women with ASC-US, L-SIL, ASC-H, AGC, and H-SIL until their return to the routine screening interval. This protocol can be applied not only in the management of abnormal Pap smears in cytology-based programmes, but also in the management of abnormal Pap test triage after HPV positive test when HPV is the primary screening test. The protocols approved within the screening programmes must have an extensive consensus among all involved professionals, including any that women might meet outside the programme. ","773":"Pilot HPV-based cervical screening programmes have recently started in Italy, partly on the strength of a large randomized trial. The Ministry of Health recommended that regions shift toward HPV-based screening in early 2013 and provided guidelines for its application (stand-alone HPV testing by validated methods, cytological triage of HPV positives, beginning at age 30-35, 5-year intervals). A first survey on the 2012 activity was conducted in 2013. In 2012, 19 Italian organized cervical screening programmes from 10 regional programmes invited 311,856 women (8.0%of all women invited for cervical screening in 2012 in Italy) for HPV-based screening; 41.5% complied, with a decreasing North-South trend. Among screened women, 7.9% (range 4.3%-13.9%) were HPV positive, decreasing to 6.6% (range 4.0%-12.4%) when considering women aged 35-64 years.

As we have been doing since 1998, we collected aggregated tables of data from Italian organized cervical screening programmes in order to centrally compute process indicators. Data on women invited during 2011 and 2012 and screened up to April of the subsequent year were considered. In 2012, the target population of Italian organized screening programmes included 14,497,207 women, corresponding to 87.3% of Italian women aged 25-64 years. Compliance to invitation was 41.2%in 2011 and 40.8%in 2012, with a strong decreasing North-South trend. However, it should be considered that many women are screened outside any organized programmes. In 2012, of the women screened, 3.5% were referred for repeat cytology and 71.1% of them complied; 2.4% of screened women were referred to colposcopy. Compliance with colposcopy referral was 85.3%among women referred because of ASC-US or more severe cytology and 90.4% among those referred because of HSIL or more severe cytology. The positive predictive value (PPV) of referral because of ASC-US or more severe cytology for CIN2 or more severe histology was 16.9%. The unadjusted detection rate of CIN2 or more severe histology was 3.4 per 1,000 screened women (3.6 standardized on the Italian population, truncated 25-64). CIN2 or more severe histology was detected in 64.6% of colposcopies classified as grade 2 or higher. Of all colposcopies during which a CIN2 or more severe histology was obtained, 33.6% were classified as grade 2 or higher. Follow-up only was recommended to 81.7% of women with CIN1.

","775":"In this position paper, a self-convened team of experts from the Italian Group for Mammography Screening (Gruppo italiano screening mammografico, GISMa) pointed out the problems that increasingly hamper the feasibility and validity of the estimate of the proportional incidence of interval breast cancer (IBC) in Italy, suggested potential solutions and an agenda for research, and proposed that the question of the sensitivity of mammography be viewed in a larger perspective, with a greater attention to radiological review activities and breast radiology quality assurance programmes. The main problems are as follows: the coverage of cancer registration is incomplete; the robustness of using the pre-screening incidence rates as underlying rates decreases with time since the start of screening; the intermediate mammograms performed for early detection purposes may cause an overrepresentation of IBCs; the classification of many borderline screening histories is prone to subjectivity; and, finally, the composition of cohorts of women with negative screening results is uncertain, because several mammography reports are neither clearly negative nor clearly positive, and because of the limitations and instability of the electronic mammography records. Several possibilities can be considered to cope with these issues: standard methods for using the hospital discharge records in the identification of IBCs should be established; for the calculation of regional estimates of the underlying incidence, a suitable mathematical model should be identified; the definition of IBC according to the 2008 GISMa guidelines needs to be updated, especially with respect to in situ cancers and to invasive cancers with borderline screening histories; a closer adherence to standard screening protocols, with a simplified patient management, would make it easier to objectively identify IBCs; alternative methods for estimating the sensitivity of mammography should be taken into consideration; and, finally, analysis could be restricted to the absolute incidence rate of IBC, which would make comparison of the risk between neighbouring populations possible. Epidemiologists must extend their attention to the prevention of the risk of IBC and the implementation of breast radiology quality assurance practices. Epidemiologists and radiologists can share common objectives: it is necessary to promote the idea that the availability of a registry-based series of IBCs is not a prerequisite for their radiological review; radiological review of breast cancers greater than 20mm in size detected at second and subsequent screens, that are potential substitutes for IBCs, needs radiological and epidemiological validation studies; the advent of digital mammography brings about the possibility to create libraries of mammograms accessible online, which enables the conduct of large studies of the diagnostic variability of radiologists; and, finally, epidemiologists and radiologists have the responsibility to monitor the effects that a loss of cumulative professional experience in screening centres, due to the imminent retirement of a substantial proportion of healthcare workforce, could cause on their performance.

The study compares information provided by invitation letters and leaflets of Italian breast screening programmes in 2001 (N=47) and 2014 (N=80). At both times, nearly all programmes provided adequate practical information and details about screening objectives and test procedures. Information regarding epidemiology\/figures was scarce or absent in 2001, while in 2014 a number of programmes began to inform women about screening risks (false negative and positive results and overdiagnosis, 65%, 16%, and 21% respectively) although actual figures were rarely supplied. Despite this small improvement, Italian programmes are still far from giving balanced information. Further efforts should be addressed to providing accurate and transparent information, enabling women to make an informed choice.

The 2011-2012 results show good overall quality and an improving trend over time. A number of critical issues have been identified, including waiting times (which have had a worsening trend over the years) and compliance with the recommendation of not performing frozen section examination on small lesions. Pre-operative diagnosis improved constantly over time, but there is still a large variation between Regions and programmes. For almost 90% of screen-detected invasive cancers a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was performed on the axilla, avoiding a large number of potentially harmful dissections. On the other hand, potential overuse of SLN dissection for ductal carcinoma in situ, although apparently starting to decline, deserves further investigation. The detailed results have been distributed, among other ways by means of a web-based data-warehouse, to regional and local screening programmes, in order to allow multidisciplinary discussion and identification of the appropriate solutions to any issues documented by the data. The problem of waiting times should be assigned priority. Specialist Breast Units with adequate case volume and enough resources would provide the best setting for making monitoring effective in producing quality improvements with shorter waiting times.

To estimate actual population coverage for the three types of screening the extent of spontaneous screening needs to be known.

All three screening programmes showed a decreasing North-South trend in coverage. From 2010 to 2013, coverage increased for all types of screening; the trend was stronger in the South; the increase was mostly due to the tests performed within the organized programmes.

The analysis of 40 years of mortality shows only a slight decrease of the murders of women nationwide. This suggests that the factors that underline this phenomenon are deeply rooted in the relationship between men and women. The decrease has taken place mainly in the South and Islands and the percentage SMRs point to a reversal of the relationship between geographic areas: thus, at the end of the observation period the North-West assumes a greater weight than the South and Islands.

Early-neonatal, neonatal and infant lethality were calculated for the non-chromosomal cases. 3,653 cases were identified out of 486,947 live births and 1,883 stillbirths, 95% of which were non-chromosomal cases. The total average prevalence was 7.47\/1,000 births. The overall prevalence decreased significantly in all CHDs (Prevalence ratio - PR: 0.86; 95%CI 0.80-0.91) as well as in non-chromosomal (PR: 0.86; 95%CI 0.80-0.92), while in the more severe defects (SI\/SII combined cases) the total prevalence was stable over time. In more severe cases, prevalence of live births decreased significantly (PR: 0.83; 95%CI 0.71-0.97), while the greater increase of TOPFAs and of diagnosed cases was observed in the prenatal period. All three mortality rates reduced significantly over time. In the more severe cases, the greatest rate mortality reduction was observed for neonatal mortality (Mortality ratio - MR: 0.29; 95%CI 0.16-0.49) than perinatal (MR: 0.37; 95%CI 0.19-0.70) and infant mortality (MR: 0,40; 95%CI 0.28-0.56). In this group of CHDs, early neonatal lethality decreased from 10% to 3%, neonatal lethality from 17% to 6%, and infant lethality from 24% to 10%. the results suggest that the improvements in prenatal diagnosis and in foetal and neonatal treatment and care have reduced the burden of congenital heart defects on the health of the Tuscany population.

In the four-year period under study 876 TB cases were notified in Sicily with a mean annual notification rate of 4.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The proportion of TB cases in the foreign-born individuals was increasing and higher than the proportion in Italian-born in the period 2010-2013. The median age of foreign-born patients was significantly lower than the Italian-born (30.5 vs. 51.2 years, p &lt;0,001). Moreover, the distribution by age class was also significantly different, with the largest proportion of TB cases among the foreign-born sub-population in the 15-44 age class, whereas the Italian-born cases were equally distributed in the 15-44, 45-64 and &gt;64 age classes.

There is a group of immigrants regularly resident in malaria free areas, which travel to malaria endemic countries to visit their friends and relatives (VFRs). VFRs represent a high-risk group of contracting malaria. Publications presenting original data on malaria in VFRs were selected for a literature review. We considered all data regarding prevalence of malaria in VFRs compared to the other groups of travelers, length of trip, group characteristics such as age, sex, country visited, and adherence to pre-travel recommendations, in particular, the compliance on the use of chemoprophylaxis, where such information was available. Studies related to malaria importation in VFRs in children and pregnant women were also included. Review of the literature revealed significant variations in the proportion of VFRs among imported malaria cases which may be due to differences in immigrant populations across the reporting countries. However, in studies focused on those at higher risk such as children and pregnant women, the prevalence of imported malaria was significantly higher compared to other types of travelers. Adherence to adequate preventive measures was low in VFRs. Significant reasons for not seeking pre-travel advice were economic and cultural issues, fear of the side effects due to chemoprophylaxis, and misconception about life-long immunity against malaria, and consequently, a low awareness about malaria risk. In order to implement preventive strategies focused on this high-risk group, prospective studies, which better define determinants of the risk of malaria in VFRs, are needed.

This study is also aimed to estimate the number of already cured cancer patients, whose mortality rates have become undistinguishable from that of the general population of the same age and sex. The study took advantage of the information from the AIRTUM database, which included 29 Cancer Registries (covering 21 million people, 35% of the Italian population). A total of 1,624,533 cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2009 contributed to the study. For each registry, the observed prevalence was calculated. Prevalence for lengths of time exceeding the maximum duration of the registration and of the complete prevalence were derived by applying an estimated correction factor, the completeness index. This index was estimated by means of statistical regression models using cancer incidence and survival data available in registries with 18 years of observation or more. For 50 types or combinations of neoplasms, complete prevalence was estimated at 1.1.2010 as an absolute number and as a proportion per 100,000 inhabitants by sex, age group, area of residence, and years since diagnosis. Projections of complete prevalence for 1.1.2015 were computed under the assumption of a linear trend of the complete prevalence observed until 2010. Validated mixture cure models were used to estimate: the cure fraction, that is the proportion of patients who, starting from the time of diagnosis, are expected to reach the same mortality rate of the general population; the conditional relative survival (CRS), that is the cumulative probability of surviving some additional years, given that patients already survived a certain number of years; the time to cure, that is the number of years necessary so that conditional survival in the following five years (5-year CRS) exceeds the conventional threshold of 95% (i.e., mortality rates in cancer patients become undistinguishable compared to those of the general population); the proportion of patients already cured, i.e., people alive since a number of years exceeding time to cure. As of 1.1.2010, it was estimated that 2,587,347 people were alive after a cancer diagnosis, corresponding to 4.4% of the Italian population. A relevant geographical heterogeneity emerged, with a prevalence above 5% in northern registries and below 4% in southern areas. Men were 45% of the total (1,154,289) and women 55% (1,433,058). In the population aged 75 years or more, the proportions of prevalent cases were 20% in males and 13% in females, 11% between 60 and 74 years of age in both sexes. Nearly 600,000 Italian women were alive after a breast cancer diagnosis (41% of all women with this neoplasm), followed by women with cancers of the colon rectum (12%), corpus uteri (7%), and thyroid (6%). In men, 26% of prevalent cases (295,624) were patients with prostate cancer, 16% with either bladder or colon rectum cancer. The projections for 1.1.2015 are of three million (3,036,741) people alive after a cancer diagnosis, 4.9% of the Italian population; with a 20% increase for males and 15% for females, compared to 2010. The cure fractions were heterogeneous according to cancer type and age. Estimates obtained as the sum of cure fractions for all cancer types showed that more than 60% of patients diagnosed below the age of 45 years will reach the same mortality rate of the general population. This proportion decreased with increasing age and it was &lt;30% for cancer diagnosed after the age of 74 years. It was observed that 60% of all prevalent cases (1,543,531 people or 2.6% of overall Italian population) had been diagnosed &gt;5 years earlier (long-term survivors). Time to cure (5-year CRS&gt;95%) was reached in &lt;10 years by patients with cancers of the stomach, colon rectum, pancreas, corpus and cervix uteri, brain, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality rates similar to the ones reported by the general population were reached after approximately 20 years for breast and prostate cancer patients. Five-year CRS remained &lt;95% for &gt;25 years after cancer diagnosis in patients with liver and larynx cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia. Time to cure was reached by 27% (20% in men and 33% in women) of all people living after a cancer diagnosis, defined as already cured. The study showed a steady increase over time (nearly +3% per year) of prevalent cases in Italy. A quarter of Italian cancer patients alive in 2010 can be considered as already cured. The AIRTUM Report 2014 describes characteristics of cancer patients and former-patients for 50 cancer types or combinations by sex and age. This detailed information promotes the conduction of studies aimed at expanding the current knowledge on the quality of life of these patients during and after the active phase of treatments (prevalence according to health status), on the long-term effects of treatments (in particular for paediatric patients), on the cost profile of cancer patients, and on rare tumours.

About 10% of e-cig users quitted smoking tobacco, whereas the 90% was dual users. Among them, about three out of four decreased the number of cigarettes smoked per day (cig\/day), but did not quit. How many fewer cigarettes a smoker has to smoke to obtain significant health benefits? Is there a threshold? In order to observe a significant 27% reduction in the risk of developing lung cancer, a smoker must reduce the number of cig\/day by at least 50%, while for the other smoking-related diseases (acute myocardial infarction - AMI, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases), halving the number of cig\/day did not drive to a significant risk reduction.

These different forms of knowledge, technical tools, and skills have merged in community based scientific and social, as well as legal, initiatives, where scientists and citizens use genetic information and ICT as powerful ways to gain more control over their health and the environment.

This paper illustrates two Italian case-studies where citizens and scientists, by making use of both ICT and biobanking, have joined with the goal of protecting environmental health in highly polluted contexts. The statute of these initiatives still needs to be defined as to both the validity of the underlying citizen science and the lack of adequate legal tools for structuring them. However, as to their scientific quality and use of sophisticated technologies, these activities cannot be compared to previous experiences, such as those inspired by so-called popular epidemiology.

However, conventional approaches to smoking cessation require tobacco users to completely abstain, and many smokers are unable - or have not the willingness - to achieve this goal, and then continue to smoke despite the looming negative consequences for health. But it is possible to consider another option: the reduction of harm caused by tobacco smoking (tobacco harm reduction) through the intake of nicotine from alternative sources safer than tobacco smoke, such as the electronic cigarette (e-cig). It is a promising product for the reduction of harm caused by tobacco smoking. In addition to providing nicotine through the vapour without the typical toxic and carcinogenic substances derived from combustion, the e-cig is also a good substitute for the rituals associated with the behaviour of the smoker.

The general picture emerging from the studies was a non-negligible and highly spatially variable (within 2-3 km from the fence line) airport contribution; even if it is often not dominant compared to other concomitant pollution sources. Results were highly airport-specific. Traffic volumes, landscape and meteorology were the key variables that drove the impacts. Results were thus hardly exportable to other contexts. Airport related pollutant sources were found to be characterized by unusual emission patterns (particularly ultrafine particles, black carbon and nitrogen oxides during take-off); high time-resolution measurements allow to depict the rapidly changing take-off effect on air quality that could not be adequately observed otherwise. Few studies used high time resolution data in a successful way as statistical models inputs to estimate the aircraft take-off contribution to the observed average levels.

However, using high time resolution measurements, peaks of particles associated with aircraft takeoff (total number concentration and soot mass concentration), and landing (coarse mass concentration) were observed, when the site measurement was downwind to the runway. the frequently observed transient spikes associated with aircraft movements could lead to a not negligible contribute to ultrafine, soot and coarse particles exposure of people living around the airport.

The assessment procedure is contingent on the availability of data relating to environmental and food compartments and on any other available scientific evidence, such as data on toxicity and human biomonitoring. This chapter outlines the procedure that should be adopted in order to conduct an accurate exposure assessment and presents three case studies involving different types of contaminated sites where this approach was applied. ","910":"The SENTIERI Project represents the first comprehensive analysis of the health impact of residence in National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs). For the first time, it considers three distinct health outcomes: mortality (2003-2010), cancer incidence (1996- 2005) and hospital discharges (2005-2010). The Report includes a commentary explaining methodology and approach, as well as remarks on the causal association between environmental exposures and investigated health outcomes based on the a priori assessments of the epidemiological evidence; the main implications for public health and scientific research priorities are also presented. The approach put forward by SENTIERI was among those sanctioned by the World Health Organization to conduct an initial description of the health status of residents of contaminated sites. Results relating to individual diseases that can be traced back to a single agent, such as asbestiform fibres, can be easily analysed. The Biancavilla NPCS (where the fluoro-edenite asbestiform fibre was found) displays excesses of pleural mesothelioma and its proxy, malignant pleural tumours, as does Priolo, where asbestos coexists with other pollutants. Increased risk was also recorded in NPCSs adjacent to the coast hosting harbour areas (such as Trieste, Taranto and Venice) or comprising industrial areas specialising in the production of chemicals (Laguna di Grado e Marano, Priolo and Venezia) and steel (Taranto, Terni, Trieste). Increases of pathologies, such as cancer and respiratory diseases, connected to more than one agent, in industrial sites with multiple and diverse sources of exposures, prove harder to interpret. There are also more complex cases in which results do not appear consistent in the three databases or by gender (such as lung cancer in Venice, where mortality and hospital discharges have only increased among women). In order to adequately examine these we must consider factors such as the appropriateness of the health outcome showing the increase, considering latency and the length of the observation period. Of further interest are results relating to diseases of the urinary tract such as kidney failure in the NPCSs of Basso bacino del fiume Chienti, Taranto, Milazzo and Priolo. Overall, the results discussed above are consistent with the previous findings pertaining to mortality for 1995-2002. The present analysis also introduces a new element - the study of cancer incidence and hospital discharges - which can tell us a great deal about diseases with high survival rates or non lethal ones. The first is the case of thyroid cancer, which presents increases in both databases and for both genders in a number of NPCSs (Brescia-Caffaro, Laghi di Mantova, Milazzo, Sassuolo- Scandiano and Taranto). The study of cancer incidence and hospital discharges also revealed cancer excesses for melanoma, breast cancer and non Hodgkin lymphoma in Brescia-Caffaro NPCS where PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyl) are the site's main pollutant. PCBs, according to the 2013 evaluation of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, are ascertained human carcinogens for melanoma and probable carcinogens for breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The results pertaining to cancer incidence in the 17 NPCSs can also be presented using rankings by area or disease analyzed by a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian model. These rankings reveal an overlapping of credibility intervals, such that it is not possible to speak of a limited number of cancer sites or of certain NPCSs as being particularly affected. Every NPCS, therefore, must be considered individually and ordering them by ranking of cancer incidence wouldn't be appropriate. Data collected concerning some of the NPCSs in the context of the SENTIERI Project is so conclusive that remediation measures can immediately be put in place. This is the case in the Biancavilla and Brescia-Caffaro NPCSs. A similar conclusion can be drawn for complex locations such as Taranto, where, based on the results of SENTIERI Projects and the whole available information, we can safely conclude that exposure to environmental agents played an important role, allowing us to set in place 'Integrated evaluation of environmental and health impact procedures'. SENTIERI approach does not allow definitive causal assessments. However, as stated above, these results do provide a topic for further study without getting in the way of initiatives promoting urgent environmental remediation. ","911":"Of the 18 National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) analysed in this Report, some have a single source of environmental contamination (such as fluoro-edenite in Biancavilla). In most cases, however, we are looking at multiple heterogeneous sources of contamination. In this respect, the a priori causal evaluation of the association between diseases and environmental exposures in NPCSs, based on epidemiological evidence, can help trace the health impact back to specific types of environmental exposure. There are several cases in which the project's findings have been consistent with a priori evidence: stomach cancer (both genders, excess cancer incidence) in the Fidenza NPCS; stomach cancer (women, excess mortality, cancer incidence and hospital discharges) in the Laguna di Grado e Marano NPCS; excess hospitalisation from respiratory diseases in Brescia-Caffaro, Milazzo and Terni Papigno NPCSs; excesses for non-Hodgkin lymphomas and melanoma (incidence and hospitalisation in men and women) and breast cancer (incidence and hospital discharges, women) in Brescia-Caffaro NPCS. In preorder to properly evaluate the population's health profile, we must also observe whether results remain consistent for all three health outcomes or in both genders. The first is the case of excess mortality, cancer incidence and hospital discharges for bladder cancer (men) in Porto Torres and diseases of the urinary tract in the Basso bacino del fiume Chienti NPCS). Gender consistency is observed, for instance, for all cancer in Bolzano, Porto Torres, Venice, Litorale Domizio Flegreo, Priolo, and Taranto, for all causes in Taranto, Litorale Domizio Flegreo and Trieste. The health impact in the various NPCSs needs to be considered carefully and used as a springboard for further analytical research that could confirm and explain causal links to specific environmental exposures. The observations can, however, already be considered as a basis for mandatory primary prevention measures. ","912":"The Report considers three health outcomes - mortality, cancer incidence and hospital discharges - studied using homogenous methods and using data from official sources, namely the National Institute of Statistics (Istat), Italian Network of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM) and the Health Ministry. The timeframes of observation are: 2003-2010 for mortality, 1996-2005 for cancer incidence and 2005-2010 for hospital discharges. The causes of death are those examined by the SENTIERI Project. Hospital discharges are analysed with reference to the main diagnosis. The study of cancer incidence applies to the sites selected by AIRTUM. Statistical parameters (SMR, Standardized Mortality Ratio; SIR, Standardized Incidence Ratio; SHR, Standardized Hospitalization Ratio) were computed with a 90% confidence interval; the estimators were adjusted for age and socioeconomic status.

","920":"Two recent articles in the French daily Le Monde raised the issue of conflicts of interest with specific reference to the case of an Italian epidemiologist nominated for a key position in a French public institution. The issue can be seen - and is here discussed - from the angle of the social role of scientists, in particular epidemiologists. The viewpoint developed is that epidemiologists having key responsibilities in public institutions, whose mission is not only to carry research but to channel its results into the process of public health decisions, are akin practicing clinicians who are also involved in research. Their social role, and what the public expect of them, is to orient their research and interpret the unavoidable uncertainties of the results in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks to people's health. Being directly or indirectly involved in practical decisions at clinical or public health levels, they cannot be \"neutral\" in respect to health, as a researcher could be. This viewpoint is particularly relevant in respect to the doctrine maintaining that false positive results are today the dominant methodological issue in epidemiology and consequently avoidance of decisions based on possibly false positive results is the top priority in all circumstances. In fact, depending on the specific circumstances, this may turn out contrary to the principle of maximizing benefits and minimizing risks to people's health, hence the \"doctrine of false positives\" is erroneous for epidemiologists working in public institutions with responsibilities for translating research into actions.

In 1970, Common Market Organisation provided a virtually unlimited support for European tobacco production. After 2004, funds progressively has been cut by half, even though the other half has been given for restructuring or reconversion of tobacco farms through the Rural Development Plan. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control recommends conversion of tobacco crops, although there are no effective measures. Tobacco production requires large quantities of chemicals (pesticides, growth regulators, fertilisers), with significant workers' exposure if applied without personal protective equipments. Pesticides may have genotoxic, teratogenic, immunotoxic, hormonal, and carcinogenic effects. Tobacco itself may cause also a disease called \"Green tobacco sickness\" syndrome, as a consequence of nicotine dermal absorption due to skin exposure to tobacco leaves. In Italy, financial resources for tobacco production and restructuring\/conversion to other crops of previously tobacco planted fields are available. On the contrary, anti-smoking media interventions do not receive funds comparatively relevant as those for tobacco production.

Different kinds of documents were produced, as adaptations of already existing guidelines elaborated by international institutions, short reviews addressing specific clinical issues and consensus conferences aimed at providing clinical governance on issues which lack on evidence. The steps needed to produce a high quality guideline are presented, considering and comparing all the different international experiences, to define and discuss a common and well-structured methodology, and to face the ethical and epistemological implications of each method. The multidisciplinary of the working groups, the importance of the active surveillance on conflicts of interests, the definition of a minimum set of rules to be followed during the whole activity and the transparency of all the steps are the milestones of the Italian experience. The lack of a continuous and stable source of funding and the subsequent instability of the central structure are endangering all the knowledge and the experience gained during these years of activity.

For each indicator, we analyzed the relationship with age, stage, deprivation index, type of treatment, volume of the specific procedure of the hospital where primary surgery was performed. Estimates were adjusted using multilevel regression models. 12,988 incident cases, without metastatic diseases and other cancers, were included in the cohort: 62% were localized to the breast, 33% to the axillary lymph-nodes, 3% metastatic ab initio, and 2% with unknown stage. Deviations from the expected value of different magnitude depending on the type of indicator were observed: the most important differences were detected for the follow-up indicators. There was, in fact, an excess of several procedures in the first year of follow-up: 75% of the cases performed a dosage of a tumor marker, 67% an ecography or a CT scan or an MR, and 37% a bone scan.

The use of indicators calculated by linking the cancer registries (that provide staging) and administrative databases allows the assessment of compliance to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tumours. This experience shows that it is possible to develop a methodology, shared with clinicians, to define indicators that measure the distance between guidelines and current clinical practice in order to decrease variability, to limit inappropriateness, and to reduce unnecessary diagnostic tests for patients (and, consequently, hospitals organizational overload).

The reasons are the lower screening sensitivity and the lower risk of occurrence of breast cancer at younger ages. For these reasons, an annual interval is suggested for this age group, and a lower positive predictive value of the recall rate is observed in screening practice. Harms of screening are false positive rates and overdiagnosis (that is an exceeding number of cases over the women's lifetime ascribable to early diagnosis). A tailored approach to screening could both contribute to a reduction of possible harms and reduce the costs of the service screening programmes, which started to offer screening mammography to 45- 49-year-old women also in Italy, according with the suggestions of the Italian Group for Mammography Screening. Higher breast density is considered a marker of risk and, at the same time, it brings about a masking effect that decreases the screening mammography sensitivity at younger ages. the Tailored Breast Screening Trial (TBST) is a population-based, non-inferiority randomised trial aimed at evaluating the impact of a change in the screening protocol in a service screening practice. \"Tailored\" means that the use of a breast density classification allocates women to a longer interval, decreasing the number of screening rounds in the 45- 50-year age range. Density of the breast at the baseline is considered as an indicator of risk and also as a masking factor. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a longer interval and the reduction of side effects for women allocated to the intervention group. In this study, any further intervention is offered to high-density women who are followed-up according to the usual care interval, since the study aimed at decreasing the screening burden. 45-year-old women resident in the screening centre catchment area will be invited to attend for mammography screening and will be asked for informed consent in order to be included in the study. After the enrolment, they will receive a high quality digital mammography; two views and breast density will be classified according with the BI-RADS classification. Women are randomly allocated either to an usual care group or to the intervention group. In the intervention group, women with a dense breast (3-4 categories in BI-RADS)will be invited again after 1 year, while the lower-density group in the intervention arm will be invited after 2 years. After the age of 50, all women will continue to be screened in the usual service screening programme. Density of the breast will be read by 2 readers, and controversies will be solved by a consensus. Allocation of women is blinded to the mammography readers. the outcomes are: A. cumulative incidence of interval-cancer cases by intention to treat (ITT) grouping and by density group, aimed at assessing the non inferiority of screening performance; B. cumulative incidence of T2+\/node-positive status breast cancer cases between arms and by protocol. Screening performance parameters will be evaluated at each screening round. Interim and outcome analysis are expected at 3 and 6 years average follow- up, respectively, starting from the beginning of the screening. the non-inferiority limit is derived from the accepted level of interval cancers in women 50-69 years, which was considered acceptable by the European Community Guidelines. Assuming a 70%BI-RADS 1-2 at the baseline on the basis of the digital mammography experience, the estimated sample size with a power of 90% is 16,596 women per arm. the background of the study, that uses data from cancer registries and screening centres, describes the most relevant characteristics of breast cancer occurring in the Italian regions where the study will be conducted.

In Tuscany Region the extension of screening has already been planned for the next few years.

In order to assess the feasibility and the interobserver reproducibility of breast density visual classification by BI-RADS, two testing sets of 80 digital mammograms for screened women aged 50-52 years were made available by the ISPO (Institute for oncological study and prevention) service screening tests. The test was performed by 11 radiologists, which are members of the working group. Concordance was moderate with a BI-RADS classification in 4 categories (kappa=0.46;95%CI 0.41-0.53), and substantial using 1-2 vs.3-4 (kappa=0.68;95%CI 0.59-0.79).

Until further scientific evidence is available, it is mandatory to regulate the production and marketing of e-cigs, to make them less attractive, to forbid their use in enclosed areas, and prevent them from being promoted. E-cigs, however, seem to be much less dangerous than traditional cigarettes, although the few studies conducted are not sufficient to demonstrate either a clear therapeutic efficacy of e-cig or their total harmlessness. If e-cig had a known content, were made according to clear rules and in certified laboratories, without toxic substances, it could be used to help heavy smokers to quit, or at least to reduce smoking habits. There is a large proportion of smokers who are unable to quit. The revision of the European Directive (the proposal is being evaluated and we are waiting for its final approval) on tobacco recommends free sale for a minority of e-cigs only, those with a nicotine content &lt;4 mg\/ml.

It updates the monograph published on the same topic in 2008. The main objective of this monograph is to present the statistics according to standard rigorous epidemiological methods and disseminate them to a wide range of readers, including the lay public. Given the deep impact of the 2008 monograph on the general public, in this update we complement descriptive statistics with additional data and commentaries on issues of importance for public health, in order to provide unambiguous criteria on how to interpret the statistics. The study is the result of the collaboration between AIRTUM and AIEOP (Italian Association of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology) with contributions from interested parties, including representatives of parent associations. The monograph is divided into three parts. The first part presents incidence rates, survival probabilities, and time trends, by sex, age, geographical area, and cancer site or type, by means of tables and graphs as in the previous monograph, to facilitate direct comparisons. Four articles summarize and comment the results. The second part uses data from AIRTUM and AIEOP to outline patient management and health care issues; it includes estimates of the number of new cases in the next decade and of young adults living after a paediatric cancer diagnosis. Health organizational aspects of treatment services for paediatric patients, based on the AIEOP database, are also discussed, along with long-term complications in cured patients. The third section describes the changes in mortality trends due to improving therapies and healthcare services, and discusses risk factors and prevention of childhood cancer, late adverse events in cured patients, and other related issues. Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population-based cancer registries, covering 47%of the Italian population below age 20 years, in the period 2003-2008. Quality of cancer registration in Italy is elevated, with high proportions of microscopically verified diagnoses (91%in the 0-14 years age group and 96% between 15 and 19 years of age) and a very small proportion of cases collected through death certificate only (0.1%).The proportion of cases in diagnostic groups XI (other malignant epithelial neoplasms) and XII (other and unspecified neoplasms) of the International Classification for Childhood Cancer (ICCC), based on the third revision of the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3), were 7.0% in the 0-14 years age group and 26.0%in the 15-19 years age group.The ratio between mortality and incidence was 17.7% in both children and adolescents. Detailed results are presented in 24 fact sheets for the 12 major ICCC-3 diagnostic groups and 10 sub-groups of special interest; the series is completed by a sheet on all malignant tumours and one on all tumours including non-malignant neoplasms of the central nervous system. All sheets include results for three age groups (0-14, 15-19, and 0-19 years) and are followed by two commentaries on incidence in the recent period, one on trends and the other on survival. Incidence rates were age-standardized on the European population and presented per million children. Incidence rates are also presented by age group, sex, and geographical area. Incidence trends were evaluated for two periods, 1988-2008 and 1998-2008, using estimated annual percent changes, and survival estimates were calculated by age and period. Indicators and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown in forms of graphics and tables at the end of the monograph and online at http:\/\/www.registri-tumori.it. Geographical analyses were conducted rearranging cancer registries into four macroareas (North-West, North-East, Centre, and South and Islands). Age groups were the same used in descriptive studies on children worldwide (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10- 14 years for paediatric tumours and 15-19 years for adolescents). Incidence trend analyses included cancer registries with three or more years of registration in the 5-year period, using Poisson regression models. Observed survival was computed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The estimate of expected cases in the next decade was based on observed incidence rates in the most recent period, extended to the Italian estimated population of children and adolescents in the periods 2011-2015 and 2016-2020. The AIEOP database (Modello 1.01) allowed us to compare the number of patients treated and followed-up in specialized centres with expected cases based on AIRTUM estimates. The AIEOP database also provided information regarding health care migration throughout Italian regions and the number of foreign (immigrated) children treated in Italian AIEOP centres. In the period 2003-2008, 31 cancer registries reported 4,473 incident malignant neoplasms, 2,855 in children and 1,618 in adolescents. Cancer incidence rates were 164 cases per million in children aged 14 years or below and 269 cases per million in patients aged 15-19 years. Limited geographical variations emerged. In children (0-14 years) a significant increase in malignant cancer incidence was observed until 1997 (APC: +3.2%), followed by a plateau (APC: -1.1%not statistically significant).Until the late Nineties, a statistically significant increase was also observed in the incidence of all leukaemias in males (APC: +5.7%), lymphoid leukaemias (APC: +5.6%), representing 80% of all leukaemias, Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphomas (APC: +6.3%). A significant decrease emerged for lymphoid leukaemia starting in 1995 (APC: -1.9%), while no substantial change in cancer incidence rates was observed in the last decade of observation for all malignant neoplasms and lymphomas. In addition, no variation emerged for malignant (according to the most recent classification) central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms, while an annual increase of 1.8% (significant) was observed in the period 1988-2008, when non-malignant tumours were included. Increases in cancer incidence were observed throughout the study period for neuroblastoma (APC: +1.9%) and epithelial tumours or melanoma (APC: +4.1%). In the period 1998-2008, in addition to lymphoid leukaemias, a significant decrease was observed for all malignant neoplasms, lymphomas in girls, CNS tumours (males and females), and renal tumours in girls, while no increases were observed in this age group. In adolescents (15-19 years) between 1988 and 2008, a significant increase in incidence rates was observed (APC: +2.0%) for all malignant neoplasms, all lymphomas (APC: +2.9%; in particular Hodgkin lymphoma, APC: +3.6%), thyroid cancer (APC: +6.1%), and melanoma (APC: +8.1%). Conversely, lymphoid leukaemia is the only neoplasm showing a long-term decrease in adolescents. Recent trends (1998-2008) confirm the long-term increases only for all malignant neoplasms in girls and thyroid cancer (APC: +7.9%, boys and girls), while a decrease in bone tumour incidence emerged in girls, albeit based only on 46 cases. Cancer mortality in children showed a persistent decrease for all neoplasms and even for more frequent cancer sites or types, and mortality rates for cancer were three-fold higher in the early Seventies than in 2008. In addition, five-year survival after cancer diagnosis increased in the last three decades and was still increasing in the period 2003- 2008, reaching 82% in children and 86% in adolescents. In the period 2008-2010, 4,488 children (0-14 years) were treated in one of the AIEOP clinical centres and we estimate, based on the above-presented incidence rates, that they represented 92% of all cancer cases in Italy. However, in adolescents, the proportion of patients treated in AIEOP centres was only 25%. A migration of patients living in the South of Italy to Central and Northern Italy emerged from AIEOP information. The expected number of cancer cases in children aged between 0 and 14 years of age is approximately 7,000 in the period 2016- 2020, while the corresponding figure for adolescents between 15 and 19 years of age is 4,000, with no relevant variation in comparison with the previous five-year period. The present findings update descriptive cancer epidemiology in children and adolescents in Italy based on data provided by an extensive network of general and specialized population-based cancer registries. Data obtained from cancer registries are supplemented by additional information collected by specialized clinical AIEOP centres and mortality reports collected by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Incidence rates reported in Italy were slightly higher in comparison to other developed Countries, but relatively consistent between different Italian areas. Our results also showed that the significant increase in cancer incidence observed until the end of Nineties has halted, with the exception solely of thyroid cancer in adolescents. Efficacy of therapeutic protocols has improved constantly since the Seventies, and recent findings confirm this trend in all age groups and, in particular, for rarer tumours and cancer types that have very poor prognosis. Findings derived from cross-analysis with AIEOP data suggest that it is possible to further improve the efficiency of our healthcare system, in particular for adolescents; migration can be reduced with a more rational use of hospitals throughout Italy.

Information were collected on personal habits and working history, focusing on solar ultraviolet radiation exposure. Agriculture, construction, quarrying and fishing activities were considered: 292 employees responded to questions about the type of clothing used in the morning and in the afternoon,while working outdoors; 637 outdoor workers underwent skin examination. We contacted 743 cases of NMSC occurred in 2004; 498 subjects accepted to participate in this study. The clothing worn by surveyed subjects was often inadequate compared to the high level of exposure to UV. The skin examination of 637 outdoor workers highlighted 2 melanomas, 7 epitheliomas and 35 actinic keratoses. Among the 498 cases of NMSC, 135 (27%) were diagnosed in outdoor workers. Most represented economic activity sectors were: agriculture, construction, transport, sports. The characterization of outside workers revealed unsatisfactory sun protection behaviours. Moreover, previously undetected skin cancers were diagnosed. The study on MNSC confirms the complexity of studying the exposure to UV radiation. The Tuscany Regional project provided useful information on the risk of solar ultraviolet radiation in outdoor workers. Prevention programs are needed. ","1032":"To present problems and opportunities related to the operating procedures developed by the Tuscan epidemiological surveillance system on mesothelioma during its 25 years of activity. All 1,224 mesotheliomas, registered up to 31.12. 2011, diagnosed in Tuscan residents during 1988-2009 by the Tuscan Operating Centre of the Italian registry, have been considered. In order to evaluate accuracy and completeness of cases, the following indicators by period are used for pleural mesotheliomas diagnosed during 1988-2009: the distribution of the sources of cases' diagnosis and report to the regional registry, the latency time between diagnosis and report, the age and sex specific rates, the ratio between standardized mortality and incidence rates. The distribution of type of interview and exposure classification by period for all cases were used to evaluate the collected and classified exposure information. Histology with immunohistochemistry became the chosen method (97.4% of histological cases in 2005- 2009). Since the second half of the Nineties, other Italian regional Operating Centres and, more recently, the Workers Compensation Authority (INAIL) became new important sources of case report. Nowadays, the mortality\/incidence ratio is closer to 1. The latency time between diagnosis and case report have been reducing with a consequent increase in direct interviews to cases (from 20.3% in 1988-1993 to 71.4% in 2005-2009) and in exposure information and classification quality. The regional network with the effective cooperation of the Local Health Authorities produced relevant improvements in the quality of the epidemiological surveillance system. It is hoped that the new revision of the national Guidelines will succeed in taking into consideration all the improvements made by the surveillance system in order to get over the difficulties observed in defining and classifying cases and their asbestos exposure.

Mean age at diagnosis is 69 years. Pleural MMs represent 93% of all cases. Exposures have been investigated in 12,065 cases (76%). The median latency time is 46 years. In addition to clusters of MM cases in activities well known to entail asbestos use, different current exposure circumstances requiring intervention have been evidenced.

","1035":"To test three hypotheses in an Italian sample of call center workers: higher levels of perceived work stress are associated with more frequent common mental disorders (GHQ-12) and a lower Work Ability Index; combining the Job Strain (JS) and Effort\/Reward Imbalance (ERI) models increases explained variance in health over and above either model when applied separately; compared with outbound operators, inbound call handlers are expected to report a lower health status,which is due to a more intense exposure to task-related work stress factors in the latter. A multi-center cross-sectional study, conducted by means of interviews and self-administered questionnaires. Call handlers working in the Italian branch of a telecommunication multinational company. In all, 1,106 permanent workers were examined (35.9%of the total target population, 98.9% response rate). The majority were women (76.5%);mean age was 33.3 (SD: 3.9) and company seniority 8.0 (SD: 2.1). Nearly 60% worked as inbound call handlers, about one third as outbound operators. Work stress was measured with the well-known JS and ERI models. Three exposure levels (based on tertiles) were identified for each scale. Common mental disorders were measured with the GHQ-12 questionnaire. Subjects with a GHQ-12 score 4 were classified as \"cases\". The Work Ability Index (WAI) was used to evaluate work ability. Being in the \"poor\" or \"moderate\" categories of the WAI indicated a low work ability status. Cronbach's alphas were 0.70 for all scales. Multivariate Poisson regressions showed that both models were linked to more frequent common mental disorders and a lower WAI. Moreover, combined models demonstrated an advantage in terms of explained variance in health. Finally, performing inbound call handling was associated with a lower WAI in comparison with engaging in outbound activities. Mediation analyses showed that such association is explained by the higher levels of psychological job demands and Job Strain experienced by inbound operators. Our results highlight the relevance of work stress as a risk factor for lower psychological health, and especially for a poorer WAI among call center workers. The combined use of the two models increases completeness of work stress assessment in this sector.The higher levels of work stress and the lower WAI observed among inbound operators are due to objectively less favourable task-related characteristics.

In all, 8,992 subjects filled in a questionnaire to detect workplace bullying, the presence of work stress factors and days of sickness absence in the last year. Workplace bullying and psychosocial stressor were measured by the means of the CDL 2.0 questionnaire. Days of sickness absence reported by the subjects. On average, days of sickness absence were 7.4, and 7.2% of the respondents were defined as bullied. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that a workplace bullying was associated with more days of sickness absence after controlling for gender, age, professional qualification, company sector and juridical nature and other psychosocial factors (men: OR =1.62; women: OR =2.15). The present study confirms that workers exposed to a workplace bullying reported higher sickness absenteeism as compared with non-exposed subjects, also when a potentially highly stressful work environment is considered. The results of the present study support that workplace bullying may be viewed as an extreme stressful condition. Interventions to avoid workplace bullying not only favoure workers' health, but also avoid the company costs associated with workers' sickness absenteeism.

Preoperative diagnosis improved constantly over the years, but there is still a large variation between regions and programmes. For almost 90% of screen-detected invasive cancers the sentinel lymph node technique (SLN) was performed on the axilla, avoiding a large number of potentially harmful dissections. On the other hand, potential overuse of SLN for ductal carcinoma in situ deserves further investigation. The detailed results have been distributed, also by means of a web data warehouse, to regional and local screening programmes in order to allow multidisciplinary discussion and identification of the appropriate solutions to any issues documented by the data.

As compared to the previous year, a large increase was observed for colorectal screening.Whereas a slight decrease was observed both for cervical and for mammographic screening.

The analysis is therefore aimed at identifying the most promising entry points in order to plan and implement either health care and other policies to tackle the negative effects of crisis on health. using the main international and national references on the measure of wellbeing and on the role of social determinants, this paper draws a conceptual framework of all the connections between recession and health. For each mechanism identified, it examines the value of the main available indicators before and during the crisis in order to measure its impact, adjusting if possible for the trend observed in the previous years. Indicators have been selected according to their availability in the main Italian national informative sources and, when not possible, circumscribing the analysis to the regional or local level. regarding the short term impact, results have shown an association between the recession and the raise of mental health related problems (measured in terms of number of suicides, depression and substance misuse), especially on the most disadvantaged groups because of their higher job and financial insecurity. A first ex-ante impact assessment on long term effects allows to attribute almost two hundred deaths a year due to the increase of unemployment rate. Regarding the budget cuts on public expenditure of the health care sector, significant reductions have been shown in specialist care and in drug prescriptions, associated with the increase of co-payment and with a stronger effect on the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups. Nevertheless the crisis does not seem to be associated with a reduction of indicators of quality, continuity and outcomes of the health care, at least in the considered clinical pathways (diabetes and maternal and child health). At the same time the crisis seems to be associated with the reduction in the rate of injuries in the workplace (although it has been observed an increase of the serious ones) and car crashes, probably explained by the reduction of industrial production and of household consumptions. the conceptual framework seems to be the appropriate tool to set an Italian surveillance system for assessing the short and medium term impact of crisis on health, in particular the health of the most disadvantaged groups, mainly focusing on unemployed which are the most vulnerable target.

The farms, located between 6 and 43 km from the industrial area, are family owned and animals (mainly sheep and goats) are locally reared outdoors. The study subjects have similar eating habits, including food consumption resulting from their production. manganese concentrations and, to a lesser extent, arsenic, cadmium and lead are in the medium-high range of levels observed in the Italian general population. This study does not identify factors able to explain the variability in the blood levels of metals. The amount of dioxins and PCBs, on the other hand, is strongly associated both with subjects age and the distance of farm from the industrial site. the results of this survey are suggestive of research hypotheses that need to be confirmed by biomonitoring studies of adequate design and size, in particular the hypothesis that the blood level of dioxins and PCBs decreases with increasing distance from the industrial site.

Mortality update (SENTIERI Project, 2003-2009) regards 63 single or grouped causes (all ages, both genders); for a selection of causes 0-1 and 0-14 age classes were analyzed (both genders combined). Standardized mortality ratio crude (SMR) and deprivation adjusted together with 90% confidence intervals (90%CI) were computed using regional rates for comparison. Mortality time trend (1980-2008, triennial intervals) were analyzed calculating standardized rates (0-99 years, both genders, per 100,000, Italian population at 2001 Census as reference) and 90%CI.

Among females, since the early Nineties, lung cancer and ischemic heart diseases are in excess in Taranto IPS. Also infant mortality is higher for the whole period in Taranto IPS than regional and national averages.

EFFICACY AND UNDESIRED EFFECTS: LBC WITH MANUAL INTERPRETATION: The estimates of cross-sectional accuracy for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 or more severe and CIN3 or more severe) obtained by a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2008 were used. This review considered only studies in which all women underwent colposcopy or randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with complete verification of test positives. A systematic search of RCTs published thereafter was performed. Three RCTs were identified. One of these studies was conducted in 6 Italian regions and was of large size (45,174 women randomised); a second one was conducted in another Italian region (Abruzzo) and was of smaller size (8,654 women randomised); a third RCT was conducted in the Netherlands and was of large size (89,784 women randomised). No longitudinal study was available. There is currently no clear evidence that LBC increases the sensitivity of cytology and even less that its introduction increases the efficacy of cervical screening in preventing invasive cancers. The Italian randomised study NTCC showed a decrease in specificity, which was not observed in the other two RCTs available. In addition, the 2008 meta-analysis observed a reduction - even if minimal - in specificity just at the ASC-US cytological cut-off, but also a remarkable heterogeneity between studies. These results suggest that the effect of LBC on specificity is variable and plausibly related to the local style of cytology interpretation. There is evidence that LBC reduces the proportion of unsatisfactory slides, although the size of this effect varies remarkably. LBC WITH COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERPRETATION: An Australian study, based on double testing, showed a statistically significant increase of the sensitivity for CIN2 or more of LBC with computer-assisted interpretation vs. conventional cytology with manual interpretation. However, an English RCT estimated that LBC with computer-assisted interpretation has a lower sensitivity than LBC with manual interpretation. COST AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION: In the current Italian situation the use of liquid-based cytology for primary screening is estimated to increase the costs of cytological screening. Liquid-based cytology needs shorter time for interpretation than conventional cytology. However, in the Italian situation, savings obtained from this time reduction and from the decreased number of repeats due to unsatisfactory slides are not currently sufficient to compensate the cost increase due to the prices currently applied by producers and to a possible greater number of colposcopies caused by LBC. In any case, at current prices, cost is estimated to increase even when assuming a referral rate to colposcopy with LBC similar or slightly lower than that with conventional cytology. For the costs of computer-assisted interpretation of liquid-based cytology, readers are referred to the relative HTA report (Epidemiol Prev 2012;36(5) Suppl 3:e1-43). ORGANISATIONAL AND ETHICAL ASPECTS: Ethical, legal and communication problems are judged to remain unchanged when compared to screening with conventional cytology. After having used the test for some time, interpreters prefer liquid-based to conventional cytology. Reduced time for interpretation makes the adoption of LBC a possible approach to deal with shortenings of cytology interpreters which is happening in Italy. However, alternative solutions, such as computer-assisted interpretation of cytology and the use of HPV as primary screening test, should be considered. Liquid-based cytology allows performing molecular tests, in particular the HPV test. This property allows triaging women with borderline or mild cytology by \"reflex\" molecular or immunocytochemical tests with no need to recall them. LBC sampling can be used also if HPV is applied as the primary screening test, allowing \"reflex\" triaging of HPV positive women by cytology with no need to recall them nor to take two samples, one for HPV testing and one for conventional cytology. This represents a remarkable advantage in terms of organization. However, costs are high because only 5-7% of women screened with this approach need interpretation of cytology. In addition, HPV testing with the Hybrid Capture assay on material preserved in LBC transport media needs a preliminary conversion phase, which limits the use of LBC for triaging HPV positive women. It is advisable that in the near future industry develops sampling\/transport systems that allow performing both the HPV test and cytology or other validated triage tests without additional manipulations and at sustainable costs.","1065":null,"1066":"Several Italian and international studies investigated the short-term effects of air pollution in different geographical areas, while knowledge on the association between long-term exposure to pollutants and mortality due to natural causes and cardio are fully comprehensive at present.

Based on the difficulties experienced by the National Center of Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion of the Italian National Institute of Health, in the present work we aim to promote what we feel is a more rational approach to the concept of \"use of sensitive data\". In particular, we address the importance of these data for research, the concept of identifiability as defined in current legislation, informed consent, and the lawful use of the data. Given that data networks have been replacing static archives, it is more realistic to strive for the protection of data confidentiality, as opposed to performing irreversible anonymization of data. We also stress the role that research and health institutions should play in clearly communicating to law and policy makers the importance of the data routinely collected by healthcare facilities in performing epidemiological research and surveillance, stressing the invaluable impact of these activities on the health of the population.

Individual risk factors include age, comorbidity, cause of the index admission. Furthermore, being admitted to nursing homes or hospice after discharge is associated with increased risk of readmission. We identified an area of the region where five Districts performed worse than the average. we identified groups of the elderly population at high risk of poor outcomes after hospital discharge and a source of possible disparity in post-discharge health care in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region.

Individual follow-up for assessment of vital status at 31.01.2010 was performed using municipality data. The census-tract socioeconomic position level and the district of residence were assigned to each participant, on the basis of the geocoded addresses at the beginning of the follow- up. Standardized cause specific mortality\/ morbidity rates, adjusted for age, were calculated by gender and districts of residence. Mortality and morbidity Hazard Ratios (HR, CI95%) were calculated by districts and socioeconomic position using Cox models. All models were adjusted for age and calendar period, and were done separately for men and women. 321.356 people were enrolled in the cohort (48.9%males).Mortality\/morbidity risks for natural cause, cancers, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were found to be higher in low socioeconomic position groups compared to high ones. The analyses by districts have shown several excess mortality\/morbidity risks for residents in Tamburi (Tamburi, Isola, Porta Napoli and LidoAzzurro), Borgo, Paolo VI and the municipality of Statte. The results of this study showed a significant relationship between socioeconomic position and health status of people resident in Taranto.

The purposes of this report are: to define the best screening policies with HPV-based screening on the basis of the resulting efficacy and of undesired effects; comparing them to cytology-based screening; to identify their best conditions of application; to evaluate economic cost, feasibility and impact on the organisation of services of such policy in the Italian situation. This report contains a section on efficacy and undesired effects based on a systematic review of literature conducted in strict coordination with the preparation of a supplement to the European Guidelines for quality assurance in cervical cancer screening. This chapter corresponds to a preliminary version of the chapter of the European Guidelines on primary screening with HPV. The sections on costs, impact on organisation, and social, ethical and legal impact reflect the Italian situation; they are based on a review of the available Italian data (including unpublished data, mainly from on-going pilot projects) and on a structured analysis of what will result if the proposed protocol is applied to the Italian situation. Efficacy and undesired effects. There is clear scientific evidence that a screening based on validated tests for the DNA of oncogenic HPV as primary test and applying an appropriate protocol is more effective than screening based on cytology in preventing invasive cancers of the uterine cervix. In addition, it entails a limited--if any--increase of the undesired effects both in terms of unneeded referral to diagnostic work-up and in terms of over-diagnosis and consequent overtreatment of spontaneously regressive lesions. The crucial elements of such protocol are the followings: HPV-positive women are not to be directly referred to colposcopy, but the use of triage systems is essential. The currently recommendable method is based on performing cytology in HPV positive women. If the result of this test is abnormal, the woman is immediately referred to colposcopy; if cytology is normal, the woman is invited to repeat a new HPV test after one year. In case such a test is still positive, the woman is referred to colposcopy; in case of negative result, the woman will be re-invited for a new screening round at the regular interval. In organised population-based screening programmes the interval after a negative primary HPV test should be at least 5 years. There is evidence that the 5-year cumulative risk of high-grade CIN after a negative HPV test is lower than the 3-year risk after a normal cytology. On the other hand, the probability of unneeded colposcopies and treatments would plausibly be relevant with 3-year intervals after a negative HPV test. HPV-based screening should not start before 30-35 years. There is evidence that below 30 years HPV-based screening leads to an increased overdiagnosis of CIN2 that would regress spontaneously, with consequent overtreatment. Some increase in overdiagnosis is plausible also between 30 and 34 years. Below such ages, cytological screening is the recommended test. Only tests for the DNA of oncogenic HPV, validated according to the European guidelines as for sensitivity and specificity for high-grade lesions, should be applied. There is no evidence that double testing with cytology and HPV is more protective than stand-alone HPV as primary test, although it entails a small and not relevant increase in sensitivity vs stand-alone HPV. On the contrary, there is evidence that double testing causes a substantial increase in referral to colposcopy and a decrease in its PPV. For this reason, if HPV is used as primary screening test, it is recommended not to add cytology in parallel. Cost and economic evaluation. It is estimated that, if the protocol described is applied, in the current Italian situation the overall costs of HPV-based screening are lower than those of conventional cytological screening applied at the current 3-year intervals, although the cost of each screening round is higher. Impact on organization. For reasons of quality and cost, both the interpretation of cytology and HPV testing require a centralisation. This need is particularly strong, in terms of costs, for HPV test execution. It is therefore recommended to perform the HPV test in a limited number of reference laboratories of large size. This also makes monitoring and evaluating the spontaneous activity easier. HPV-based screening entails problems of organisation related to the need of triage, to complex protocols and to reconversion of the activities of cytological interpretation. Social, ethical and legal impact. The communication of the result of the HPV test to women, particularly if positive, is a further crucial aspect in order to reduce not only the emotional impact, but also the possible risks that women are inappropriately managed or lost to follow-up. Great efforts must be put in the education of healthcare professionals, both directly involved in organised programmes or not, particularly private gynaecologists and general practitioners. In conclusion, the crucial requirement to introduce HPV-based screening programmes is the capacity to guarantee the application of appropriate screening protocols. If protocols do not respect the criteria described above they can cause relevant increase of undesired effects and costs compared to cytology-based screening. Therefore they should be avoided, except in studies able to provide clear evidence about human and economic costs. For this purpose, correct education and information both to healthcare professionals and to the population is needed. In the Italian situation, where organised screening and a relevant spontaneous activity coexist, their interaction is crucial. Actions directed to integrate them and to guarantee as more uniformity of interventions as possible are needed, in particular through the integration of registries and thorough monitoring and a progressive homogenization of protocols. In order to grant the safety of transition, it is needed that the HPV-based organised screening activities are strictly monitored and that the National Centre for Screening Monitoring (ONS) ensures coordination. Knowledge about HPV based screening is still rapidly evolving. It is possible that currently on-going researches suggest changes to the optimal protocols in the next few years, particularly as for the management of HPV positive women. In addition, studies on the validation of new assays were recently published and others are expected. It is suggested to exploit the organised screening activity to produce scientific evidence, in order to clarify the still uncertain aspects of optimal protocols. Different protocols in terms of screening intervals, age of application and management of HPV positive women should be studied in the frame of controlled implementation, through multicentre projects coordinated by ONS. Finally, it is suggested the creation of a National working group to promptly update the recommendations for screening and the list of assays to be considered as validated. On the bases of the results obtained in the first vaccinated cohorts reaching the screening age, for the future, it will be crucial to deliver specific recommendations to the population vaccinated against HPV during adolescence.

The educational program lasted six months. Data collection was performed using anonymous questionnaires, administered to \"treated\" students at the beginning and at the end of the program. The \"control\" population only answered a single questionnaire at the end of the project. It was also carried out an assessment of the fallout of the project on parents, through a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the program. At the end of the educational intervention, a satisfaction questionnaire was administered to teachers. The enrolled population was composed of 1,358 students from 3rd, 4th and 5th classes of Public Primary Schools of the four Pavia School Districts: 938 \"treated\" students followed the program and 420 \"controls\" only answered the final questionnaire. The data concerning the pupils' knowledge are expressed in terms of frequencies: at first, we evaluated the comparison between \"treated\" students knowledge at the beginning and at the end of the program in each class, then we made the comparison between \"treated\" and \"control\" students at the end of the program. The comparison of the final questionnaires (\"treated\" students vs \"controls\") revealed in \"treated\" students higher knowledge of terms \"waste\" (94.5% vs 89.0%) and \"separate collection\" (97.3% vs 90.7%): the differences are statistically significant. Also the practice of separate collection of rubbish is more frequent in \"treated\" students' families than in \"control\" ones (83.5% vs 71.4%, p =0.0001).The analysis of teachers' satisfaction questionnaires showed positive ratings with high average scores for each item investigated. The analysis of parents' questionnaires revealed that 99.8% of them knows the meaning and 89% practice separate collection of rubbish. The program has proved effective in increasing students' short-term knowledge and making also families more interested in problems like waste recycling and separate collection of rubbish. The need of an awareness and environmental education campaign for the general population is apparent and the role of children, promoting knowledge and environmental behaviour changes in parents and community, has not to be underestimated.

There are significant differences in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in relation to geographical distribution (Northern, Central and Southern Italy), the high prevalence of overweight and obesity resulted statistically significant in the Southern compared to Central and Northern Italy. These differences are likely linked to different geographical areas in relation to socioeconomic and environmental condition that must be further investigated.

","1088":"During the last twenty years, in the most of the European nations, studies on how measuring socioeconomic differences related to inequities in take in charge of patients, health care and outcomes have been developed. The aim of this paper is the computation of a Liguria Region Deprivation Index (IDR), able to describe the peculiar health characteristics of the Liguria population, economically and socially quite homogeneous, on the basis of the socioeconomic (SE) differences related to health outcomes according to the differences in general mortality. All the population and households variables from the 2001 Italian Census have been considered at municipal level and, for Genoa and Savona, at lower administrative area level, selecting only the ones significantly correlated to the general mortality by Pearson correlation. The Standard Mortality Ratios (SMR on 2001 standard Liguria population) for Overall Mortality by gender and age groups (0-64 years and 65+ years) have been used as dependent variables. In order to build the RDI and classify the areas on the basis of increasing socioeconomic deprivation, a multivariate methodology have been used by means of principal component factor analysis of the previous selected variables and k-means clustering of the geographical areas; then these results have been compared with the SMR by analysis of variance. Finally, the RDI has been applied to the SMR of some groups of principal causes of death (all tumours and cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive system diseases), in order to differentiate the population by health outcomes. Two factors have been identified: an economic-educational factor and a socio-familiar one. The first factor describes the educational level and occupation, while the second one the marital status, the family dimension and the house peculiarities. The clustering procedure has allowed to identify five groups of geographical areas, distributed by the increasing of the SE deprivation. The most problematic areas are located in the countryside or in some spot places of the seaside, far from the health care centres and with difficult access by travel connection. The association between RDI and overall mortality SMRs confirms the relationship between deprivation and mortality increases, according to a statistically significant linear trend. Similar relationships have been observed for cardiovascular and digestive system diseases, while no associations have been found for respiratory illness and overall cancers. The RDI is able to give information on the health differences in the population, by differentiating the mortality trend on the basis of specific situations of richness and social hardship. It is useful not only for disentangling by economic condition, but also by the resources of the social and familiar support to cope with the illness situations. So, the relationship between deprivation and mortality, according to a statistically significant linear trend, shows how groups of Liguria people suffer by a lack of familiar resources, which strongly reduces the possibility of a quick take in charge and the adhesion to the more adequate therapeutic procedure, till to fatal results. In this way, areas of aimed actions can be defined by the local decision-makers, in order to optimize the health resources allocation and to reduce inequities.

Models performed before and after reabstract study for comparative evaluation of the outcome were compared. Blind coding of diagnosis and interventions\/procedures was completed according to a standard grid consistent with regional guidelines for Hospital Discharge Record coding. Other information was registered, if present on discharge record: smoking habit, number of reacutizations occurred within previous year, use of oxigen and\/or other therapies, pneumological visit at discharge. The majority (94%) of reviewed cases were confirmed as being cases of COPD. A total of 168 cases (72%) have been identified as reacutized COPD coherent with enrolment criteria of regional program, 49 (21%) have been identified as COPD and only 15 cases (6%) resulted not affected by COPD. Results of the regional comparative model were substantially unchanged for Grassi hospital (RR =23 vs RR =24). Accurateness of clinical documentation resulted inadequate especially regarding information at discharge (50% missing information on smoking habit, 83% on previous year reacutizations, 22% on follow-up organization after discharge).

Hospital admission for COPD was defined a priori to be sufficient to identify a COPD patient. For all other panel patients and controls, specific drug use (minimum 2 prescriptions during 12 months) and hospitalization for respiratory causes during the past 9 years were retrieved and compared between panel and control patients. COPD associated factors were selected through a Bootstrap- Stepwise (BS) procedure. The predictive model was validated through internal (cross-validation-bootstrap) and external validation (comparison with external COPD patients with confirmed diagnosis), and through comparison with other COPD identification approaches. The BS procedure identified the following predictors of COPD: consumption of beta 2 agonists, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, oxygen, and previous hospitalization for respiratory failure. For each patient, the expected probability of being affected by COPD was estimated. Depending on the cut-point of expected probability, sensibility ranged from 74.5% to 99.6% and specificity from 37.8% to 86.2%. Using the 0.30 cut-point, the model succeeded in identifying 67% of patients with diagnosis of COPD confirmed with spirometry. The predictive performance increased with increasing COPD severity. Prevalence of COPD turned out to be 7.8 %. The age-specific estimation was similar to results from other approaches. The predictive model shows good performance to identify COPD patients, even if it does not allow to identify those patients who have not been registered in the regional health care service or do not request any public health care service.

The clinical records included in the study were selected in a random way starting from the electronic archives of the hospital discharges of each participating centre. 7,573 clinical records were reviewed with a process of two stages managed by two reviewers each. The first stage of the review process involved 7 physicians, 1 nurse, 1 pharmacist and 1 biologist with skills and experiences in clinical risk management and in analysis of clinical documentation. The second stage was realized by 10 physicians (5 specialists, 3 experts in public health and 2 forensic physicians), also for the second stage every person involved had specific training in clinical risk management. The reviewers attended a 20-hour training course. Study of the incidence of adverse events identified during the admissions included. In the case of more than one adverse event for each admission, it is calculated the cumulative incidence of adverse events for each patient. We also considered the percentage of re-admitted patients for each adverse event, the percentage of adverse events which occurred in the phase of pre hospitalization and the degree of preventability of adverse events. A description of the identified adverse events was realized. The sample of the data included in the study was described in terms of included and excluded subjects with respect to the planned research design. Different products and results were tested and validated in the study and could be reused in the future research products. The overall average of the incidences of adverse events was 5.2%, the median was 5.5% and it is consistent with the expected results mentioned in the protocol of the study. The identified incidence of adverse events is lower than the median rate of international studies (9.2%). The distribution of adverse events for specialties underlines the majority of adverse events in the medical area (37.5%), in opposition to the results of other studies; the surgery is the second specialty for number of adverse events (30.1%), followed by the emergency room (6.2%) and obstetrics (4.4%). The study identified 56.7% of adverse events as preventable. The consequences of adverse events were classified in different typologies: the prolonged stay was the most frequent consequence, followed by the disability at discharge. The death of the patient had a median occurrence of 9.45%. The concordance between the two reviewers in the evaluation of the clinical records was very high (higher than 95%) except for two centres. The results were consistent with the results of other international studies similar in scope in terms of type of study (definition of the rate of adverse events) and epidemiological study design (retrospective study). The incidence rate, previously mentioned as 5.2%, coincides with the unfavorable rates of events determined in varied countries. The preventability resulted in an average of 56.7%.

Whenever possible, information has been developed in collaboration with the target groups: citizens but also health professionals. However, if good quality information must be clear about benefits and harms, the communication of quantitative information is particularly complex in cancer screening. Moreover, receiving more information on risks and benefits does not seem to modify participation. In addition, more balanced information does not entail that a person will include it in the decision process.Throughout several focus groups, citizens have made it clear that the information received from the programmes was only a part of the decisional process in which other elements were just as, if not more, important: trust in doctors, family and friends, perception of health authority efficiency, personal experiences, inconsistencies in information or public disagreements with other credible sources.

The request of deliberative ecological democracy is pressing.(2) There is an urgent need to meet that plethora of rights emerging in the \"knowledge society\" and in the \"risk society\" that someone has called \"rights for scientific citizenship.\"(3) This request of the population of Campania, net of local cultural specificity, it is quite similar to that of the people of any other region of Europe. The context in which this request of participation is expressed, however, is quite different. Not only and not just for that real or perceived social pre-modern and familist web that would replace a modern civil society in Campania and all across the Southern Italian regions, but also and especially for some structural causes that we here try to list. Campania is a unique region in Europe - in many ways different even from other regions of southern Italy - due to the conjunction of at least five factors, not independent from each other. 1) The presence of a widespread organized crime which, in many areas, metropolitan and non-metropolitan alike, and especially in the provinces of Naples and Caserta, is a sort of state against the State and has one of its main levers of power and a major source of its wealth in the illegal control of the territory, in its different dimensions (military, but also economic, social and even cultural). 2) A huge social and economic disintegration, exacerbated in the last twenty years by a process of deindustrialization (until the early nineties Naples was the fifth industrial city of Italy, today it is a desert where few productive oases survive) that has had few parallels in Europe and that, unlike other areas of the Old Continent, where the old manufacturing industries were closed, has not seen any serious plan to realize policy renewal and a reconstruction of its economy. 3) A huge population density, which makes at least part of the Campania region - particularly in the area straddling the provinces of Naples and Caserta - one single \"in-finite\" city, an \"in-complete\" megalopolis in which there is no solution of continuity between the rural and urban realities; in which cities, towns and countryside are piled up without order - without any order, because in the past, even in the recent past, that order somehow existed; houses, warehouses, roads and farmland, cement, fields, unauthorized dumping sites and again cement, in a state of chaos and, often, of deterioration that is, once again, almost unique in Europe. 4) The contemporary presence of two large migration flows, one incoming (usually non-EU), the other outgoing (with a very high number of migrant graduates), are interwoven in a way chaotic to further contributing to tear the already tattered social fabric. 5) Last but not least, the authoritative answer of the State that, in its various forms, now explicitly (through laws and decrees) now implicitly (through activities or omissions of bureaucracies) effectively inhibits at all levels the demand of participation, of transparency and even of simple information. The authoritarianism of the State and its bureaucracies was recently only scratched by the evolution of the local and national political events.","1126":"The discussion here presented focuses on three issues included in the paper of P. Cocco: the perception of excesses of cancer mortality in selected areas of South-East Sardinia, the report of excesses of cancer mortality in other areas of South Sardinia, the criticism towards public institutions for non-using scientific evidences. The starting point of the tale is the report done in 2001 by a General Practitioner about an excess of haemolymphopoietic cancers located in the Quirra suburb (Municipality of Villaputzu) and about an excess of congenital anomalies in the Municipality of Escalaplano. Cocco quotes four independent epidemiological studies excluding the existence of excesses of cancer mortality and incidence in the Salto di Quirra military area. Three questions are presented and discussed: why in this area, characterized by environmental pressures, where public anxiety and high risk perception have been report even before 2001, a specific surveillance program wasn't activated? why, after the reporting of congenital anomalies, there were neither epidemiological investigations nor a feasibility study about a registry? the ability of the four investigations quoted by Cocco was evaluated a priori? To discuss the conclusions of Cocco, some considerations concerning the methodological limits of the mentioned studies, the lack of micro-geographical and etiological studies are suggested. The whole event indicates problems of communication, participation and relationships among stakeholders, and specifically the role of researchers when they have to face public administrators.","1127":"Since January 2011, media reports have been reviving claims about a presumed excess of haemolymphopoietic cancer in south-eastern Sardinia, Italy, that started 10 years before.The almost daily sequence of articles created alarm in the local population, and a judicial investigation was initiated. The present commentary discusses possible reasons for the perception of an excess of haemolymphopoietic cancer, which was not confirmed by four independent epidemiological investigations. The update 2003 of the spatial analysis of haemolymphopoietic cancer incidence in southern Sardinia, on the other hand, commissioned by the local health authorities, has suggested an elevated risk of leukaemia among males residing in areas far from those reported at risk.No action followed. It is unclear why the regional authorities do not use the epidemiological investigations commissioned by themselves, whatever the results are either negative or positive for possible environmental health problems.","1128":"to evaluate the trend over time of the use of seat belts by drivers and passengers of cars and vans and the use of hand held mobile phone while driving in Florence from 2005 to 2009.

It has been carried out correlation analysis between the use of the seat belt by occupants of vehicles and between the simultaneous use of this device and mobile phone while driving.Moreover, it has been carried out time series analysis (ARIMA Box Jenkins) of in the prevalence of the use of seat belts by occupants of vehicles observed, of mobile phone by drivers and the trend of the risk to drive using the mobile phone with unfastened seat belt rather than to drive using the mobile phone with fastened seat belt. seat belts were used on average by 75.7% of drivers, 75.5% of front passengers and 25.1% of rear passengers. The average mobile phone use while driving was 4.5%. Drivers most frequently fasten seat belt if front passengers use it and while they do not use mobile phone. The use of seat belts by drivers and front passengers has not changed over time, whereas the use of mobile phone while driving has significantly increased. The prevalence of using mobile phone with unfastened seat belt rather than to use it with fastened seat belt while driving has significantly decreased over the years, indicating an increase in the use of mobile phone, especially among those who fasten the seat belt. it is necessary to plan and realize stronger interventions in the whole area.

Emission factors confirm that, to produce the same energy amount, many more pollutants are emitted by wood than by natural gas. Biomass burning produces a relevant deterioration of air quality inside and outside houses, notably due to emissions of fine and ultra fine dust (PM10, PM2.5) according to reviewed studies. Important improvements in emission quality are obtained with the use of more efficient household heating systems, both in developed and in developing countries. Numerous studies have assessed the possible health effects produced by wood smoke, providing sufficient evidence that the indoor exposure to wood smoke, even in developed countries, can have adverse effects on human health. In 2010 IARC classified wood smoke as a possible human carcinogen. In Europe, electricity generation from biomass combustion is increasing (12% each year) thanks to incentives provided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and use of fossil fuels.Today adequate studies to assess the environmental and health effects of emissions from power plants fuelled by solid biomasses are still needed.","1131":"","1132":"","1133":"","1134":"","1135":"","1136":"","1137":"","1138":"population-based survival analyses are fundamental to assess the impact of public health interventions and new therapies in cancer control.

We used the Ederer II method to estimate relative survival (RS) for 29 different types of neoplasm. Five-year relative survival rates were analysed by gender and macroarea. Trends in 5-, 10- and 15-year RS were studied by gender over six 3-year diagnostic periods, from 1990 to 2007. Conditional 5-year RS was also computed by gender and macroarea. Hybrid approaches were applied to exploit the recent survival experiences of cases diagnosed up to 2007. Adjustment for age was performed using EUROCARE weights.  Additional sections describe cancer patient survival in childhood and in elderly patients and provide a comparison of cancer patient survival rates in Italy with those of other countries. Standardized 5-year RS for all tumours but skin in 52% for men and 61% for women. Patient survival has improved for almost all types of cancer: from 1990 to 2007 5-year RS has increased by 15% for all cancers but skin; the exceptions are some cancers with poor prognosis, where patient survival has remained basically unchanged. In males, RS was usually lower than in females, but trend analysis shows that the gap is narrowing. We also report persisting lower RS in southern Italy: 5-year RS in the South is usually from 4% to 10% lower than in the North and Centre. this study provides valuable information for all stakeholders in cancer control, both in Italy and elsewhere.

Incidence data are characterized by better diagnostic quality and are not influenced by survival factors, furthermore they allow the investigation of high-survival neoplasms (i.e. childhood cancer) and rare malignancies. Furthermore, the study of incidence is more informative than mortality for non-lethal tumours, therefore it represents an advancement in respect to the study of mortality completed in SENTIERI Project. In the last decade in Italy some environmental epidemiology studies used cancer register data, for example the Biancavilla (Sicily) investigation on fluoro-edenite related mesothelioma and the study in an area of Naples Province where hazardous waste was extensively dumped. In this frame, ISS planned some collaborative studies with Siracusa, Mantua and Ferrara cancer Registries, where three major polluted sites are located.

The Civil Status Office records data on the demographic dynamics (not only marital status but also causes of death); the data refer to the population living in the municipality, independently of official residence. Changes in the status of a municipality (e.g., the creation of a new municipality or the unification of diverse municipalities) are often not recorded simultaneously by these two offices, so that the data do not correspond.","1182":"The use of deprivation indices in small-area studies of environment and health is described, with particular reference to the Italian context. Deprivation indices can represent a proxy for individual deprivation and\/or contextual deprivation. In Italy, deprivation indices have been constructed using Census variables. They are applied at census tract level in studies with a local basis; in national based studies, they can be used at municipality level. In SENTIERI Project (Mortality study of residents in Italian polluted sites) an ad hoc deprivation index at municipal level was used (DI SENTIERI). Its strength and weaknesses are discussed. In addition, suggestions about the use of socioeconomic indices in small area studies of environment and health are given. For a description of SENTIERI, refer to the 2010 Supplement of Epidemiology &amp; Prevention devoted to SENTIERI Project.","1183":"SENTIERI Project is the first comprehensive study of the health impact of residence in Italian polluted sites (IPSs). The present Chapter examines the main validity aspects of the present mortality investigation and the evaluation of causality of the observed associations; in addition, some recommendations for public health intervention and research priorities in epidemiological studies on environment and health are given. Exposure ascertainment is a key aspect when an ecological study design is adopted in environmental epidemiology, therefore any exposure potentially affecting the population at study should be described in detail. This is here discussed. SENTIERI is an ecological study, based on a priori hypotheses, in which each IPS's types of exposure were described with specific attention to human exposure. Though, when commenting the results, the problem of concurrent air pollution exposure and\/or industrial activities implying occupational risk, if present in the IPSs, was taken into account. Socioeconomic status is a determinant of health and disease, therefore in SENTIERI the Standardized Mortality Ratios were computed both crude and adjusted for an ad hoc deprivation index. About 60% versus an expected 40% of IPSs residents are in the two most deprived quintiles of the index. This hints to a possible problem of environmental justice that should be taken into account when planning remediation intervention. The mortality results here presented are a first step in the epidemiological IPSs' characterization, and some developments have been made or planned. Firstly, a mortality analysis was performed combining mortality data in IPSs presenting similar pollution, i.e. asbestos, or industrial hazardous wastes or dumping sites; secondly, the mortality analysis will be extended beyond 2002, namely the year when ICD X started to be in use in Italy. In addition, disease prevalence will be investigated using hospital discharge records; cancer incidence and congenital anomalies incidence will be studied in IPSs in which a Cancer Register or a Congenital Anomalies Register are active. The above described activities will lead to a more valid estimate of the disease burden of IPSs residents, and allow to identify priorities of remediation activities. The method adopted in SENTIERI, specifically the ecological design and the use of mortality data at municipal level, in general does not grant the evaluation of the causal association between environmental exposure and adverse health effects. However, it allows etiological observations that make unacceptable the delay of remediation intervention.","1184":"SENTIERI Project has assessed the overall mortality profile in all the IPSs combined, and performed IPS-specific analyses. The epidemiological evidence of the causal association between cause of death and exposure was classified into one of these three categories: Sufficient (S), Limited (L) and Inadequate (I). The procedures and results of the evidence evaluation have been presented in a 2010 Supplement of Epidemiology &amp; Prevention devoted to SENTIERI. Mortality for causes of death with a priori Sufficient or Limited evidence of association with the environmental exposure exceeds the expected figures, with a SMR of 115.8 for men (90%CI 114.4-117.2; 2 439 extra deaths) and 114.4 for women (90% CI 112.4-116.5; 1 069 extra deaths). These excesses are also observed when analysis is extended to all the causes of death (i.e. with no restriction to the ones with a priori Sufficient or Limited evidence): for a total of 403 692 deaths (men and women combined), an excess of 9 969 deaths is observed, with an average of around 1 200 extra deaths per year. Most of these excesses are observed in IPSs located in Southern and Central Italy. The distribution of the causes of deaths shows that the excesses are not evenly distributed: cancer mortality accounts for 30%of all deaths, but is 43.2%of the excess deaths (4 309 cases of 9 969). Conversely, the percentage of excesses in non cancer causes, 19%, is lower than their share of total mortality (42%). Consistently with previous studies, the results suggest that the health status of populations living in the IPSs is worse than what regional averages show. Compared to previous studies, the analysis of the causes selected in SENTIERI, on the basis of a priori Sufficient or Limited evidence of association with the environmental exposures, provides additional information on their role, though some limitations, due to methodology and data used, should be considered.","1185":"SENTIERI Project (Mortality study of residents in Italian polluted sites) studies mortality of residents in 44 sites of national interest for environmental remediation (Italian polluted sites, IPS). The epidemiological evidence of the causal association between causes of death and exposures was a priori classified into one of these three categories: Sufficient (S), Limited (L) and Inadequate (I). In these sites various environmental exposures are present. Asbestos (or asbestiform fibres as in Biancavilla) has been the motivation for defining six sites as IPSs (Balangero, Emarese, Casale Monferrato, Broni, Bari-Fibronit, Biancavilla). In five of these, increases in malignant neoplasm or pleura mortality are detected; in four of them, results are consistent in both genders. In six other sites (Pitelli, Massa Carrara, Aree del Litorale Vesuviano, Tito, \"Aree industriali della Val Basento\", Priolo), where other sources of environmental pollution in addition to asbestos are reported, mortality from malignant neoplasm of pleura is increased in both genders in Pitelli, Massa Carrara, Priolo, \"Litorale vesuviano\". In the time span 1995-2002, a total of 416 extra cases of malignant neoplasm of pleura are detected in the twelve asbestos-polluted sites. Asbestos and pleural neoplasm represent an unique case. Unlike mesothelioma, most causes of death analyzed in SENTIERI have multifactorial etiology; furthermore, in most IPSs multiple sources of different pollutants are present, sometimes concurrently with air pollution from urban areas: in these cases, drawing conclusions on the association between environmental exposures and specific health outcomes might be complicated. Notwithstanding these difficulties, in a number of cases an etiological role could be attributed to some environmental exposures. The attribution could be possible on the basis of increases observed in both genders and in different age classes, and the exclusion of a major role of occupational exposures was thus allowed. For example, a role of emissions from refineries and petrochemical plants was hypothesized for the observed increases in mortality from lung cancer and respiratory diseases in Gela and Porto Torres; a role of emissions from metal industries was suggested to explain increased mortality from respiratory diseases in Taranto and in Sulcis-Iglesiente-Guspinese. An etiological role of air pollution in the raise in congenital anomalies and perinatal disorders was suggested in Falconara Marittima, Massa-Carrara, Milazzo and Porto Torres. A causal role of heavy metals, PAH's and halogenated compounds was suspected for mortality from renal failure in Massa Carrara, Piombino, Orbetello, \"Basso bacino del fiume Chienti\" and Sulcis-Iglesiente-Guspinese. In Trento-Nord, Grado and Marano, and \"Basso bacino del fiume Chienti\" increases in neurological diseases, for which an etiological role of lead, mercury and organohalogenated solvents is possible, were reported. The increase for non-Hodgkin lymphomas in Brescia was associated with the widespread PCB pollution. Mortality for causes of death with a priori Sufficient or Limited evidence of association with the environmental exposure exceeds the expected figures, with a SMR of 115.8% for men (90% IC 114.4-117.2; 2 439 extra deaths) and 114.4% for women (90% CI 112.4-116.5; 1 069 extra deaths). These excesses are also observed when analysis is extended to all the causes of death (i.e. with no restriction to the ones with a priori Sufficient or Limited evidence): for a total of 403 692 deaths (both men and women), an excess of 9 969 deaths is observed, with an average of about 1 200 extra deaths per year. Most of these excesses are observed in IPSs located in Southern and Central Italy. The procedures and results of the evidence evaluation are presented in a 2010 Supplement of Epidemiology &amp; Prevention devoted to SENTIERI.","1186":"The methods of mortality analysis in Italian polluted sites (IPS) are described. The study concerned 44 IPSs; each one included one or more municipalities. Mortality at municipality level was studied in the period 1995-2002, using the following indicators: crude rate, standardized rate, standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and SMR adjusted for an ad hoc deprivation index. Regional populations were used as reference for indirect standardization. The deprivation index was constructed using the 2001 national census variables representing the following socioeconomic domains: education, unemployment, dwelling ownership, overcrowding. Mortality indicators were computed for 63 single or grouped causes. The results for all the 63 analysed causes of death are available for each IPS, and in this Chapter the results for each IPS for causes selected on the basis of a priori evidence of risk from local sources of environmental pollution are presented. The procedures and results of the evidence evaluation have been published in the 2010 Supplement of Epidemiology &amp; Prevention devoted to SENTIERI.","1187":"The concept of \"polluted site\" was firstly introduced in Italy with the definition of \"environmental high risk areas\" (Rule 349\/86). Later, the decree 471\/99 stated that a site is considered polluted if the concentration of even just one index pollutant in anyone of the matrices (soil or subsoil, surface or ground waters) exceeds the allowable threshold limit concentration. The boundaries of Italian polluted sites (IPS) were defined (Decree 152\/06) on the basis of health, environmental and social criteria. SENTIERI Project includes 44 out of the 57 sites comprised in the \"National environmental remediation program\"; they correspond to the largest national industrial agglomerates. For each site, characterization data were collected, classified and arranged in tables. A great part of collected data came also from the environmental remediation programmes planned for the sites. These plans show that characterization and risk assessment activities were mainly undertaken for private industrial areas, as they were considered source of pollution. On the other hand, municipal and\/or green and agricultural areas included in IPSs were poorly studied. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the exposure of the populations living inside and\/or near the IPSs. The most probable population exposure come from the contamination of ground waters utilized for irrigation, or industrial emissions.

SENTIERI Project described and evaluated the mortality of the populations residing in IPSs and it specifically focused on causes of death for which environmental exposure is suspected or ascertained to play an etiologic role. The epidemiological evidence of the causal association was classified a priori into one of these three categories: Sufficient (S), Limited (L) and Inadequate (I). The study results will allow the priorities setting in remediation intervention, so as to prevent adverse health effects from environmental exposure. At the time of 2001 Census, about 10%of Italian population resided in the 44 IPSs included in SENTIERI; the mortality analysis was carried out for the years 1995-2002 for 63 causes of death.

Preliminary results for a longer period (1996-2007) have shown incidence rates lower than expected for all malignancies. No significant difference was registered between observed and expected cases of Hodkin's lymphoma: the excess of reported cases for this malignancy in 2001-2002 was probably due to a peak occurred in 2000 among the whole military; it is therefore unrelated to deployment in the Balkans, and probably represents a chance event. Moreover, a significant excess of thyroid cancer was reported among the whole military.The estimated number of incident cases, including those missed by the surveillance system, was not significantly higher than expected for all cancers; conversely, the estimated incidence rate of thyroid cancer was significantly increased; this excess, however, is probably due to a selection bias.These data concerning cancer surveillance in the Italian military are consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo, where armour penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used.

Adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimated the association between submitting claims and obtaining an award and socio-demographic and other characteristics. 349 on 499 mesotheliomas considered to be due to occupational exposure to asbestos submitted a claim (70% of those of occupational origin) and 72%of claims were accepted. The welfare system covers only 35%of mesothelioma occurred. The probability of submitting and obtaining a claim was associated with gender, cancer site, age at diagnosis, vital status, and residence or local office in charge of the evaluation. A strong discrimination against women is observed. If exposure to asbestos at work was due to a direct manipulation of asbestos, claims were more easily accepted.As a consequence,mesothelioma occurred among construction workers, the occupational activity at the origin of the largest number of occurring mesotheliomas, are more frequently rejected.When submitted by a relative, the lag between a request for compensation and the decision is on average of about two years.

The SPIRALE program is a public health intervention aimed at identifying the former workers having been exposed to asbestos or wood dust during their working life and to propose them a PRMS. Additionally, it is also an epidemiologic research on the longterm effects of occupational exposure.We report the results of first years of the program conducted in 2006-2008, in 13 districts. a self-administered questionnaire was sent to 50 000 newly retired men, to identify potential past occupational carcinogen exposure. For respondents detected as possibly exposed, exposure was assessed in Health Screening Centres and a PRMS was recommended if necessary. Participation rate, rate of confirmed exposure, increased rate of PRMS, satisfaction about the program. The participation rate was 24%. From 12 002 questionnaires analysed, 72% of respondents were identified as possibly exposed: 3%to wood dust, 50%to asbestos and 19%to both exposures. Exposure to asbestos was confirmed for 73.4%, and according to the level of exposure, PRMS was recommended for 47.1%. Wood dust exposure was confirmed for 56.7%. In these districts, PRMS for asbestos increased by 45% and for wood dust by 600%. Additional surveys showed that participants showed a high degree of satisfaction about the program.

Cross-sectional descriptive study of a sample recruited for a prospective cohort study. SETTING E PARTICIPANTS: Prison inmates detained in Tuscany on June 15th 2009. Istat data concerning the survey \"Aspects of daily life\" 2006-2009 has been used for comparison. The measures used for the analysis are prevalence data by age classes and odds ratios obtained through a logistic regression model. Outcome variables are: broad disease groups, in particular infectious and parasitic diseases and psychic disorders. Prison inmates from Northern Africa and Eastern Europe are 40% of the population studied. A high consumption of tobacco is observed, with 70.6% of regular smokers among prisoners vs 33.2% among free citizens. Digestive system diseases are the most frequent diseases (25.1%), followed by infectious and parasitic diseases (15.7%). Among digestive disease,more than half are teeth and oral cavity pathologies that affect 13.7% of prisoners.Other frequently reported disease groups were diseases of the bone-muscular and connective systems (11.0%), of the circulatory system (10.8%), endocrine and metabolic systems (9.2%), traumatisms and poisonings (6.8%), respiratory system diseases (5.9%), and nervous system diseases (4.9%). The prevalence of ischemic heart diseases, diabetes, obesity and esophagitis, gastritis and gastro-duodenal ulcers is significantly higher among prisoners than in the general population. The most frequent infectious and parasitic diseases are Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection with a prevalence of 9.0%, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection (2.2%), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (1.4%). Hepatitis C, HIV and hepatitis A have a higher prevalence among inmates of Italian nationality, while syphilis is more common among prisoners from Eastern Europe (1.2%). The prevalence of psychic disorders among prison inmates is 33.3% (vs 11.6% in the general population), while it decreases to 29.3% if we exclude the population detained in the Psychiatric Prison. According to previous national and international studies, the cohort is more affected than the general population by physical and psychic disorders, partly associated to the prison inmate's country of origin.

We selected cancer cases diagnosed during the period 1998-2005 in the population resident in the provinces of Firenze and Prato. Each case was classified according to the place of birth: a) born in Italy, b) born in countries with high migration (PFPM), born in other highly developed countries (PSA).To compute incidence rates we used as denominator the health regional registry. We used the European standard population in computing standardized incidence rates (restricted to the age group 20-59 years) and the standardized rate ratio (SRR) in order to compare subjects born in different countries. During the period 1998-2005, 14 791 invasive cancers were diagnosed (non-melanoma skin excluded) in subjects aged 20-59 years old, 4.2% in subjects born in countries outside Italy (1.2% in other PSA e 3.0% in PFPM). Incidence in subjects born in PSA did not differ significantly from incidence in subjects born in Italy. Incidence rates among subjects born in PFPM were statistically lower, both in men (151.2 per 100 000) and women (199.3 per 100 000), than in subjects born in Italy (243.5 men e 337.5 women). On the contrary, liver and cervix uteri cancer incidence showed higher rates among subjects born in PFPM (liver: SRR=2.13, p=0.007; cervix uteri: SRR=1.88, p=0.0095). Subjects born in countries with high migration showed a level of incidence lower than subjects born in Italy (healthy migration effect).

Most residents had no healthcare coverage (94%). Almost all settlements (except the authorized one) had no sanitary facilities, no garbage collection system and were definitely overcrowded. Mild diseases were the most commonly found pathologies, with few chronic diseases reported probably due to difficulties in investigating more complex diseases in the study setting,and to the impossibility to follow the patients over time.

We compared more deprived patients (category 3) vs less deprived ones (category 1-2). 10-year relative survival has been computed for patients diagnosed with 27 different cancer sites during 1997-2002, for different deprivation categories. Cancer sites were split into three groups of the same dimension, on the basis of 10-year survival (bad, intermediate and good prognosis). For each category the relative excess risk of death (RER) for most deprived patients has been computed using a Generalized Liner Model. We evaluated also the effect of marital status, classified as married and non-married. We analysed 14 549 invasive cancer cases (out of skin epithelioma). Overall bad prognosis cancers did not show any RER of dying for most deprived patients. For intermediate prognosis cancers RER was 1.13 (1.02 ; 1.24). A excess occurs in the most disadvantaged tertile for tumors diagnosed under 50 years. For good prognosis cancers the RER was 1.06 (0.89 ; 1.26).

In the analysis of the resident population all autochthonous citizens and all immigrants from Developed Countries were considered Italians, while citizens from Developing Countries were Immigrants. Temporary Immigrants were those immigrants with residence and citizenship in a Developing Country. A descriptive analysis was conducted using demographic variables related to patients (age, gender, citizenship and residence) and variables related to access (admission emergency codes, cause of admission, hour, day of the week, month and discharge modality). Standardized access Ratios (SRs) were calculated for the resident population, together with 95%Confidence Intervals (95% CI). The SRs were calculated separately for children and for adults. In the years 2007-2010, 562,658 accesses to ER were recorded for Italians, 95,300 accesses for Immigrants and 6,800 for the Temporary Immigrants. Access rates for resident Immigrants were higher than Italian ones. In 2010, the SR for men was 1.24 (95%CI 1.22-1.27) while for women it was 1.18 (95%CI 1.15-1.27). Considering only non-urgent accesses, the SRs were even higher (SR men=1.65, 95% CI 1.58-1.72, women=1.43, 95% CI 1.36-1.50). Similar findings were observed in children. Immigrants access the ER services more than Italians do.They also show more non-urgent accesses in comparison with Italians.

Unfortunately, interventions with an individual approach involved few smokers, so their impact in decreasing smoking prevalence was limited. The socio-ecological model offers a theoretical framework to community interventions for smoking cessation developed during the 80s, in which smoking was considered not only an individual, but also a social problem. In the 80s and the 90s smoking cessation community trials were developed, such as the Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT). Afterwards, policy interventions (price policy; smoking bans in public places; advertising bans; bans of sales to minors) were developed, such as the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention (ASSIST). California has been the first State all over the world to develop a comprehensive Tobacco Control Program in 1988, becoming the place for an ever-conducted natural experiment. All policy interventions in tobacco control have been finally grouped together in the World Health Organization - Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO-FCTC), the first Public Health Treaty. Study designs have changed, according to the individual, community, or regulatory approaches: the classical randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in which the sampling unit is the individual, have been carried out for the evaluation of smoking cessation treatments, whereas cluster RCTs, in which the sampling unit is the community, have been conducted for evaluating community interventions, such as COMMIT. Finally, quasi-experimental studies (before\/after study; prospective cohorts, both with a control group), in which the observational unit is a State, have been used for evaluating tobacco control policies, such as ASSIST and the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project. Although the successes of the last 20 years, tobacco control is at a critical point: in a reductionist approach, we tried to study its parts, but few efforts have been done to consider tobacco control as a complex network that needs an alternative approach to be understood, the systems thinking approach. New attempts of understanding and solving contradictions within tobacco control using a systems thinking approach are presented.","1211":"Potentially reduced exposure products (PREPs), already sold in USA and in some European Countries, are low-nitrosamine cigarettes, low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco (e.g., the Swedish Snus), cigarette-like products, and medicinal nicotine products. Even e-cigarette delivers nicotine. With the exception of snus and medicinal nicotine, studies on the health effects of PREPs have not been carried out, although some PREPs are already sold and promoted as products that effectively reduce health risks. Thus, a second disaster similar to that occurred for light cigarettes could happen in the next years. Only medicinal nicotine and snus could be valid candidates to become PREPs, even if they pose some significant health risks. The World Health Organization, following a precautionary approach, has recently published a list of 9 carcinogens or toxicants recommended for mandated lowering (the tobacco-specific nitrosamines NNN and NNK, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, benzo[a]pyrene, 1-3 butadiene, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde), and 9 carcinogens or toxicants for monitoring in usual cigarettes (not PREPs), underlining that tobacco companies cannot use this reduction strategy as a promotional message, as it occurred for light cigarettes in the 70s and 80s. The present status quo, in which cigarettes are freely available, medicinal nicotine, being a drug, is available under a regulated market, and Snus is prohibited, actually denies smokers the right to choose safer nicotine products. The solution suggested by the UK Royal College of Physicians is to balance the nicotine market, framing tobacco products and medicinal nicotine in the same regulation system; establishing a nicotine and tobacco regulatory authority;making medicinal nicotine more available; evaluating the feasibility of the introduction in the English market of Swedish Snus. California Government remarks that the nicotine maintenance is not a valid strategy, because it could induce smokers not to try to quit.Thus, California Department of Health Services prohibits promotion of snus and medicinal nicotine as a harm reduction strategy. However, the US Federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, signed by President Obama in 2009, places tobacco products under FDA jurisdiction: FDA must define criteria for lowering carcinogens and toxicants in tobacco products, making more available medicinal nicotine, evaluating PREPs, creating a federal Tobacco Control Agency.Which approaches is Italy going to follow?","1212":null,"1213":"","1214":"","1215":"","1216":"","1217":"","1218":"","1219":"","1220":"This article describes the phases of development and assessment of a continuous quality improvement program focused on hospital end-of-life care for cancer patients. Although most patients would like to die at home, a high proportion still die in hospital. Many studies showed non appropriate end-of-life care for patients dying in hospital and their families. During the last years, a number of hospital end-of-life pathways have been developed but only partially assessed. Among the different care pathways the most structured and proficient seems to be the Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient (LCP). Although it is currently in use in over 20 countries, evidence for its effectiveness are weak. The Medical Research Council framework has been used for designing the process of implementation and assessment of the Italian LCP Program for cancer patients dying in hospital. In the first step (preclinical and phase I) results from literature review have been used to develop the Italian version of the Program. Subsequently, LCP-I Program has been piloted in the Medical and Respiratory Disease wards of the \"Villa Scassi Hospital\" of Genoa by a Palliative Care Team (phase I-II). The implementation process has been assessed with a mixed model. Focus groups, performed on samples of doctors and nurses before and after the implementation of the LCP-I, showed a perception of effectiveness of the Program, particularly in pain management and in communication with patients and their families. Quantitative analyses, performed on consecutive series of cancer deaths before and after the introduction of the Program, allowed to test process and outcomes measures for assessing the quality of end-of-life care. According to the results from the previous phases, a cluster randomised trial was designed with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of the LCP-I Program in improving quality of end-of-life care (phase III). This study is ongoing and final results will be available by 2012. In conclusion, development and assessment of the LCP Program in Italy shows that it is possible to perform studies aimed at assessing complex interventions in end-of-life care.","1221":"To determine the prevalence, among adolescents, of medicine use for headache, stomachache, difficulties in getting to sleep and nervousness, and to analyse its association with common lifestyles.

Females are more likely than boys to use medicines for headache (41.2% vs 30%) and stomachache (29%vs 16.2%), but there are no gender differences regarding medicines for difficulties in getting to sleep and nervousness, which are used less frequently. The prevalence of the use of medicines does not increase with age. The related behaviours are: for headache, breakfast, smoking and drunkenness; for stomachache, physical fitness, breakfast and smoking; for difficulties in getting to sleep and nervousness, drunkenness.

The system ability of providing useful recommendations for prevention was evaluated on one hand by analyzing the effectiveness of inspections in preventing fatalities, on the other hand by identifying the most frequent accident mechanisms. Data analyzed consisted of investigation reports of construction fatalities occurred during 2002-2008 in the Piedmont Region, collected by surveillance system. The injury narrative description was used to assess whether the fatality would have been preventable by an inspection hypothetically conducted the day before the event; injuries were classified as probably preventable, probably not preventable, and uncertain. A standardized model of classification of injury dynamics was employed to identify mechanisms and circumstances related to the construction fatalities, and particularly those caused by falls from height. Among 122 construction fatalities occurred, 25%were considered probably preventable and 60%probably not preventable. Half of the construction fatalities was caused by fall from height, most of which were caused by sudden breaking of a surface walkway, and almost 20% by fall of objects, including burial. The analysis of the preventability of construction fatalities in Piedmont seems partly to rebut the assumption that more inspections are necessarily associated with a reduction in fatalities.

However, they were low in comparison with those of other fish-eating populations and below theWHO alert limits, likely because of the small consumption of fish among pregnant women, estimated from the FFQ.

Twenty-four Cancer Registries (CRs) (covering 27% of the Italian population) collected information on the incidence and vital status of 1,275,353 cases diagnosed between 1978 and 2005. For each CR, the observed prevalence was calculated up to the maximum observable duration. To estimate the complete prevalence (all living patients, independently from time since diagnosis) and the prevalence for lengths of time exceeding the CR maximum duration of registration, the observed prevalence was corrected through a completeness index. Completeness indices, gender, age and site specific, were estimated by means of statistical regression models using cancer incidence and survival data available from CRs with more than 15 years of observation. As of 1 January 2006, the prevalence was estimated (as absolute numbers and as a proportion per 100,000 inhabitants) for 46 cancer sites, by gender, age class, years since diagnosis and geographic areas. as of 2006, 2,244,000 persons (4%of the Italian population) were alive with a cancer diagnosis. A relevant geographic variability emerged, with proportions between 4%-5% among CRs in the Centre and North of Italy, and proportions between 2%-3% in the South.

The association between particulate matter (PM10) and gases (NO2 and O3) and hospital admissions for cardiac, cerebrovascular, respiratory conditions, pulmonary embolism and diabetes has been evaluated. The study population consists of 701,902 hospital admissions of subjects residents in nine Italian cities and hospitalized in the city in the period 2001- 2005. We used a case-crossover approach and the statistical analysis considered the relevant temporal and meteorological factors for confounding adjustment. The results for ozone refer to the warm semester. The analysis of the association between air pollution and admissions was conducted for each city, and the city-specific estimates were meta-analyzed to obtain pooled results. we found an immediate effect of PM10 and NO2 (lag 0) for cardiac diseases as a group and for specific conditions (coronary syndrome and heart failure). No effect of ozone was observed. For cerebrovascular diseases we did not observe a positive effect of the three pollutants. An effect of NO2 on pulmonary embolism was detected. The association between air pollutants and hospitalization for respiratory diseases (respiratory infections, COPD and asthma) showed different lags for the three pollutants: the effect of PM10 was immediate at lag 0-1 while the effects of NO2 and ozone were prolonged at lag 0-5. The strongest association was between NO2 and asthma admissions, especially in children. No effects on diabetes were found. the main results of the present study confirm the deleterious short term impact of air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity in Italian cities. ","1336":"the relationship between air pollution and mortality has been well established in national and international scientific literature. This study reports the results of the EpiAir Project relative to the effect of air pollution on mortality in 10 Italian cities during 2001-2005. The association between particulate matter (PM10) and gases (nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and ozone, O3), and all natural mortality, as well as cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality, is presented. Specific issues have been investigated, such as the latency of the air pollution-mortality effects and the identification of individual demographic characteristics and clinical conditions that result in greater susceptibility to the effects of particulate matter. the study population consisted of 276,205 subjects aged 35+ years old, resident in one of the 10 Italian cities studied, which died in the city between 2001-2005. For each subject, information was collected on cause of death, location of death, demographical variables and hospital discharge diagnoses in the previous 2-year period. The statistical analysis was adjusted for the relevant temporal and meteorological factors using the case-crossover approach. The results for ozone are limited to the warm semester (April through September). An analysis of the association between air pollution and mortality was conducted for each city, and the city-specific estimates were meta-analyzed on a second level to obtain a pooled result, and reported inter-city heterogeneity. a short-term effect of PM10 on mortality has been detected for all the groups of causes considered, with latencies ranging from lag 0 for cerebrovascular mortality to lag 0-3 for respiratory mortality. The association between NO2 and mortality displays strong and similar effects for all death causes, with prolonged effects (lag 0-5) for all groups of causes. The results for O3 are similar to those found for NO2, with prolonged latency (lag 0-5) for all causes of death with the exception of cerebrovascular mortality, for which a delayed effect (lag 3-5) was identified. Individual susceptibility factors of the PM10-natural mortality association include age, as elderly subjects are especially vulnerable to the effects of particles. the main results of the study suggest that the air pollution originated by vehicular traffic is the most relevant environmental problem in Italian cities from a public health viewpoint. ","1337":"The EpiAir Project, which is funded by the Italian Center for disease prevention and control, Ministry of Health, involves 10 Italian cities for the period 2001-2005, and has the following objectives: to monitor the environmental characteristics associated with relevant health effects; to systematically collect data on relevant health outcomes, such as mortality and hospitalizations, for which the impact of air pollution has been established; to report estimates of the health effects attributable to air pollution; to identify the subgroups of the population most vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. An important part of the project deals with estimating the association between several air pollutants (PM10, NO2, O3 ) and adverse health outcomes, such as mortality for a broad spectrum of causes and hospital admissions for single disease diagnoses or diseases groups. The analyses are implemented at the city level, and then pooled estimates are calculated with random-effects metaanalyses. The present paper provides details on the statistical methodology applied, focusing on: the definition of and control for the confounding factors in the city-specific analyses, estimating the association between health outcomes and air pollution at different temporal latencies (lags), identifying population subgroups most vulnerable to PM10, and analysing the heterogeneity of the city-specific results.","1338":"the EpiAir (Air pollution and health: epidemiological surveillance and prevention) Project has been conducted in 10 Italian cities.

For each deceased subject, information were collected on hospital discharge diagnoses in the previous 2-year period. Urgent hospital admissions of subjects resident in nine cities and hospitalized within the city for specific diseases (including cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory conditions) were also included as endpoints. Annual mean raw death and hospitalization rates were calculated for each city. 276,205 deaths and 701,902 urgent hospital admissions have been included in the study. Annual mean crude death rates for non accidental causes in the population aged +35 yrs resident and deceased in the municipalities ranged from 12.1 and 15.7 per 1,000 residents.The percentage of deceased subjects with at least one of the selected comorbidities ranged from 32 to 48%. Annual mean crude urgent hospitalization rates in the resident population ranged from 5.5 to 11.7 per 1,000 residents for cardiac diseases; 1.7 to 3.7 per 1,000 residents for cerebrovascular diseases and 3.3 to 10.7 per 1,000 residents for respiratory diseases. Several factors can explain the between-cities differences observed, especially in the hospitalization rates, including availability and variability in the health care services utilization. an epidemiological surveillance system based on health databases has to take into account the observed differences.

The necessary meteorological data are: temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and apparent temperature.We have identified some criteria to select monitoring stations and have taken standard methods of calculation to produce environmental indicators starting from the daily data available after closely evaluating the completeness of the existing data. Furthermore, we have checked the homogeneity of the selected data to ensure that it represents the population's exposure. close examination of descriptive statistics shows a critical situation of the considered pollutants. The analysis of the yearly state underlines for PM10 values higher than 40 microg\/m3 in the area of Mestre-Venice and in Milan, Turin, Bologna e Taranto. For NO2, values are consistently above 40 microg\/m3 in Milan, Turin, Bologna, Florence, Rome and Palermo. For ozone, the concentrations were stable, with the exception of Summer 2003 when we recorded, on average, an increase of 13% compared to the mean value estimated for the ten cities during the study period, especially in Mestre-Venice, Turin and Palermo. it is important to ensure the consistency of the methods and instruments in environmental monitoring. To evaluate health effects and perform interventions over the longterm, it is therefore fundamental that the data be homogenous, especially during the periodic reorganizations and rationalizations of air quality management.

The recordings were carried out inside a car moving on the road at the speed of 50 km\/h, with controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity. after lighting a cigarette, with driver's window closed, the levels of all the pollutants increased dramatically, with peaks of 700 mug\/m3 for PM2.5 and PM10, and of over 600,000 particles\/ liter, while TVOC reached values up to 6,000 mug\/m3 and CO up to 6 ppm. When a cigarette was lit with the window 1\/4 open, excess pollution was promptly recorded, although with less intensity. With the window completely open, PM, TVOC and CO concentrations were hardly measurable as compared to background levels. On the contrary, particle number increased dramatically up to over 300,000\/liter, mostly due to the submicrometric particle fraction in the range 0.3-0.4 mum. smoking just a cigarette inside a car represents an extremely high exposure to ETS. Partially opening the window is useless to prevent the accumulation of pollutants. Complete window opening is helpful to remove coarse PM and volatile pollutants, but is ineffective against submicrometer particles.

The lack of effectiveness of the recommendation concerning the use of antibiotics in guiding clinicians' behaviour, emerges particularly in two specific scenarios: the presence of comorbidities in elderly patients and the persistency of fever in children. the use of antibiotics in course of influenza-like syndrome is not necessarily inappropriate, and should be further investigated.

The APC in the incidence of all cancers combined was 2.3% (IC 95% 0.6%-3.9%) in children, 4.4% (IC 95% 1.8%-7.1%) in adolescents and 5.1% (IC 95% 2.8%-7.5%) in young adults. Hodgkin lymphomas (APC =12.7%; IC 95% 2.6%-23.7%; 7 cases) in the age-group 0-14 years, skin melanomas and carcinomas (APC =8.2%; IC 95% 4.5%-12.0%; 49 cases) and central nervous system tumours (APC = 6.4%; IC 95% 1.5%-11.5%; 25 cases) in the age-group 15-24 years were the malignancies characterised by the highest increase in incidence. the increase in incidence rates observed in this study can be only partly explained by the small number of ascertained cases, by an improvement in diagnostic techniques and by more efficient registration. However, few environmental and hereditary factors are consistently associated with cancers affecting young people. Therefore, it is imperative to continue to carry out descriptive and analytical studies with primary prevention as the ultimate aim. ","1382":"several studies have shown that most road accidents are due to human factors, and that these are strongly linked to a drive's age and sex. The aim of this study is to test the role that some human factors play in road accidents by analysing current road accident data in the Province of Pavia, in Northern Italy. road accidents that occurred in 2004 were analysed by integrating the paper database of the vehicle licensing office, properly computerised, with the 911 database of the Province of Pavia. This study has been carried out by analysing 1.347 road accidents and the associated 2.908 drivers of motorised vehicles. Northern Italy, the Province of Pavia. the death rate of drivers of 2-wheeled vehicles is almost nine times higher than that of 4-wheeled vehicles. Analysis shows that females are twice as exposed to road accidents than males; it also shows the benefits of extensive road education training and of being aged 30-64 and older. Drivers who have already been punished and have had their driving license scores reduced are likely to respond rapidly when in a dangerous situation and also to be without blame after an accident. Motorcycle riders are 25 times more likely to suffer serious injury than drivers of cars. Additionally, the risk of a woman being seriously injured is higher than for a man. females, young drivers and motorcycle riders who have not previously been penalised for a previous traffic violation have a higher risk of being seriously injured; females and motorcycle riders are also at greater risk of being seriously injured. We hope that this analysis will be used to improve preventative interventions for road accidents.r. ","1383":"the study evaluates the accuracy of an algorithm based on hospital discharge data (HDD) in order to estimate breast cancer incidence in three italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Toscana and Veneto) covered by cancer registries (CR). The evolution of computer-based information systems in health organization suggests automatic processing of HDD as a possible alternative to the time-consuming methods of CR. The study intends to verify whether HDD quickly provides reliable cancer incidence estimates for diagnosis and therapy evaluations. an algorithm based on discharge diagnosis and surgical therapy of hospitalized breast cancer patients was developed in order to provide breast cancer incidence. Results were compared with the corresponding incidence data of cancer registries. The accuracy of the automatic method was also verified by a direct record-linkage between HDD output and registries' files. The overall survival of cases lost to \"HDD method\" was analyzed. in the period covered by the study (3,125,425 person\/year) CR enrolled 6,079 incident cases, compared to 6,000 cases recorded through the HDD flow. Incidence rates of the two methods (CR 194.5; HDD 192.0 x 100.000) showed no statistical differences. However, matched cases by the two methods were only 5,038. The sensitivity of the HDD algorithm was 82.9% and its predictive positive value (PPV) was 84.0%. False positive cases were 9.9%. On the other hand, 12.3% CR incident cases were not identified by the algorithm: these were mainly made up of older women, not eligible for surgical therapy. Their three-years survival was 62.0% vs 88.8% of the whole incidence group. HDD flow performance was similar to observations reported in the literature. The agreement between HDD and CR incidence rates is a result of a cross effect of both sensitivity and specificity limitations of the HDD algorithm. This can seriously impair the reliability of the latter method with regard to the evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cohort studies (i.e. the most effective approach to health setting in oncology).s.

Critical issues were identified in waiting times, compliance with recommendations on not performing frozen section examination on small lesions and on performing specimen X-ray. Pre-operative diagnosis reached the acceptable target, but there is a large variation between Regions and programmes. The sentinel lymph node technique (SLN) was performed on the axilla in more than 70% of screen-detected invasive cancers, avoiding a large number of potentially harmful dissections. On the other hand, potential overuse of SLN in ductal carcinoma in situ deserves further investigation. The detailed results have been distributed to regional and local screening programmes, also by means of an online database, in order to allow multidisciplinary discussion and the identification of appropriate solutions to any problems documented by the data.

Of the 18,340 reported colposcopies 37.9% were classified as normal and 20.9% as unsatisfactory. CIN2 or more severe histology was detected in 71.6% of colposcopies classified as grade 2 or higher. Of all colposcopies the outcome of which was CIN2 or more severe histology, 40.6% had a colposcopy classified as grade 2 or higher. We obtained data on treatment from 83 programmes. Of the 3,405 women with CIN1 69.3% had follow-up only. However 0.8% of them had cold-knife conisation, 7.5% were treated by diathermocoagulation and 0.1% had hysterectomy. Of the 2,597 women with CIN2 or CIN3 4.1% had not yet been treated when data were collected and no data were available for a further 8.1%. Excision by radio-frequency device was the most common treatment among these women (60.9% of those with known treatment). However 0.7% of all CIN2 and 3.4% of all CIN3 had hysterectomy.

During 2007, fi ve new programmes were activated, but three other programmes were stopped, including the regional programme of Basilicata, and by the end of the year 46.6% of Italians aged 50-69 years were residing in areas covered by organised screening programmes (theoretical extension). Seven regions had their whole population covered. In the South of Italy and Islands only one new programme was activated in 2007, while two others were stopped, with a decline of theoretical extension from 10% to 7%. The majority of programmes employ the faecal occult blood test (FOBT), while some have adopted flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) once in a lifetime, or a combination of both. Overall, about 2,600,000 subjects were invited to undergo FOBT, 79.1% of those to be invited within the year. The adjusted attendance rate was 46.3% and approximately 1,131,900 subjects were screened. Large differences in the attendance rate were observed among Regions, with 10% of programmes reporting values lower than 33%. Positivity rate of FOBT programmes was 5.6% at first and 4% at repeat screening. The average attendance rate for total colonoscopy (TC) was 78.7% and in two Regions it was lower than 60%. Completion rate of TC was 91.6%. Among the 914,029 subjects attending screening for the first time, the detection rate (DR) per 1,000 screened subjects was 2.7 for invasive cancer and 12.2 for advanced adenomas (AA, adenomas with a diameter &gt;\/=1 cm, with villous\/tubulovillous type or with high-grade dysplasia). As expected, the corresponding figures at repeat screening were lower. The DR of cancer and adenomas increased with age and was higher among males; 25% of screen-detected cancers were in TNM stage III+. Many programmes reported some difficulties in guaranteeing TC in the appropriate time frame to SOF+ subjects: in 23.9% of cases the waiting time was longer than two months. Seven programmes employed FS as the screening test: 66.5% of the target population (about 50,000 subjects) were invited and 8,678 subjects were screened, with an attendance rate of 27.7%. Overall, 88% of FS were classified as complete. Overall TC referral rate was 11.1% and the DR per 1,000 screened subjects was 4.4 and 58.4 for invasive cancer and AA, respectively.","1396":"Italian national guidelines recommend to Regions the implementation of organised screening programmes for cervical cancer. As in previous years since 1998, we collected from Italian organised cervical screening programmes aggregated tables of data in order to centrally compute process indicators. Data on women invited during 2007 and screened up to April 2008 were considered. In 2007, the target population of Italian organised screening programmes included 11,872,810 women, corresponding to 71.8% of Italian women aged 25-64 years. Uptake of invitation was 39.8%, with a clear North-South decreasing trend. It should, however, be considered that many women are screened outside the organised programmes. Of the women screened, 5.0% were referred for repeat cytology and 60.4 % of them complied; 2.4% of screened women were referred to colposcopy. Compliance with colposcopy referral was 82.3% among women referred because of ASCUS or more severe cytology and 89.5% among those referred because of HSIL or more severe cytology. The positive predictive value (PPV) of referral because of ASCUS or more severe cytology for CIN2 or more severe histology was 16.0%. The unadjusted detection rate of CIN2 or more severe histology was 2.9 per 1,000 screened women (3.1 standardised on the Italian population, truncated 25-64).","1397":"Since its establishment in 1990, one of the main tasks of the Italian Group for Mammography Screening (GISMa) has been that of collecting, as systematically and thoroughly as possible, data on the activity of the Italian mammography screening programmes. Data are collected in an aggregated way and gathered through a standardised form to calculate process and impact parameters. Analysis of data referring to the period 1998-2007 shows that crude attendance rate reached the acceptable 50% standard, presenting a higher level of participation in Northern and Central Italy compared to Southern Italy\/Islands, where attendance rates are still inadequate and do not reach the acceptable standard. In areas where the centralised management is more established or complete, the participation rate was higher compared with areas without such characteristics, with differences of about 4-9%. The time trends of the other parameters included in the analysis showed a good average performance. For example, benign\/malignant surgical biopsy ratio (B\/M ratio) continued to progressively decrease, reaching 0.20 at first screening and 0.10 at subsequent screening in 2007; overall detection rate, detection rate for in situ and small cancers (&lt; or =10 mm) showed a good trend, reaching 5.4 per thousand, 0.9 per thousand, and 1.6 per thousand, respectively, for fi rst screening, and 4.8 o\/oo, 0.8 o\/oo, and 1.2 o\/oo for subsequent screening in 2007. On the contrary, excess referral rate at first screening persists over time. Data comparing activity volume and programme duration were also considered. In programmes with greater activity volume (average test number: 24,596) the referral rate for first screening was higher if compared with programmes with lower activity volume, but still within acceptable standards. Nevertheless, this performance is compensated by better specificity and sensitivity. An improvement in quality with the increase of programmes experience continues to be evident: compared with new programmes, programmes with more than 6 years of activity showed lower recall rates, higher positive predictive values and higher overall detection rates in the first screening round. Outcomes related to subsequent screening rounds present analogous performances. These results continue to be consistent with those achieved by other European programmes and reassuring for all Italian mammography screening professionals.","1398":"This report is an update of similar previous papers that have been published by the ONS (Osservatorio Nazionale Screening, National Centre for Screening Monitoring) since 2002. Data for the survey come from several different programmes that may have changed over time, and may have different settings of organisation and management. During 2007, a further increase in screening activity was recorded, with the inclusion of all Northern and Central Italian Regions, and a further development in the Southern Regions and Islands. In 2007, screening activity also started in Puglia, so today all Italian Regions have implemented screening programmes. In 2007, almost 2,210,000 women aged 50-69 years were invited to have a screening mammogram, and over 1,225,000 were screened. Theoretical extension was 81.4%, while actual extension increased from 57.2% in 2006 to 62.3% in 2007, finally rising over the critical value of about 50% registered during the last years. An imbalance in coverage is still present when comparing Northern and Central Italy to Southern Italy, which only has a 52% coverage by organised screening. The percentage of women screened during 2007 accounted for 33.3% of the national target population. During the last few years (2004-2007), participation rates were substantially stable around 55-57% for crude rate, and 59-61% for adjusted rate, respectively. A decreasing trend towards the South of Italy is evident for this parameter, too. Many programmes work with low volumes of activity (below 10,000 or even 5,000 examinations per year), and no regional mean value surpassed the desirable level of at least 20,000 examinations for each programme. Referral rates of 7.9% at first screening and 4.0% at repeat screening were recorded. Direct standardised detection rate was 6.5x1,000 at first test and 3.8 at repeat test, while benign to malignant ratio for first and repeat screening was 0.21 and 0.14, respectively. Detection rate of invasive cancers &lt;\/=10 mm was 1.18x1,000 at first test and 1.28 at repeat test; the proportion of in situ carcinomas was 13.3% and 14.7% for first and repeat test, respectively. Indicators by 5-year age group confirm greater diagnostic problems at younger ages, with higher referral rates, higher frequency of surgical procedures with benign outcome (B\/M ratio), and a substantially lower detection rate as compared to older age groups.","1399":"","1400":"","1401":"","1402":"","1403":"","1404":"","1405":"","1406":"","1407":"","1408":"","1409":"","1410":"","1411":"","1412":"","1413":"","1414":"","1415":"","1416":"","1417":"","1418":"","1419":"","1420":"The study area includes the Municipalities of Gela, Niscemi and Butera located in the South of Sicily, Italy. In 1990 it was declared Area at High Risk of Environmental Crisis. In 2000 part of it was designated as Gela Reclamation Site of National Interest, RSNI. The site includes a private industrial area, public and marine areas, for a total of 51 km(2). Gela populationin 2008 was 77,145 (54,774 in 1961). Sea level:46 m. Total area: 276 km(2). Grid reference: 37 degrees 4' 0\" N, 14 degrees 15' 0\" E. Niscemi and Butera are located border to Gela. Populations are respectively 26,541 and 5,063. Sea level respectively: 332 m and 402 m. Close to the city of Gela, the industrial area, operating since 1962, includes chemical production plants, a power station and an oil refinery plant, one of the larger in Europe, refining 5 millions tons of crude per year. From the beginning the workforces decreased from 7,000 to the current 3,000 units. Over the years, these industrial activities have been a major source of environmental pollution. Extremely high levels of toxic, persistent and bio-accumulating chemical pollutants have been documented. Many relevant environmental and health data are available. Prior to the studies described in the present publication, their use in order to identify environmental pressures on health has been limited. Nevertheless, since several years different epidemiological studies have provided evidence of the occurrence of health outcomes significantly higher than in neighbouring areas and compared to regional data. In 2007 a Multidisciplinary Working Group has been established, to analyze the existing data on pollution-exposure-effect and to complete current knowledge on the cycle of pollutants, from migration in the environment to health impact. The present publication is a collection of contribution of this group of experts, supported by the following projects: Evaluation of environmental health impact and estimation of economic costs at of National Interest Remediation Sites coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health on behalf of the Ministry for the Environment and Technical Assistance of WHO Health and Environment Centre to the Sicilian Region to develop plans for environmental remediation. Results describe the state of contamination of a variety of environmental matrices in the area. Other contributions are addressed to understanding action mechanisms of main pollutants and their environmental pathways, as well as to identifying crucial knowledge to be used for studying the environment-health relations. A specific attention has been paid to pollutants migration in the environment and to the potential exposure of the population. Appropriate markers of exposure and physiological changes are described and referred to the chemical substances identified in the environment in Gela. Details are given about the genotoxic and endocrine disrupting potential, and about the potential association between markers of exposure and diseases observed in excess in the same area. Indications to develop specific biomarkers for Index Substances and human biomonitoring surveys for populations exposed to environmental risk are presented and discussed. A specific multiple-exposure risk assessment procedure is proposed for Index Substances. Epidemiological studies useful to describe the health status of Gela population are summarized. One report deals with the occupational and residential analyses of male petrochemical workers, born in Sicily, employed from 1960 to the end of 1993, followed up for mortality from 1960 to 2002. Major findings were amarked healthy worker effect and an increased lung cancer risk for residence in Gela. The analyses of death certificates from 1995 to 2002 and of hospital discharge records from 2001 to 2007 confirm the potentialities of these current statistics for ecological studies: they depict the poor health conditions of Gela residents compared to other neighbouring municipalities in a 40-km range. Infact, the overall mortality rate for tumor and non-tumor causes in Gela is significantly higher for both sexes, and this is shown also in the Municipality of Niscemi, especially among the male population. Hospital discharge records for tumor causes, but especially for non-tumor ones, exceeded expectations in both genders and must be analysed taking into consideration the attraction exerted on the surrounding areas by the Gela hospital. Data analysis according to 5 ten-year birth cohorts, from 1915 to 1964, shows a decreasing mortality trend, whereas the increase of hospital admissions is confirmed in the younger generations. The issue of birth defects is recurrent in this area: a suitable register is lacking so that updated figures cannot be presented. However, data previously published showed excesses of prevalence rates of several specific birth defects, mainly urinary tract and genital anomalies. The same is worth in the incidence of new cancer cases since the development of a proper register is yet in progress. Tools and methodologies that should be applied in Gela to study environment-health relations are proposed, like Life Cycle Analysis, dispersion patterns and an air-quality monitoring system. A conceptual model considering all pollution sources and different exposure patterns present in Gela, developed by the Multidisciplinary Working Group, is presented. Among the activities carried out by regional authorities, two Reports on the Regional Environment Protection Agency monitoring activity and on the EU Program SEARCH, School Environment And Respiratory Health in Children, are included. A section is devoted to understanding what is necessary to build an epidemiological monitoring system specifically designed for this area, in order to keep under permanent control environment-related health outcomes. This includes a systematic and continuative collection, storage and analysis of environmental-induced diseases, exposure and risk factors, as well as a timely dissemination of those information to the decision-makers. The final article describes the research activities carried out to design and implement a human biomonitoring survey in the area. These activities included relation-building with local communities, information collection, meetings, involvement of stake-holders. This experience will reach its climax when the community-exposure data feedback will be provided, because it will mark the consolidation of present knowledge and its possible processing into public health action plans. The present publication can represent an important tool and a model for all interest-bearers to assess environmental pollution impacts on human health in contaminated areas. A local system to assess the relation between environmental pollution and population health is therefore urgently needed to provide risk managers with ad-hoc tools to improve environmental protection and prevent further risks for local communities.","1421":"The development of Bayesian statistical methods for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of health care technologies is reviewed. Although many studies adopt a frequentist approach, several authors have advocated the use of Bayesian methods in health economics. Emphasis has been placed on the advantages of the Bayesian approach, which include: (i) the ability to make more intuitive and meaningful inferences; (ii) the ability to tackle complex problems, such as allowing for the inclusion of patients who generate no cost, thanks to the availability of powerful computational algorithms; (iii) the importance of a full use of quantitative and structural prior information to produce realistic inferences. Much literature comparing the cost-effectiveness of two treatments is based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. However, new methods are arising with the purpose of decision making. These methods are based on a net benefits approach. In the present context, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves have been pointed out to be intrinsically Bayesian in their formulation. They plot the probability of a positive net benefit against the threshold cost of a unit increase in efficacy.A case study is presented in order to illustrate the Bayesian statistics in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Emphasis is placed on the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Advantages and disadvantages of the method described in this paper have been compared to frequentist methods and discussed.","1422":"","1423":"Decisions in occupational health may involve ethical conflicts arising from conflicts between stakeholders' interests. Codes of ethics can provide a practical guide to solve dilemmas. The new law on health and safety in the workplace in Italy (decree 81\/2008) states that occupational health practice must comply with the code of ethics of the International Commission on Occupational Health. The universally acknowledged ethical principles of beneficience\/nonmaleficience, autonomy and justice, which are the basis of the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union, inspired this code. Although the code is not a systematic textbook of occupational health ethics and does not cover all possible aspects arising from the practice, making decisions based on it will assure their effectiveness and compliance with ethical principles, besides the formal respect of the law.","1424":"","1425":"To describe methanol poisoning exposures in Italy and to investigate a cluster of methanol-related deaths due to abuse occurred in Sicily among immigrants from East Europe. the human methanol exposures handled by the Poison Control Centre of Milan, the major national centre for toxicological advise active in Italy, were reviewed retrospectively (January 2004-September 2006) and prospectively (October 2006-October 2008). For each case of managed human exposure, the Poison Control Centre of Milan uses a standard format to collect patient information, substance\/exposure information, clinical effects, therapy, outcomes. The database arising from that procedure was searched for all cases exposed to methanol and\/or reporting selected clinical signs (i.e., metabolic acidosis with ocular effects and\/or central nervous system depression and\/or respiratory depression). Each case was reviewed and classified according to standard criteria. Three commercial products containing more than 70% methanol available on the market in Sicily and associated with lethal exposures due to abuse among immigrants were identified. In the period under study, the Poison Control Centre of Milan examined 29 methanol poisoning exposures (none in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 15 in 2007, and 2 in 2008). Among them, 17 occurred in Sicily, with a peak of 11 cases in 2007, and 12 in other regions. The patients included 16 men and 13 women with a median age of 49,5 years (range 1-81 years). Fifteen cases were immigrants from East Europe (14 Rumanian and one Polish). Eleven cases reported minor effects, two cases moderate effects, four cases major effects, and 12 cases died. Twelve cases were accidental exposures (5 occurred at work, 3 at home and 4 in other places), while 17 cases were intentional exposures (14 due to abuse, 2 to attempted suicide and 1 to misuse). Minor effects were reported in 11 cases, moderate effects in two cases, major effects in four cases and death in 12 cases. The most frequently reported clinical effects included: coma (13 cases), metabolic acidosis (10 cases), mydriasis (4 cases), visual loss (3 cases), gastric pyrosis (2 cases), constriction of the visual field (2 cases), and vertigo (2 cases). Blood methanol level was reported for 15 cases (&lt; 50 mg\/dL in 2 cases; 50-99 mg\/dL in 2 cases; 100-499 mg\/dL in 4 cases; &gt;500 mg\/dL in 1 case; positive, unknown value in 6 cases). All cases due to abuse (n. 14) and, among them, lethal (n. 12) occurred in Sicily and involved immigrants. On the other hand, all methanol poisonings occurring in the other Italian regions involved Italian citizens unintentionally exposed and with minor effects, except for one case of attempted suicide with consequent major effects. The investigations performed in Sicily lead to identifying three locally produced and marketed detergents containing more than 70% methanol, improperly labelled and packaged. Furthermore, a detergent for domestic use was identified containing 25-30% methanol without any labelling information. Two of the detergents containing more than 70% methanol were withdrawn from the market in November 2007, while the other, that was identified later, was withdrawn in July 2008. The detergent for domestic use, containing 25-30% methanol was withdrawn in December 2007. Starting from July 2008, no new cases of methanol poisonings were observed. The availability in Sicily of products containing high concentrations of methanol, improperly packaged and labelled, determined a generalised risk of accidental exposures and favoured voluptuary assumption of methanol among selected groups. The observations highlight the importance of a surveillance system of toxic exposures based on the information collected by the Poison Control Centres and its ability to provide timely identification of unexpected and dangerous events and to support preventive actions.

Particularly, it was tested whether some variables (routinely available) can describe the severity of casemix and the value of the \"ticket exemption\" database. the main administrative databases of the ASL were linked through the unique personal health identifier and analyzed by means of multivariate techniques, using the tariff as the dependent variable; the explanatory ones are a number of variables describing health conditions. ticket exemptions, assumed as estimator of health conditions, resulted quite reliable in predicting costs, often better than the traditional sex and age. Further, for some activities, as for instance hospitalization, they almost completely explain variability among general practitioners. ticket exemptions can be considered good estimators of the prevalence of some conditions in the general population and very good predictors of the use of health resources. They could be easily improved in this respect introducing slight modifications. Data show a good level of appropriateness in the use of hospital resources by general practitioners. ","1428":"to provide a synthesis of the state of the art on the effectiveness of local transport policies on improvements in air quality and public health. we searched published scientific articles focused on the evaluation of the accountability of local transport policies on emissions levels, on air pollutants concentrations, on air pollution-related health outcomes (respiratory and cardiovascular health). we selected 19 articles and reviews; authors used different methods to define and to monitor environmental and health indicators and data analyses are conducted on different spatio-temporal scales. the evaluation of the effects of transport policies on air quality and public health is a complex research field. Different factors may influence the assessment of impacts and there is an overlap of many intervention strategies that limit the interpretation of the findings.

Age standardized incidence rates for the whole province were computed. High-level risk areas were classified using a Poisson model, computing area-specific p-values associated to the null hypothesis of no increased risk (i.e. relative risk equal to 1). A hierarchical spatial Bayesian model was estimated to strengthen results: specifically two additional variance components, accounting for relative risk spatial autocorrelation and excess heterogeneity respectively, were considered in the model specification. Bayesian mapping of disease incidence allows for the drawing of regularized (smoothed) maps. To adjust for the effect of socio-economic deprivation, a five-variable index was introduced into the model as an ecological covariate. an increased risk of lung, pleura and bladder cancer was observed among male residents in the city of Taranto (respectively: SIR 1.24, p-value &lt; 0.01; SIR: 2.21, p-value &lt; 0.01; SIR 1.28, p-value &lt; 0.01).

PM10 data from the ARPA official monitoring stations were also evaluated. during a walking trip from Piazza Loreto (outside) to Piazza Duomo (inside Ecopass zone) and back, mean (SD) PM1, PM2,5 and PM10 were 31 (6), 68 (24) and 93 (37) microg\/m3 inside the Ecopass zone, and 32 (6), 70 (37), 98 (48) microg\/m3 in the outer area, respectively (not significant, ns).

Nevertheless, several experiences suggest that the proportion of occupational cancers unrecognised and not notified, as required by law, still remains important. This contribution concerns some experiences, performed between 2004-2008 by the Local Occupational Health Service (SPSAL) located in a highly industrialised province, on the working sector of rubber, iron and steel industry, the asphalt working and the poultry stock-breeders. This work concerns the following issues: - the evaluation of carcinogens exposure; - technical preventive measures and personal protection; - the level of workers' information and formation and the registration of exposed workers; - the characterization of work-related cancer. The results of the 5 years of activity allow us to underline that, in the most of 49 plants involved in the study, the carcinogens exposure evaluation and the prevention and protection measures were lacking. Information of workers was largely deficient and the registration of exposed workers was absent. A major attention to detect and to evaluate the work-related cancer has allowed us to recognize 50 new cases in the iron-steel industries and 21 new cases in a rubber industry. Although this experience concerns only few occupational fields, it provides the basis to call for a greater commitment of SPSAL addressed to companies and general practitioners to both, the promotion and surveillance of the correct procedures of carcinogens exposure evaluation and his prevention, and the active detection of occupational cancer, still missing.","1467":"European and Italian data show a marked under ascertainment of occupational cancers: only a small proportion is recognized, although for the majority of them the etiological fraction attributable to the workplace is high. Since more than 20 years Patronato INCA is active in order to reduce this gap. Its commitment to spread scientific knowledge has paralleled the action intended to make social security rules more favourable to workers, as well as to improve hygiene and safety in the workplace. Particular attention has been given to updating both the Italian list of occupational diseases for which notification is compulsory (which includes all Group I carcinogens according to IARC) and the Italian tables of occupational diseases. The latter are of particular relevance to the Patronato because, within the Italian norms, causality is approached in different terms according to whether a disease is or is not included in the tables. Together with changing the tables, a theoretical elaboration regarding causality, as required by multifactorial diseases such as occupational cancer, has been carried out. Such a constant commitment to bring to the surface occupational diseases is based on the belief that the right to compensation of workers who turned ill because of the work is important, and even more on the belief that identification of occupational diseases is most important for primary prevention.","1468":"As a result of legislation regarding the surveillance of occupational cancers in Italy three systems for the monitoring of the effects of occupational exposure to carcinogenic agents have been implemented: - theMesothelioma national register (ReNaM), one of the most important experiences in terms of quality of data produced, territorial coverage and scientific reliability of results; - the rino-sinusal national tumor register (ReNaTuns). Today important regional experiences are on going in Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany. - OCCAM, a monitoring system based on the linkage of available information. The SIREP system has been implemented to monitor the exposure to carcinogenic agents in the workplace and is available at ISPESL. In the near future, the epidemiology of occupational cancer in Italy will most certainly regard issues such as scientific research, surveillance, compensation and prevention.","1469":"The persistence of exposure to carcinogens at work in member States of the European union and in other industrialised countries has been repeatedly reported, and prompts for the epidemiologic assessment of trends in cancer risk according to changes in exposure distribution. Epidemiological evidence of risk reduction could be produced for all agents classified by the International agency for cancer research as Group 1 agents (human carcinogens). However, such evidence is available only for a much more limited number of agents. Benzene and asbestos are used as case-studies, given the very large number of epidemiological studies conducted on populations exposed to them. Only five studies assessed cancer risk after exposure cessation, and in four of them cessation was due to dismission of the industrial activities rather than to the introduction of industrial hygiene measures. The bases for assessment of effectiveness in the field of occupational (and environmental) prevention differ from those of evidence-based medicine. The burden of proof should be on the employer to demonstrate that a given industry can be operated safely; once evidences of adverse effects have been found, that should be per se sufficient to enforce strict control of exposures. From a methodological point of view, it would be either impossible or unethical to conduct controlled trials to assess effectiveness, and in general the highest level of evidence that can be reasonably achieved is that provided by observational studies.","1470":"The active search for occupational neoplasms has been implemented only in Italy. This search can be carried out with two modalities: the in-hospital face-to-face interview of selected cancer cases, and the linkage of available information (OCCAM). Both were supported by a special project on occupational carcinogenesis of the Lombardy Region. The active search for occupational neoplasms is a moderate-cost activity and is important for the safeguard of the workforce and of the population as a whole.","1471":"The collaboration between epidemiology and the laboratory (molecular investigations) has been proposed to face some of the limitations of epidemiological studies, in particular errors in exposure identification and assessment for environmental exposures. Molecular epidemiology has some advantages: changes in biomarkers appear early in the disease process, i.e. it is not necessary to wait for decades for the onset of a chronic disease in populations exposed to environmental contaminants; biomarkers allow a better quantification of &lt;&lt;internal exposure&gt;&gt;, and draw our attention to the role of the environment and early damage rather than individual susceptibility. In the mean time limitations of biomarkers need to be addressed, in particular the lack of validation, the limited reproducibility of several biomarkers, and the fact that measurements are expensive and cumbersome.","1472":"Nowadays tumours represent one of the major problems of public health, both for their epidemiological dimension as for the causes that are at their origin, represented by three important factors: people ageing, general and occupational environmental pollution, including incongruous individual behaviour, and individual genetic susceptibility. The strategies followed till today in order to check tumours have privileged the role of therapeutic interventions: the results achieved show the great limits. On the contrary, current scientific experiences indicate the need to re-orientate present strategies, developing prevention programmes for the identification of carcinogenic risks (primary prevention), and early diagnosis of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions (secondary prevention). In this review we discuss the importance of primary prevention in tumour control and specifically we present: - the role of long-term carcinogenic bioassays on rodents (rats and mice) in order to identify and predict the carcinogenic risks and then the great value that these studies have for public health; - the two major programmes of carcinogenic bioassays: the National Toxicological Program (NTP) of the US government, and the one performed by the European Ramazzini Foundation (ERF), in Italy; - the importance of observing the experimental animals until spontaneous death in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assays, a way of working followed by ERF from the beginning.","1473":"Epidemiology is a public health oriented discipline and is aimed to detect the spatial, temporal, social and causal distribution of diseases in the human population, in order to promote timely and effective preventive solutions. This paper highlights some gold standard of the epidemiological method and suggests some considerations for a critical comprehension of epidemiological studies, in particular those that deny or minimize the existence of public health risks. This paper will focus on some crucial elements such as definition, attribution, misclassification and underestimation of the harmful exposures caused by a multitude of factors, undervaluation of the possible interactions among harmful agents (even when law limits are respected), selection of exposed populations, insufficient number of studied diseases, importance of the right comparisons between similar groups when the reference population is used, disproportion between shortness of follow-up in respect with long latency period of the studied diseases, including cancer. This paper also observes that many epidemiologists carry out confirmative studies rather than exploratory ones, and they end to both underestimate and underevaluate the multiplicity of the causal associations in favour of a reductive and a critical approach to the statistics which, in final analysis, wants to replace epidemiology. It points out, moreover, that neglecting primary prevention as well as precautionary principles in the interpretation of public health studies, arises the suspicion of professional limitation or strong conflict of interests (business bias). Epidemiology is naturally oriented to both primary prevention and public health defense, and today, more than ever before, for many reasons, among which the overwhelming market power that is first and foremost the cause of the general increase of populations affected by avoidable pathologies, a systematic, correct and timely application of this precious discipline seems to be urgent to us. In conclusion, we would suggest that some technical-scientific and institutional initiatives should overcome the intrinsic limits of the current aetiological researches. The rigorous adhesion of epidemiology to its scientific method appears to be absolutely necessary in order to enforce the Italian constitutional principle which states that health defence is a fundamental right of each individual and a concern for the whole community.","1474":"This review considers some facets of the problem of the recognition of carcinogenic risks in the workplace. The crucial role that long-term animal experiments have had over the decades in the recognition of the carcinogenicity of agents which are present in the workplace should not be underestimated. Further, awareness should be developed about the obstacles met by the implementation of long-term epidemiological studies on occupational cancer and to the fact that not infrequently the interpretation of results of such studies is problematic.Thus, within the philosophy of the precautionary principle, risks suggested by studies in laboratory animals should not be ignored. Recent observations on risks associated to melamine are a good example of the consequences of imprudent interpretations of findings in laboratory animals. Another paragraph is addressed to proposals of screening for cancer in asymptomatic workers. Basic principles of cancer screening are recalled. For no site known to be the target of occupational carcinogens, currently, there is evidence that ad hoc screening programmes offered to asymptomatic workers have the potential for improving the natural history of the disease. Finally, a comment is made on the increasing attention given to genetic susceptibility to occupational cancer. As yet, no convincing findings have been obtained in this area. In any case, this line of research is not to be considered as an approach to preventive strategies alternative to the elimination of exposure to occupational carcinogens.","1475":"In Italy during the last three decades important changes in employment have occurred. During the '70s, thanks to a variety of factors, the hygiene conditions of work have undergone a process of slow, but gradual improvement, which has not been arrested during the following decades. New legislation, partly deriving from European directives, has been introduced, and processes of outsourcing have moved the most burdensome and pollutants industrial productions to developing countries. Nevertheless, the estimates of the number of exposed (or even potentially so) workers, to carcinogens remain quite high. Currently, in absence of the planned National Information System on Prevention, it is impossible to estimate in how many and which workplaces primary prevention plans and facilities have been already installed. This paper aims to describe the situation related to most occupationally diffused carcinogenic agents: asbestos, wood and crystalline silica dusts, each one for its specificity. It also describes the innovations introduced by the most recent legislation, in particular with regard to the asbestos risk control. Finally, it stresses the need for a reform of the insurance premiums in order to introduce a mechanism for rewarding those employers who implement primary prevention facilities and penalizing those who don't. The economic advantages should gradually cover the cost of risk control technology.","1476":"In this article, the issue of occupational cancer is discussed by studying the correlation between work conditions and health-related social disparity.Without aiming to furnish a review of the pertinent scientific literature in this field, some matters for discussion will be advanced to initiate scientific and political debate. Keeping in mind the major socio-health disparities still present in European countries, the objective is to address the issue of knowledge generation pertinent to occupational cancer in a complex scenario with numerous obstacles posed both by employers and by the issue of differing methodological approaches, which require cooperation between various disciplines such as epidemiology, toxicology, statistics, and sociology of health. Such cooperation cannot be effective unless both the political and the scientific aspects are addressed in the investigative process and the decisive role of mobilization of the workforce is acknowledged. Finally, the article discusses the particular condition of women, highly underestimated in the scientific literature concerning health issues in the workplace. We have observed that albeit current understanding in this field is insufficient, intervention strategies and prevention policies are inadequate even when measured against this knowledge base. In order for prevention to be effective, public policies on industry, territorial health, environmental protection, and the workplace must be integrated, figures able to act as prime movers in the change process need to be identified, and replacement of carcinogenic substances and production processes must be favoured.","1477":"The article reviews the estimates of Attributable Fraction (AF) of occupational cancers. Because of their relevance, it starts with a synthesis and a comment on the estimates of avoidable cancers, and among these of cancers due to occupation, as expressed in 1981 by Doll and Peto. The main studies that have brought back into the epidemiological pathway the exercise of producing FA are quoted and the results of the new studies reviewed. The dimension of occupational cancers is of public health importance, because caused by exposures assumed to be avoidable. However, the estimates of AF are prone to uncertainties and limitations. Occupational cancers represent the major killer among deaths due to occupational diseases and injuries and a relevant fraction, especially among males, of total cancers. When related to developed countries, estimates may underestimate the risks, because of the insufficient data on exposures for workers in small firms, the lack of information on exposures in agriculture, the scanty availability of epidemiological studies on cancer risks among women. The trend towards a reduction of employees in industrial activities, the elimination or control of some exposures should suggest, instead, a reduction for occupational cancer. However, the more recent estimates of AF of occupational cancers are still in line with the estimates expressed more that 20 years ago. In developing countries, the estimates of AF are plenty of assumptions. In addition, some characteristics (i.e. the younger age of starting work, the extension of work at older age) suggest the need of better data, whereas information on exposures and events are dramatically lacking.","1478":"Here are recalled the most interesting elements in order to outline a history of cultural representation and application of the criteria to fight and control the effects and, eventually, the risks from carcinogens in the workplace in Italy in a period longer than a century. The roles of the actors of this process, such as social partners and institutions, are illustrated, and consequently the critical aspects of risks management and control at present starting from the description of two different scientific and ideological policies, the &lt;&lt;MAC 0&gt;&gt; (TLV null) and the criteria required by current legislation, although in conflict between them but, at least in some cases, able to interact and, in some aspects, completing themselves. The critical points and some contradiction of the system are described and emphasis is placed on the imperative need to promote the risks primary prevention from carcinogens rather than possible other interests on the insurance and welfare fields.","1479":"the aim of this collaborative project of the Italian Network of Cancer Registries (Airtum; www.registri-tumori.it) was to analyse cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy with special reference to the period 1998-2005. the study was based on the Airtum database, which collects and checks data from all the Airtum registries. The present study was based on 20 general and 2 specific populationbased cancer registries. Overall, we analysed 818,017 incident cases and 342,444 cancer deaths for the time period 1998-2005. Seventy percent of the analysed population was from the North of Italy, 17% from the Centre, and 13% from the South. A joinpoint analysis was carried out to detect the point in time where the trend changed; trends are described by means of the estimated annual percent change (APC), with appropriate 95% confidence intervals. Crude and standardized incidence and mortality rates were computed for 36 cancer sites, for both sexes, three age-classes (0-49, 50-69 and 70+ years), and three geographic areas (North, Centre, and South of Italy). Specific chapters are devoted to long-term trends (1986-2005), differences among age-groups, and international comparisons. In 1998-2005, cancer mortality for all sites showed a statistically significant decrease among men (APC - 1.7) and women (- 0.8). Mortality significantly decreased in both sexes for stomach cancer, rectum cancer, liver cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Mortality also decreased among men for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, prostate, urinary bladder, and leukaemia. Among women mortality decreased for cancers of the colon, bone, breast, and uterus not otherwise specified. An increase in mortality was recorded for lung cancer among women (+1.5) and melanoma among men (+2.6). Incidence for all cancers together (except non-melanoma skin cancers) increased among men (APC +0.3) and remained stable among women. Cancer sites which showed increasing incidence were thyroid and melanoma in both sexes, colon, testis, soft tissue among men, and lung and Hodgkin lymphoma among women. For several cancer sites incidence decreased, e.g., stomach and Kaposi sarcoma (men and women), upper aerodigestive tract, oesophagus, lung, urinary bladder, myeloma and leukaemia (men), gallbladder, cervix uteri and ovary (women). this monograph presents a detailed description of cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy. It is based on the Italian Network of Cancer Registries which presently covers about one-third of the whole Italian population.

They also advocate for an interdisciplinary approach to relate epidemiology to other branches of knowledge, especially qualitative sociology. Qualitative studies can be carried out both ex ante, prior to the epidemiological investigation, and ex post, to verify limits of the analysis itself. Useful and unintended elements for the epidemiological investigation are likely to emerge in the course of a study.

Deliberation is analysed by political scientists because deliberative experiences usually involve citizens in the policy making process. Although experts are instrumental in many deliberative processes, scholars usually ignore the interaction between scientific information, citizens' knowledge and deliberation. Through the analysis of three citizens' juries, the article examines the effects that experts-citizens interaction generates on cognitive mechanisms. People who participate in deliberative processes often seem not to accept information experts give them. Cognitive psychologists assert that this is a typical human mechanism: people select information choosing messages more linked with their values and believes. Observing deliberative processes, where people not only have to learn but to make policies in a public arena the reaction of citizens seems less instinctive. In a deliberative context citizens are not satisfied of information, they want to know what there is behind facts and causal relations: how instruments measure data, which methods are used. In other words, in a deliberative context citizens want to understand reality before knowing it.","1483":"The LaboRisCh algorithm is a practical tool for the first-level assessment of the health risk from chemicals in research laboratories and similar workplaces. Through the assessment of the risk index related to each agent (Ra), the algorithm leads to the calculation of the value of a baseline risk index (Rb), and finally to a corrected risk index (Rc). The value of Rc sets the relevant condition in one of three health risk zones. The algorithm also includes carcinogens and mutagens, whose presence mandates the addition of the c\/m subscript (Rc(c\/m)). The addition is automatic for agents allocated the EU risk phrases R40, R45, R46, R49 and R68; whereas it is at the discretion of the evaluator for non EU-classified agents that belong to EU categories 1 or 2 and\/or to IARC categories 1, 2A or 2B. Further research has led to integration of the algorithm. For instance, similarly to the provision for carcinogens and mutagens, the r subscript (Rc(r)) is now required for agents that are considered toxic to reproduction allocated or attributable to risk phrases R60, R61, R62 and R63.","1484":"In recent years, cost-effectiveness analysis has become a frequent component of randomized clinical trials. In statistical terms, the major efforts addressed the method for estimating the Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and its confidence interval both with parametric and non-parametric methods.

The methods which have been considered were applied to the data of a randomized clinical trial comparing two alternative approaches to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The example shows that the application of different methods leads to significantly different confidence intervals' estimates, with consequences on the interpretation of the study results.","1485":"this study evaluates changes in life expectancy at birth and at 65 years of residents in Rome between 1991 and 2005 by gender and socioeconomic position (SEP). epidemiologic study based on mortality data from the Regional Registry of Causes of Death (ReNCaM).

Recent advances in time and cost for genotyping have rapidly moved from a candidate gene approach to genome-wide studies, but the methodological issues remain the same and furthermore increased. One of the major problem is that the genome is large and includes many polymorphic variants which could be found associated by chance. In addiction, complex diseases will require complex analyses in which many variants are assessed simultaneously. To help to distinguish causal associations from spurious ones, restrictive standard for statistical significance or considering polymorphisms which could be a-priori causally associated to disease are needed.","1496":"Incinerators reduce urban waste volumes and recover energy by combustion, but produce important quantities of solid wastes: bottom ashes and fly ashes.

From a public health point of view, screening and vaccination are interventions directed to the whole community and their goal is to reach high coverage of the target population. The vaccinated women should be screened with different algorithms from the non-vaccinated ones, consequently we need individual information about the vaccination status of the women that we are going to invite for screening. Vaccine and screening interventions must be integrated in a unique public health program and screening should use less aggressive protocols, to be less expensive and more sustainable and efficient. The challenge for the Health Service is to integrate the primary and secondary prevention avoiding that one will diminish the benefits of the other and that the introduction of new technologies will be only the opportunity to double the costs with minimal health benefits.","1498":"To assess whether mortality rates differ among areas with different values of a socioeconomic index.

Observed and expected numbers of cancer were compared through sex- and age-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The transplant attributable fraction (AF) of cancer cases and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were also computed. After 16.594 PY of follow-up (median flow-up: 6.8 years), 121 cancer cases were diagnosed (729.2 cases\/10(5) PY). The SIR for all cancers was 1.9.

Significantly increased SIRs were also noted for native kidney (11 cases observed SIR = 4.9), corpus uteri (6 cases observed SIR = 4.6), and liver (6 cases observed, SIR = 3.1). The transplant AF was 46.9%, largely due to KS (98.8%) and NHL (84.3%). Since SIRs decreased with increasing age, the transplant AF ranged from 73.2% below 45 years of age to 30.4% after 54. Among risk factors, area of birth strongly influenced the risk of KS, with a 3-fold higher risk in those born in the South of Italy as compared to those born in the northern part. Immune depression after kidney transplantation entails a two-fold increased overall risk of cancer, mainly related to cancers associated to a viral aetiology.

The results from a multicentre study using a standard approach to probabilistic record-linkage procedures are also included in a specific chapter. Eleven Italian centres from five Italian regions with an overall population of 11,932,026 collected and treated more than 21,374,426 records (year 2003) from five electronic information sources: death certificates, hospital discharge records (including outpatient discharges), drug prescriptions, tax- exemptions, and pathology records in order to estimate the frequency of the following diseases: diabetes, ischemic heart diseases, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive lung diseases. For each pathology a specific algorithm was developed and used by all centres for the identification of the prevalent\/incident cases of the selected diseases. Standardized methods were used to estimate the rates. The results confirm the need for a common standard approach to produce estimates based on EHA, considering the variability of the quality and of the completeness of the archives, and the difficulties of standardizing record-linkage operations in the various centres. The main achievement of this work was the elimination of the variability due to the use of different algorithms to identify cases using EHA.","1522":"","1523":"","1524":"","1525":"","1526":"","1527":"","1528":"","1529":"Community interventions represent a key component of the current anti-smoking strategies.

To facilitate their evaluation and to contribute to the detection of determinants, as well as of barriers, it is necessary to compare community interventions sharing similar theoretical approaches and focuses. Also, studies aimed at assessing the steps of the implementation process of community programmes may allow to identify those components related to specific levels of intervention, thus enabling the generalisation of results.

Results are summarized by cancer site: all cancers, neoplasms that may be a target of exposure to depleted uranium (lung cancer, leukemias, kidney cancer, bone cancer), and other neoplasms (lymphomas, brain cancer, and cancer of the testis) relatively frequent among young adults. The overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of Gulf war and Balkans veterans published to date, nor there is consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms possibly related to exposure to depleted uranium. However, in the Danish cohort of Balkans veterans an increased risk ofbone cancer has been observed, but the excess disappeared when a 1-year latency was considered. An increased brain cancer risk in relation to exposure to nerve-gas agents has been observed. Sporadic excesses of Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer in deployed veterans have been reported. None of the studies reviewed could obiectively assess exposures to depleted uranium or to other potentially carcinogenic agents experienced in the theaters.

Out of the 1,092,201 people in the Brescia ASL, 275,601 had at least one chronic disease (prevalence 252.3\/1,000). Diseases ofthe circulatory system were the most frequent (169.1\/1,000), followed by diabetes mellitus (36 6\/1,000). Having had an organ transplant was the condition with the highest per-person expenditure (Euro 16,170\/year). The highest total expenditure was associated with circulatory diseases, because of the high prevalence (Euro 470,377,413). A single computerised data base is capable of achieving epidemiological aims (assessing population health status) as well as managerial and health care aims (resources management, control of the appropriateness of services, adaptation of diagnostic-therapeutic methods to international guidelines and standards).

Data routinely registered by organised programmes was provided as aggregated tables. We obtained data on colpo-histological correlation from 63 programmes. Of the 14,745 reported colposcopies 38.9% were classified as normal and 19.6% as unsatisfactory. CIN1 or more severe histology was detected in 2,664\/4,877 (54.6%) colposcopies classified as grade 1. CIN2 or more severe histology was detected in 865\/1,239 (69.8%) colposcopies classified as grade 2 or higher. Of all colposcopies during which a CIN2 or more severe histology was detected, 40.3% had a colposcopy classified as grade 2 or higher. We obtained data on treatment from 82 programmes. Of the 2,903 women with CIN1, 69.8% had follow-up only. However 25 (0.9%) of them had cold-knife conisation, 212 (7.3%) were treated by diathermocoagulation and 17 (0.6%) had hysterectomy. Of the 2,568 women with CIN2 or CIN3, 4.9% had not yet been treated when data was collected and no data was available for a further 7.5%. Excision by radio-frequency device was the most common treatment among these women (60. 6% of those with known treatment). However, 1.5 % of all CIN2 and 5.5 % of all CIN3 had hysterectomy. Among the 140 women with invasive carcinoma 17.8%, plausibly with microinvasive disease, had excisional treatment only reported.","1545":"Within this survey, conducted by the Italian Group of Mammography Screening (GISMa), individual data are collected yearly on more than 50% of all screen-detected operated lesions in Italy. In 2005, results showed overall good diagnosis and treatment quality, and an improving trend over time. Critical issues were identified in waiting times, compliance with the recommendations on not performing frozen section examination on small lesions and on performing specimen X-ray. Pre-operative diagnosis has reached the acceptable target, but room for improvement still exists. The sentinel lymph node technique (SLN) was performed on the axilla in more than 70% of screen-detected invasive cancers, avoiding a large number of potentially harmful dissections. On the other hand, potential overuse of SLN deserves further investigation. The detailed results have been distributed to local and regional screening programmes in order to allow multidisciplinary discussion and the identification of appropriate solutions to any problems documented by the data. Specialist Breast Units with adequate case volume would provide the best setting for making audit effective in producing quality improvement.","1546":"We present the main results of the third survey of the Italian screening programmes for colorectal cancer carried out by the ONS (Osservatorio Nazionale Screening, National Centre for Screening Monitoring) on behalf of the Ministry of Health. During 2006, many new programmes were activated and by the end of the year, 44% of Italians aged 50-69 years were residing in areas covered by organised screening programmes (theoretical extension). Five regions had their entire population covered. In the South of Italy and Islands only one new programme was activated in 2006, with a 10% theoretical extension. The majority of programmes employ the faecal occult blood test (FOBT), while some have adopted the flexible sigmoidoscopy (PS) once in a lifetime, or a combination of both. Overall, about 2,107,000 subjects were invited to undergo FOBT, 70.3% of those to be invited within the year. The adjusted attendance rate was 44.6% and approximately 907,000 subjects were screened. Major differences in the attendance rate were observed among regions, with 10% of programmes reporting values lower than 26%. Positivity rate of FOBT programmes was 5.3% at first and 3.9% at repeat screening: it increased with age and was higher among males than females in all age groups. The average attendance rate to total colonoscopy (TC) was 81% (10th-9Oth percentiles: 64%, 93%). Completion rate of TC was 89%, with higher rates among males. At first screening, the detection rate (DR) per 1,000 screened subjects was 3.1 and 14.6 for invasive cancer and advanced adenomas (AA--adenomas with a diameter &gt; or =1 cm, with villous\/tubulo-villous type or with high-grade dysplasia), respectively; the corresponding figures at repeat screening were 1.3 per thousand for cancer and 7.7 per thousand for AA. The DR of cancer and adenomas increased with age and was higher among males; 25% of screen-detected cancers were in TNM stage III+. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 6.8% for cancer and 32.1% for AA at first screening, and 4.0% for cancer and 23.4% for AA at repeat screening. Given the high PPVof a positive FOBT, obtaining a high attendance at TC is therefore crucial. Seven programmes employed PS as the screening test: 51.4% of the target population (about 50,000 subjects) were invited and 7,589 subjects were screened, with an attendance rate of 29.2%. Overall, 88% of FS were classified as complete. TC referral rates ranged between 6.1 and 17.8%, due to different referral criteria. Among subjects referred to colonoscopy, the prevalence of proximal AA and cancer ranged from 6 to 18.2%. The overall DR (subjects with at least one advanced lesion) ranged from 4.9 to 7.5%. In conclusion, during 2006, organised colorectal cancer screening programmes in Italy grew considerably, covering almost half of the eligible population at a national level. Many programmes were activated in the second part of the year, thus their results should be evaluated with caution. However, reported experiences showed good results in terms of attendance and DR, although some critical aspects need to be carefully addressed when planning and implementing screening activity.","1547":"Since 1996, Italian national guidelines recommend that Regions implement organised screening programmes for cervical cancer. As in previous years since 1998, we have collected from Italian organised cervical screening programmes aggregated tables of data in order to centrally compute process indicators. In 2006, the target population of Italian organised screening programmes included 11,362,580 women, corresponding to 69% of Italian women aged 25-64 years. However, taking into account the proportion of women invited, the actual extension was 52.9%. Compliance to invitation was 38.5%, with a clear North-South decreasing trend. It should, however, be considered that many women are screened outside the organised programmes. The remaining process indicators deal with women invited during 2005 and screened up to April 2006 Of these, 6.1% were recommended to repeat cytology and 57% of them complied; 2.3% of screened women were referred to colposcopy. Compliance to colposcopy was 84.7% among women referred because of ASCUS or more severe cytology and 90% among those referred because of HSIL or more severe cytology. The positive predictive value (PPV) of referral because of ASCUS or more severe cytology for CIN2 or more severe histology was 16.8%. There was a relevant variability of both referral rate and PPV that were inversely related. The unadjusted detection rate of histologically confirmed CIN2 or more severe was 2.7 per 1,000 screened women (2.6 standardised on the Italian population, truncated 25-64).","1548":"Since its establishment in 1990, one of the main tasks of the Italian Group for Mammography Screening (GISMa) has been that of collecting, as systematically and thoroughly as possible, data on the activity of the various mammography screening programmes implemented in Italy. Data are collected in an aggregated way and gathered through a standardised form to calculate process and impact parameters. Analysis of data collected in the period 1996-2006 shows that the number of Italian women involved in mammography screening has constantly increased over time. In 2006, almost 8 out of 10 Italian women in the 50-69 year age range lived in areas where an organised screening activity had been implemented. The geographical distribution of the screening activity in Italy continues to present differences between Northern and Central Italy, where the coverage ranges from 95.7% to 89.6%, and Southern Italy and the Islands, where this value is still lower (45.9%). The discrepancy between annual theoretical coverage and actual coverage still persists (21%). Throughout the period, crude attendance rate reached the acceptable 50% standard, presenting the same North-South trend as the coverage rate distribution. In areas where the centralised management is more established or complete, the participation rate was higher compared with areas without such characteristics, with differences of about 4-9%. The time trends of the other parameters included in the analysis showed a good average performance. For example, benignant\/malignant surgical biopsy ratio (B\/M ratio) continued to progressively decrease, reaching 0.24 at first screening and 0.14 at subsequent screening in 2005; overall detection rate, detection rate for in situ and small cancers (&lt; or =10 mm) showed a good trend, reaching 6.0 per thousand, 0.7 per thousand, and 1.3 per thousand, respectively, for first screening, and 5.2 per thousand, 0.8 per thousand, and 1.6 per thousand for subsequent screening in 2005. On the contrary, excess referral rate at first screening persists over time. Data comparing activity volume and programme duration were also considered. In programmes with greater activity volume (average test number: 24,596) the referral rate for first screening was higher if compared with programmes with lower activity volume, but still within acceptable standards. Nevertheless, this performance is compensated by better specificity and sensitivity. An improvement in quality with the increase of programmes experience continues to be evident: compared with new programmes, programmes with more than 6 years of activity showed lower recall rates and higher positive predictive values and overall detection rates in first screening. Outcomes related to subsequent screening present analogous performances. These results continue to be consistent with those achieved by other European programmes and reassuring for all Italian mammography screening professionals.","1549":"Mammography screening programmes in Italy have been implemented since the early 90's. Over the last ten years, national and international institutions have strongly supported screening programme implementation with several laws. Since 2004, the Italian Ministry of Health, together with the Commission of Regions and Self-governing Provinces Health Officials, has officially entrusted the ONS (Osservatorio Nazionale Screening, National Centre for Screening Monitoring) with monitoring and promoting nationwide screening programmes. Previously, for several years, GISMa (Gruppo Italiano per lo Screening Mammografico) carried out a yearly survey to collect process indicators of mammography screening and compare them, using national and international standard values as reference. In 2006, an updated version of the operative report of process indicators was published by GISMa, and in November 2006 the updated national screening guidelines, prepared by the workgroups on oncological screening set up by the Ministry, was published. This report is an update of similar previous papers published by the ONS since 2002. Data for the survey come from several different programmes that may have changed over time, and may have different settings of organisation and management. During 2005, an increase in screening activity was recorded with the inclusion of all Northern and Central Italian Regions, and 2006 showed a further development n the Southern Regions and Islands. Only one Region is missing (Puglia), but it started its activity in 2007; so starting from 2007, all Italian Regions have implemented screening programmes. In 2006, more than 2 million women aged 50-69 years were invited to have a screening mammogram, and over 1,150,000 were screened. Theoretical extension was 76.4% in 2005 and 78.2% in 2006. This year shows an important increase in actual extension, improving from 50.3% in 2005 to 57.2% in 2006 and finally rising over the critical value of about 50% registered during the last years. An imbalance in coverage is still present when comparing Northern and Central Italy (more than 90%) to Southern Italy, which only has a 46% coverage by organised screening. The percentage of women screened during 2005 accounted for 28.6% of the national target population, and increased up to 31.8% in 2006. During the three-year period 2004-2006, participation rates were substantially stable around 55-57% for crude rate, and 59-60% for adjusted rate, respectively. A decreasing trend towards the South of Italy is evident for this parameter, too, but in 2005-2006 the Central Regions registered the highest increase in attendance: crude and adjusted participations rose from 52-54% in 2004 to 56-58% in 2005-2006. Many programmes work with low volumes of activity (below 10,000 or even 5,000 examinations per year), and no regional mean value surpassed the desirable level of at least 20,000 examinations for each programme. Referral rates of 8.3% at first screening and 4.5% at repeat screening were recorded. Direct standardised detection rate was 5.7 x 1,000 at first test and 4.6 at repeat test, while benign to malignant ratio for first and repeat screening was 0.28 and 0.21, respectively. Detection rate of invasive cancers &lt; or =10 mm was 1.44 x 1,000 at first test and 1.58 at repeat test; the proportion of in situ carcinomas was 12.9% and 14.7% for first and repeat test, respectively. Indicators by 5-year age group confirm greater diagnostic problems at younger ages, with higher referral rates, higher frequency of surgical procedures with benign outcome (B\/M ratio), and a substantially lower detection rate as compared to older age groups.","1550":"","1551":"Epidemiological studies often involve multiple comparisons, and may therefore report many \"false positive\" statistically significant findings simply because of the large number of statistical tests involved. Traditional methods ofadjustment for multiple comparisons, such as the Bonferroni method, may induce investigators to ignore potentially important findings, because they do not take account of the fact that some variables are of greater a priori interest than others. The Bonferroni method involves \"adjustings all of the findings to take account of the number of comparisons involved even though the a priori evidence may be very strong for some exposures, but may be much weaker (or non-existent)for the other exposures being considered. Furthermore, the Bonferroni method only \"adjusts\" for estimates of statistical signficance (p-values) and does not \"adjust\" the effect estimates themselves (e.g. odds ratios and 95% CI). Empirical Bayes and semi-Bayes methods can enable the avoidance of numerous false positive associations, and can produce effect estimates that are, on the average, more valid. In this paper, we report on a research in which we applied these methods to a case-control study of occupational risk factors for lung cancer and tested their performance.","1552":"this study shows the mortality rates in a retrospective cohort of intravenous drug users attending the public treatment centres (SERT), in the metropolitan area of Bologna, from 1978 to 2004 (3753 subjects, 2926 men and 827 women). The overall mortality rate decreases after 1996 because of the substantial drop of mortality rate owing to AIDS. The overdose mortality increases until 1998 and then decreases; as from 1997 it becomes the first cause of death. The risk of death due to overdose is higher in men than in women, it is higher in subjects treated at SERT during the period 1996-2000 and decreases in subjects treated for more than two years. the study confirms an over mortality, due to all causes, of the cohort compared with the general population, in accordance with the results of other studies, and a remarkably high mortality for women (SMR in men: 1464; 95% CI 13.45-15.93; SMR in women: 25.61; 95% CI21.53-30.45) as well. Major causes of death among men are, besides overdose and AIDS, cirrhosis, cardiovascular disorders, suicide, lung tumour, and road accidents; among women are suicide, cirrhosis and cardiovascular disorders. The risk of death is higher before 1996 with regard to subjects attending SERT before 1990, and to those who are in treatment for less than two years. Also at higher risk are those subjects with a low schooling level and unemployed. ","1553":"GISMa analyses the interval cancer (IS) topic providing guidelines and reference standards in addition to CE recommendations. IC identification is based on Cancer Registries (CR), if existing, or on hospital discharge records, in alternative. The optimal measure of IC frequency (inversely correlated with sensitivity) is the IC proportional incidence (observed IC\/carcinomas expected in absence of screening). Other formulas (IC\/IC + screen detected cancers; IC rate per 1000 negative screens) look less reliable. IC stage at diagnosis (if available through CR) must be compared with screen detected cancer and cancer detected in non-attenders. Review of mammograms preceding the IC (coded as screening error, minimal signs, or occult) should be done mainly with a blind procedure (IC mixed with negative controls), as this procedure is more representative of the original scenario and more respectful of radiologist's rights.","1554":"tuberculosis is a global heath priority and the surveillance systems are essential tools to control the spread of the disease.

Tuberculosis cases were identified from the integrated Regional Tuberculosis Surveillance System (SSR- TB), the Tuberculosis Laboratory Registry (RL-TB), and the Regional Registry of Inpatient Records (SDO). 1790 cases of tuberculosis were recorded, in 28.6% (512) of the cases the disease was observed among individuals from countries with high prevalence of tuberculosis. Microbiologically confirmed cases of tuberculosis were 1254 (70%), while pulmonary cases were 1233 (69%). The annual crude incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 inhabitants) was 14.1 cases, 31.5% of whom were attributable to immigration from countries with high prevalence of tuberculosis. The incidence among immigrants was 122.4 cases, while that of microbiologically confirmed cases was 9.8 cases. The overall estimated sensitivity, for the microbiologically confirmed cases, was 97%, while the sensitivity of SSR-TB was 90%. Our estimate of tuberculosis incidence in Piedmont is about two times as great as that given by the WHO for Italy (8 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The fraction of incident cases attributable to immigration from countries with high prevalence of tuberculosis is also consistent with that estimated in other industrialized countries undergoing high immigration flows.

The \"study population\" includes 1226 patients (54.2% males and 45.4% females), mean age 47 years. Patients have a middle\/high level of education and a long history of smoking; most are highly dependent on nicotine and report previous attempts to quit smoking. treatment effectiveness in smoking cessation is assessed six months after entering treatment service. Logistic Regression Model was used to determine the predictors of successfiul cessation, independent of treatment typology. The predictors were included as confounding variables in the logistic regression model that was used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. Besides the effect of treatment completion on smoking cessation was estimated. predictors of successful smoking cessation are: being male, presence of a partner, strong motivation to quit, previous attempts to give up smoking, mild nicotine dependence, and not suffering from mood disturbances. All treatments are effective in helping people to stop smoking: cessation rate ranges between 25.00% for patients receiving a single session of motivational counselling and 65.3% for those receiving nicotine replacement therapy combined to group therapy. Compared to a single session of motivational counseling, nicotine replacement therapy combined to group therapy is the most effective therapeutic program (OR 5.4; 95%CI 12.5-12.0). Treatment completion is a strong determinant ofsuccess (OR 4.8; 95%CI 3.5-6.4). enrolling people in any type of therapeutic program, in particular nicotine replacement therapy combined with group therapy increases the probability of successfully quitting smoking; moreover, patients that begin a smoking cessation program should be encouraged to complete the therapy ","1568":"to estimate mortality due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), risk of dying from COPD without hospital admission and mortality within 30 days after hospital admission for COPD in an Italian region. population registries of death causes and hospital discharge reports were used as data sources; COPD was identified through ICD-9 codes = 490.X, 491.X, 492.X, 494.Xe 496.X. Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by direct standardisation using the Italian population from 1996 to 2000; logistic regression was used to estimate predictors of dying from COPD in multivariable models. there were 4,292 deaths among men and 2,713 among women; the mean annual mortality was 3.68\/10,000 inhabitants among men and 2.29\/10,000 among women. no statistically significant trend was observed from 1996 to 2000, but the increase in mortality rate was higher for females (13.2%) than for males (2.0%), suggesting a possible inversion in smoking habit between sexes. The risk of dying without hospitalisation was higher for males who resided outside Rome (OR 1.65; CI 95% 1.04-2.62). Mortality within 30 days after hospitalisation was 4.2% among 25,046 patients.

Recently, however, a deceleration in the increase has been reported. we updated to 31 december 2001 previous estimates ofMM incidence among residents in the Piedmont region (Italy) and assessed time-trends in incidence. the Registry of Malignant Mesotheliomas actively searches cases in hospital wards and pathology units' records since 1990; since 1996 the database of hospital admissions and discharges is also used. Cases are registered when eligible for inclusion in the National Mesothelioma Registry. the average yearly incidence of pleural MM, computed across four consecutive three-year calendar periods, from 1990-1992 to 1999-2001, increased in both sexes, for histologically confirmed as well as for all cases. No changes were observed in peritoneal MM incidence. the rise in incidence might be due to increased diagnostic awareness for MM. An analysis by birth-cohort, however, revealed a cohort-effect, therefore it is unlikely that diagnostic bias alone could explain the observed trend. Among men residing at diagnosis in the province of Turin, but not among women nor in both sexes outside Turin province, the increase in incidence has levelled off in the most recent calendar period; for them exposures stopped on average seven years earlier than those of residents in other areas of Piedmont.

We assessed the number of cases identified only through HDRs and their influence on MM incidence. cases identified through HDRs were about 10% of those with histologic confirmation of the diagnosis, 34% of those with cytologic confirmation, and 72% of those without morphologic examination. Cases diagnosed in hospitals located outside the region would have been easily (50%) missed. The age-standardised (standard: Italian pop. at the 1981 census) incidence rate of pleural MM increases from 2.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 per year among men, and from 1.1 to 1.2 among women, when including all cases identified from HDRs, irrespective of their diagnostic confirmation. Peritoneal MM incidence estimates are unaffected. Overall without access to the hospital discharge files, 179 cases out of 954 would not have been registered between 1996 and 2001. In the same calendar period 59 cases identified by means of active search by the Registry have not been found in the hospital discharge files.

The decrease was greater for early (first 6 days of lfe) (RR=0.54; 95% CI 0.51-0.56) than for late neonatal mortality (6th to 29th day of life) (RR=0.75; 95% CI 0.69-0.81). Rates declined for all causes, but RR were particularly low for prematurity (RR=0.24; 95% CI 0.22-0.28), pre-partum hypoxia (RR=0.28; 95% CI 0.22-0.35), intra-partum hypoxia (RR=0.42; 95% CI 0.38-0.47). More limited declines were observed for congenital anomalies (RR=-0.67; 95% CI 0.61-0.72) and for RDS (Respiratory Distress Syndrome) (RR=0.82; 95% CI 0.77-0.87). Declines inpre- and intra-partum hypoxia and for other causes were observed in both early and late neonatal mortality. Mortality due to congenital abnormalities declined more in the early neonatal period (RR=0.59; 95% CI 0.53-0.65) than in the late neonatal period (RR=0.86; 95% CI 0.75-0.99). RDS, which was the leading cause of death in both periods, was the only cause for which there was an increase in late neonatal mortality (RR= 1.21; 95% CI 1.05-1.40). Available current data allow to describe different determinants of neonatal mortality by causes of death. Currently, improvement of RDS care is necessary in order to reduce high neonatal mortality.

The rehabilitation activities, the number of patients involved and the service provided by each center were explored by multiple correspondence analysis. the organizational setting and workload of the rehabilitation centers, the services delivered and activities involved, the human resources employed and the estimated costs to the healthcare system. in 2002, 320 rehabilitation centers (80.6% of them for outpatients) and 2,500 full-time equivalent personnel took care of about 300,000 patients delivering more than 5.5 million treatment sessions. Patients were under 17 years old in 19.3% of cases. The service varied considerably within and between Local Health Agencies. Rehabilitation mainly concerned physical (58.7%) and psychological treatments (19.1%) and speech therapy (3.7%). The rehabilitation facilities dedicated to one particular activity tended to take care of a large number of patients with a low complexity profile, e.g. those needing physical exercises, while facilities providing services that demand a multidisciplinary approach dealt with fewer patients, who were mostly children. The total cost of rehabilitation was estimated at 659 million Euro. rehabilitation activities have a great impact on health service users and providers, with related costs that were estimated to be about one third of the amount normally allocated to hospital services. There was no homogeneity of the facilities provided for outpatients in terms of type of rehabilitation, number of patients, services provided, and resources used Although activities involving outpatients represented the vast majority of the service provided, no systematic data are currently available on this area.

Besides traditional estimation techniques, Bayesian estimators (BMR) have been used, which--if based on appropriate statistical analysis techniques--allow to consider the spatial dependence of the data. The smoothed geographical distribution of mortality in the area surrounding the pollution source is then represented as a map and the presence of particular mortality patterns is verified. Compared to traditional techniques, this approach produces more reliable data in a relatively short time and leads to an analysis with a better information level. Communication to the decision makers and to the population should be based on these data and results. the data were derived from ISTAT mortality reports coded at a local health district level. The following analysis have been carried out: a. a traditional descriptive analysis, i.e. comparison of age. standardized rates in the Spinea municipality and the surrounding area with crude regional rates; b. an analysis of heterogeneity of BMR distribution (reference rates = age-specific rates in the population of the investigated area) in the area itself c. the application of execution of the Martuzzi-Hills test and d. the creation of a mortality distribution map (divided into BMR value classes) in the investigated area. the examined area includes Spinea and the surrounding municipalities within the Veneto Region borders, considering Spinea in the centre and a 15 km radius. the total number of deaths in the examined area in the 9 years covered by the present analysis is 49,739 (13% of the regional total).

In comparison with these estimators the plot of the hazard function has the advantage to show the variations of the occurrence of the event along the period of observation, which often are important to be highlighted. Furthermore, when comparing individuals with different characteristics, the hazard function is a valuable support to check the assumption and to interpret the results of a Cox regression model. This paper illustrates the method for estimating the hazard function and an example is given from a real case by using the survival data of the breast cancers collected in the IMPACT study, aimed to detect the efficacy of the mammographic screening program. The relationship between the usual estimators and the hazard function is shown and its role in the survival regression modelling is emphasized. In the example the estimate of the hazard function allows to point out that the mortality rate of breast cancer in the first year after the diagnosis is lower than later and that the difference between the hazards of the invited cases and those of the not invited cases is approximately constant along the whole l0 years follow up, two important remarks both demonstrating the usefulness of the application of this function in the analysis of cohort studies.","1601":"Italy is one of the industrialized countries with the highest mortality from road accidents.

Police reports of 95,944 road traffic accidents occurred between 1999 and 2004 in Piemonte, involving 178,230 drivers, were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of drivers' and accidents' characteristics with mortality among drivers. Analyses were stratified for car, truck and two-wheel vehicle drivers. Mortality is affected by age and gender. In addition, the main risk factors are night-time, extra-urban roads, mountain areas and two wheel vehicles. The drivers license penalty point regulation law introduced in Italy on July 2003 seems to have had a protective effect on mortality during the early months of application. Official data are useful for estimating potential determinants of road injuries' outcome. Factors affecting the occurrence of accidents are not necessarily predictors of outcome severity. An effective prevention policy of frequency of accidents, mortality and disability should be based on drivers'safety education, structural interventions, targeted road controls and law enforcement.

A deterministic record linkage using 5 different keys of linkage obtained from demographic information, was applied The estimates were derived using two capture-recapture techniques: log-linear models and sample-coverage approach. Record linkage results using the 5 different keys of linkage were similar. Prevalence estimates varied between 63% and 7.8% when all four lists were considered and they varied between 5.7% and 6.1% when the glicate haemoglobin list was excluded. Our estimates were slightly higher compared to those recently reported in the literature; estimates were particularly influenced by the inclusion\/exclusion of the haemoglobin glicate prescriptions list. Estimates were not influenced either by the key of linkage, or by the capture-recapture technique. Health administrative registries can be used to estimate the prevalence of diabetes through record linkage and capture-recapture techniques.

The data analysed, including clinical-epidemiological and obstetric-neonatal information, have been extracted from birth certificates for the Italian region of Lazio for the period 2000-2003. Two methods of analysis, previously used in two Italian studies, have been applied. In the first method the observed distribution for each gestational week has been decomposed as a mixture of two normal distributions with homoscedastic components. The percentiles obtained, relative to the estimate of the component with the greater weight, have been then used in a third degree polynomial regression with gestational age as covariate, to estimate the final smoothed values. The second method assumes that, for a fixed gestational age, the position of the percentiles can be obtained as a polynomial function of Normal scores. Initially, for both sexes, the percentiles for every gestational age have been estimated using quantile regressions restricted to windows of three weeks. These have been subsequently smoothed by a polynomial model using the logarithm of the birth weight as the dependent variable and gestational age (up to the third degree), the z-score corresponding to the percentiles observed in the three week windows (up to the second degree), sex and the interaction between sex, gestational age and z-score as independent variables. data relating to 157,335 single live births to Italian women resident in the Lazio region have been analysed. The raw curves of the birth weight percentiles for the preterm babies are very irregular for the more extreme percentiles because of the very low number of deliveries of live pre-term babies. The two methods have produced similar results. However, the first method was less influenced by extreme and potentially anomalous values. The second method tended to estimate percentiles beyond 41a week of gestation inferior to those of the previous weeks. A comparison has been made with the curves obtained in the two previous Italian studies and the new estimated percentiles tend to be inferior for the very preterm live births. this study has produced new curves of birth weight for gestational age. The analysis has been based on two different techniques, which have produced substantially similar results. For the tenth percentile, our estimates are lower than those obtained in previous studies suggesting a reduction in the late foetal mortality of babies who are not only pre-term but also of low weight.

Four microenvironments (home indoor, school indoor, traffic, home outdoor) and three typical days (school day, holidays in schooling period, and summer holidays) has been considered in the model. Annual mean exposure to NO2 and PM10. Exposure levels in the sample were lower than mean concentrations recorded by the monitoring station located in the study area. During the school period, mean exposures to NO2 and to PM10 were respectively 20% and 40% higher than in holidays during school period and 30% and 50% higher than during summer holidays. Exposures of the most exposed children were 39 mg\/m3 for NO2 and 18 mg\/m3 for PM10, i.e. roughly 50% higher than the least exposed children. During the school period, the most important contributions to total exposure were those of the indoor and school micro-environments. Compared to ambient levels measured at traffic oriented monitoring stations, exposures of school children are influenced by the length of time spent in the traffic microenvironment, as well as by the protection given by the time spent at school and at home. Exposure modelling can be used in order to estimate the consequences of policy options on exposure. However, a detailed empirical validation of the exposure model is needed. ","1616":"Estimates the prevalence of asthma and other allergic disorders in a random group of adolescents living in the L'Aquila area, which was not covered by SIDRIA (Italian Studies on Respiratory Disorders in Children and the Environment). The second phase of the study showed considerable regional variations within Italy, with a higher prevalence of asthma and wheezing in Central Italy. This study used the same standardised questionnaire of SIDRIA and included 1100 adolescents aged 13-14 years, between January-March 2004. Prevalence of lifetime asthma was 6.7%, cumulative and current prevalence of wheezing were 19.1% and 9.0% respectively. A relatively high proportion of adolescents, 29.2%, reported night cough and 3.6% symptoms of severe asthma. Lifetime prevalence of hay fever and eczema were respectively 17.8% and 6.7%. Prevalence rates of allergic rhinitis and atopic-eczema symptoms were higher in females. The risk of asthma was associated to exposure to: pollen, to house dust mite and to paternal smoking, whereas current smoking in the adolescents was significantly associated to wheezing during the previous 12 months. Although asthma prevalence is relatively low in L'Aquila area, it represents an important public health problem that requires further researches into genetics, environmental and medical care factors. ","1617":"","1618":"","1619":"A thought back on the \"epic of asbestos\" scanning the fundamental steps, from the \"discovery\" of the adverse effects for the workers. A first phase, the \"asbestosis one\" concluded in Britain in the early thirties with the issue of a technical legislation is described. It was the first regulation shared by the Unions and the asbestos companies, some of which were or will then become leaders all over the world. The main effect of this legislation enforcement is the reduction of the exposure in some units of the asbestos textile industry; no effects were observed instead in other asbestos industrial divisions where it's consumption for insulations and asbestos cement increased massively. The second phase lasting approximately thirty years next sees together to a formidable diffusion of all the asbestos fibres including the crocidolite ones, advertised and accepted like \"indispensable\" for the economical and social development, an absolute leadership of the companies in the management of health effects information for the workers and therefore also those on the pulmonary cancerogenicity. Such selfish and aggressive leadership, receives in return from government, labour and consumers organizations just inertia, impotence and incredulity. This attitude will also continue in the third phase, beginning in the early sixties of the last century. The time period will be dominated by mesothelioma with all its new and terrible meanings, the dangerousness of asbestos exposure especially to the blue one even at lower levels than those observed in the past for other pathologies and the long latency before the appearance of the effects. Discussing about asbestos substitutes was out of the agenda, indeed just in the period where the mining and the consumption of asbestos touched the highest levels. The initiatives assumed in some countries like the auto limitation of the use of crocidolite and a more rigorous reduction of the occupational exposures will only turn out useful in order to lower the risk for asbestosis and, probably, the one for pulmonary tumour. In the United States, the judicial litigation for compensation between the workers and the companies begins. The same phenomenon will characterize also in the other countries industrializes the fourth phase of the epic, until our days; it is just in these years, and especially during the eighties, that industry starts thinking about the substitution of asbestos; the lively public debate will favour initiatives oriented to obtain economic compensation for damages caused by past occupational and environmental exposures. These legal actions will carry to bankruptcy all the asbestos companies and later to the ban of asbestos. The judicial debates will also uncover \"confidential\" information useful to better reconstruct the epic, to formulate more dispassionate historical judgments and to allow everyone on answering to more complex questions and more important than how much generally it was previously believed; all this should happen contextualizing the ages in which the scientific acquaintances on the effects of asbestos have been published and disproving prejudgments, able to affect some conclusions of the past.","1620":"On the basis of the available evidence, several groups of experts and investigators identified a dose-response relationship between exposure to commercial types of asbestos fibres and mesothelioma risk. The first mathematical model was proposed by Peto et al. It was derived from a conceptualisation of the multistage theory of cancer and provides an interpretation of the risk for the occurrence of mesothelioma in cohorts of exposed workers. In the study described in this paper, the author reviewed the data suggesting a decrease in mesotheliomas rate follosing reduction or interruption of exposure. Descriptive analyses and the few available long-term cohort studies indicate a decrease in risk. This is supported also by the fact that even the most biopersistent asbestos fibres are eliminated from the lungs. Indeed, a slow but effective reduction of risk has been demonstrated in the cohort of Wittenoom workers in Australia, previously exposed to crocidolite.","1621":"","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"The Lombardy Mesothelioma Registry, activated in 2000, receives more than 300 cases per year of suspected malignant mesothelioma; the standardized (age and gender) incidence rate of pleural mesothelioma is 2.4\/100,000 inhabitants (CI 95% 2.0-2.7). The finding of an increasing number of cases among workers of the non-asbestos-textile industry, classified as \"unknown exposure to asbestos\", upheld the suspect of presence of asbestos in this compartment. Specific information about a possible asbestos exposure were collected by technicians, maintenance personnel and other experts; industrial machinery utilized in the past was thoroughly examined; direct inspections were carried out in several workplaces that had not yet undergone significant changes with respect to the past. A large amount of asbestos had been regularly used on the ceilings and also to the walls of factories in order to avoid both condensation of steam and reflection of noise. In addition, asbestos had also been widely used to insulate water and steam pipes. The braking systems of most of machines also had asbestos gaskets, and on several looms some brakes operated continuously. The population in study was composed of 119 subjects, 27 males and 92 females, median age of 72 years. Asbestos exposure was ascribed to work in 106 cases (89%). The system devised by the Lombardy Registry had brought to light an occupational hazard in a professional area previously never believed as a source of asbestos exposure. In consideration of the described experience, both environmental and clinical, it seems reasonable to consider the non-asbestos-textile as a new department at risk for asbestos exposure.","1626":"The Study describes the epidemiological surveillance of mesothelioma cases carried out by the Italian mesothelioma register (ReNaM). A Regional Operating Centre (COR) is present in nearly all Italian regions (17 out of 20) and it collects malignant mesothelioma cases and investigate the modalities of asbestos exposure by using a structured questionnaire. The register produces malignant mesothelioma incidence measures and analyses of the modalities of the asbestos exposure. The standardized incidence rate of malignant mesothelioma in 2001 was 2.98 (in 100,000 inhabitants) among men and 0.98 among women; a professional (certain, probable, possible) exposure has been detected in 67.4% of defined cases. In addition to the conventional sectors (shipbuilding, railways repair and demolition, asbestos-cement production), also textile, building, transport, chemical and glass industries, petroleum and sugar refineries, electricity production and distribution plants are getting involved. Despite the absence of some regions completing the national coverage and the non homogeneity in collecting and coding data, the epidemiological surveillance of malignant mesothelioma carried out by ReNaM is an important tool for the scientific knowledge and the prevention of asbestos-related diseases.","1627":"Starting from an hospital observation of the mesotheliomas cluster in women living in a lakeside area (Iseo lake, Northern Italy), an epidemiological surveillance of this tumour was performed by the local occupational health service. This cluster wasn't notified, in spite of the relevant number of factories producing asbestos textile materials in this area. From 1977 to august 2006, 45 cases of mesothelioma were detected among the workers of 3 textile industries located in 3 little villages: 14 cases occurred working crocidolite and chrysotile rope and gasket; 20 cases in a textile factory producing cotton garments, that was adjacent to and polluted by the farmer and were asbestos insulation and blankets used for fireproofing are present; 11 cases occurred among women working in silk factories. The mesothelioma cases occurred in the same period in this area, which constituted the recruitment area of the people working in the 3 textile plants (11 villages, about 43,000 inhabitants), are 55.93% of which had been occupationally exposed to asbestos. Out of the dockyard and the asbestos-cement industries, this frequency of occupational exposed workers is the highest never observed in Italy. The majority of the cases (66%) occurred among women working in the textile factories. In a women, producing asbestos textile materials and suffered form peritoneal mesothelioma and pleural plaques, the analysis (by SEM) of asbestos fibre lung burden show 286 million fibres x gr. of dry tissue. Between the 42 mesothelioma cases occurring in the population of the 3 villages where the textile plants was located, we observed only one case with possible environmental exposure to asbestos: a gardener of the village where the manufacturing asbestos ropes and gasket plant is present. In the silk factories, asbestos exposure was probable because of the presence of asbestos insulated pipes. The female pleural mesothelioma standard incidence observed in this area (6.8 x 100,000, 1977-2005) is the highest never estimate in Italy. The epidemiological surveillance of the mesothelioma appear essential to identify cases unreported and allow the collection of information useful to understand clearly the asbestos exposure effects on health's workers and to estimate the tumour incidence in the population.","1628":"In the Bergamo area of Basso Sebino (lower Lake Iseo), for decades there has been a large concentration of small firms (mostly family-run), specialised in the production of rubber gaskets. Within this production field, some companies used to manufacture textile asbestos exclusively or as part of their business. The asbestos goods were therefore marketed as they were or subsequently cut and transformed into gaskets. Among the 5 companies involved, \"Manifattura Colombo &amp; C\" was the first one that started this production in the district, and the one that engaged the greatest number of employees (considering both the Sarnico and Predore factories). In the Predore factory, operating from the fifties to 1979, the asbestos thread production was carried out exclusively and to the complete technological cycle (i.e. from crashing the raw asbestos that was brought in from Balangero). The whole process was performed in an extremely dusty environment (according to the witness of former workers), expecially during the first production steps. In the Sarnico factory which operated from 1920 to 1993, they produced textile asbestos items (laces, ropes, etc.), as well as rubber and metal gaskets. The latter were coupled with asbestos by means of metal-plastics co-moulding operations, in order to obtain gaskets highly resistant to exhaust vapours, gases, oils, solvents and so on. The environmental data available (referred to the 1980-1992 period), supply evidence of severe exposure in the first years of activity, whilst a sharp reduction in the asbestos-fiber concentration rate was achieved along the years, thanks mainly to the completion and improvement of exhaust systems installed on winding and braiding machines. Finally we shortly describe the work of the four other factories and in more detail that of the \"Manifattura Sebina srl\" is mentioned herein because, although this is a \"typical\" textile mill and exclusively manufacturing cotton products, a considerable number of cases of mesothelioma has been detected among its workforce. This has been attributed to the presence of asbestos insulated piping, to maintenance and replacement interventions on looms brake pads, and above all to the nearly 50 asbestos blankets that were employed in the weekly fire-fighting exercises, and usually leaned against the walls of departments, with no protection whatsoever.","1629":"In the second part of the 20th century, the Basso Sebino Area (Northern Italy) underwent a transformation into an industrial context. The first factories were engaged in the production of textiles, clothes and pasta. This was followed by a major development of mechanic, plastic and rubber industry. The latter activity was concentrated on the production of buttons. This text describes the evolution of the unions'activity in order to obtain a more decent salary and better working conditions in all productive areas. Within this reality, the production of asbestos goods started in 1950 in the Colombo enterprise, run by Rinaldo Colombo, The latter was also the manager of the chrysotile quarry in Balangero, province of Torino (the biggest asbestos mine in Western Europe). Through these connections, asbestos was conveyed from Balangero to the Basso Sebino Area in such a way that most of the asbestos chain (extraction, processing of asbestos goods and sales) was under the control of the same firm.","1630":"This paper summarizes a research of the Regional Agency for Health in Tuscany (Florence, Italy) on end-of-life and palliative care.

The experience of Tuscany is discussed with respect to regulation, health services and significant experiences in epidemiological research, education, and cultural promotion. The population needs for palliative care are estimated on the basis of mortality rates and hospital admissions in the last year of life.

Municipal Police data-base collects information (i.e: dynamics and localization of road traffic accident, emergency department or hospital of access, etc.) about road traffic accidents casualties occurred in Florence City (completeness: about 97% of events). Florence City, year 2002. information about emergency department access or hospital admission were found for 74.8% (4,001\/5,350) of people classified as \"injured\" in the Municipal Police data-base: 72.8% (3,895 subjects) treated in an emergency department and 12.3% (656 subjects) hospitalised. Among patients with medical information, 81.9% was treated in emergency departments for less severe injuries, 1.8% had a fracture treated in the emergency department and 16.3% was hospitalised. Fractures (42.7% of all hospitalisations) and head injuries (33.5%) were the most frequent discharge diagnoses. On the basis of diagnosis and of the length of hospital stay, we estimate that about 1% road traffic accidents casualties (fatalities not included) had very severe outcome or disability. The cost for the health system of treatment of people injured in road traffic accidents can be estimated at about 2.2 millions of euros (1.3% of total hospitalisations cost per year for residents in Florence). The characteristics of medical data-sets suggest an underestimation of the actual number of emergency department accesses. It is unlikely that this underestimation notably affects the results for the low severity of the majority of emergency departments accesses. record linkage between Municipal Police and routinely collected medical data-sets is an useful method to assess health adverse effects and costs for health system of road traffic accidents, allowing to analyse the characteristics of casualties by type of road user. Besides, at a local level, the method allows to identify the more dangerous roads taking into account also the severity of injuries.

During 2005, 52 programmes, adopting faecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy (FS), or a combination of both, were active in Italy. Overall, 827,473 subjects were invited to FOBT and 376,240 were screened; the adjusted attendance rate (47.1%) equals the best performances reported in the literature. Positivity rate of FOBT programmes was 5.8% at first and 4.1% at repeat screening: it increased with age and was higher among males than females in all age groups. The average attendance rate to colonoscopy (TC) was 82% (range: 56%-100%). Completion rate of TC was 91%, with higher rates among males. At first screening, the detection rate (DR) per 1000 screened subjects was 3.7 and 16.8 for invasive cancer and advanced adenomas (AA) (adenomas with a diameter &gt; or =1 cm, with villous\/tubulo-villous type or with high-grade dysplasia) respectively; the corresponding figures at repeat screening were 1.1 for cancer and 4.9 for AA. The DR of cancer and adenomas increased with age and it was higher among males, 55% of screen-detected cancers were at TNM stage I. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 7.4% for cancer and 32.9% for AA at first screening, and 4.5% for cancer and 20.5% for AA at repeat screening. Given this high PPV of positive FOBT, to obtain a high attendance at TC is crucial. The six FS programmes invited almost half of their target population (about 40,000 subjects) and 5,821 subjects were screened, with an attendance rate of 29.1%. Overall 89.0% of FS were classified as complete. TC referral rates ranged between 7.7 and 13.8%, due to different referral criteria. Among subjects referred to colonoscopy the prevalence of proximal AA and cancer ranged from 5.4 to 11.1%. The overall DR (subjects with at least one advanced lesion) ranged from 3.5 to 7.0%. In conclusion, during 2005 the organised programmes for colorectal cancer screening in Italy increased considerably, covering about one third of the eligible population at a national level. Many programmes were activated in the second part of the year, thus their results have to be evaluated with caution. However, the reported experiences showed good results in terms of attendance and DR, although some critical aspects need to be carefully addressed when planning and implementing screening activity.","1663":"Since 1996, Italian national guidelines have recommended to regions the implementation of organised screening programmes for cervical cancer. As in the previous years, starting from 1998, we collected aggregated tables of data from Italian organised cervical screening programmes in order to centrally compute process indicators. In 2005, the target population of Italian organised screening programmes included 10,969,571 women, corresponding to 66.7% of Italian women aged 25-64 years. However, these programmes invited only 24.8% of their target population in 2005, vs. 33.3% expected in order to invite the entire target population in the 3-year recommended interval. Compliance to invitation was 36.7%, with a clear North-South decreasing trend. It must however be considered that many women are screened outside the organised programmes. The remaining process indicators deal with women invited during 2004 and screened up to April 2005. Unsatisfactory smears were 3.1%. It was recommended to 6.1% of women to repeat cytology, and 61% of them complied. Some (2.5%) of screened women were referred to colposcopy. Compliance to colposcopy was 84.7% among women referred because of ASCUS or more severe cytology and 88.2% among those referred because of HSIL or more severe cytology. The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of referral because of ASCUS or more severe cytology for CIN2 or more severe histology was 15.5%.

The screening extension has increased over time, reaching an overall 76.4% of coverage in 2005. The geographical extension is still heterogeneous, with a higher distribution in Northern and Central Italy compared with Southern and Insular Italy, where the screening activity was implemented only recently. Notwithstanding the continuity in implementation, the actual coverage reached only 50.3% of the target population, due to a reduced flow of invitations over time as a consequence of a chronic lack of invested resources and of well-plannedpolicies. The overall Italian rate for crude attendance was above the acceptable 50% standard even though a North-South trend is still confirmed; in Southern\/Insular Italy participation was still inadequate (&lt;40%) and did not reach the standard considered acceptable. Participation was higher in centralised programmes compared with those without regional coordination (+5-8%). The time trends for the other key performance indicators showed good average performance: the benign\/malignant surgical biopsy ratio (B\/M ratio) progressively decreased, reaching an 0.25 ratio (both for first and subsequent screening) in 2004; overall detection rate, detection rate for in situ and small cancers (&lt; or =10 mm) showed a good trend, reaching 6.7% per hundred, 0.7% per hundred, and 1.6% per hundred, respectively, for the first screening, and 5.1% per hundred, 0.9% per hundred, and 1.7% per hundred for the subsequent screening in 2004. The only exception was the referral rate (RR) at first screening, which exceeded standards (&gt; 7% in 2002-2004). Data comparing activity volume and programme duration were also analysed. In programmes with greater activity (average test number: 22,506) the referral rate for the first screening was higher, but still within acceptable standards. 6.3% per hundred; RR: 1.01 (0.98-1.04). This performance is compensated by better specificity and sensitivity: Positive Predictive Value (PPV). 12.8; RR:1.16 (1.05-1.27); overall detection rate: 8.1% per hundred, RR 1.19 (1.07-1.31). An improvement in quality with the increase of programme experience is evident. programmes with more than 6 years of activity, compared with newer programmes, show a recall rate in first screening of 6.5%; RR. 0.87 (0.84-0.89), a PPV of 1.7, RR:1.61 (1.48-1.75) andan overall detection rate of 7.6% per hundred, RR:1.41 (1.29-1.55).

In 2006, an updated version of the operative report of process indicators was published by GISMa and ONS. Data for the survey came from several different programmes that may have changed over time, and may have different settings of organisation and management. The year 2004 can be considered almost exhaustive of the situation of Italian mammography screening; data were provided by 117 programmes from 18 different regions. In ten regions, the individual programmes are part of a comprehensive regional project. In 2004, about 1,870,000 women aged 50-69 years were invited to have a screening mammography, and over 1,050,000 were screened. Theoretical extension was 71.9%, while 52% of the target population received an invitation to screening. An imbalance in coverage is still present when comparing Northern (more than 80%) and Central Italy (almost 100%) to Southern Italy, that only has a 40% coverage by organised screening. The national crude attendance rate was 55.6%, slightly lower than the previous year. A decreasing trend was evident from the North to the Centre to the South of Italy: 60.2%, 51.8%, and 39.1%, respectively. Referral rates of 8.8% at first screening and 4.2% at repeat screening were recorded. Direct standardised detection rate was 6.6 x 1000 at the first test and 5.0 at repeat test, while benign to malignant ratio for first and repeat screening was 0.34 and 0.20, respectively. Indicators by 5-year age group confirm greater diagnostic problems at younger ages, with higher referral rates, higher frequency of surgical procedures with benign outcome (B\/M ratio), and a substantially lower detection rate as compared to older age groups. Preliminary data for the year 2005 shows a further increase in screening coverage: 76.4 % of the Italian target population was enrolled in screening programmes, and 50.3% received an invitation to have a mammography.

To validate the demographic information on educational level which is recorded in the registries of residents in Italian towns; to compare simple indicators of socio-economic status and family profiles with composite indicators in their ability to predict the economic and social impact of the disease. A two-level probabilistic sample of cancer deaths from the Italian Survey on Dying Of Cancer. 2000 deaths were sampled; caregivers were identified and interviewed between 4 and 12 months after the patient's death. We calculated Cohens kappa for educational level as reported in the registry, and in the questionnaire. We constructed a composite indicator of socio-economic status and family profile using a cluster analysis; its association with the impact on finances and quality of daily life was compared with that from the educational level reported in the questionnaire and with a previously derived indicator of family profile. The weighted kappa of the two sources used for educational level was 0.60 (CI 95% 0.55-0.64). Of the two indicators, educational level and socio-economic status (6 groups), only the later showed a significant association with the outcomes \"difficulties\" in sustaining the costs of treatment\" and \"use of entire savings for the illness\". The composite indicator of family profile (7 groups) was significantly associated with all outcomes considered. Log-likelihood was significantly better with model using the composite and the prior indicators of family profile than in models without them. Models that included educational level and prior indicator of family profile (7 groups) were more adaptable than models with the composite indicators. The good level of agreement between the two sources regarding educational level suggests that the registry is an adequate data source, when other information is lacking.

We invited all Piedmont hospital units that had treated at least 5 cases of colon-rectal or breast cancer in 2002 to participate to the survey. Physicians had to fill a short mail questionnaire. The questionnaire had three sections: distribution and implementation, quality of the instrument, utility and applicability. Replies were 65% (53\/82) and 73% (105\/143) respectively for the for colon rectal cancer guidelines (LGR-CR) and for breast cancer guidelines (LGR-M)). Among responders, 6% and 9% units ignored the existence of the LGR-CR and LGR-M respectively. More than 50% responders participated in the LGR presentation meetings and\/or working groups for the local implementation of LGR. Overall the units judged the LGR quality positively. The LGR utility was judged positively for LGR-CR but opinions were heterogeneous for LGR-M. The LGR-M were judged unable to improve the doctor-patient relationship--or the continuity of care. The physicians who replied to the questionnaires had received the LGRs and are familiar with them. Furthermore they had a positive attitude towards the instrument. The LGR-CR seems to be better accepted than LGR-M, for which some resistance was found among gynaecologists and radiotherapists.

Four CPG were developed by multidisciplinary working groups, involving local opinion leaders, coordinated by the same team (including epidemiologists and health economists). The major features of these guidelines were: (a) to cover all the phases ofthe disease (from diagnosis to palliative care); (b) to satisfy common standards for evidence based guidelines; (c) to be coherent with the local health organization and resource availability. In the first three CPGs, regarding common cancers (colon-rectum, breast, lung), recommendations were graded according to the underlying level of evidence, from A to C, and treatment was organized by specialty. In the last guideline, regarding a rare condition (soft tissue sarcomas, STS), a grading system reflecting also the clinical importance of the decision was adopted and treatment recommendations were organized by clinical scenarios. In each guideline, some implementation tools, including a set of process and outcome indicators for audit monitoring, were provided. The four CPGs have been published between 2001 and 2004. The number ofrecommendations ranged between 38 (STS) and 103 (colon-rectum), with some differences in the distribution by specialty and grading. The CPGs have been disseminated through the oncology network and local health coordinators have been involved in the implementation. The impact of the CPGs is being evaluated by different approaches (analyses of administrative data, sample surveys and user's interviews).

The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed but easy-reading review of different risk adjustment methodologies to compare health care outcomes. The paper is divided in two parts. Introduction describes the difference between experimental and observational studies, the role of confounding in observational studies and the ways confounding is identified and controlled (propensity adjustment and risk adjustment), Specific part on risk adjustment describes: (1) the methods for constructing the severity measures; (2) the methods that use the severity measures to obtain \"adjusted\" outcome measures for valid comparison between groups (stratified analysis, indirect and direct standardization); (3) identification and management of effect modification; (4) the methods to gain the precision of the estimates; (5) the risk adjustment methods used with multiple comparisons and (6) introduction to other models (multi-level models) used for risk adjustment. For policy makers and planners, epidemiologists and clinicians it is important to understand which factors can improve or worsen the effectiveness of treatments and services and to compare the performances of hospitals and healthcare providers. Decisions should be based on the validity and precision of study results, by using the best scientific knowledge available. The statistical methods described in this review cannot measure reality as it truly is, but can produce images of it, defining limits and uncertainties in terms of validity and precision. Since any risk-adjustment model used for comparative evaluation of outcomes must be time- and population-specific, only the studies that use credible risk adjustment strategies are more likely to yield reliable findings.","1684":"","1685":"Effective tobacco control policies include law issuing: bans\/restrictions on smoking in public areas and workplaces, increasing of taxes on tobacco products, bans on advertising of tobacco products, warning labels on cigarette boxes.

This paper briefly presents literature data, EU directives and the laws consequently issued in Italy. The importance of standardizing European legislation, especially for those policies that are not enforced by EU directives is also discussed. In Italy and in some other European countries smoking is forbidden in public and work-places, despite no EU directive. The positive impact of this ban in these countries suggests that it should be considered a priority in the European policies against tobacco in order to reduce the gap between literature recommendations and actions.","1686":"","1687":"","1688":"The critical considerations formulated by Tomatis et al. did not take into account all the experimental works and all the research on human pleura that from the Seventies on has unanimously indicated that asbestos fibre mesothelioma is caused by the ultrafine fibres class.

The conclusions of Tomatis et al, which attribute mesothelioma to fibres of all lengths and diameters, are not confirmed in the literature. Today, mesothelioma prevention must consist of identifying and cutting down airborne ultrafine fibres, above all in urban environments. The techniques for doing so now exist and can be applied.

We performed a factorial analysis, and created a composite index of socioeconomic position. We considered the quintiles of the distribution of census block in order to have a 5-level indicator. 2516666 subjects who were residents in Rome in October, 2001. four factors explained 84% of the variance. The first factor combined education, occupation and crowding and explained 49.5% of the variance. The second (14% of variance) represented immigration, the third (11.3%) family composition, and the fourth (9.1%) home ownership. High-level census blocks tended to have older residents, a higher employment rate, more students and retirees, and fewer part time employed residents than low census blocks. when individual measures of socioeconomic position are missing, small area indicators based on census data can be used as a proxy of individual indices. In addition, they describe all socioeconomic aspects of the area. This study provides an instrument that can be used in public health and epidemiology to evaluate socioeconomic differences in health.

Here we analysed the association between PM10 and Mortality\/Hospital Admissions in the Italian Meta-analysis of Short-term effects of Air pollutants (MISA) using two alternative approaches that are not affected by the same drawbacks: GAM with penalized regression spline fitted by the direct method in R (GAM-R) software and Generalized Linear Models with natural cubic spline (GLM+NS). A sensitivity analysis is also provided varying number of degrees of freedom for the seasonality spline and modality of adjustment for confounding effect of temperature. Published theoretical results and a simulation study are provided in order to explain discrepancies between GLM+NS and GAM-R estimates.

Usually the explicit goal of those initiatives is to guide citizens' choice identifying the \"best\", centres. However, these efforts rely either on simplistic approaches in comparing the clinical performance of individual hospitals or on inadequate quality indicators. Therefore, this information may easily misguide the general public. In this paper, in order to highlight the problems implied, we consider two recent cases of mass media reporting on hospitals' quality. Two recent cases of mass media reporting on cardiac surgery centres' quality are considered: the BPAC study \"Esiti a breve termine di interventi di by-pass coronarico nelle cardiochirurgie italiane\" coordinated by the Italian Institute of Health, and the publication by the news magazine Panorama of the list of the \"best\" Italian cardiac surgery centres based on a reputational index. The first example points out the problems implied by presenting hospitals' clinical performance through league tables. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, this study shows how the conclusions merely based on ranking--even when these are based on a sensible quality indicator--can be potentially misleading. As for the second case study, it is shown the inadequacy of the quality indicator (the reputation index) adopted. despite the growing awareness in the health services community of the technical problems implied by describing and comparing the quality of care provided by individual hospitals, \"real life\" examples of provision of information on quality of care by the mass media to the general public appear to be largely unsatisfactory and potentially misleading.

We conducted a geographical investigation on the relationship between Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS) and other tumours, and estimated levels of exposures to dioxins. Estimates ofthe population's exposure were derived from a historical analysis of emissions of dioxins and other pollutants, conducted by the Province of Venice in all the Venetian area in 1980-1990. Cancer cases were selected from two electronic pathology databases of Venice and Mestre, computerized since 1987. All STS diagnoses were revised in order to improve the quality of the cases in the study and cases of Kaposi sarcoma were excluded from the analysis. The 198 remaining STS--Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin' lymphoma and subjects with at least one cancer--were linked to the registry of residents and mapped according to the pollutant level estimates using GIS techniques. The same procedure was applied to cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=822), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=142) and to 25.568 cases of all cancer at other sites, with microscopic confirmation for comparison. Venetian AULSS 12. Risks for STS (measured as Standardized Incidence Ratios SIR) did not show any trend related to categories of dioxin pollution. Among women, a statistically significant increased SIR of 1.69 was estimated for the highest category of exposure. The corresponding SIR for Hodgkins lymphoma was 1.94 (I.C. 1.08-1.19). No major excesses were estimated for other cancer sites. Overall, no consistent association between cancer risk and estimated exposure to dioxins was detected in the population under study However, a statistically significant excess of STS among women in the highest exposure category allows for the possibility of a role of environmental exposure.

CEDAP and SDO of all patients admitted to any hospital in the Veneto Region (4.7 million inhabitants, about 44,000 births) during the year 2003 were considered. An area-based study on deliveries and births, a retrospective cohort study on pregnancies, and a prospective cohort study on newborns up to the first year of age were performed to calculate health indicators. These indicators were compared to two official data sources: National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and Italian National Institute of Health (ISS). Descriptive indicators concerning mother-infant health status (conception, pregnancy, delivery, newborns and events during the first year of age). SDO provide highly accurate data on pregnancies, births and stillborns, which overlap with values reported by ISTAT Combining data from SDO and CEDAP with findings fom the process of tracking mothers and infants'cohorts, allows the calculation of many indicators on conception (n. 9), pregnancy (n. 8), delivery (n. 8), newborn (n. 15), and events during the first year of age (n. 6). In the Veneto Region the general fertility rate is 40.95% per hundred, with a relatively late mean age at delivery (32 years). Pregnant women undergoing prenatal invasive procedures are 23.5% and the caesarean section rate is 29%. Infants born to foreign mothers are 16%, whereas 2.5% are conceived through assisted reproduction techniques, 0.9% are very low birth weight, and 0.3% are extremely low birth weight; neonatal and infant mortality rates are 2.2% per hundred and 2.9% per hundred respectively.

","1726":"To describe the temporal trend of hospitalisations for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs) from 1997 to 2000 in Bologna (Italy) and to analyze the association with the income level. We have selected two panels of ACSCs: eight conditions for the paediatric\/young population (&lt;20 years of age) and fourteen for the adult population (&gt; or =20 years of age). All discharges for ACSCs of residents in Bologna from Emilia-Romagna hospitals have been selected in the years 1997-2000. An indicator of social position was computed: the median per capita equivalent income by census block, obtained through record linkage between the Italian Tax Register (income earned in 1998) and the Population Register of Bologna. The direct age-standardized rates and the rate ratio by income level have been calculated. The Poisson regression model has been used to calculate the relative risk (RR) of hospitalizations for ACSCs. 2359 (17.6% of the total) hospitalisations have been selected among the paediatric\/young population and 27822 (11.1% of the total) among the adult population. The annual age-adjusted rate of ACSC is 122.68 per 10000 persons among children and 176.60 among adults. The hospitalisation forACSCs among children is associated with a middle-low level of income (RR 1.55; CI 95% 1.35-1.78 for the lowest level vs. highest level), male gender and age &lt;5 years old. In the adult population the risk of hospitalisation for ACSCs is higher among those with lower levels of income (RR 1.80; CI 95% 1.66-1.95 for the lowest level vs. highest level), moreover the RR is higher for men at every age. The admissions forACSCs among adults show a decreasing temporal trend. The disadvantaged groups of the population experience the highest risk of hospitalisation for ACSCs, with differences by gender and age groups. Although it is difficult to specifically identify the mechanisms potentially involved in the relationship between socioeconomic status and excess of hospitalisation, the admissions for ACSCs may represent an interesting indicator of quality ofprimary care.

Population based registry (residents in Tuscany). Age-standardised attack rates, 28-day case-fatality and proportion of patients who underwent coronarography or coronary angioplasty. In Tuscany, between 1997 and 2002, AMI attack rates were stable in both genders. Rates of out-of-hospital coronary death (progressively decreasing) and of hospitalised AMI cases (increasing after the year 2000) showed opposite trends. Case-fatality decreased both for total events (largely explained by the reduction of out-of-hospital deaths) and for hospitalised cases. In the same period, the spread of coronarography and coronary angioplasty progressively increased. AMI attack rates and interventional cardiology procedures utilization were significantly different across Tuscany areas, whereas 28-day case-fatality of hospitalised cases did not significantly differ within the region. Notwithstanding the importance of cardiovascular disease, scanty population-based incidence, case-fatality and treatment data were available in Italy.

DESIGN, SETTING PARTECIPANTS: 405 patients cared for at two general surgery wards, receiving an explicit judgement of clinical priority and whose actual waiting times to surgery were assessed. Clinicalpriority was assessed through 0 (no priority) to 10 (maximum priority). Identification through multivariate regression techniques of the clinical characteristics associated with high clinical priority (score 28) and with shorter actual waiting times. Patients with cancer, severe pain, relevant impairment in functional status and relevant expert improvement on quality and duration of survival were more frequently attributed a high clinical priority. As for waiting times, presence of cancer was the only factor associated with shorter waitings. Only for cancer patients high priority judgement was associated with shorter waiting times (median 21 vs. 69 days; p &lt; 0.008). These findings suggest that actual waiting times are not influenced by the same clinical characteristics that clinicians value when assigning clinical priority.

Compliance with recommendations as to not performing frozen section on small lesions and unnecessary axillary dissection for ductal carcinoma in situ still have not reached the target. The sentinel lymph node technique was performed on the axilla in more than 60% of screen-detected invasive cancers, avoiding a large number of potentially harmful dissections.

CIN1 or more severe histology was detected in 2273\/4140 (65%) colposcopies classified as grade 1. CIN2 or more severe histology was detected in 566\/853 (66.4%) colposcopies classified as grade 2. Of all women with CIN2 or more severe histology 42% had a colposcopy classified as grade 2 or higher. We obtained data on treatment from 57 programmes. Of the 2123 CIN1 cases 63% had follow-up only. However 20 (0.9%) had cold-knife conisation, 2 (0.1%) had hysterectomy and 191 (9.0%) were treated by diathermo-coagulation.

During 2004, 18 programs, adopting faecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy (FS), or a combination of both, were active in Italy. Overall, 331,333 subjects were invited to undergo FOBT and 165,480 were screened; the attendance rate (51.3%) equals the best performances reported in the literature. Positivity rate was 5.4% at first and 3.9% at repeat screening: it increased with age and was higher among men than among women in all age groups. The average attendance rate at colonoscopy (TC) was 83% (range: 70%-100%; median: 85%). Completion rate of TC was 92%, with higher rates among males. At first screening, the detection rate (DR) per 1000 screened subjects was 2.8 and 11.6 for cancer (CRC) and \"high-risk\" adenomas (HRA) (&gt; or =3 adenomas, 1 adenoma &gt; or =1 cm, or with villous component &gt;20%, or with high grade dysplasia) respectively; the corresponding figures at repeat screening were 1.2 for CRC and 4.9 for HRA. The DR of CRC and adenomas increased with age and it was higher among men than among women; 51% of screen-detected CRCs were at TNM stage 1. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 6.3% for CRC and 25.8% for HRA at first screening, and 3.6% for CRC and 15.1% for HRA at repeat screening. Given this high PPV of positive FOBT, to obtain a high attendance at TC is crucial. In the three FS programmes 15,688 subjects were invited and 4884 were screened (attendance rate: 31.9%). TC referral rates ranged between 7.6% and 14.0%, due to different referral criteria. Among subjects referred to colonoscopy the prevalence of HRA and CRC ranged from 7.9 to 9.9%. The overall DR (subjects with at least one advanced lesion) ranged from 5.5 to 7.0%. Comparing the DR at FS and FOBT in the same age range. FS showed a higher sensitivity both for HRA (DR was four times higher) and for CRC. In conclusion, colorectal cancer screening looks feasible. The reported experiences showed good results in terms of attendance and DR, although some critical aspects need to be carefully addressed when planning and implementing screening activity.","1736":"The target population of Italian organised cervical screening programmes that were active (that invited at least 1000 women) in 2004 was 10,206,741 women, corresponding to 64% of the Italian female population in the 25-64 year age range. This proportion was 66%, 83% and 49% in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy respectively. Some 27% of this target population was invited during 2004. Among women invited in 2004, 37.7% had cytology within organised programmes up to April 2005 (46.2%, 36.0% and 26.2% in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy respectively). It must be kept in mind that many women have spontaneous tests that are not registered in organised programmes. Further data on women invited in 2003 were collected as aggregated tables, provided by the local screening registration systems. We obtained data from 99 programmes with an overall target population of 8,698,480 women. At least 70% of programmes could provide data for most indicators. Overall, 3.2% of smears were classified as unsatisfactory. At a national level 6.6% of women was advised to repeat cytology and 62.2% of them actually did. However 13\/71 programmes recommended repeat cytology to &gt; 10% of screened women. Nationwide, 2.6% of screened women were referred to colposcopy. The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of detecting a biopsy-proven Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) or more severe among women referred because of cytology \"Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance\" or more severe was 15.0%. There was however a relevant variability: 9\/90 programmes had a referral rate &gt;5%. There was an inverse correlation between referral rate and PPV. Compliance with recommended colposcopy was 86% (91% among women with high-grade cytology). The raw detection rate of biopsy-proven CIN2+ was 2.7 per 1000 screened women (2.8 per 1000 when standardised on the Italian population). In conclusion, during 2004 there was a further increase of active organised programmes, especially in Southern Italy. This is important, as spontaneous activity is known to be low there. Despite this rise, quality indicators were stable. However, in a few programmes, the use of excessively broad criteria in the interpretation of cytology decides an excessively high rate of referrals to colposcopy.","1737":"Since 1992, the Italian Group for Mammography Screening (GISMa) has been performing a yearly systematic survey of ongoing activities.

This progression has been more evident in Central-Northern Italy while in Southern Italy a real, but still limited (30%), increase has been recorded only recently. Despite this geographical extension, the actual coverage reached only 5 1.1% of the target population, due to a reduced flow of invitations over time as a consequence of a chronic lack of invested resources and of well planned political actions. The time trends for the key performance indicators show a good average performance: crude attendance rate exceeds over the years the acceptable 50% standard; BIM ratio is progressively decreasing, reaching a ratio of 0.7:1 (both for first\/subsequent screening) in 2003; overall detection rate, detection rate for in situ and small cancers (&lt; or =10 mm) show a good trend, reaching 6.6% per hundred, 1.5% per hundred and 0.7% per hundred respectively for the first screening in 2003. An exception is the referral rate at first screening which exceeds the reference standards (&gt; 7% in the last 2 years). Data have been analysed also according to activity volume and programme duration. In programmes with greater activity (average test number: 24,702) the referral rate for the first screening is higher, but still within acceptable standards: 5.8%; RR: 1.05 (1.02-1.10). This performance is compensated by better specificity and sensitivity: PPV = 13.3: RR: 1.14 (1.03-1.27); overall detection rate = 6.7% per hundred; RR: 1.22 (1.09-1.36). An improvement of quality with the increase of experience is evident: programmes with more than 6 years of activity, compared with newer programmes, show a recall rate in first screening of 6.0%; RR:0.86 (0.86-0.92), a PPV of 13.4; RR: 1.65 (1.40-1.69) and an overall detection rate of 8.1% per hundred; RR: 1.44 (1.25-1.53).

Theoretical coverage was 56.2%, while 41.4% of the target population received an invitation to screening. An imbalance in coverage can be seen when comparing Northern and Central Italy, where over 3\/4 of the population is covered, to Southern Italy, with only a 10.6% coverage by organised screening. National crude attendance rate was 58.3%. A decreasing trend was evident from the North to the Centre to the South of Italy: 61.2%. 56.2%, and 38.1% respectively. Referral rates of 7.8% at first screening and 4.5% at repeat screening were recorded. Direct standardised detection rate was 6.9 x 1000 at first test and 4.8 at repeat test, while benign to malignant ratio for first and repeat screening was 0.33 and 0.23 respectively. Detection rate of \"small\" cancers (&lt; or =10 mm in size) was 1.5 and 1.4 x 1000 for first and repeat test. Indicators by 5-year age groups confirm greater diagnostic problems at younger ages, with higher referral rates, higher frequency of surgical procedures with benign outcome (B\/M ratio), and a substantially lower detection rate as compared to older age groups.

The study analyzed radiotherapy outpatients records in 2003 related to Piedmont residents and all discharge records in years 2000-2004. The quality of the procedure has been assessed by using the information on the real oncological diagnosis as reported in the outpatients medical records of a random sample of patients. The record linkage with SDO allows to define an oncological diagnosis for 82% (95% CI 78.5-84.8) of the patients. Agreement between defined diagnosis and the real one is 85.7% (CI 95% 82.2-88.6). The validity of the procedure is affected by the patients' cancer site. The distribution by cancer site of the patients treated with radiotherapy in Piedmont Region obtained with the record linkage procedure is homogeneous to the real distribution of the random sample used for control.

Age adjusted mortality rates for MND are calculated for 5-year periods (1980-84, 1985-89, 1990-94, 1995-99) at both national level and three geographical sub-areas (north, center and south); sex and age specific mortality rates are also reported for two decades (1980-89 and 1990-99). During 1980-99 the annual age-standardized mortality rate in Italy was 1.35 x 100000 in males and 1.10 (x 100000) in females. In the period 1995-99 the mortality rates increased by 39.3% in males and 78.2% in females at national level when compared to 1980-84 rates (1.56 vs 1.12 deaths per 100000 for males and 1.39 vs 0.78 per 100000 for females in 1980-84 and 1995-99, respectively). In the three large geographical sub-areas such increases were 37.6%, 29.7% and 57% in males and 73%, 63.1% and 114.3% in females, respectively. The increase reported in this study is probably due to a mix of different factors as population ageing (age-specific rates reach a peak in the age class 70-74 years), better accuracy of death certificates, adoption of new clinical criteria and at last a wide spread of environmental risk factors (metals, solvents, pesticides, electromagnetic fields) and modification of life style (smoking, diet, professional sport).

As waited, the most abundant congeners were CB-153, CB-138, CB-180, and CB-170. Age resulted to be the most significant determinant of PCB levels. Slight differences in the congener profile were observed in the two population groups. As expected, a strong correlation between age and PCB levels has been observed. It is remarkable that the correlation increased with increasing chlorination in both the population groups.

For each gender, age-standardized mortality rates and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for all causes and for specific causes. Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimating survival probability and Cox regression model to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death. in the cohort of 4.644 intravenous drug users, 801 deaths were observed. In both sexes, mortality due to AIDS was lower in subjects enrolled in 1990-99 than among those enrolled in 1980-89. Mortality caused by overdose was particularly high in males enrolled between 1995-99. (SMRs in males and females were respectively 12.12 (95% CI 11.22-13.08) and 20.26 (17.23-23.83).

The study has three sections. One is based on data from 21 population-based Cancer Registries of the Italian Network of Cancer Registries for the period 1998-2002, that involve about 15,000,000 Italians. The data of the AIRT database are gathered and classified according to IARC rules. The second section presents estimates for all cancers and for the major cancer sites for Italy in 2006, estimates are based on the MIAMOD method. The third part presents data on mortality trends in Italy and in the Italian regions for the major cancer sites from 1970 to 2002. AIRT pool incidence and mortality data for 36 cancer sites are shown. Data for each registry are also compared. There are age-specific and age-standardised rates, cumulative risks, time trends (1988-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002), and some quality indexes. Other AIRT data are also available at www.registri-tumori.it. Overall cancer incidence is increasing among males and females, while mortality is decreasing. On average, one men every three and one women every four have the probability of having a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime (0-74 years). Among men, prostate surpassed lung as the most frequent cancer site. Among women, breast cancer represents about one fourth of all cases, and we also confirm the increasing trend of lung cancer. In Italy more than 250,000 new cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) are estimated to be diagnosed every year among subjects 0-84 years old. Age-adjusted mortality is decreasing among males and females. The mortality differences between northern and southern regions, quite wide during the 1970s, are decreasing, and rates are becoming homogenous. Mortality started to decrease more recently in the South. This publication presents a wide and qualified documentation on cancer in Italy; it uses both observed data from the Cancer Registries that involve about one fourth of the resident population, and estimates; the latter enable us to have reliable data for the whole country.

We selected two populations of persons with diabetes and linked them with the PDR. The first population consisted of 123549 residents of Piedmont discharged with a diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9 CM250**) between 01.01.01995 and 31.12.2002, and the second consisted of 122394 persons who had received at least two prescriptions of an antidiabetic drug (ATCA10**) in 2003. Of these two groups of patients, 66% of those with a hospital discharge and 73% of those with a drug prescription were found among the 183301 patients in the PDR. A logistic model was adapted to explore the independent roles of variables available in the two databases as determinants of registration in the PDR. The odds ratios were significantly higher for patients under 65 years of age, women, patients with a low educational level, Italians, married and divorced patients and those with conditions affecting the severity of the disease.

Other clusters were detected in the municipality of La Maddalena (11 observed cases against 1.91, expected p value= 0.008) and in Southern Sardinia between Cagliari and Sarroch (p value= 0.018). The town of Marrubiu is clearly the most important cluster (p value= 0. 001) with 6 asbestosis cases in the period. These results indicate the urgency of the epidemiological surveillance of asbestos related diseases in Sardinia. The active search for incident cases of malignant mesothelioma in the whole Region and the analysis of modalities of asbestos exposure (according to national guidelines) is an indispensable tool for the primary prevention of occupational, environmental and domestic exposures from unknown asbestos sources of contamination.

Descriptive study of mortality at municipality and aggregated municipalities level. Mortality from 1995 to 2000 in six areas of five provinces of Tuscany Region where municipal and\/or hazardous waste landfills are located. Areas considered at higher exposure were those including municipalities where inhabitants mainly reside within 5 km from selected landfills. Comparison was made with rates observed in the five provinces in the same period. Statistical comparisons were perfomed using standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and bayesian mortality ratios (BMR) adjusted for age. Mortality for all causes, groups and specific causes of cancer and non-cancer diseases. Statistically significant mortality excesses were found for circulatory system and cerebrovascular diseases, for lymphohematopoietic system, liver and bladder cancer and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Methods utilized have produced preliminary indications on associations between residence in areas with landfills and mortality. These excesses, also due to the limitations of macrogeographic studies, indicate that further insights at microgeographic level are needed.

Lung cancer deaths occurred in 1986-2000 in residents in Piombino were included in the study. Observed and expected number of cases for each census unit were computed using 4 different case distributions by residence in the area: at the time of death, 10 years before death, 15 years before death, and the longer residence in Piombino. For each census unit, the expected cases of male lung cancer death in 1986-2000 were calculated using the cause-, sex- and age-specific mortality rates of the entire area, obtained with the four case distributions. Data was analyzed and adjusted for an index ofsocial deprivation, using the Stone conditional test. A significant excess risk of lung cancer mortality, decreasing with distance from the plant, was observed only when the cases experiencing their longer residence in Piombino were included in the analysis. Smoking habits and occupation are the most important risk factors, nevertheless environmental pollutants might have played an additional role in the causation of the excess risk observed.

Atmospheric deposition Bulks, air of High Volume (HV) samplers equipped with PM10 probe and total suspended particulate matter samplers were used. 4 sites of monitoring in different urban areas: two of them close to the cokery, one near the school, and the last one in the town of Statte (Taranto). Determination of suspended and deposition particulate matter concentration, further determination of heavy metal concentration in the suspended and deposition particulate matter, and determination of BaP concentration. Data evidenced that in the site of Tamburi Cemetery (near the cokery) suspended particulate matter PM10 concentrations vary with the different seasons (warm period: 67 microg\/m3, cold period: 39 microg\/m3). Lead concentrations are lower than the national limit (0,5 microg\/m3); for those heavy metals not yet regulated by law, values are comparable with other industrial areas. Deposition particulate matter concentrations found nearby the steelworks (warm period: 699 mg\/m2d, cold period 575 mg\/m2d), vary in each different monitoring site. In the town of Statte (Taranto) the concentrations found are: 236 mg\/m2d in the warm period, and 154 mg\/m2d in the cold period. BaP concentrations for PM10 found in the area of Tamburi near the cookery are the following: 1,9 ng\/m3 in the warm period, and 2,6 ng\/m3 in the cold period. A very compromised situation is found in the area under study as regard air quality, especially the particulate matter in its different fractions and its content of organic and inorganic pollutants.

Because of the vicinity to the city and the inadequacy of measures of pollution control, a risk also exists for the general population. Although the issue of environmental reclaim had been addressed by a specific law (DPR 23.04.1998), the solution to close the oldest batteries had been adopted through and enforced by the city administration and the Court. However, a recent agreement between ILVA and the Apulia Regional Administration has allowed to restart the use of some ovens, after simple revamping.","1803":"This study aims at evaluating the occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) through biological monitoring and at investigating the influence of selected genetic polymorphisms on the levels of internal dose biomarker. A cross-sectional study has been conducted on the basis of biological measurements in order to evaluate the levels of PAH exposure. PAH exposure assessment has been carried out in a coke-oven of one of the largest European steel plants (ILVA, Taranto), in the context of the program of medical surveillance carried in collaboration with the ILVA Occupational Health Service. 355 coke-oven workers exposed to PAH were enrolled from the 3 batteries of the coke oven plant. Maintenance workers and industrial cleaners were included. The measurement of urinary levels of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) as biomarker of internal dose has been carried out, as well as the evaluation of metabolic polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), glutathione S-transferases mu (GSTM1) and theta (GSTT1) as biomarkers of susceptibility. The median value of urinary 1-OHP was 1,05 microMol\/Molcreat. The difference between the groups was statistically significant, with the highest value observed in the maintenance group (median 1,71, range 0,06-14,69 microMol\/Molcreat). It is remarkable that 25% of the workers exceeded the proposed benchmark guideline value of2,3 microMol\/Molcreat. No statistical difference was found in relation to smoking habits. Workers with GSTT1 null genotype had higher 1-OHP levels than those with wild type (p = 0,06). The levels of biomarker of internal dose reflect a critical exposure to PAH in the coke-oven plant. Further observations are needed to better investigate the role of GSTT1 on the 1-OHP levels.

Two treatment\/distribution networks of drinking water, the first (#1) located near the source, the second (#2) located near the mouth of a river supplying the plants. Water samples were collected before (F) and after (A) the disinfection process and in two points (R1 and R2) of the piping system. The samples, concentrated on C18, were tested for DNA damage in human leukocytes by the Comet assay and for gene conversion, reversion and mitochondrial mutability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7 strain. The approach used in this study is able to identify genotoxic compounds at low concentration and evaluate their antagonism\/synergism in complex mixtures. Comet assay results show that the raw water quality depends on the sampling point, suggesting that a high input of environmental pollutants occurred during river flowing; they also show that the disinfection process can both detoxify or enhance biological activity of raw water according to its quality and that the piping systems do not affect tap water cytotoxic\/genotoxic load. The yeast tests indicate the presence of some disinfection by-products effective on mitochondrial DNA. The biological assays used in this study are proven to be able to detect the presence of low concentrations of toxic\/genotoxic compounds and assess the sources of their origin\/production.

The available evidence, in fact, points to a consistent increase of the occurrence of neoplastic and neurodegenerative disease and adverse reproductive outcomes associated to these levels of exposure. An approach based on the detection of high risk groups is proposed. In this frame contrastability between study subjects and suitable reference populations is the core issue. Some procedures aimed at selecting individuals and populations to be studied are discussed, in order to support local environmental and health authorities in setting priorities for studies and interventions. Finally, the implications of these studies in terms of scientific knowledge and environmental reclamation are examined.","1806":"","1807":"Benzene and formaldehyde are among the principal components in the air of various indoor occupational and non-occupational environments. Both compounds are toxicologically relevant for humans as recognized carcinogens. In order to evaluate the total exposure and to assess the possible health risk caused by benzene and formaldehyde for different population groups at European level, the JRC Institute for Health and Consumer Protection in Ispra launched the AIRMEX (IndoorAir Monitoring and ExposureAssessment Study) project in October 2003. It aims at identifying and quantifying the main indoor pollutants particularly in kindergartens, schools and public buildings. It also intends to evaluate the overall exposure of people working and occupying these areas. Measuring campaigns were carried out in pre-selected indoor environments in various European cities (Catania, Athens, Arnhem, Nijmegen, Brussels, Thessaloniki). Preliminary results clearly indicate that indoor air concentrations for volatile compounds (VOC) including benzene are higher than\/or similar to those found outdoors, ranging from a few micrograms (about 8 microg\/m3) to 281 microg\/m3. Outdoor concentrations vary from 7 to 153 microg\/m3. Personal exposure concentrations are generally higher than the indoor\/outdoor concentrations. In most cases they are twice as high as indoor concentrations (or even higher) and significantly higher than outdoor concentrations. Air concentrations of aldehydes inside buildings\/kindergartens were up to 7-8 times higher than outside. This mostly concerns formaldehyde, and it seems that strong indoor sources exist which clearly determine the indoor air concentrations. Formaldehyde concentrations in public buildings and offices vary from 3 to 30 microg\/m3, and those in kindergartens vary from 6 to 11 microg\/m3 (Arnhem\/Nijmegen). The highest values for formaldehyde, up to 29,9 microg\/m3, were found in Catania, Athens and Thessaloniki.","1808":"Polymorphic forms of genes involved in the control of the various phases of the cancerogenic process were associated to a greater individual susceptibility to cancer as a consequence of exposures to environmental carcinogenic agents. Some of these genes are involved in xenobiotic metabolism, in replication and repair of the DNA, in the control of cell cycle and cellular proliferation, of apoptosis, of the inflammation process, etc. Although the specific risk associated to a single polymorphic gene is generally low, the sanitary meaning can be considerable if the frequency of certain polymorphisms is high and the exposure is consistent. Furthermore, the combination of more unfavourable alleles can determine high risk genotypes. These subjects, probably, will fall ill as consequence of an exposure. The development of methodologies which allow the genotyping of a big number of genes can allow the identifying of highly susceptible subjects.","1809":"","1810":"","1811":"Improving quality and effectiveness of health care is one of the priorities of health policies. Hospital or physician volume of activity may be a measurable variable with a relevant impact on effectiveness of health care. There are several studies and systematic reviews evaluating the association between volume and outcome of health care. The aim of this review is to identify: areas, clinical conditions or interventions (prevention, diagnostic, therapeutic, surgical or clinical) for which an association between volume and outcome has been investigated; those for which an association between volume and outcome has been proved Overview of systematic reviews and Health Technology Assessment reports; search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web sites of Health Technology Assessment, other HTA Agencies, National guideline Clearinghouse, National Health Care quality tools (1995-february 2005). For each studied area results are described separately for each review due to the heterogeneity of outcomes, volume thresholds and results reported. No metanalysis has been conducted. Completeness of reporting of the systematic reviews has been evaluated using the QUOROM statement. For each review we evaluated the number of studies included and the proportion of studies with statistically significant results (p &lt; 0,05). As far as in-hospital mortality is concerned, the different areas have been classified in the following groups: Strong evidence ofpositive association: areas with &gt; or =10 studies included in the reviews, and high prevalence (&gt; or =50%) of positive studies (p &lt;0. 05) in the majority of reviews. Weak evidence of association: areas with 5 to 9 studies included in the reviews and high prevalence (&gt; or =50%) of positive studies (p &lt;0.05) in the majority of reviews. Weak evidence of lack of association: areas with 5 to 9 studies included in the reviews and high prevalence (&gt;50%) of not statistically significant studies (p &gt;0.05) in the majority of reviews. No suficient evidence of association: areas with less than 5 studies included in the reviews. No evidence of association: areas with &gt; or =10 studies included in the reviews, and high prevalence (&gt;50%) of not statistically significant studies (p &gt;0.05) in the majority of reviews. The same literature search was then applied to identify primary studies published in each considered area following the most recent systematic review published. We identified 21 systematic reviews and included 11 of them analysing 46 different areas. The majority of studies evaluate the effect of specific surgical procedures; the main outcomes considered are hospital mortality and 5 year survival for cancers. Considering in-hospital mortalilty as outcome, in 11 areas there is strong evidence ofassociation between volume of activity and outcome: abdominalaortic aneurysm (unruptured), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty knee arthroplasty coronary artery bypass, surgery for oesophageal and pancreatic cancer, surgery for prostate cancer, colecistectomy, carotid endarterectomy, myocardial infarction, neonatal intensive care. It is never possible however to identify a unique volume threshold. For some of these areas, particularly coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass, there are many new studies published following the last systematic review; some specific aspects are being investigated such as the role of temporal changes in the association, the effect of different risk adjustment procedures and the separate role of physician or hospital volume. In some cases, for example knee arthroplasty in-hospital mortality could be an inadequate outcome on which judging the strength of association, in fact, the few studies evaluating other outcomes such as complications provide inconsistent results. For a range of areas the evidence of association is weak: AIDS, appendicectomy, cardiac catheterization, surgery for breast, lung, stomach cancer, hernia repair, hip fracture, hysterectomy and injuries. As far as AIDS is concerned, the few number of studies found is probably due to the lack of studies published after the introduction of effective therapies. All the included studies show an evidence of association between volume and in-hospital mortality. In no case we found weak evidence of lack of association while we identified three conditions for which the number of studies included in the reviews together with the prevalence of non significant studies do suggest lack of association; these are abdominal aortic aneurysm (ruptured), hip arthroplasty and surgery for colorectal cancer. In the case of hip arthroplasty as well, inhospital mortality could be an inadequate outcome, but only one old study found a positive association with risk of complications. Eventually there is a group of areas (n=22) for which there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about the association between volume and outcome due to a small number of studies. In some cases, such as transplants, this could be due to the low rate of events; in this case all the few published studies show positive results. There are some limitations which should be taken into account in the interpretation of these results: despite the overall good completeness of reporting of the included reviews, the majority of studies included in the reviews themselves are cross-sectional studies representing a very weak study design to evaluate causality of the investigated association. Moreover the methodology of risk adjustment applied is heterogenous among studies and it is difficult to know the extent to which this can affect the observed results. It is eventually necessary to consider the possible occurrence of publication bias which could lead to an overestimation of the positive effect of volume on health care outcomes attributable to the lack of publication of negative studies. In some areas the evidence seems strong enough to guide health care organizational choices, although it is not possible to identify well defined volume thresholds. In other areas, particularly for non surgical conditions, where there is not enough evidence, it seems necessary to conduct proper epidemiological studies. Also the evaluation of effectiveness of using volume as an instrument of health policy requires further research. Taking into account the rapid and continuing process of technology development, the definition of standard and prerequisite volumes of care should be specific of each temporal period and health care system. It is therefore a dynamic process requiring a continuous review of the available evidence. In the area of evidence based public health, the limited available evidence should not impair the choice of actions based on limited evidence, but rather it should lead to the application of thefew available evidence on one side and to the planning of proper research in the areas of lack of evidence.

Out of the two studies, the first one shows problems on data confidentiality and privacy, while the other one entails a risk, even though minimum, of physical damage for the study subjects. In Italy, the laws foreseeing the submission of research projects to the ethical committee are the Code for Personal Data Protection (Dlgs 196\/2003), and the Good Clinical Practice regulations for the protection of research subjects (DM 15 luglio 1997); other provisions tied to such basic laws are also mentioned in the article. The laws on the protection of personal data tend to simplify prescriptions when the research relates to public health issues; the laws on the protection of the research subject do not almost totally pertain observational studies. We concluded that the researchers are free to submit or not both projects to the ethics committee.

With the exception of some population subgroups, the retrospective study showed that the vaccination was not effective in reducing the risk of hospital admission and death. On the contrary, the vaccination was associated with an increase in hospital admissions due to influenza, heart disease, and respiratory disease (increased by 7%, 13%, and 17%, respectively). On the other hand, the prospective study showed an association between the vaccination and a 26% reduction in the risk of admissions for respiratory disease and a 21% reduction in the risk of all-cause death, whereas visits due to respiratory disease were increased by 55%.

Eighteen percent of the SIDRIA-2 sample reported high traffic density in the zone of residence; 60% and 20% of subjects reported a very frequent transit of cars and lorries, respectively on the street of residence. High frequency of lorry traffic in the street of residence was associated with significantly increased risks for chronic cough or phlegm and sinusitis symptoms. These results, confirming previous findings (SIDRIA, 1994-95), show that children living near streets with intense traffic of heavy vehicles are at higher risk for adverse respiratory effects, especially for productive cough.","1841":"Several studies have shown that indoor pollution increases the risk for chronic pulmonary diseases and acute respiratory symptoms in children\/adolescents. Some associations have been confirmed by studies. Other relations are still unclear, such as those regarding dog and cat ownership. In this study we assessed the relationships of the exposure to mould and dog\/cat ownership with respiratory\/allergic symptoms\/diagnoses, such as wheezing, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema, and cough\/phlegm in 20,016 children (6-7 yrs old) and 13,266 adolescents (13-14 yrs old) from 12 Italian areas. Early mould exposure (in the first year of life) was positively related to all considered symptoms\/diagnoses (significantly for wheezing, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis in both children and adolescents, and for cough\/phlegm among children); current exposure (in the last year) was a significant risk factor for wheeze, among children. In the latter, dog exposure only in the first year of life increased the risk for wheezing and cough\/phlegm, whereas the presence of a dog lifetime seemed a protective factor (though not significant) for all symptoms\/diagnoses; negative relations (but not significant) suggested a protective effect by the cat for asthma, independently of exposure period. Among adolescents, the presence of a dog both lifetime and only in the first year of life was significantly related to cough\/phlegm; except for rhino-conjunctivitis, all symptoms\/diagnoses were negatively related to the presence of a cat lifetime (though not significantly). In conclusion, our results confirmed the effects of mould exposure, especially when it occurs early, on the prevalence of respiratory disorders such as asthma, rhinitis and cough in the pediatric age. The complex relations between keeping a dog or cat at home and respiratory\/allergic symptoms\/diseases in childhood warrants further studies.","1842":"The present study shows associations between parental smoking and respiratory diseases in Italian children and adolescents participating in SIDRIA-2. We studied associations (odds ratios, ORs, and 95% confidence intervals, 95% CI) between exposure to mothers smoking fathers smoking, both parents' smoking, and three categories of cases: current asthma, current asthmatic symptoms, chronic bronchitis. At least one parent smoker was associated with a greater risk for asthmatic diseases compared to subjects not exposed. Our findings are in agreement with other published studies' results on the adverse effect of passive smoking on childhood respiratory health. The proportion of families with at least one parent smoker is very high (about 50%), confirming that measures aimed to reduce passive smoking in the community, and particularly in all places where children are present, are urgently needed in Italy.","1843":"In recent years some studies have focused attention on the contribution of early life risk factors in the pathogenesis of asthma and wheezing. In our study we tested the hypothesis that wheezing in childhood is not a single disorder and that different wheezing phenotypes (called transient early wheezing, persistent wheezing and late-onset wheezing) are associated with different risk factors. We evaluated the association between pre, perinatal and early life (1st year) risk factors and different wheezing phenotypes in children 6-7 years old enrolled in the SIDRIA-2 project. Maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with early and persistent wheezing; prematurity, child's admission to hospital shortly after birth for respiratory problems, indicators of respiratory infections during the child's first year of life are associated with early wheezing. An increase in childhood infections from contact with siblings or day care attendance is a risk factor for early wheezing but protective against late-onset wheezing, while an opposite pattern was observed for breastfeeding. Finally, mould or dampness in the child's bedroom during his first year of life is associated with all wheezing phenotypes. The risk factors studied are differently associated with different wheezing phenotypes.","1844":"Asthma and obesity in children are common chronic conditions and both disorders have been increasing in the last 2 to 3 decades. The changes of dietary habits and a sedentary life style could have played a role in increasing the prevalence of both conditions. The aim of this report is to analyse the relation between some respiratory conditions (current wheezing, asthma and chronic cough) with dietary habits, body mass index (BMI), the physical activity and the habit to watch television. A total of 19,995 children (10,294 males and 9701 females) were investigated. Current wheezing is associated with increased BMI (V quintile OR=1.65), TV watching (more than 5 h\/day OR=1.53), adding salt to the foods (OR=2.45), and fizzy drink (5 times or more per week OR=1.31). Children who often eat tomatoes, fruits, cooked vegetables and citrus fruits have a lower risk of current wheeze. The pattern of association is similar for asthma. High BMI, TV watching, adding salt to foods, and fizzy drink are risk factors for chronic cough. An increased BMI and TV watching are strongly related to respiratory symptoms. Our data confirm that dietary factors such as salt, vegetables and fruits are associated with the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in children.","1845":"Prevalence of asthma and allergies in children shows large variations among different populations, but there is limited evidence about these conditions in immigrants from developing countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of asthma symptoms and allergies in immigrant children and adolescents living in Italy and to investigate the possible role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of such diseases. There were 1340 (4.0%) immigrants in Italy, mainly from East Europe (31.7%); 532 were born in Italy to foreign parents and 808 were born abroad. Asthma and other atopic diseases were on the whole significantly less common among immigrant children than among Italians, while some infectious diseases in the first two years of life resulted more present in immigrant children than in Italians.","1846":"The association between socio-economic status (SES) and respiratory and allergic disorders is controversial, and conflicting results are reported in literature. We examined this association using as indicators of SES parental education and occupation. Persistent cough resulted inversely associated with SES, while current wheezing and atopic dermatitis were directly associated with SES. The role of SES on frequency of respiratory and allergic conditions in Italy needs to be further investigated, although our results confirm a higher frequency of allergic dermatitis and a lower frequency of persistent cough in more advantaged families.","1847":"The present study investigated the prevalences of asthma, allergic rhinitis (both to pollen and to other causes) and eczema in Italian children (6-7 yr old) and adolescents (13-14 yr old) in the second phase of SIDRIA (2002), aiming also to highlight geographical differences in the prevalence of the studied diseases. Prevalence of lifetime asthma is 9.3% in children and 10.3% in adolescents; lifetime prevalences of allergic rhinitis and eczema are 12.3% and 15.9% in children, 20.9% and 11.9% in adolescents. In both age groups, prevalence of lifetime asthma and lifetime and past 12 months wheezing was greater in central than in northern and southern areas. A similar situation was also seen for allergic rhinitis but not for eczema whose prevalence decreased between North to South of Italy. An excess in prevalence of lifetime asthma and rhinitis was found in metropolitan areas compared to other areas; prevalence of eczema did not show any difference by urbanization level. Prevalence of asthma and, only in children, prevalence of rhinitis symptoms was greater in males than in females. On the contrary, prevalence of eczema and, only in adolescents, prevalence of rhinitis symptoms was greater in females. Prevalence of childhood asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema in Italy ranks intermediate with respect to other countries participating in ISAAC phase three.","1848":"The second phase of the SIDRIA study provides important information regarding the family characteristics of Italian children (6-7 years old) and adolescents (13-14 years old), and the frequency of risk factors for asthma and allergies, allowing comparisons between study areas according to differences in latitude (North, Centre, South) and urbanization level (metropolitan areas, with at least 500,000 inhabitants, and other areas). Parental education level was higher in metropolitan and central areas. The frequency of children and adolescents born abroad, and the percentage of mothers and fathers employed were higher outside metropolitan areas and there was an increase from the South to the North of Italy. This trend was paralleled by an increase in maternal age at child's birth and in the frequency of low birth weight and day care attendance. The frequency of breastfeeding was greater in children than in adolescents; the opposite was registered for passive smoking, with a frequency of exposure higher in adolescents than in children, especially in the Northern and Central areas, even if the proportion of subjects having at least one parent who smokes was still high in both age groups. The prevalence of overweight children was striking, especially in the South where physical activity was less frequent and children had the unhealthy habit of consuming a lot of snacks and carbonated beverages. Frequency of exposure to traffic in the area of residence was particularly high, especially in the metropolitan areas.","1849":"The SIDRIA project (Italian Studies on Respiratory Disorders in Children and the Environment) is aimed at evaluating the prevalence of respiratory and allergic disorders, and their geographic and temporal variations, in the context of the ISAAC study (International study of asthma and allergies in Childhood). The SIDRIA study was specifically designed to evaluate the prevalence of a variety of environmental, social, behavioural and familiar risk factors, and to examine the association between these socio-environmental factors and asthma as well as other respiratory disorders in children. The first phase of SIDRIA was conducted in 1994-1995 in 10 areas of Northern and Central Italy. The 2nd phase took place in 2002, in 13 Italian areas, and included 20,016 children (6-7 years old) and 16,175 adolescents (13-14 years old), with a response rate of 89% and 93%, respectively.","1850":"","1851":"","1852":"","1853":"","1854":"This review considers the State-of-art of Epidemiology in Italy with particular emphasis to: the promoting role of the Specialists in hygiene and preventive medicine; the new perspectives after its inclusions among the official disciplines of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) in a political contest of devolution; the past and present role of University training; the actual epidemiological training needs for the NHS; the different opinions about this discipline among the operators.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of various types of post acute rehabilitative care in patients with different diagnoses by investigating the association between treatments and functional gain by type of impairment and severity on admission. Information on the characteristics of patients and the rehabilitative treatments was collected using an Italian version of the Minimum Data Set-Post Acute Care. The questionnaire was created and validated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it is divided in various section and was filled in at regular intervals throughout the hospital stay. Patients included in the study were 1918. We used factor analysis to summarize each section in a single continuous variable. The observed functional gain was calculated as the difference between functional status at the beginning and at the end of the admission. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between rehabilitation treatments and functional gain, adjusting for patient characteristics and severity at admission. The effectiveness of the treatments were obtained by calculating the difference between the overall functional gain of the hospital stay and the predicted functional gain of the stay in the absence of rehabilitation treatments. The effectiveness of treatments differs across diagnostic class and it is associated directly with severity of functional status at admission. In most cases, the positive effect of treatments combines with the spontaneous functional gain; in other cases the positive effect of treatments opposes the spontaneous deterioration of patient functional status.

Purposive cluster (Rom settlements) sampling. Five settlements of Rom from Macedonia and Kosovo located in five cities in northern and central Italy. These settlements were chosen to represent the different types of existing living arrangements. 137 Rom families residing in the selected settlements. In total 737 people were covered, of which 167 were children from zero to five years of age. Respiratory wheezing, breathing difficulties during lifetime and number of episodes in the last 12 months. Asthma diagnosis and period prevalence. The comparison with the data of the SIDRIA study for children aged 6-7 confirms the reliability of the results we are presenting. However, the study reveals a higher incidence of asthma symptoms in Rom children which could lead to a worse asthma prognosis in later years. Moreover, the prevalence of asthma and the incidence of asthma symptoms in the last year vary significantly according to the settlement of origin and the state of the housing in which the child lives. The health of Rom children who live in settlements is put under great strain by the poor state of repair of the majority of these structures. It is therefore necessary to overcome the \"emergency\" approach and the \"temporary\" nature of the measures taken so far to deal with the issue of Rom from Eastern Europe, and plan serious reception and integration policies. ","1900":"The purpose of the present paper is to calculate cancer incidence estimates in the italian regions for the year 2001. Estimates are computed according to the mortality\/incidence (M\/I) ratio method. Observed data were from Italian areas covered by cancer registration and recently published by Cancer Registries Network (1993-1998), by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), that published mortality statistics for the year 1998, and by the National Institute of Statistics (Istat) that provided population figures for the year 2001. Regression coefficients of the M\/I ratios specific by cancer site, age class, sex and geographical area were computed and then applied to the observed mortality in the Italian regions in the year 1998. The estimated number of new cancer cases was then computed multiplying the estimated rates for the regional populations in the year 2001, as published by Istat. The total number of estimated new cancers (with the exclusion of skin cancers) in Italy was approximately 160,000 in men and 130,000 in women. The population of the Liguria region, older than other Italian regional populations, showed the highest crude rates, while its risk is similar compared to other Northern regions, as indicated by age-standardised rates. The most frequent tumour sites are the lung cancer (29,500 cases), the colon-rectum cancer (19,900 cases) and the prostate cancer (19,600 cases) in men; the breast cancer (35,000 cases), the colon-rectum cancer (19,500 cases) and the stomach cancer (6,800 cases) in women. The invasive cervical cancer, largely preventable with early diagnosis, is still responsible for approximately 3,000 new cases yearly. Incidence estimates are a useful tool for a better management of health resources. Treatment costs for tumour patients are generally high in the first period for diagnosis and principal treatment, while they fade during follow-up and remission. Costs increase during the terminal phase of disease. In the first period, costs can be predicted thanks to incidence estimates, while in the last period mortality data are more useful.

The determinants of mortality (birthweight, gestational age, sociodemographic maternal characteristics and type of delivery) have been analysed using logistic regression models. Two Italian regions with the highest number of births, Lombardia and Campania. The first represents the industrialized northern Italy, the second the relatively poorly developed southern Italy. The analysis concerns 300,697 births, 156,436 of which in Lombardia and 144,261 in Campania. Stillbirth, perinatal and neonatal mortality rates. The percentage of low birthweight (&lt;2,500 grams) is the same in both regions, that is, 5.2%. The percentage of preterm births is higher in Lombardia than in Campania (5.5% vs 3.9%). Stillbirth, perinatal and neonatal mortality rates are lower in Lombardia than in Campania, that is: 3.6 per thousand and 4.2 per thousand; 5.8 per thousand and 7.6 per thousand; 2.9 per thousand and 4.4 per thousand respectively. The comparison between the two regions highlights the different role played by the various main determinants. In particular, the gestational age seems to be more important in Campania than in Lombardia, as it is for the neonatal mortality The analysis provides us with some useful elements strictly related to the delivery characterisitcs and consequently to the kind of health care organisation to explain mortality differences between the two regions.

HEALTH OUTCOMES DATA: mortality for all natural causes (362254 deaths), for respiratory causes (22317) and cardiovascular causes (146830), and hospital admissions for acute conditions, respiratory (278028 admissions), cardiac (455540) and cerebrovascular (60960), have been considered. Mortality data came from Regional or Local Health Unit Registries, while hospital admissions data have been selected from Regional or Hospital Archives (exclusion percentages range for all admissions between 45% and 82%). For each participating city daily series averaged about 4.3 years, with a minimum of three consecutive years. AIR POLLUTANTS DATA: daily pollutants concentration series (SO2, NO2, CO, PM10, O3) came from air quality monitoring networks of Regional Environmental Protection Agencies, of Environmental Offices of Provinces or Municipalities. Monitors' selection has been done by a working group composed by representatives of monitoring network Agencies. The selection criteria are the representativeness of general population exposure for each specific pollutant, avoiding as possible monitors close to high traffic roads; and the number, quality and location of monitors, selecting around 3-4 monitors with continuous data flow in the period (at least 75% of valid hourly data). The final series has been created averaging over monitors and imputing missing values under proportionality assumptions. Median of Pearson correlation coefficients between pairs of monitors of the each city was 0.62, interquartile range 0.42-0.77. A generalized linear model on daily counts of health events has been fitted for each city. Linear pollutant effect has been specified and bi-pollutant models have been fitted for PM10+NO2 and PMO+O3. Temperature has been modelled parametrically using a change point at 21 degrees C and lagged effects. Humidity, day of the week, national holidays and influenza epidemics (using data from the National Surveillance Programs from 1999) are the other considered confounders. An age-specific natural cubic spline on season has been specified with 5 degree of freedom (on average) per year for mortality and 7 degree of freedom per year for hospital admission data. The base model is age-stratified (0-64, 65-74, 75+ years). Gender, age, season specific models have been fitted, too. Five sensitivity analyses have been done, varying the degree of freedom for the seasonality spline and specifying non parametric functions on temperature. Constrained distributed lag models have been fitted on mortality data to study potential harvesting effects. City-specific results have been meta-analyzed by random effects hierarchical Bayesian model. Four different models have been fitted in the sensitivity analyses, assuming different priors on heterogeneity variance and outlier-resistant prior on city-specific effects. Bayesian meta-regressions have been fitted on base model, bi-pollutant and season-specific city-specific results. Attributable deaths have been estimated by Monte Carlo methods using effect, pollutant, baseline rate distributions. Fourteen different scenarios have been considered for PM10 and ten for NO2 and CO, using meta-analitic and posterior city-specific effect estimates Pollutants effects are reported as percent increase on mortality or hospital admissions for an increase of 10 microg\/m3 of SO2, NO2 and PM10, and 1 mg\/m3 of CO. We found an increase on mortality for all natural causes associated to increase of air pollutants concentration (for NO2 0.6% 95%CrI 0.3,0.9; CO 1.2% 0.6,1.7; PM10 0.31% -0.2,0.7). Similar findings were found for cardiorespiratory mortality and hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiac diseases. We found no difference by gender. There was a weak evidence of greater effect size in extreme age groups (0-24 months and over 85 years where we found a percent increase in mortality for all natural causes for PM10 of 0.39% CrI95% 0.0,0.8). There was a strong evidence for each pollutant of greater effects in the warm season (1st May-30th September) on mortality and hospital admissions (we found a percent increase in mortality for all natural causes for PM10 in the warm season of 1.95% CrI95% 0.6,3.3). The associations between pollutants concentration and health events were present at different time lags, depending on outcome and exposure. For mortality, the excess risk peaked within few days from the exposure increase (two days for PM10, up to four days for NO2 and CO). Mortality displacement was minor and ended within two weeks. Cumulative effects at fifteen days showed higher risks for respiratory diseases (PM10 1.65% CI95% 0.3,3.0). The results of meta-regressions showed associations between PM10 effects on mortality and hospital admissions, and mortality for all causes (SMR) and PM10\/NO2 ratio. The effect modification of temperature was very consistent, and also using bi-pollutant models. Such effect modification was greater during the cold season. We found and overall impact on mortality for all natural causes in the period 1996-2002 between 1.4% and 4.1% of all deaths for gaseous pollutants (NO2 and CO). The estimates were more imprecise for PM10, due to the variability among cities of the effect estimates (0.1%; 3.3%). The limits stated in the European Union directives for 2010 would have been saved about 900 deaths (1.4%) for PM10 or 1400 deaths for NO2 (1.7%) among all the MISA cities, applying posterior city-specific effect estimates. ","1915":"Socioeconomic inequality and its impact on health is a growing concern in the European public health debate. In many countries, the issue is moving away from description towards the identification of the determinants of inequalities and the development of policies explicitly aimed at reducing inequalities in health. In Italy, ten years after the publication of the first report on inequalities in health, this topic is seldom present on the agenda of public policy makers. The purpose of this report is to update the Italian profile of social variation in health and health care in order to stimulate the debate on ways to tackle inequalities in health that are preventable. In the first section of this book, the threefold objective is to describe the principal mechanisms involved in the generation of social inequalities in health (Introduction); to report Italian data on the distribution and magnitude of this phenomenon in the last decade; and to evaluate policies and interventions in both the social (chapter 1.9, Section I) and the health sector (chapter 2.3, Section I), which are potentially useful to reduce health inequalities. It is intended for anyone who is in a position to contribute t o decision-making that will benefit the health of communities. For this reason, chapters are organized by specific determinants of inequalities on which interentions may have an impact. The methodological approach in the second section focuses on the best methods to monitor social inequalities including recommendations on social indicators, sources of information and study models, based on European guidelines revised for the Italian situation. According to data from national and local studies, mortality increases linearly with social disadvantage for a wide range of indicators at both the individual (education, social class, income, quality of housing) and the geographical level (deprivation indexes computed at different levels of aggregation). This positive correlation is evident for both sexes, with the steepest gradient observed among adults of working age, although differences persist also among the elderly. The causes of death found to be most highly correlated with social inequality, and largely responsible for the increasing inequality over the last decade, are those associated with addiction and exclusion (drug, alcohol and violence related deaths), with smoking (lung cancer) and with safety in the workplace and on the roads (accidents). Similar gradients and trends have been observed with different outcomes, such as self-reported morbidity, disability and cancer incidence (chapter 1.1, Section I). Reproductive outcomes confiirm this picture: compared to women belonging to the upper classes, those women in low conditions experience more spontaneous abortions and their children suffer from higher infant mortality and low birth weight. This is a critical issue since poor infant health, particularly for metabolic and respiratory pathologies, affects health in adult life. There is now substantive evidence showing that also socioeconomic circumstances at birth or during adolescence may have a strong impact on adult health (chapter 1.2, Section I). Differences in harmful lifestyles, such as smoking, heavy drinking, drug use, unhealthy diet, obesity and physical inactivity, have a similar effect. The only exception is smoking among women, which is positively correlated with socioeconomic status; however, since women in the upper classes have a greater tendency to quit smoking, the gradient will soon be reversed (chapter 1.7, Section I). On the other hand, most of these behaviours do not follow from free and conscious individual choice; they are a form of adaptation to chronic stress originating in the work-place (chapter 1.4, Section I), or to particularly unfavourable events and conditions, such as unemployment (chapter 1.5, Section I) or lack of family and social support (chapter 1.6, Section I). Poor socioeconomic circumstances are the threshold of absolute poverty and may lead to social exclusion, a condition with a heavy impact on health, which in Italy includes marginal groups of the native population and broader classes of immigrants (chapter 1.3, Section I). Finally, there is recent and consistent evidence on the existence of a \"contextual\" effect on health, as opposed to the \"compositional\" effect given solely by the aggregation of individual processes. According to this hypothesis, characteristics of the infrastructure, and the physical and socioeconomic environment of an area would have an impact on individual health independent from the cultural and economic resources personally available to people living in that area (chapter 1.8, Section I). With respect to the health care system, various studies are in agreement in demonstrating that poor and less educated people have inadequate access both to primary prevention and early diagnosis (chapter 2.1, Section I), and to early and appropriate care (chapter 2.2, Section I). They also experience higher rates of hospitalization, particularly in emergencies and with advanced levels of severity.","1916":"","1917":"A multidisciplinary effort involving epidemiologists, general practitioners and specialists is critical for finding valid and feasible answers, by asking the right questions through observational and experimental studies. Clinical practice guidelines may represent a good starting point of this research process, highlighting which information needs exist in everyday practice; logically, guidelines also represent an ideal end, as a means of transferring any useful knowledge produced into practice. In between, this research process may have an added educational value and represent an active and valuable means of achieving continuing medical education credits. Consistency of the research-education-guidelines triad is discussed in this paper by describing methods and results of a practical research experience--a cohort study for evaluating prevalence, incidence, chronicity and management of digestive disorders--involving epidemiologists, gastroenterologists and thirty-five general practitioners of the Emilia-Romagna region.","1918":"Owing to a widespread diffusion, the consumption of banned and potentially harmful substances in sports has become a problem for the public health. Current estimations of the prevalence of doping in sports are rather uncertain, as most investigative tools do not reflect an absolute statistical power. However, the emerging scenario reflects a concerning underestimation by Structures and Institutions that should establish definitive rules and set reliable controls. Owing to restricted resources, prevention and fight against doping must be supported by meditated and rational strategies, with the aim to identify suitable contests and accurate procedures, considering carefully ethical issues that may arise from the positivity of the athletes to antidoping controls.","1919":"Usually survival studies evaluate the percentage of subjects alive or disease-free at a given point in time (cumulative survival percentage). These studies require a lengthy period both for follow up and for the collection of an exhaustive number of cases. In addition, for cancer types with a sharp gradient of cumulative mortality, the estimate may be unstable. On the database of children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) collected by the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont (CCRP) in 1979-1991, we have estimated an alternative time-dimensional index to estimate both patients' life expectancy of patient and number of years gained to death. These estimates have been compared in subsets of the database corresponding to different periods of diagnosis and efficacy of treatment. Life expectancy has been evaluated as the area under the survival curve, on the assumption that after a number of years since diagnosis, survivors have the same mortality rates of the general population. Clinicians are invited to take into consideration the approach described in the present note.","1920":"A series of cases of sinunasal cancer has been observed among shoe-makers (11 cases) and tannery workers (8 cases) in the leather production area in Tuscany in the period 1990-2002.

Before asking their consent, patients were informed by cultural mediators who had been instructed about the aims of the study\/exam during introductory meetings. The initial step managed by mediators was followed by further individual counselling interventions, carried out by hospital infective disease unit, prison and prison drug abuse service physicians. The laboratory tests were performed in an external structure. Prison of Bologna. The study was conducted on 433 subjects among a whole population of 900 inmates in the local prison: 390 subjects were males (90.1%) and 43 were females (9.9%). The median age of the whole population was 34.86 years (+\/- 9.9). The studied population counted 147 (33.9%) intravenous drug users (IDU) and 286 not addicts (66.1%). As regards nationality, 212 subjects were Italian (48.9%) and 221 (51.1%) foreigners. Among the total 433 inmates considered, 78 (18%) were known as previous IDU with conviction history or condemned to long term sentences, while 59 (13.6%) were inmates recently convicted active IDU assisted by the internal drug abusers service. The third group was composed by 296 inmates imprisoned during the summer (103 Italians and 193 foreigners) self declared not IDU. A. 12.5% of inmates were HIV positive, 8.1% HBV positive and 31.1% HCV positive. 25 subjects were found positive both to HIV and HCV; 1 both to HIV and HBV and 5 to HIV, HBV and HCV. HIV positivity is more common among Italian vs. foreigners inmates, among IDU vs. not IDU. HCV positivity is more common among Italian vs. foreigners inmates, and among IDU vs. not IDU. The distribution of HBV seropositivity among the different groups shows no statistically significant differences. All subjects receiving multi-focal counselling reached better compliance levels: 10% vs. 1% for HIV, 16% vs. 1% for HBV and 35% vs. 0.3% for HCV, with statistically significant coefficients of contingency. In the prison of Bologna drug addiction is prevalent in italian seropositive personers and it is often associated with HIV and HCV positivity.

Descriptive study and multiple linear regression analysis of the relationships between structural variables and outcomes. General practitioners (GPs) belonging to the Italian Society of General Medicine (SIMG), and enrolled in Health Search (HS). Six hundred and ninety-five voluntarily enrolled GPs and their patients. PRINCIPAL OUTCOMES: Descriptive statistics (mean and median values, standard deviation, frequencies) concerning the general characteristics of the GPs, the ways in which they connect to the network and their use of the clinical data management software, and epidemiological measures concerning the prevalence of hypertension among their patients, and the recording of weight, height and tobacco smoking habits. The geographic distribution of the GPs is homogeneous: 317 in Northern Italy (12.52 physicians per 10(6) patients), 134 in Central Italy (12.30 physicians per 10(6) patients) and 244 in Southern Italy and the Islands (11.89 physicians per 10(6) patients). Five hundred and ninety-five (85.6%) are males; their mean age is 46.7 years (SD +\/- 3.8); the mean number of patients per physician is 1128; 69% have at least one post-graduate specialisation; 49% practise alone; and they work for a mean of 30 hours per week (SD +\/- 13). Five hundred and fifty-three GPs were actually connected to the network as of January 2003. The data relating to the years 2000-2001 show an increase in the number of connected physicians (34 in 2000 and 261 in 2001) and in the number of connections (a median of 12 in 2000 and 17 in 2001). The GPs contact more than 80% of their patients every year. The frequency of the recording of data concerning smoking habits, weight and height increases in proportion with the frequency of connections. The prevalence of hypertension among the patients included in the survey is 5.4%. Multiple regression analysis showed that the variability in the prevalence of hypertension was not influenced by the frequency of PC use but by the different structure of the age classes of the patients. This study of the variables relating to GPs, their clinical practices, and their use of computerised records (examined by means of the chosen indicators) shows that the regular and complete recording of the principal data of health interest is feasible insofar as it is not biased by the characteristics of the GPs, and advantageous. The construction of the database therefore represents a first step towards the initiation of routine research into general practice in Italy.

The number of asbestos workers by municipality has been estimated by merging data provided by the National Institute for Insurance against Occupational Accidents (INAIL), the Ministry of Labour and an association of formerly exposed workers (AUSER Flegrea). The number of deaths from malignant pleural neoplasms by municipality has been derived from published studies regarding two consecutive periods: 1988-1994 and 1995-1997. In the first period most deaths occurred in areas with a high number of formerly exposed asbestos workers, whilst in the second period mesothelioma mortality increased extending to other areas without registered exposed workers. This finding may be attributable to the presence of atypical occupational exposures, not reported by the current information systems, or to environmental, non occupational exposure patterns.

Per one million kilometres travelled 0.4 cars and 1.3 two-wheeled vehicles are involved (0.7 motorcycles and 2.2 mopeds). In 2000 there were 1,229 deaths and 69,543 injured riders. Males up to forty years old are the most represented. The masculinity ratio presents a decreasing trend from motorcycles to mopeds and to cars both for killed people and for injured people. The lethality rate increases with age for all types of vehicles but for mopeds this trend is much more evident. Most of the accident occur in urban road while most of the deaths happen in extra-urban road. Mopeds and motorcycles, which are a small subset of all motor vehicles (approximately 20%), are greatly overrepresented in crashes. Considering the kilometres travelled, the risk to be involved in a crash for mopeds is estimated to be 32.6 times higher than the comparable risk for cars and for motorcycles it is 17 times higher.

Nevertheless, multivariate analysis by the Cox model based on incident cases proved that histological subtype and age are the only most important prognostic factors (cases with fibrous morphology and older age are associated with lower survival). In the incident case group the increase of survival for pleural mesothelioma of cases treated with recent therapeutic protocols doesn't reach statistical significance. These results are similar to those of previous studies conducted to identify prognostic factors for mesothelioma survival; they don't permit confirmation of the efficacy of the recent therapy on the population base cases and only allow one to suppose them in the cases of the non resident population.

The average nicotine concentration in discotheques and restaurants were respectively 26.78 microg\/m3 and 2.32 microg\/m3. In the other public places the concentration was about 1 microg\/m3. In smoke-free public places the average concentration was 0.85 microg\/m3; in public places where smoking is allowed concentration was higher (11.53 microg\/m3). In the smoking section and non-smoking section of restaurants with separated areas the average concentration was respectively 2.54 and 2.14 microg\/m3. The highest nicotine concentrations were recorded in discos and restaurants. A smoke-free public place is effective in reducing ETS exposure. Smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants without a separate ventilation system seem not to solve ETS exposure. ","1937":"The study describes briefly the current situation of the surveillance of congenital anomalies in Italy and gives an insight into the province of Siracusa in order to better characterise health status of populations residing in an area at high environmental risk. The authors, who coordinate the Italian registries of congenital malformations, have collaborated with the Eastern Sicily Registry of congenital malformations (ISMAC) and the registry of diseases of the Siracusa province. Data collected by the ISMAC Registry were used to calculate the prevalence of malformed newborns, resident in the municipalities of the province of Siracusa between 1991-2000. This prevalence was compared to that observed in the rest of the Siracusa province (RSP), in the whole area covered by the ISMAC Registry (ESR) and to the mean prevalence at birth of the North-East, Emilia Romagna, Toscana and Campania Registries (IR). Comparisons were made for all malformations and for groups of malformations (with the exclusion of groups with a 10 year frequence &lt;10 cases in the province of Siracusa). In addition, heterogeneity among the municipalities of the province and temporal trends were statistically tested. Total, groups and specific congenital malformations. Results were statistically borderline considering all malformations when the Priolo-Augusta-Melilli area was compared to IR and ESR (standardized morbidity ratio SMR(IR)=1.1, SMR(ESR)=1.2) and statistically significant when compared to RSP (prevalences ratio PR(RSP)=1.9). Significant excesses resulted in this area also for hypospadias (SMR(IR)=1.9, SMR(ESR)=2.4, PR(RSP)=2.5) and anomalies of the digestive system (SMR(IR)=2.1, SMR(ESR)=1.9, PR(RSP)=2.6). Following these results a case-control study on malformations observed in excess has been activated and a protocol for the surveillance of sensitive diseases in areas at environmental risk is being elaborated.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the observed excess mortality had to be attributed to the deaths occurred among the local large Nursing Home's guests which were half of the total deaths registered among residents. Empirical Bayesian Mortality Ratios (EBMR), applying the method of Clayton and Kaldor, were calculated either including or excluding the guests of the Nursing Home from the deaths and from the population. Only the population with age &gt; or = 65 was included in the analysis. The expected deaths were calculated using the Tuscan population mortality rates by sex, age and specific cause of death (all causes, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, digestive diseases and respiratory diseases). Excluding the guests of the Nursing Home from the analysis it was observed a strong decrease of the EBMRs for almost all causes considered, but those for cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases. The results obtained underline the necessity to take in consideration also a possible \"Nursing Home effect\" in evaluating mortality excesses in small areas.

Moreover, we describe the implications of its use in evaluation of scientific evidence and in decision making. In many cases evaluation of possible risks is influenced by individuals or groups with personal interests different from those of public health. Their actions discredit positive studies, giving rise to forced controversies and discouraging new studies. The result is to hinder checking of causal patterns. We report examples of historical cases and of issues rising from electromagnetic fields. The use of the precautionary principle is desirable both in issues related to global change and in possible risks associated with specific biological, chemical and physical agents. The precautionary principle should be included between values of public health evaluations and its use requires institutional subjects to take high responsibility for it. Both time and quality of analysis of causal patterns are linked to the sincere desire to solve doubts and defend public health interests for those who are active in public health.","1971":"To compare hospital mortality in a cardiac surgery unit with external data and to assess changes in time (patients undergoing surgery in two different periods).

Comparisons of in-hospital mortality, expressed as Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR), were adjusted for risk factors defined according to EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation). In the first and second period, complete information on all the 17 EuroSCORE items was available for 58.3% and 89.6% patients respectively. After exclusion of patients with one or more missing data, observed and expected numbers of death were found to be very similar, with SMRs ranging between 0.82 (isolated bypass in the second period) and 1.06 (\"other\" surgery in the first period). Mortality was higher among patients with missing data, but at least in 1999 the latter had a limited impact on the overall estimates. Compared to the first period, mortality was reduced during 1999 (from 5.9% to 5.4%), in particular for isolated bypass (from 4.4% to 3.4%). In the unit under investigation, hospital mortality following heart surgery was similar to that predicted from EuroSCORE and seemed to be lower in 1999 than in 1991-95, particularly for isolated bypass.

For fatal accidents, we reviewed the data on deaths provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). All patients hospitalised for \"home accidents\" for the period 1999-2001 and deaths due to \"external causes of injury and poisoning\" and from these excluded transport accidents, homicides, and suicides for the period 1982-1999. The most commonly reported reasons for hospitalisation following a home accident were: fracture for 15-64 year-old age-group and for persons aged 65 years or more (60.7% and 86% respectively) and intracranial transmatism for 0-14 year-old age group (33%). Regarding fatal accidents, the mortality rate per 100,000 was 3.6 among 0-14 year-olds, and 145.1 among the persons aged 65 years or more. The most common cause of death was chocking for 0-14 year-old age-group and falls for the person aged 65 years or more (32.2% and 86.3% respectively). There is an excess of mortality in the geographical areas of Western Alps of Piemonte.

Infant mortality rate (deaths occurring in the 1st year of life), early neonatal mortality rate (1st-7th days of life), late neonatal mortality rate (8th day of life-1st month of life), post-neonatal rate (1st month-one year of life), and incidence of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). The infant mortality rate was 4.76 per 1,000 live births, with no significant differences among the three years and lower than the Italian rates. The SIDS incidence rate was 0.14 per 1,000 live births, and 0.39 per 1,000 live births when deaths not directly labelled as SIDS were considered. SIDS was the single leading cause of death in the first year of life after the early-neonatal period. The decrease of the infant mortality rate is due to the drop in mortality for congenital malformations and perinatal diseases. The incidence of SIDS in Northern Italy turns out to be low, while SIDS remains the single leading cause of death in the first year of life after the early neonatal period.

Through data collected in a prospective cohort study (Italian Seroconversion Study) of 1899 HIV-infected persons with well estimated date of seroconversion, considered as time-zero of analysis, we calculated Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models, allowing for staggered entries, to estimate the cumulative probability of survival and hazard-ratios (HR) for death and for AIDS by calendar period (1980-1996: pre-HAART era, 1997-1998: first HAART era, and 1999-2001: second HAART era), age at seroconversion, gender, and exposure category. During 17251 person-years, 660 HIV-positive patients developed AIDS and 510 died. Before 1997, the cumulative probability of survival, at twelve years from seroconversion, was 51.0%. In the period 1997-1998 the probability was 77.3% and in the period 1999-2001 it further increased at 91.2%. In the period 1980-1996 only older age at seroconversion was associated with more rapid progression to death. In the period 1987-2001 individuals infected through injecting drug use had a reduced increase of survival compared to those infected through sexual contact. Similar results were obtained for progression to AIDS. Finally we estimated an improved level of immunesuppression in the period 1987-2001. In fact, while in the period 1980-1996 we estimated a decrease of the CD4 lymphocites of -54.8 cells\/mm3 (95% CI: -52.0; -57.6) per year; after 1996, we estimated an increase of CD4 of +39.6 (95% CI +34.1; +45.1)per year.

Such parameters allow to summarise the pre-vaccination epidemiology of measles in the Italian regions, particularly the amount of effort needed for the eradication of the disease, consistently with the WHO targets. Despite the limited reliability paid to Italian case notifications data, the results show i) that the estimated eradication coverages are nor distant from the levels estimated from Northern-Europe; ii) that regions seemingly demanding the largest eradication effort seem also to be those characterised, up to now, by the lowest coverages; iii) the importance of achieving high coverages without delays in the age of administration of vaccination.","1984":"Epidemiological investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks helps us to better define the risks, hazards and vehicles involved. In 1997 guidelines on epidemiological methods for investigating these outbreaks were implemented in the Lazio Region. Methods used in investigating the 410 foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the 1996-2000 period were analysed to evaluate the impact of the guide lines on health services. Specific food attack-rates (epidemiological methods) were calculated more frequently in outbreaks with setting of mass catering with many exposed people (46% of these outbreaks) than in outbreaks in home setting with few exposed people (13% of these cases). Inversely, in smaller outbreaks the proportion of cases with detected aetiology (microbiological method) was higher (66%) than in larger ones (43%). For foodborne disease outbreaks with at least 30 people exposed epidemiological methods of investigating showed temporal trend in the period 1996-2000: the epidemics in which attack rates were calculated increased from 50% to 83%, those in which epidemic curve was drawn increased from 17% to 79%, and those in which food specific attack rates were calculated increased from 33% to 58%. The hazard analysis of critical control points (HACCP) was performed only in 18.3% of the cases. In conclusion, the guide lines resulted in a wider application of epidemiological methods in large outbreaks with a well defined exposure resulting in an improved detection of vehicles of foodborne diseases. Epidemiological methods possibly are not adequate to investigate smaller foodborne outbreaks.","1985":"","1986":"","1987":"","1988":"","1989":"","1990":"","1991":"Mortality data in the province of Modena 1987-1996 show an excess for lung cancer in the municipality of Fiorano Modenese.

In such situations, a typical regression approach, known as \"structural equation models\" (SEM), which was introduced in the 1970s, becomes significant. These models allow hypotheses to be formulated quite clearly, thanks to some explicit and rigorous graphical representations, on which the \"path analysis\" is based. SEM, which were initially used in economics, have in the past decade been applied in a wide variety of fields, especially in genetic epidemiology. It's in this field that SEM are extraordinarily effective, representing a simple yet powerful means of estimating the contribution of genes and the environment to the phenotypic expression of a given disease. To this end, data on twins are particularly useful, and in this case the correlation between the outcomes describes the extent of similarity of the twin phenotypes. From this standpoint, SEM undoubtedly constitute one of the most promising statistical tools for family studies and quantitative genetic research. The method can be easily extended to traditional epidemiology, and some interesting applications have already been developed in occupational and social epidemiology. In this paper, we describe in detail the SEM approach and discuss the use of these models in genetic epidemiology, using twin studies as an example. We also discuss the application of SEM in fields other than genetic research.","1993":"Twins are a valuable resource for the study of complex traits. The twin method is substantially based on the comparison between correlations and concordance in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and allows several applications in biomedical and molecular genetic research. It allows either the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the influences that genetic and environmental factors exert on phenotypes or the estimation of trait variability. Moreover, classical genetic linkage analysis is more powerful if performed in DZ twins. However, the twin method has some pitfalls, such as the necessity that collected samples be representative of both twin and general population. For this reason, over the last few years, a number of Countries have established population-based twin registers, which guarantee the maximum level of representation and, consequently, are of extreme value for epidemiological studies. Italy is also implementing a national twin register. The following is the description of the procedure that led to the establishment of the Italian Twin Registry.","1994":"Cesarean deliveries (CS) are increasing in Italy, especially in the Campania region, where they reached a peak incidence of 52% in the year 2000. This study analyses CS rate variability by hospital type, foetal risk factors (low birth-weight, prematurity, plurality, anomalous presentations), maternal characteristics (age and parity) and delivery time. Data are drawn from birth certificates of 31,182 babies, that is 64.2% of all delivered in 65 out of 98 Campania birth-places. 16,251 (52%) babies are born by CS; 559 (1.8%) by operative vaginal delivery. The Attributable Risk for foetal risk factors is 6.9%. In absence of these the CS rate would be 48.5% instead of 52%. CS rate of primigravid women was 53.2%. 63% of CS take place during morning hours and 93% on working days. CS rate is higher in private than in public hospitals (58 vs 46%), though foetal risk factors are lower. Rate of older women was higher in public hospitals, rate of primigravid women was higher in private ones. Campania data confirm the marginal role of foetal risk factors in the increase of CS rate. In order to reduce CS rates it seems reasonable to offer special support to primigravid low risk mothers and to provide behavioural obstetrical guidelines for the peculiar Italian reality.","1995":"This report presents the impact of smoking habits on Italian mortality in 1998. Estimates of smoking-attributable fraction (FAF), smoking-attributable mortality (MAF), and years of potential life lost (YPLLf) were calculated using the SAMMEC software (CDC, USA), and the Peto method. During 1998, using the SAMMEC software, smoking caused approximately 83,650 premature deaths in Italy (67,600 in men, 16,000 in women, and 45 in infants), equal to 15.1% of mortality in adults above the age of 35 years (24.4% of mortality in men and 5.8% in women). YPLLf were about 900,000 in men, 221,000 in women, and 3,500 in infants. Using the Peto method, smoking-attributable deaths were about 70,200 (59,600 in men and 10,600 in women), equal to 12.7% of mortality in adults older than 35 years (21.5% of mortality in men and 3.9% in women). YPLLf were about 806,000 in men and 142,000 in women. Among adults, for both methods most smoking-related deaths were attributable to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, chronic airways obstruction, and cerebrovascular disease. Differences between the estimates of the two methods underline the gap between a more conservative estimate (Peto method) and a less restrictive one (SAMMEC software). Given validity for both methods, it is likely smoking habits caused between 70,000 and 83,000 deaths in Italy during 1998.","1996":"In this paper, by means of explorative methods based on geographical analysis, the relationship between the presence of an asbestos-cement factory in the urban area of Bari and malignant mesothelioma cases, occurring between 1980 and 2001 among residents, is analysed. The data source of the 64 cases studied is the national register of mesotheliomas (Renam), the Apulia regional operating centre (Cor-Puglia). Data are analysed by the use of the S + SpatialStats software. Both individual data analysis and explorative geographic analysis point out an increased risk of disease among people living near the asbestos-cement factory: within an area centred on the location of plants and having a radius of about 1 Km, the estimated risk is 2.38 times above the normal level. Further analytical studies are required. ","1997":"The integration of the scientific researches in the assistance process is one of the most important challenges that is currently set to the health operators. In this paper a model for the health needs-assessment will be applied to verify if and how the prevalence of some classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease foretells mortality and hospitalisation episodes at 3 years, and if it could express the health need of that population. The \"sanitary history\" of 1704 subjects, enrolled in 1996 during the Brisighella Study, has been followed. We know the health profile of these subjects at 1996 and data about their hospitalizations, mortality, and general assistance from 1996 to 1999. In this population the risk of cardiovascular disease is inferior to that esteemed by the hospitalisation rate, attributable mostly to a little group of subjects with well-defined characteristics of exposure. The resources spent on a hospitalization do not adequately describe either the sanitary need nor the relief load and the \"cost\" associated to the disease. The methodology used allows to explore in detail the relative weight of the different subjects involved in the sanitary assistance in order to better reach the objective of producing the maximum quantity of benefits for the patient at the smallest possible quantity of risk.","1998":"","1999":"","2000":"","2001":"Movies influence fashion, lifestyles, and represent smoking as an acceptable behaviour. In fact the greatest tobacco companies built relationships with Hollywood's actors and producers, in order to show smoking and cigarette brands in films. All over the world laws have been developed, in order to restrict smoking and tobacco advertising. Films showing tobacco do not violate these laws, even in those states where tobacco advertising is restricted. Moreover, films are better than any other commercial advertisements because the audience is total unconscious of the sponsor's involvement. Stanton Glantz, Medicine Professor at San Francisco University, is the voice of the movement for smoke-free movies. A lot of studies show that cigarette smoking is more frequently in '90s movies than in 60's and 70's movies. The smoking actors seem to be attractive, strong, healthy and successful. Films showing smoking influence tomorrow's customers: adolescents. Teenagers watching \"smoking films\" are the most exposed to start smoking. Hence the need to educate Hollywood industry, in order to have smoke-free movies.","2002":"This study describes the evolution of the concept of health in Italian occupational health legislation (1900-2001). Mental health dimensions at work (such as reduction in monotony and repetitiveness, mental risks in pregnancy and so on) were introduced only recently. This can be explained with: 1) poor working conditions; 2) the delay of the occupational health community in including mental health in the concept of health; 3) the gap between scientific knowledge of risk factors for mental health and legislation aimed at prevention.","2003":"Air pollution is associated with short- and long-term effects on \"natural\" mortality. Both can be viewed as the worsening of population health, more pronounced for long-term effects. A method for estimating this burden is proposed.","2004":"The opening of the new Malpensa 2000 Airport worried people living in the neighbouring towns about possible effects of acoustic and air pollution on health status. For this reason, Varese Health Unit set up a study involving housewives and General Practitioners. This study has been carried out in 3 Areas: A Area, bordering the airport, B Area, at intermediate distance, and C Area, at long distance. On the whole, 932 housewives (18 to 64 years old) and 92 General Practitioners, were involved. The questionnaire, distributed to housewives between May 1st and November 30th 2000, was filled out in the doctor's surgery who furthermore added clinical data. Chi-square statistics were calculated to test the association between living area and personal data, behavioural and environmental characteristics, and reported disorders. To describe possible interrelationships between living Area and the answers supplied by housewives and General Practitioners the multiple correspondence multivariate analysis technique was applied. The housewives living next to the airport (A area) frequently report insomnia, nocturnal waking, anxiety and difficulty in hearing words. The multivariate analysis has shown a relationship between recently increasing noise noted by the housewives, and the area where they live, as well as a noticeable coherence between the answers given by the housewives and those given by the General Practitioners, who reported higher frequencies of cephalgy, allergies, anxiety neurosis, medical consultation, benzodiazepine's and sleeping disorder's prescriptions in A Area compared to C Area. The airport's presence seems to be associated with the onset of subjective disorders in neighbouring population. Some of these disorders, in particular neuropsychological ones, are clinically confirmed by General Practitioners, and are consistent with different noise exposure levels.","2005":"A study about the frequency of respiratory and allergic disorders in childhood was carried out in Rome, during the 2000-2001 school year. This survey represents the Italian contribution to the second phase of the International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC Phase Two). A properly filled in ISAAC Phase II questionnaire was returned by parents of 1,760 children attending the fifth grade in primary school (83.5% of the target). Prick tests were performed to provide an objective measure of atopy, defined as skin reactivity to one or more allergens. The presence of visible flexural dermatitis was determined through skin examination. Lifetime prevalence for asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema was 12.4%, 13.2% and 15.1%, respectively. Period prevalence in the last 12 months was 7.0% for attacks of wheezing or whistling in the chest, 9.1% for rhinitis symptoms, and 9.5% for dermatitis symptoms. A total of 1.6% of the children under examination had a visible flexural dermatitis. Of the children who performed prick test, 31.8% was skin positive at least to one of the adopted allergens. An international comparison with the results of other ISAAC Phase Two studies (conducted in Albania, Germany, Hong Kong, UK and Sweden) has shown that Rome and Hong Kong were the areas with the highest prevalence rate for atopy, but had comparatively low proportions of asthmatic subjects. This inconsistency suggests that factors other than atopy could be responsible for the geographic epidemiological distribution of asthma.","2006":"To study cancer mortality among main subgroups of workers employed in VC\/PVC production potentially exposed to toxics and carcinogens. We reanalyzed the mortality of 1,658 males (follow up 1972-1995; 35,626 person years; 170 deaths) by Poisson regression, adjusting for age, age at hiring, calendar period, length of exposure and latency. We calculated the relative risks (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PVC baggers (n. = 197), PVC compound (n. = 403) and autoclave (n. = 209) workers. As an internal reference we used two groups of workers: technicians and employees (main reference: n. = 202 subjects), with the group of other blue collar workers (n. = 639) added for statistical purposes only (minor reference: n. = 841 subjects). Pooling the four subgroups of exposed workers, the comparison with the main reference group allowed us to detect increased mortality from all causes of death (RR = 2.09; CI = 1.09-4.00; 160 deaths), all tumours (RR = 1.53; ns; 81 deaths), lung cancer (RR = 2.05; ns; 29 deaths) and cardiovascular diseases (RR = 3.57; ns; 29 deaths). The analysis for each specific subgroup revealed increased mortality from all causes of death among both PVC baggers (RR = 2.66; CI = 1.27-5.59) and PVC compound workers (RR = 2.68; CI = 1.36-5.27). Comparison of the minor reference group with the overall population of exposed workers showed increased RRs for other diseases, namely, liver tumour (RR = 4.08; ns; 9 deaths), lymphomas and leukaemia (RR = 2.97; ns; 7 deaths) and liver cirrhosis (RR = 3.30; ns; 11 deaths). The analysis for each specific subgroup revealed significantly increased RR for all tumours among PVC compound workers (RR = 1.74; CI = 1.06-2.85), for lung cancer among PVC baggers workers (RR = 3.04; CI = 1.15-7.99) and for liver cancer (RR = 9.57; CI = 1.69-54.1) and liver cirrhosis (RR = 6.32; CI = 1.37-29.07) among autoclave workers. In addition, the two deaths from brain tumour were observed among PVC compound workers. To highlight the risk previously reported in the literature and to reduce the possible dilution effect (due to comparison bias, healthy worker effect), it proved methodologically pivotal to separate exposed and probably unexposed workers (considered as an internal reference group). ","2007":"Sinonasal cancers (SNC) are neoplasm uncommon; although strictly related to occupational risk factors, in the Brescia province the professional SNC was unknown to the Occupational Health Service until short time ago. During the first nineties, a retrospective study has carried out to detect SNC and it has showed several occupational SNC cases. A local SNC population based Register was subsequently set up in 1994, covering 1,044,544 inhabitants. Between 1981 and 2000 104 SNC, occurred to 74 men and 30 women, have been collected; 98% of them was histologically diagnosed and 87.4% was of epithelial type. 36% of cases is located on maxillary sinus and the 31.7% on the ethmoidal sinus; 43% is the squamous cell carcinoma and 13.7% is the intestinal adenocarcinoma. The annual standardised incidence rates (on the Italian population, census 1981, x 100,000) on 1990-1995 and 1996-2000 are respectively 1 and 1 in men, 0.3 and 0.4 in women, in accordance with those esteemed in others industrialised provinces. In 1990-1995 the survival observed after 1, 3 and 5 years are respectively 83.8%, 67.7% and 48.3%. Anamneses were collected on 83 SNC cases among the epithelial type cancer. In men the 33% was exposed to occupational risk factors: wood (13 cases), leather (6 cases) and chromium (1 case) dusts. Among works probably related to SNC, agriculture, construction and textile reached respectively the 20.5% for both sex, 16.4% for men and 18% for women. As for non occupational risk factors suggested by literature, smoke appear to be the most relevant, related to the 52% of all cases and reaching the 64% in men. Among the women, polyps and inverted papillomas (31%), and also chronic rhinitis and sinusitis (13.6%) are more frequently observed. Some problems still limiting the work and its usefulness are discussed.","2008":"This study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of hospital discharge data for monitoring the impact of a regional practice guideline on treatment of colorectal cancer. The aims of the study were: i) estimating process and outcome indicators; ii) exploring the relationship between patient and hospital characteristics and these indicators. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for all risk factors analysed. All 3,614 patients undergoing potentially curative resection for rectal cancer in 75 hospitals in Piedmont (Italy) between 1997 and 2000 were included. Occurrences of abdominoperineal resections (APR), postoperative complications, reinterventions and hospital mortality were 16.2%, 11.0%, 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively. APR was performed more frequently in patients with distant metastases or urgently admitted and by hospitals with a lower volume of cases (&lt; 25 per year) compared to hospital with more than 50 cases per year (OR = 1.50, CI = 1.16-1.94). The strongest predictors for mortality and complications were: older age, distant metastases and urgency of admission. Incidence of complications and of reinterventions was also increased among males and in patients with lesions of the lower rectum. The rate of complications showed an increasing trend during the period, from 8.5% to 14.5% likely reflecting improvement in coding during time. Low hospital workload was associated to a reduced risk of complications and reinterventions, but there was evidence of underreporting of secondary diagnoses and procedures in smaller hospitals. Outcome indicator based on secondary diagnoses and procedures are of limited value in monitoring improvement of care since they reflect also differences in coding during time and among providers.","2009":"","2010":"","2011":"","2012":"","2013":"","2014":"","2015":"In this research, we suppose that the Di Bella case showed a separation, that is at the basis of the relation between people and the \"official medicine\", in an emblematic way: the separation between the reified universe--that is the scientific research with its necessary and universal rules, the medical practice, the medical and governmental institutions--and the consensual universe--the common sense, the emotions and the thoughts of people, of the patients and of their relatives. At the same time, these dynamics of the relationship between science and public opinion are framed in the context of the historical and political Italian situation of the Nineties to explain the origin and the development of the affair. Because of the priority role attributed to the mass-media in building the case, this research analyses all the articles on the Di Bella case published in Panorama and L'Espresso--two magazines chosen because they represent different cultural and political tendencies--by experimenting the integration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies. From our analysis, an ancient culture emerges, that is expressed by the stereotype of the no hope illness and by the repetition of consolidated common places: on one side the irrationality of the masses and the Italian character, on the other side the veneration for the science and the unquestionable trust in the guarantee provided by a foreign hospital or by a foreign research centre. At the same time, a positive role of the public opinion points out, which is able to get some negative sides of the reified universe and to give voice to the needs of the patients and of all common people who have to face with--or are afraid of facing with--the cancer, a prototypical illness which arouses fears and anxieties.","2016":"","2017":"","2018":"","2019":"","2020":"The investigation describes mortality of vinyl chloride exposed workers in the Montedison-Enichem plant located in Porto Marghera, near Venice, Italy. A total of 1658 workers employed from start of production (1950), present in 1956 or successively hired until 1985, were followed up between 01.01.1973 and 31.07.1999, for a total of 41.037 person years at risk: 248 deaths were observed. Mortality from all causes compared with regional population was lower than expected, (SMR 0.75; 90% CI 0.68-0.83) and from all malignant neoplasms similar to expected (SMR 0.94; 90% CI 0.81-1.09). SMR for primary liver cancer was significantly increased (SMR 2.78 90% CI 1.86-4.14). In the first year since leaving employment observed mortality was significantly above the null value for all causes (SMR 2.76; 90% CI 1.94-3.91), all malignant neoplasms (SMR 1.89; 90% CI 0.97-3.92) and cardiovascular diseases (SMR 2.37; 90% CI 1.13-4.95). Mortality rates for liver angiosarcoma (6 cases) increased with latency (trend test x 2 (1df) = 25.20 p &lt; 0.001) and cumulative exposure (trend test x 2 (1df) = 61.00 p &lt; 0.001), there were no cases with duration of employment less than 12 years, latency less than 10 years and for cumulative exposure less than 2.379 ppm-years. Mortality rates for hepatocellular carcinoma (12 cases) and liver cirrhosis (20 cases) showed a similar pattern for cumulative exposure. Observed mortality from lung cancer was higher than expected among those workers whose only job title was bagger. In the analysis accounting for latency, age and calendar period the RR for only bagger was 2.31 (90% CI 1.15-4.61). Mortality pattern for all causes, all malignancies and cardiovascular disease increased by time since employment, as expected in presence of a particularly strong Healthy Worker Effect (HWE). These results and the increased SMR values during the first year since leaving employment indicate that workers were selected into employment on the basis of good health conditions and early selective removal of weaker ones followed. The study results confirm the causal relationship between VCM exposure and liver angiosarcoma, and add supplementary evidence in favour of a causal explanation of the excess risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis as well as lung cancer among only baggers.","2021":"A mathematical model has been developed in order to assess the effect of extended programs of varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of the disease in Italy. The effect of different vaccination options have been estimated by the change in incidence of the disease and age distribution of cases over a short and long period of time. The developed mathematical model reproduces chickenpox transmission and immunisation; five strategies different for target age of vaccination and\/or proportion of vaccinated subjects have been considered. In all scenarios the model pointed out an initial decrease of case frequency observed in the first 3-5 years, followed by a series of epidemic peaks, variable in number and size by vaccination strategy. Moreover, as the number of cases among infants decreases, the number of cases among adults increases. Such event is minimised only by very high vaccination coverage (80% in the first year of life and 50% at 12 years of age). Extensive programmes of vaccination against chickenpox must reach a high coverage as soon as possible in order to avoid undesirable effects that may move forward the age of cases and therefore should be offered to target age groups easy to reach.","2022":"The main objectives of the National Mesothelioma Register (ReNaM), set up by the National Institute for Prevention and Occupational Safety (ISPESL), are: (a) the estimate of malignant mesothelioma incidence in Italy, (b) the definition of exposure to asbestos, (c) the identification of unknown contamination sources, still present on the territory. Cased diagnosed in 1997 in Piedmont, Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Apulia are reported, regions with more than 17 million inhabitants (30% of national population). ReNaM has facilitated the identification of mesothelioma cases and the description of the previous asbestos exposure in a large geographical area of the country, even though in some regions the definition of exposure to asbestos is not complete. 429 cases are recorded, of which 326 (76%) have been defined as definite malignant mesothelioma. The standardized annual incidence rate just for pleural definite mesothelioma is 1.51 x 100,000 inhabitants (2.26 for males and 0.79 for females). The exposure to asbestos has been defined for 198 mesothelioma cases with histological diagnosis: 125 cases (63%) refer to professional exposure, 10 (5%) to environmental exposure, 5 (2.5%) to domestic exposure. The adoption of a well-constructed national database, the up-date of guidelines and the recent starting up of ReNaM in other italian regions (Lombardy, Veneto, Marche, Campania, Basilicata and Sicily) will shortly lead to obtaining a major representativeness of the Italian situation.","2023":"This audit initiative aimed at assessing the prevalence of pressure sores in the public hospitals of Emilia-Romagna, and at monitoring the rate of use of specific modalities of prevention and cure. The design was cross-sectional, with information collected on three index days during 2000 by trained personnel. Overall, the prevalence of pressure sores at the regional level was 7.1%, with remarkable variation across hospitals (from 2.9% to 9.7%), also after adjustment for case mix. As for patterns of prevention and cure, 74% of patients at risk (according to the Braden scale) of developing a pressure sores received only standard low technology devices, and 50% of those in need were included in a systematic programme of postural change. Adequate (according to the available evidence) medications were used in 45% of patients with a pressure sore. The overall prevalence of pressure sore is close (or even inferior) to that observed in similar studies. However, variation between hospitals indicates that the current health services ability to deal with pressure sore is variable and often suboptimal. This evaluation is also supported by the limited adoption of adequate preventive and curative modalities.","2024":"","2025":"","2026":"","2027":"","2028":"","2029":"","2030":"In the last twenty years many large epidemiological studies have made efforts to collect material for biological specimen banks.

Technological know-how and experience in developing the production cycles were scarce. The early experience in occupational medicine had been abruptly interrupted by the war. The attitudes of the Fascist regime with regard to work protection were ambiguous: work was claimed to be a sacred source of the national wealth worth being safeguarded by the regime, but the workers' potential to antagonize the regime was seen as a constant danger to public order. This scenery is well exemplified by a case study: Viscose-Ray-on Industry developed in synchrony with Mussolini's seizing power, in the early 20s. Thanks to the initiative of some manufacturers, Italy acquired a predominant role in this sector and became the second producer after the United States. Huge factories were created and complex equipment was imported from abroad. No attention was paid to health and safety at work. The major source of risk was carbon disulphide, used as a solvent in the production of xanthogenate starting from cellulose, the raw material; which produces progressive conditions following prolonged exposure. The slowness and the substantial inertia of the Fascist regime in the protection of workers' health contrasted with the reality in the Unit States, Italy's main competitor of Italy in the production of rayon. In order to exploit masses of workers, Fascism, unlike Nazism, needed no inferior \"race\": social discrimination was equally effective. Modern industrial development in Italy relied on masses of semiliterate farmers originating first from the Venetian region and later (after World War II) from Southern Italy. Shortly after 1945, during the so-called \"Reconstruction-period\", health protection developed slowly and circumspectly. National agencies supposed to have a proactive role in prevention, such as ENPI, confirmed their role as consultant of the employers for hygiene and prevention matters. Only the workers' fight around 1970 overcame the concept of the Corporative state introduced by the Fascism.","2032":"","2033":"","2034":"Cystic Fibrosis is the most common life-shortening autosomal recessive disease of Caucasian population. The clinical expression of the disease is heterogeneous and the treatment of CF patients requires high qualification of medical and paramedical staff. In 1992 and 1993, in Italy, two national laws (104\/92 and 548\/93) were enacted in favour of people affected by CF. Data gathered in the Italian Registry for CF (started on 1.1.1988) allow us to monitor changes occurred in the age structure of patients and diagnosis methods. This also thanks to the laws mentioned above. Data here presented refer to 4,209 patients, 1,964 of whom were alive on 1.1.1988, and 2,245 were diagnosed afterwards. A remarkable increase in early diagnosis (within the 3rd month of life) was noticed (from 41% to 65%), together with an increasing percentage of subjects who underwent a neonatal screening program (+34%). An increase in late diagnoses is also apparent: the frequency for patients diagnosed after 18 years of life ranged from 8% to 12%. The proportion of adult patients is more than doubled between 1988 (17%) and 2000 (41%) and the number of patients over 30 is now about 400. 512 patients died during the study period. Median age at death increased from 14 (1988) to 22 (2000) years. This trend can be observed also for patients diagnosed within the first year of life. All these changes have contributed in modifying age structure of CF population. In late 80's, the latter was mostly composed by children, while now 50% of patients are adolescents or adults. Therefore, it is now necessary to involve specialists of adult diseases in CF care.","2035":"Mortality for malignant pleural neoplasms (1980-97) was studied in Broni (Pavia) and in the surrounding area in order to update previous studies indicating a high incidence of pleural mesothelioma, due to the presence of an asbestos-cement factory.

A significant increase was found in Broni (SMR 825, CI 95%: 604-1, 100, 46 observed). An increased risk of death from malignant pleural neoplasms was evident in both genders, especially in the most recent years, and in younger age groups; this increase in pleural neoplasm mortality also involves some neighbouring municipalities.","2036":"Aim of this paper is to describe the methodology adopted to build up an epidemiological surveillance system on the reproductive health of women employed by the Regional Health System (Hospital Division). The implementation of this system required the set up of a relational database, with personal and health data collected from the 1st January 1998 to the 31st December 1998. The goals of research were: to describe the phenomenon of unfavorable reproductive events such as: death at birth, low weight at birth, birth defects, spontaneous abortions, voluntary abortions (for reasons linked to the child's and the pregnant woman's health), premature births and post term births; to provide the basis for further analytical studies on working activities with exposures of particular interest (antiblastic drugs, ionizing radiations and ergonomic factors); to contribute to evaluate the state of enforcement of the specific legislation. We computed raw, age-specific and standardized rates of the studied population as far as natality, spontaneous and voluntary abortivity and birth defects are concerned. The results showed an increased number of spontaneous abortions. Investigations are still in progress and an estimate of risks associated with chemical and physical exposures in this sector will be determined.","2037":"AIDS surveillance systems, which have provided for many years useful information on HIV epidemic dynamics, are no longer useful for estimating the evolution of the HIV epidemic due to the effect of anti-retroviral treatments that have strongly improved survival of HIV-infected persons. To obtain reliable data on the HIV epidemic, some Italian provinces and regions (Lazio, Veneto, Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Trento, Modena) have set up local surveillance systems of the new HIV diagnoses. Aggregated data collected by these systems since 1988, show that the rapid spread of the infection in the eighties has been followed by a progressive decrease in the number of new diagnoses during the nineties; in more recent years this trend has levelled-off. The composition of cases by exposure category has greatly changed over time: in 1988 75.2% of cases were injecting drug users, whereas in 2000 58.5% of cases acquired the infection through sexual contacts. HIV incidence for the considered areas decreased from 19.2 per 100.000 inhabitants in 1992, to 6.7 per 100.000 inhabitants in 2000. Median age at diagnosis increased over time, from 27 years in 1988 to 34 years in 2000. The changed pattern of the HIV epidemic in Italy stresses the need of a nation-wide surveillance system for HIV infections aimed at allocation of adequate economic resources and planning specific prevention programmes.","2038":"","2039":"","2040":"","2041":"","2042":"","2043":"","2044":"The most recent European guidelines for coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention acknowledges that stress\/anxiety and depression are independent risk factors for CHD.

Furthermore, we observed a 40% of hypertensive patients among that only one half with controlled blood pressure level and 6.5% of diabetics or glucose intolerant among that 78% with uncontrolled basal glucose level. Finally, 40% of these subjects is affected by dyslipidaemia and 98% of them has uncontrolled plasma lipid levels. 16% of patients accounts more than one pharmacologically treatable CHD risk factor. A non-lethal CHD event in these patients could really increases the risk of non-compliance and of drug-drug interactions because of the high number of drugs needed to treat both kind of disease. Thus, we find unethical do not treat hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes in severe psychiatric patients.","2045":"During 1998-1999 a survey assessed the health impact of living in an area (Zona D) of the city of La Spezia (Liguria Region, Italy) characterised by industrial plants, urban waste disposal sites and incinerators, a coal-fired power-station and a heavily trafficked thoroughfare. One of the main results was an excess prevalence and incidence of self-reported anaemia among residents in area D compared to those of the control area (Zone C). Given the environmental lead pollution in Zone D due to the emissions of a lead processing plant active since 1930, and in order to confirm the validity of previous findings, was investieable the association between residence and blood lead levels, as well as the relationship between the latter and an anaemia-specific biomarker. We re-analysed personal, occupational and haematological data of 785 residents of La Spezia Province collected by the Liguria Environmental Protection Agency (ARPAL) during 1992 as part of a biological monitoring survey of the general population about the risk of lead intoxication. Subjects were geo-referenced by the 1992 residence address, and the haematocrit value was used as the anaemia-specific biomarker. Multiple regression analysis estimated the effect of residence on log-transformed lead blood levels, and to assess the relationship between the latter and haematocrit values. After adjusting for several potential confounding factors, residents from Zone D showed a 14% increase (95% IC = 6%-23%) in the blood lead median value estimated via the log-normal regression model compared to people living elsewhere. The excess became 27% (95% IC = 14%-41%) after 30 years of residence in the study area. Similar results were obtained by focusing analyses on students (n = 89, &lt; 18 years, non-smokers, non-drinkers). The same modelling highlighted a significant non-linear (parabolic) dose-response relationship between lead blood and haematocrit values. This trend is consistent with the findings of other Authors and might reveal an adverse haematological effect of lead values over 170, 0 microgram\/l. In conclusion, The results of this investigation strengthen the epidemiological evidence of the 1998-1999 survey.","2046":"Under appropriate conditions, the use of domestic and wild animals can help to reveal the presence of unknown chemical contaminants in the environment before they cause harm to humans or help identify the amount of exposure to known chemical contaminants. This paper examines how animals could contribute to improve knowledge of environmental health issues. The value of using animals to identify and monitor a wide variety of environmental hazard to human health and ecosystems is discussed. Some epidemiological and experimental approaches to use animals as environmental sentinels to detect hazards before they would be discovered with more traditional methods, human epidemiological studies or laboratory-animal experiments are described. The gaps in existing data that need to be addressed if animal sentinel data are to be used in human risk assessment are considered.","2047":"The aim of this study is to define the burden of pneumonia requiring hospitalization among adults in Lazio region from 1997 to 1999 and to describe the characteristic of community acquired (CAP), suspected nosocomial (NP) and in AIDS pneumonia. The data source is the hospital discharge register. 30517 incident episodes of pneumonia hospitalization occurred in the three years period, 20497 CAP, 9760 NP and 964 in AIDS of which 704 supposed to be acquired in hospital; the mean age is 65, 69 and 38 years respectively. Standardized hospitalization rates for CAP do not show a clear geographical pattern, while for NPs and in AIDS they are higher in the city of Rome than in the rest of the region. There are peaks of incidence during the winter for CAPs and NPs but not for AIDS. Only 20% of pneumonias have etiological diagnosis. The proportional analysis of aetiological agents shows: pneumococcus, pseudomonas, staphylococci and influenza; the most frequent comorbidities are: circulatory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancies and diabetes. 3.9% of individuals in the study with CAP or NP had more than one episode of pneumonia during the study period, for those with pneumonia in AIDS this percentage was 14.8. In-hospital lethality is 9.4%, 29.3% and 11.2% for CAP, NP and in AIDS, respectively. Data from the hospital discharge registers can be used to give a cheap and rapid glimpse to the epidemiology of pathologies frequently requiring hospitalisation neglected from more analytical surveillance systems or registries.","2048":"In the period 1988-1999, the Tuscan Mesothelioma Registry (ARTMM) recorded 436 cases of pleural malignant mesothelioma (MMP); 81% were males. The Tuscan MMP incidence rate (age standardized on European population; per 100,000 per year), was 0.97 in 1988-1993, 1.64 in 1994-1999 for males; 0.22 and 0.23 for females, respectively. In the period 1988-1999 the Tuscan Mortality Registry (RMR) recorded 676 pleural cancer (TMP) deaths (ICD IX 163; 464 in males). In the periods 1988-1993 and 1994-1999 Tuscan TMP mortality rate (per 100,000 per year) was 1.54; 1.70 for men; 0.46 and 0.53 for women, respectively. The highest incidence and mortality rates for males were recorded in Massa Carrara (MMP incidence in the period 1994-1999: 5.20) e Livorno (MMP incidence in the period 1994-1999: 4.64) provinces. In order to study differences between incidence and mortality for males, an analysis of distribution of incident MMP cases and TMP deaths by municipality in Tuscany was carried out. It is usually assumed for projections of MMP mortality that the ratio of MMP mortality to TMP mortality is 1:1. However, in order to evaluate more precisely projections of MMP mortality, the exact ratio was calculated for men. In the period 1994-1999, 82% (154\/188) of the male MMP deaths were correctly coded as TMP deaths in the RMR; 60% (154\/256) of male TMP deaths were definite MMP cases, as they were recorded in ARTMM. The ratio of MMP mortality to TMP mortality is, therefore, 0.73:1 (0.60\/0.82) for males in Tuscany.","2049":"","2050":"","2051":"","2052":"","2053":"","2054":"The Italian Ministry of Environment identified 15 areas throughout the country as at \"high risk of environmental crisis\". The areas host industrial activities that may entail noxious exposures, through occupation and the environment. An epidemiological descriptive study on the residents was carried out using routinely collected mortality data. Mortality data for the period 1981-1994 at the level of municipality were analysed, for around 30 causes of death for both sexes. Methods for small area analysis and disease mapping were used. Rates and SMRs (also adjusted for socio-economic factors) were tabulated for residents and restricted to people born locally. The geographical distribution within areas, time trends, and birth cohort effects were also investigated. Results for some specific areas indicate excesses that can be ascribed to known exposures. The mortality of the residents of areas taken together is substantially higher than expected; significant excesses are more than can be predicted by chance. Due to the heterogenous nature of the risk factors, no common patterns of mortality were observed, but for example 50% of the SMRs for total mortality calculated in the areas, for men and women separately, were significantly greater than unity, and so were 37% of the SMRs for all cancers and 30% for lung cancer. Relative risks were in general of small magnitude, but as populations are large (the areas include some 3.5 million people) and mortality is increased for common causes, absolute numbers of excess deaths were large. These results indicate the occurrence of important risk factors, some of which are related to the industrial activities, but more detailed data are needed for the identification of corrective public health actions.","2055":"","2056":"","2057":"","2058":"","2059":"","2060":"Cutaneous melanoma incidence rates are rapidly increasing worldwide, including in the Mediterranean countries. Sunlight exposure has been associated with melanoma, but the mechanisms of UV radiation-induced carcinogenesis is still largely unknown. In mammalian cells, UV radiation induces DNA damage that can be repaired mostly by the nucleotide excision repair system. We summarize here the results of a case-control study conducted at the Bufalini Hospital in Cesena, Italy to assess host and environmental risk factors for melanoma. We recruited 183 incident cutaneous melanoma cases and 179 controls selected predominantly among partners or close friends of the cases. Presence of dysplasticlatypical nevi (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.4-7.4), low propensity to tan (OR: 2.4; 95% CI 1.1-5.0), light skin (OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4-12.1), and light eye color (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.2) were the strongest risk factors for melanoma in this population. A chart identifying melanoma risk associated with multiple combinations of these factors is presented. We used the host-cell reactivation assay on subjects' lymphocytes to measure individual DNA repair capacity (DRC) after UV-induced DNA damage. Subjects with low tanning ability and low DRC had a higher melanoma risk (OR: 8.6; 95% CI: 2.7-27.5) than those with higher tanning ability and high DRC. Subjects with dysplastic nevi and low DRC had a higher risk (OR: 6.7; 95% CI: 2.4-18.6) than those lacking dysplastic nevi and with high DRC. These results may help identify high-risk subjects in the Mediterranean populations who would the benefit from preventive measures.","2061":"Smoking cessation can be considered the most effective strategy to reduce smoking related mortality at medium term. The aim of this study is to conduct an overview of systematic reviews of effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in the general population. Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library for the years 1990-march 2001 have been searched for those systematic reviews of primary studies evaluating the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in the general population, adult smokers. The outcome measure was abstinence from smoking at 6 months after the start of the intervention. Thirty papers were found, 15 Cochrane reviews and 15 other systematic reviews. The present overview focuses on Cochrane reviews, because they were more recent and followed a standardised methodology. The interventions which proved to be successful were: the simple medical advice, a structured intervention from nurses, individual counselling, group therapy, nicotine replacement therapy, and bupropion. There is not enough evidence yet that one strategy is better than another. Even though there is evidence that it is possible to quit smoking without any intervention, we can recommend that every physician register the smoking habits of his patients, encourage smokers to quit and offer all the available effective strategies.","2062":"Tremolite asbestos in rocks surfacing by natural ground erosion as well as originating from construction activities in the Upper Susa Valley (Piedmont, Italy) was recently reported. We investigated the spatial distribution of cases of pleural (ICD Rev 9 163) and peritoneal cancers (ICD Rev 9 158.8 and 158.9) in that area. Mortality and hospital discharge statistics were analyzed by municipality of residence respectively for the periods 1980-98 and 1995-99. Kernel and empirical bayesian estimators of standardized proportional mortality ratios (SPMR) were computed in circular areas of 25, 50, 75, and 100 km distance from Sauze d'Oulx. Pleural and peritoneal malignancies were found to occur in excess in this town and in the surrounding municipalities.

The present study describes the geographical distribution of 1.483 cases in men, notified to INAIL (and subsequently confirmed) during 1984-1992. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for the 93 Italian provinces. In addition, standardised incidence ratio (SIR) were computed, comparing the number of observed cases to the number of expected cases on the basis of age specific rates in the large geographical Italian areas (Northeast, Northwest, Centre and South and islands). Empirical Bayes estimates applying the Poisson-Gamma model were also estimated. The geographical distribution of standardised incidence ratios revealed a high excess risk for the province of Gorizia, Livorno, Massa Carrara, La Spezia, Trieste, Alessandria, Caltanissetta and a lower, but still significant, excess risk for the province of Siracusa, Ancona, Napoli, Genova, Reggio Emilia, Brindisi, Bergamo, Arezzo, Taranto, Pavia, Messina, Lecco and Varese. This study suggests the possibility to use the insurance files on asbestosis in order to estimate risks in Italy and to compare geographical clusters. Identification of provinces with significant excess number of compensated cases for asbestosis underscore the need for more detailed surveys aimed to detect conditions correlated with asbestos exposure and identifying persisting environmental pollution. Detailed enquiries are needed in particular in those provinces where excesses cannot be explained by current knowledge on circumstances of the presence of asbestos in the workplace.","2073":"When inhaled, chlorine is a highly irritating gas that can damage larger airways as well as distal lung structure. We examined the short-term respiratory effects of acute chlorine inhalation during a swimming pool accident. On October 22, 1998, an emission of chlorine vapours occurred in the chlorinating maintenance procedures room of a recreational center in Rome. A total of 282 subjects (134 children) inhaled hydrogen chloride and sodium hypochlorite. Most people received bronchodilators and cortisone at the emergency room; five children were hospitalised. A telephone follow-up was taken on 260 (92.2%) subjects to obtain information about duration of exposure (less than 3 minutes, 3-5 minutes, more than 5 minutes), intensity of exposure (not at all\/a little, a fair amount, a lot), and acute respiratory symptoms. A total of 236 (90.7% of the target) individuals underwent clinical examinations, which took place 15-30 days after the accident. Lung function was measured in 184 people (82 children) after 15-30 days. A multiple linear regression was run to test the association between chlorine exposure and lung function, separately in adults and in children. Acute respiratory symptoms occurred among 66.7% adults and 71.6% children. The incidence rates were highest among those who had chronic respiratory disease and had a longer duration of exposure. In about 30% of the subjects, respiratory symptoms persisted 15-30 days after the accident. Lung function levels were reduced among those who reported high intensity of exposure in comparison to those who reported low exposure, both in children and in adults (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV1, ml differences: -109 (CI 95%: -310, 93) and -275 (CI 95%: -510, -40). Given high prevalence of potential exposed people, findings from this study should alert public health authority about the possible clinical consequences.","2074":"One of the most important aspect of any surveillance system is completeness. We conducted an evaluation of the completeness of the AIDS surveillance system (SSAIDS) of Lazio region. We estimated the underreporting of AIDS cases in SSAIDS of Lazio in the period 1996-1998 through a linkage with the regional Hospital Information System (HIS) for the same years. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the relative risk (Odds Ratios--OR) of being unreported by demographic and clinical characteristics. A total of 56 cases had not been reported in the period 1996-1998, corresponding to 3.6% of underreporting. The risk of not being reported was associated with undetermined value of CD4 at diagnosis of AIDS (OR 15.40), unknown modality of exposure (OR 3.15) and with AIDS defining illness at diagnosis (ADI) as mycobacteriosis (OR 11.65), encephalopaties (OR 4.47) and toxoplasmosis (OR 8.67). Differences were also observed by clinical centre of diagnosis. In conclusion, the degree of underreporting is lower in our region than in other countries and the SSAIDS has a high completeness in Lazio. In agreement with other studies, underreporting is more frequent for cases with undermined value of CD4 at diagnosis of AIDS and unknown modality of exposure. The results regarding ADI need further investigation.","2075":"The paper describes 1980-1995 trends in social differences in reproductive outcomes and infant mortality in Piedmont, Italy. By means of a logistic model, risk differences by mothers'educational level were calculated for low birthweight, stillbirth, neonatal, postneonatal and infant mortality in four time periods (1980-83, 1984-87, 1988-91, 1992-95). Odds ratios of low birthweight for children born to mothers in the lowest educational class compared to the highest are slightly increasing (from 1.43 to 1.57), while those between highest and intermediate educational groups are small and steady. After adjustment for selected confounding variables, for which data were available, these differences are confirmed. Differences in risk for neonatal mortality between highest and intermediate educational groups have strongly reduced from the beginning of the Nineties, while they have increased between highest and lowest classes. Adjusting for birthweight, differences disappear. Postneonatal mortality is strongly related to low educational level and differences are widening: OR for lowest educational level has increased from 1.96 to 2.60. Even within a fairly good health system, social differences are present. Hospital assistance has always been equitable to all new-borns; social differences generate in the environment where pregnant women and infants live. Due to the high attributable risk on infant mortality, reduction in social differences in low birthweight should be considered a priority in public health policy in Piedmont.","2076":"","2077":"","2078":"","2079":"","2080":"","2081":"","2082":"","2083":"","2084":"","2085":"The present paper focuses on the Italian registries: their actual achievements, future developments and the possible critical states.

Comparing mortality rates across hospitals requires adjustment for patient risks before making inferences about quality of care based on patient outcomes. Therefore it is essential to dispose of well performing severity measures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the All Patient Refined DRG system to predict inpatient mortality for congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia and ischemic stroke. Administrative records were used in this analysis. We used two statistics methods to assess the ability of the APR-DRG to predict mortality: the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (referred to as the c-statistic) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The database for the study included 19,212 discharges for stroke, pneumonia, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure from fifteen hospital participating in the Italian APR-DRG Project. A multivariate analysis was performed to predict mortality for each condition in study using age, sex and APR-DRG risk mortality subclass as independent variables. Inpatient mortality rate ranges from 9.7% (pneumonia) to 16.7% (stroke). Model discrimination, calculated using the c-statistic, was 0.91 for myocardial infarction, 0.68 for stroke, 0.78 for pneumonia and 0.71 for congestive heart failure. The model calibration assessed using the Hosmer-Leme-show test was quite good. The performance of the APR-DRG scheme when used on Italian hospital activity records is similar to that reported in literature and it seems to improve by adding age and sex to the model. The APR-DRG system does not completely capture the effects of these variables. In some cases, the better performance might be due to the inclusion of specific complications in the risk-of-mortality subclass assignment.","2088":"This study applies a method for the estimation and temporal projection of cancer incidence. The estimates are disaggregated to the Local Health Units; they refer to Tuscany for the year 2000 and to the incidence of cancer at three specific sites (lung, breast, prostate). The mortality data derive from the Regional Mortality Registry and the incidence data from the Tuscan Cancer Registry, which includes two provinces: Florence and Prato. The choice of method is discussed and a validation of the estimates obtained, using the incidence data observed in the province of Prato. The estimates and the temporal projections are required for accurate health planning, and they present the means to overcome health planning based on the historical data of medical care only. We suggest that appropriate communication of these estimates should address their limits, due to the uncertainty of the temporal prediction on the one hand and the possibility (only partially verifiable) of the violation of the assumptions on which any method for the estimation of cancer incidence is based.","2089":"In Italy, as in other countries, an apparently increasing number of subjects is reporting a variety of subjective symptoms that the subjects themselves refer to the exposure to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields (EMF) from nearby electric appliances, cellular phones, antennas, etc. Terms like electricity hypersensitivity (EHS), EMF hypersensitivity, or other similar, are frequently adopted to describe such symptoms; nevertheless, up to now, these terms are not entered the medical terminology. No accepted diagnostic criteria or procedures for the diagnosis of EHS are currently available. Furthermore, apart from the subject's self-attribution of the symptoms to EMFs, no direct cause-effect relationship between EHS symptoms and electromagnetic fields has been proved; additionally, evidence of a possible pathogenetic mechanism is lacking. In this paper, two cases developing symptoms of EHS ascribed to overhead power line in the proximity of their house are discussed. Nervous system (asthenia, depression, paraesthesias etc.), cardiovascular system (cardiac palpitations) and the skin (tingling, itching, etc.), are mostly (but not exclusively) involved. Based on available scientific knowledge, the rationale for an approach to subjects claiming for EHS is discussed.

Cytologic screening programs have contributed to the decline of cervical cancer mortality in Europe and the United States. Long-term screening programs remain, however, outside the reach of the poorest countries, where 80% of deaths for cervical carcinoma occurs.

We recorded 118 new cases of cancer (96% microscopically verified) corresponding to a rate, age-standardized to the world population, of 162.3 (standard error SE = 15.0) per million person-years. The diagnostic group with the highest rate was that of carcinomas (54.5; SE = 8.7; 40 cases). The diagnosis was reached at hospitals in the province of Trieste for 107 cases, with a median time of nine days (25th-75th percentile = 5-23) between admission and diagnosis. Among patients with leukaemias, lymphomas and brain tumours, this interval was longer than in children affected by the same neoplasms. One girl with cancer of the uterine cervix refused all treatment. The therapy of the other 117 cases were co-ordinated by 29 different departments of hospitals located in Trieste for 86 cases, in other Italian hospitals for 26 cases and in European hospitals for five cases. On the other hand, out of 123 childhood cancers 107 were co-ordinated by three departments in Trieste, seven by other Italian hospitals and nine by foreign hospitals. The 10-year survival probabilities of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas were higher than those of patients aged 15-24 years: 66.7% (SE = 9.1) vs 14.3% (SE = 13.2) and 77.8% (SE = 13.9) vs 40.0% (SE = 21.9), respectively.","2100":"This paper describes the activity, the sources of informations, methods and results of the \"Emilia-Romagna Mesothelioma Registry\" (ReM).

Most cases (n = 286) concerned pleura. Other observed localizations were: peritoneum (n = 30), tunica vaginalis testis (n = 4) and pericardium (n = 3). Most of the cases were reported by the Institutes of Pathology and Occupational Health and by the Safety Services (respectively the 62% and the 18%). 87% of all the cases were histologically, 8% TC, 4% radiologically and only 1% clinically confirmed. The regional incidence rate (for 10(5) person-years, age standardized on the 1991 Italian population), has been estimated to be 1.98 in males and 0.88 in females.

Objective of the study is the description of the outpatient care system of Lazio region and of the main characteristics of outpatient clinics, through indicators obtained using data from the Outpatient Care Information System (SIAS) for 1999. Outpatient clinics were classified into three categories: ASL managed clinics, private clinics and hospital trusts. Absolute and relative density of supply (respectively DAO and DRO) were used as indicators of clinics distribution in the regional area. Number of specialties, average procedure weight and volume of procedures performed were used as indicators of complexity. Absolute density of supply (DAO = n. of dispatch points\/population) is generally high, and a large and statistically significant variability is observed (p &lt; 0.001). The relative density (i.e. the correlation coefficient between DAO and population density) is positive overall (r = 0.43), but it is higher within the private sector (r = 0.62) independently from provider category. Statistically significant differences were observed among categories of providers in terms of average number of specialties (ASL managed: 9.9; private clinics: 1.7; hospital trusts: 16.1), average weight (ASL managed: 1.1; private clinics: 0.9; hospital trusts: 1.3) and average volume of procedures supplied (ASL managed: 35.000; private clinics: 59.000; hospital trusts: 282.000).

Several hints suggest that this degenerative disease is linked to western diet, characterised by excessive dietary intake of sugar, refined carbohydrates (with high glycaemic index), and animal product (with high content of saturated fats), and decreased intake of unrefined seeds--cereals, legumes, and oleaginous seeds--and other vegetables (with high content of fibres, vitamins, polyphenols and other antioxidant substances, phytoestrogens) and, in several populations, of sea food (rich in n-3 fatty acids). It has been hypothesised, in fact, that AD, may be promoted by insulin resistance, decreased endothelial production of nitric oxide, free radical excess, inflammatory metabolites, homocysteine, and oestrogen deficiency. AD, therefore, could theoretically be prevented (or delayed) by relatively simple dietary measures aimed at increasing insulin sensitivity (trough reduction of refined sugars and saturated fats from meat and dairy products), the ratio between n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (e.g. from fish and respectively seed oils), antioxidant vitamins, folic acid, vitamin B6, phytoestrogens (vegetables, whole cereals, and legumes, including soy products), vitamin B12 (bivalve molluscs, liver), and Cr, K, Mg, and Si salts. This comprehensive improvement of diet would fit with all the mechanistic hypotheses cited above.

The findings show that the women who accept chemical preparations or to modify their dietary habits present different personality traits from those who refuse to adhere. One should ask oneself if the lack of homogeneity of the samples with a different concentration of psycho-social factors can alter the efficacy of a cancer prevention program. During chemoprevention studies, in which a high compliance could bring about a redundancy of experience of sickness, in coherence with our goal of health protection, we think it is necessary to supply psycho-social support which tempers any experience of physical, psychological and inter-personal discomfort in the healthy women.

This cancer has an unusual age distribution with one peak in incidence in young adults (aged 20-39) and a second peak in over 60. On the basis of the Italian Bureau of Statistics, mortality rate was higher in northern regions of the country compared to southern ones, up to the beginning of the 1980's. However, the progressive decline in mortality in all regions eliminated the geographical differences in recent years. Incidence rates obtained from the existing cancer Registries, confirm a strong geographical gradient, with higher rates in the North (ex. 5.1\/100,000 in Parma in 1988-92) than in the South (ex. 1.1\/100,000 in Ragusa in 1988-92). The comparison between incidence rates of two recent periods (1983-87 and 1988-92), showed an increase in most of the provinces for which data were available. The age distribution curve showed that testicular cancer occurs after puberty, with a peak in incidence among 30-34 year olds, and after the age of 60. These observations suggest the possible causative role of some environmental exposures. Epidemiological studies have found an association between some occupational exposures in industrial and agricultural settings and testicular cancer. Moreover some studies have found an association between parental occupation and testicular cancer in the offspring. However, the aetiology of testicular cancer is still poorly understood.","2109":"Cause specific mortality was investigated in a cohort of insulators employed by a company which operated in various parts of Italy. Follow-up covered the years 1960-1996. The cohort, which included 893 subjects, was derived from company files of relatively poor quality, which resulted in a high rate of lost to follow-up (10.1%) and of deaths with unknown cause (12.4%). The mortality experience of the cohort was contrasted with that of the Italian population. Overall mortality (SMR 141, 90% CI 118-167, 97 observed), and cancer mortality (SMR 165, 90% CI 123-216, 38 observed) were significantly increased. Among neoplasms, significant increases were observed for lung cancer (SMR 202, 90% CI 124-311, 15 observed), pleural neoplasms (SMR 2667, CI 90% 911-6103, 4 observed), and peritoneal neoplasms (SMR 1853, 90% CI 329-5832, 2 observed). The excess mortality for lung cancer was especially pronounced in subjects with latency time longer than ten years (SMR 237.1, 90% CI 140-377, 13 observed).","2110":"The study describes the mortality of 417 workers employed in a asbestos-cement plant, located in Bari, Puglia, Southern Italy. Follow up started on February 1st 1972. The vital status and cause of death were ascertained at 1995. The mortality experience of the Apulian population was used as comparison. Using 90% confidence limits (CLs), a significant increase in mortality was observed in our cohort from: all causes of death (SMR 118, CL 100-139), pneumoconiosis (SMR 14810, CL 10298-20683), all types of cancer (SMR 139, CL 105-181), lung (SMR 191, CL 126-277), pleural (SMR 1560 CL 431-4081) and peritoneum (SMR 1705, CL 303-5367) malignant neoplasms. In our cohort, the discrepancy between observed and expected mortality for lung and pleural cancer occurred 30 years after the first exposure, after 40 years for all neoplasms and peritoneum cancer. Under the Cox regression model, lung cancer SMR showed a curvilinear trend along time since first exposure, the peak being detected at 35 years. Finally, SMRs from our cohort were compared to a previously described cohort including workers from the same plant compensated for asbestosis by INAIL.","2111":"","2112":"","2113":"","2114":"","2115":"","2116":"","2117":"","2118":"","2119":"","2120":"","2121":"","2122":"A survey was carried out in a pharmaceutical industry, in order to know the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the workplace, and attitudes of workers toward workplace smoking restrictions and bans. In the three plants of the industry (Bergamo, Milan, Reggello-Florence) workers were exposed to ETS in every workplace areas, except for the production area, even if there were no-smoking warning notices in the plants. Non-smokers were more favorable than smokers about the introduction of workplace restrictions on smoking. In order to decrease exposure to ETS, it would be desirable to develop workplace smoking restrictions or bans, effective and low-cost interventions.","2123":"Short-term measurement of suspended particulate matter has been recently made possible since the release of laser-operating portable instruments. Data of a pilot study of field evaluation of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) with a portable instrument are reported. We analysed the concentrations of total suspended particle (TSP) and of the fine particles PM10, PM7, PM2.5 and PM1 released indoor from a single cigarette, and their levels inside smoking- and non-smoking-areas of a restaurant. The results indicate that ETS creates high level indoor particulate pollution, with concentrations of PM10 exceeding air quality standards. This kind of field evaluation could allow a more careful assessing of short-term exposure to ETS and its relevance to public health.","2124":"","2125":"","2126":"Household and workplace exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with various deleterious health effects. We evaluated the health impact of ETS in Italy. We considered only those health conditions for which systematic quantitative reviews were available. We used relative risks from the reviews while data on the proportion of the Italian population exposed to ETS were derived from national statistics or from ad hoc studies. A total of 2.033 newborns per year are of low birth weight (&lt; 2500 grams) in Italy (7.9%) because of maternal exposure to ETS during pregnancy. There are 87 sudden infant deaths (16.9%) due to post natal maternal active smoking. 21.3% of acute respiratory infections during the first two years of life are due to parental smoking (about 77.000 children); 27.000 cases of asthma (9.1%), 48.000 cases of chronic respiratory symptoms, 64.000 cases of middle ear effusions among children and adolescents are due to parental smoking exposure. The annual estimates of mortality from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease due to ETS exposure from the spouse are 221 and 1896, respectively. Workplace exposure is associated with 324 lung cancer deaths and 235 deaths from ischemic heart disease. Although these estimate are based on several assumptions and they have large uncertainties, the results underline the need and the urgency of public health measures to reduce ETS exposure in the household and in the workplaces in Italy.","2127":"Work-related deaths are important \"sentinel events\" of unsuccessful prevention. In Italy the most exhaustive source of such events is the National Fund for Occupational Diseases (INAIL), but the amount of cases from this source seems to be underestimated due to the fact that it refers only to cases occurred to subjects insured by the Fund. A previous survey estimated the real amount of work-related deaths 10-20% higher than that quantified by INAIL. This study evaluated the contribute of the two most important sources (INAIL and the Regional Mortality Registry of Tuscany-RMR) in estimating the number of these cases in Tuscany in the period 1992-96. Cases were identified from each source, and then it was applied a capture-recapture method to size the cases from work-related accident different from road accidents. RMR appeared to be the most exhaustive source with 72.3% completeness versus 56.4% completeness of INAIL source. Nevertheless the last one must be considered the primary source, more specific and accurate, and since few years also timely, than any other one. Work-related deaths from road accident represent 35.9% of INAIL cases but they are difficult to be identified from RMR and were not considered in this study. In conclusion the mortality data should be used for an epidemiologic surveillance system on work-related deaths not due to road accident in order to identify cases occurred to subjects not insured by INAIL (and therefore not defined by the Fund). These deaths are also important in terms of public health. Cases identified only from RMR, occurred in Tuscany in 1992-96, were 155: the vast majority occurred to farmers (mainly pensioners, and due to caterpillar upsetting), to bricklayers, to railway workers, to soldiers and to entrepreneurs.","2128":"","2129":"","2130":"This paper is a commentary to the MISA study (Meta-analysis of Italian studies on short-term effects of air pollution).

Vatican Radio, a very powerful radio station transmitting all over the world (up to 600 kW) is located in Santa Maria di Galeria, in the northern suburbs of the city of Rome. Electric field measurements in the proximity of the radio station ranged between 1.5 and 25 V\/m. In the 10 km area around the station, with 60.182 residents (1999), leukaemia mortality among adults (&gt; 14 years, 40 cases) in the period 1987-98 and childhood leukaemia incidence in the period 1987-99 (8 cases) were evaluated. The analysis (Stone's conditional test) was performed computing observed and expected cases (reference: population of Rome) in 5 bands of increasing radius (2 km width). The risk of childhood leukaemia was higher than expected within 6 km from the station (Standardized Incidence Ratio = 217; 95% Confidence Interval 99-405). Stone's test showed a significant decrease in risk with increasing distance both for male adult mortality (p-value = 0.03) and for childhood incidence (p-value = 0.04). A Score test, showed a significant decrease in risk of childhood incidence as function of the distance.

They were first published in 1982, based on IARC Monographs. List A included industries, processes and occupations definitely entailing carcinogenic risk, list B those probably\/possibly carcinogenic. In 1995 the lists had been updated. We carried out a further update, reviewing IARC Monographs Volumes 62-75, focusing on Group 1, 2 A, and 2 B agents, and coded the lists according to widely used classifications: ISIC Rev. 2, ISIC Rev. 3, NACE Rev. 1, and ISTAT ATECO 1991 (for economic activities); ILO-ISCO 1968 and ISTAT-Classificazione delle professioni 1991 (for occupations). In order to evaluate temporal and geographical variations in attributable risk, exposure assessment must be performed consistently across different studies and standard tools to identify exposures, such as the one we propose here, are needed. The lists can also help to develop maps of industrial activities entailing carcinogenic risk at local, regional, and national level, and to identify economic activities that deserve priority action to control occupational exposures to carcinogens. The classifications were originally developed for economic and demographic purposes, and some exposure circumstances cannot be coded with sufficient specificity. This applies to productions or processes (i.e.: PVC production) that could be classified only by codes corresponding to wide groups of economic activities and\/or occupations: in these instances we associated no code, so as not to inflate the estimates of exposed workers. As a consequence, however, certain exposures are not represented in the coded version of the lists. Even keeping in mind such limitations, coding makes the lists easier to apply, and increases the comparability of studies on lung cancer and occupation, as well as of surveys on exposure prevalence.","2140":"In conducting scientific research, certain ethical standards must be applied, not only in the actual performance of the research, in particular the choice of appropriate methodology, but also in writing about science.

From the selected records, every day of the hospital stay, including both the admission and the discharge, were evaluated, so that the studied days were a total of 18,683. Only 32% of the nursing records had a global assessment of patient situation on admission. A medical diagnosis was observed in 84% of the cases, but a nursing diagnosis was absent in over 99.5% of the charts. During stay most notes were related to medical treatment and visits. Nursing notes were lacking in 32% of turns, while \"nothing to report\" was recorded in another 15.5% of cases. A nursing care plan was present in a minority of records. A final evaluation of planned nursing interventions was reported in approximately 5% of the charts. Nursing care plans were updated during stay in less than one tenth of cases.

The first 100 cases of neoplasm of the urinary bladder incident in the years 1993-1994 were identified from the files of each registry. The original pathology reports were made available. A working group considered eligible to the study 699 cases of microscopically confirmed transitional carcinoma (ICD-O morphology code 812-813). Using the ENCR criteria, each of these was classified according to morphology code (8120 vs. 8130) and behaviour (1\/ uncertain, \/2 non-invasive, 3\/ invasive). Information of tumour behaviour was classified as follows: (i) present, when expressly stated in the original report, (ii) deducible, when not expressly stated but suggested by the pathologist's description, and (iii) absent, when impossible to determine on the basis of the original pathology report. The working group classification of tumour behaviour and the classification of the registry of origin were compared. There was a full concordance in the case of complete agreement on the morphology code, and partial concordance when only the invasive or non-invasive behaviour code was agreed upon. As much as 92.5% cases were microscopically confirmed. Tumour behaviour was expressly stated in the original report of 69.2% cases, not stated but suggested by the pathologist's description in 21.2% cases, and impossible to determine in 9.6%. Agreement between the panel and the registry of origin was complete in 71.2% cases and partial in 12.3% while there was a complete discordance in 16.5% cases.

A quality check was performed on the registration techniques, assuring that they met the international standards and yielded correct data, and on follow up methods. Difficulties concerning the assessment of certain tumours emerged from international debates. Thus, registries were requested to fill in a questionnaire to thoroughly examine differences in the management of tumour cases with difficult biological and clinical assessment (e.g. in situ and urinary bladder tumours). Some discrepancies in registration methods were observed. The most significant problems concern urinary bladder tumours, especially in coding procedures of in situ and uncertain behaviour tumours and the proportion of short-term survivors proportions for some geographical areas. Good quality and comparability indices were generally observed (microscopic verification, follow up management). In conclusions, quality standards in cancer registration appear good and allow for a correct geographical comparability. Some important problems regard only a small number of cancer sites (namely urinary bladder), whose results should be examined with caution.","2172":"This article shows the survival trends of childhood cancers diagnosed from 1978 to 1994 in Italy.

When cause-specific survival was calculated including among the deceased only those subjects whose death certificate reported strictly the same neoplasm as cause of death (three digits ICD-9), very good agreement between the two methods was found for stomach, lung, and skin melanoma and a good agreement was found for female breast. For cancer of the colon and rectum, in order to obtain similar estimates, deaths coded as caused by cancer in other sites of the large bowel and partially the not specified intestine had to be included. For cancer of the cervix and corpus uteri, in order to obtain similar estimates, but with cause-specific remaining higher than the relative estimates, deaths coded as not specified uteri cancer had to be included. In conclusion, cause-specific survival may be used also with overall mortality data, providing the death causes by cancers most susceptible to misclassification are to be included.

A number of large planned meta-analyses (in which methods for data retrieval and processing are commonly planned a priori for all participating centers) are on going both in the US and in Europe. The National Mortality, Morbidity and Air Pollution Study included data from 90 US cities, whereas APHEA (Air Pollution and Health, a European Approach) considers data from about 30 european cities. The present paper summarizes methods and findings of MISA, a meta-analysis of data from 8 Italian cities. It belongs to an ad hoc supplement of Epidemiologia &amp; Prevenzione (Epidemiol Prev 2001; 25 (2) Suppl: 1-72), the official Journal of the Italian Association of Epidemiology, which contains a full description of the study. MISA was launched on March 2000, within the project \"Statistics, Environment and Health\" (GRASPA), funded by the Italian Ministry of Education. Additional support was given by the Authorities of the 8 participating cities (from North to South: Turin, Milan, Verona, Ravenna, Bologna, Florence, Rome and Palermo). DAILY HEALTH DATA: Deaths certificate and hospital admission data have been collected respectively from the Local Health Authority and regional files. The same programme for retrieval of data on selected hospital admissions for acute conditions was used in the 8 cities. Main data are summarized in Table 1. DAILY CONCENTRATION OF POLLUTANTS: Most data were obtained from Regional Environmental Protection Agencies, which are responsible for environmental monitoring since 1993. Verona, Palermo and Milan (1990-94) data were obtained from local sources. Monitors with more than 25% of missing data were excluded. Meteorological data were collected by the same monitors and completed with data from monitors situated in the suburbs or (in Milan and Bologna) in the airport. The monitors were selected by a group of experts to ensure comparability. For SO2 and NO2 daily averages of hourly measurements were used, whereas concentrations of ozone and CO were estimated as the maximum 8 hours moving average. Total suspended particulate or PM10 were measured as 24 hours deposition. All analyses used the whole range of observed values (Table 2). Daily data were considered as missing when more than 25% of hourly data were not available. Missing data in one monitor were imputed as average of data from the remaining monitors weighted by the ratio between the specific monitor's year average and the general year average of all the selected city monitors. Missing data in one day were imputed as average of four days (preceding and following day, the same day of the previous and following weeks). In the city of Florence and Palermo PM10 concentrations were available. For the other cities we applied a conversion factor from PTS to PM10 (0.6 for Turin and 0.8 for all the others) estimated through validation studies. Ozone concentrations were used only where background monitors were available (Turin, Verona, Bologna and Florence) and limited to the warm season (May through September). A common protocol for the city-specific analyses was defined on the basis of a structured exploratory analysis. The adopted basic model was a Generalized Additive Model for Poisson data. Effect estimates were age-adjusted (0-64, 65-74, 75+) and formal tests of interaction pollutant-age were conducted. In the first two age groups, indicator variables for seasonality were specified, and cubic splines with fixed number of degree of freedom were specified for the last age group and for all age groups for the morbidity data. Model adequacy was checked by residual analysis and inspection of the partial autocorrelation function. In a sensitivity analysis non linear pollutant effects were considered and overdispersed [table: see text] transitional models were fitted; the analysis was conducted for all lags 0-3 and some distributed lags (0-1, 1-2, 0-3); no multipollutant models were fitted. The same model was fitted to the city data. No model selection was done: Table 3 describes the steps in model building. In the meta-analysis, for each outcome, the estimates for each pollutant and for each city were combined using fixed and random effects models. Heterogeneity of effects was tested according to DerSimonian and Laird. Results were checked using a hierarchical bayesian model, which was used to investigate heterogeneity across cities in a meta-regression phase. Non informative priors were used. Posterior distributions of parameters of interest have been obtained with WinBUGS. 10,000 iterations (excluding [table: see text] the first 2000) were retained, while for the meta-regression 100,000 iterations (excluding the first 4000) were stored. To approximate the marginal posteriors only one sample out of five were used. Achieved convergence was assessed using the Gelman and Rubin approach. In the meta-regression the models specified were the following: [formula: see text] i denotes city, j calendar period (1990-1994; 1995-1999). The first model includes only period as effect modifier, while the second model other potential variables. The ui terms (which do not vary with j) represent city specific random effects. For each pollutant, the meta-analysis detected a statistically significant association with mortality for natural causes. But for ozone, positive associations were commonly found for death and hospital admissions for both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Indeed, the only estimates whose lower 95% confidence limit bore a negative sign regarded the association between PM10 and mortality from respiratory diseases. Ozone in the warm season was positively and significantly associated with daily mortality and mortality for cardiovascular diseases whereas other estimates did not reach statistical significance and some were negative (only lag 0-1 for external comparability are reported in Table 4). Risks were highest (up to 4%) for respiratory conditions (Table 4). They were more pronounced at lag 1-2 for mortality, and at lag 0-3 for hospital admissions. Age was an effect modifier for mortality, the elderly being more susceptible. In the random effect meta-analysis, at lag 1-2, excess risks for unit increase of the pollutants at age 75+ and at age 0-64 were respectively: 4.9% and -0.4% for SO2, 1.7% and 0.6% for NO2; 2.3% and 0.2% for CO. Corresponding figures for PM10 at lag 0-1 were 1.1% and 0.2%. The effect of PM10 on mortality [table: see text] was greater during the warm season (2.8% vs 0.8%). A complete analysis is reported in the Italian text. Here we provide some details on the effects of PM10, about which the residual heterogeneity across cities was highest (Table 4). In addition, the epidemiological evidence on the hazards from this fraction of particulate matter is more controversial. Table 5 reports the excess risk estimated through the meta-analysis in 1995-99 for a 10 micrograms\/m3 increase of PM10 for some outcomes. Proper prior distributions (overdispersed normal and inverse gamma) were adopted in the final bayesian analyses. The sensitivity of results to the choice of the priors were investigated (we defined proper and improper uniform, student's t), obtaining comparable results. Total natural mortality was significantly heterogeneous across cities (Q = 18.96, 5 df, p &lt; 0.001). City-specific estimates are represented graphically in Fig. 1. As expected, the confidence (credibility) intervals are widest [table: see text] for bayesian estimates, intermediate for those obtained under a random effects model, and narrowest for those found under a fixed effects model. Nevertheless, differences in point estimates are negligible. A North-South gradient in risk is obvious. Table 6 shows, for the cities for which mortality data were available, the improvement in precision and the shrinkage of effect estimates toward the overall mean introduced by the bayesian modelling. In the meta-regression, total mortality and a deprivation score were associated with greater effects. The excess risks on hospital admission were modified by the deprivation score and by the NO2\/PM10 ratio. Overall, the risk estimates were greater in the calendar period 1995-99 and there was a North-South gradient, with larger effects in cities located in Central and Southern Italy (Florence, Rome, Palermo). The meta-analysis of the Italian studies on short-term effects of air pollution in 8 cities, MISA, exhibits the following features: With the exception of Naples, all greatest Italian cities were included; overall a population of 7 million was enrolled. The study protocol was accurate with regard to the selection of hospital admissions for acute conditions. Monitored data of concentration of pollutant were carefully evaluated before their inclusion in the meta-analysis. City specific analyses were carried out according to a common protocol controlling for seasonality, influenza epidemics, age and meterological variables; [table: see text] the protocol derived from a structured exploratory analysis. The meta-analysis was done using fixed and random effects models; a hierarchical bayesian model was fitted in a sensitivity analysis. The heterogeneity of effects across cities was investigated using a hierarchical bayesian model for meta-regression. While mortality data are of good quality, hospital admission data are more problematic. Since the filing criteria for the latter changed around 1995, comparability of results before and after such date is limited. Moreover, hospital admissions rely on availability of beds, the offer of which may be restricted during the warm season. Comparability of pollutant concentration estimates among cities may have been influenced by differences in monitor characteristics.

These issues are to be viewed in the light of the various roles the epidemiologist is called to play in court, as consultant for the prosecutor, the defendant and the plaintiffs. The criteria adopted in court should not differ from the ones usually followed in good epidemiologic practice. Potential conflict of interest that may occur when the personal interest of a researcher leads to introduce bias in his\/her\/witnes is another relevant issue. Another relevant point is how an epidemiologist deals with his\/her colleagues in the courts: diversity in opinions and rigorous critics are acceptable but they must be adequately documented.","2184":"The present study compares the data of pleural mesothelioma (PM) patients resident in the province of Genoa (Italy) who, in the period 1994-1996, applied to the Italian National Insurance Institute for Work Accident (INAIL), for workers' compensation for asbestos-related diseases due to occupational exposure, with the dataset of PM patients collected by the Mesothelioma Registry of Liguria (REM) in the same period and in the same area. As PM is a malignant tumor of a prevalently occupational origin, it is recognized and acknowledged as such by INAIL when clinical and etiological characteristics are matched. Objectives of this study were to describe observed PM cases, to evaluate completeness of collected data and differences between those who requested compensation and those who did not. The REM describes the incidence of PM among Ligurian residents, proposing patients with a specific questionnaire to assess occupational, environmental and indoor asbestos exposures. The REM collected 199 new cases of PM among the residents of both the city of Genoa (1994-96) and the province of Genoa (1995-96). In the same period, INAIL received 48 (24%) applications for compensation. Among these, 43 subjects were included in a subgroup of 98 patients registered in the REM as cases with definite diagnosis and ascertained asbestos exposure; 32 were awarded compensation, while 11 are under evaluation. The data collected by REM do not show proven asbestos exposure and\/or PM diagnosis for five other subjects (two compensated and three under judgment). This study reveals that: a) only a 24% of the patients with a diagnosis of PM and asbestos exposure apply for compensation; b) an exchange of information among institutions involved in primary prevention, in the evaluation of occupational exposures to carcinogens and in insurance compensation is useful.","2185":"This study evaluates the risk of mortality in a cohort of Italian alcoholics resident in a rural area characterised by traditional drinking habits. Individual vital status of the 1,037 patients enrolled at the Centro Alcologico in Arezzo during the 1979-1997 period has been traced. Causes of death (ICD-IX) have been retrieved from the Regional Mortality Register. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) have been computed according to gender and 5-year age group mortality rates of the general population resident in Tuscany during the same period. This cohort is representative of the traditional rural alcoholism of the Tuscany region based on wine consumption. Among the 9,190 person-years followed-up, 333 deaths have occurred, corresponding to approximately 2.6 fold the expected number of deaths (SMR males: 2.6; females: 2.4). In both genders, significantly high SMRs for liver cirrhosis, oesophagus and liver cancer are reported, while SMRs of cancers at all sites, oral and respiratory cancers, injuries as a whole, road and traffic accidents, and suicides are significantly elevated only among males. No relevant variation between expected and observed deaths for pancreatic diseases, colon cancer, female breast cancer, and, despite a large proportion of heavy smokers, for cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, coronary heart diseases) has been recorded. This research confirms the high mortality among a cohort of Italian alcoholics. However, causes of death related with violence and trauma are proportionally less represented, in accordance with the social pattern of Mediterranean alcoholism. The absence of cardiovascular mortality risk in a wine-based cohort of alcoholics is an unexpected finding that requires to be further examined. Finally, to prevent smoking related deaths, alcohol addiction services should begin to introduce smoking cessation practices among treatment protocols.","2186":"","2187":"","2188":"","2189":"","2190":"","2191":"","2192":"","2193":"","2194":"","2195":"","2196":"","2197":"","2198":"","2199":"","2200":"","2201":"International, national and regulatory classification, evaluation, guidelines and occupational exposure values regarding vinyl chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane, carried out by European Union (EU).

The central issues in communicating with health authorities have been evaluation of the causal link and connections between available knowledge and subsequent action. The public has been rapidly informed, through press and local broadcasting stations. It has been made clear that recommended interventions were of preventive nature, namely paving with asphalt roads that were previously paved with the local quarry's byproducts.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the relative importance of the main known risk factors for lung cancer in that area. It is a case control study based on the population where the cases under study (249) are selected from subjects deceased over the period 1988-1993 in the territory of the ex USL 33 (Local Health Authority) of Comacchio, while the controls (500) lived in the same area. The statistical analysis showed the same information that can be found in other medical literature regarding the known risk factors: smoking (OR = 3.7-44.9 per n. cigarettes\/die), spouse passive smoking (OR = 1.1), passive smoking due to social setting (pubs) (OR = 1.9), vegetable diet (OR = 0.4). A important role was played by the factors linked to socio-economic differences. There was a significant increase in risk for those who had lived in \"casazze\" in the area, which are typical homes of the poorer social classes. There was also a significant increase in risk for subjects with a lower level of education. To obtain these results the analysis method known as \"classification trees\" was also used in order to verify its possible use in the public health sector.","2206":"","2207":"","2208":"The development and the validation of the Pavia Physical Performance Scale (PPPS) is here presented. PPPS is a new instrument evaluating the physical performance of pacemaker implanted patients. Data comes from a cross-over clinical trial on the efficacy of two functions of the pacemaker device. Primary end-point is the improvement of the physical performance together with the quality of life. We used data of 168 patients actually enrolled and interviewed with the Pavia Physical Performance Scale. We first selected 30 Likert-type items; then we applied a statistical methodology of Homogeneity Analysis (HOMALS). We verified the homogeneity of the scale and the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92). With the same methodology, we developed the final version of PPPS. The final version lists 20 items; based on the results of the psychometric analysis, we turned the Likert-type scoring into a binary scoring (1 = no limitation of physical activity, 0 = limitation or never tried). The external validity, trough an Analysis of Variance of PPPS mean scores within New York Heart Association classes (NYHA), has been performed. We found a negative linear trend of PPPS scores and NYHA classes. That means an association between high PPPS scores (good physical performance) and low NYHA classes (also good physical capacity). The Pavia Physical Performance Scale (PPPS) could be proposed as a valid and consistent scale aimed to evaluate physical performance in pacemaker implanted patients. We suggest to use it in the clinical practice in addition to more traditional techniques.","2209":"","2210":"Bernardino Ramazzini, born in Carpi in 1633 and deceased in Padua in 1714, is universally renowned father and founder of occupational health. This paper will present Bernardino Ramazzini under a different perspective, and will show that during his scientific career he continuously maintained the attitude of a modern epidemiologist. Reviewing all his scientific papers, and many papers commenting his activity, we present four major areas in which Ramazzini expressed in a direct and convincing way his epidemiologic culture: the epidemiologic constitutions and the work done mainly on physical subjects while he was in Modena; the general architecture of his most important book (De Morbis Artificum Diatriba); the first full description of an episode of environmental pollution which occurred in Finale Emilia in 1689 (in his book this episode is reported in the chapter describing the diseases of chemicals); the opening lectures of some academic years he gave while he was teaching, mainly, in Padua. To our knowledge the epidemiological attitude of Bernardino Ramazzini is not recognized yet in epidemiology textbooks.","2211":"","2212":"Quality of Life (QoL) instruments are often considered similar, since they all concern subjective health state valuations. Actually, among the set of QoL scales, it is possible to distinguish two approaches, different in terms of both goals and tools. The clinical approach elicits functional limitations as perceived by patients, the economic approach is aimed at solving allocation problems generated by scarsity of resources. The major goal of this article is to analyse the economic approach to health state subjective valuation. By using QoL questionnaires, economists attempt to set up quantitative indexes which can value any kind of health outcome. Thus the economic approach seems to be more ambitious than the clinical one. However, the results so far achieved are quite disappointing, especially if compared to those of the clinical approach. In particular, economic scales still suffer a general lack of validation, due to the scarcity of studies conducted on relevant samples. Accordingly, indexes now available seem to require substantial revision. In general, further significant efforts seem necessary to improve the methodology inside the field of HRQoL measures. Integrating the two approaches, as recently attempted, could be a sound strategy.","2213":"The crocidolite mine at Wittenoom Gorge, Western Australia, has been active from 1943 to 1966, and managed by Australian Blue Asbestos Ltd (ABA). Migrants constituted the large majority of workers. The list of workers is composed of 6,911 subjects (6,501 males). In it we identified 1,102 Italians (1,069 males) and completed the follow up for those previously lost, remained in Australia or returned to Italy. Up to 1997, 302 subjects (301 males) definitively resettled in Italy, almost always returning to their community of origin. The median length of work at Wittenoom for those resettled was 17.8 months. The resettled subjects are spread around Italy, and 112 subjects (37%) already died. We compared the mortality rates of those returned to Italy to the rates of the male Italian population. Migrants were subjected to a strong selection before departure and were the target of a surveillance program during work at Wittenoom: however, for those resettled, instead of a healthy migrant effect, we observed an overmortality, mainly due to deaths from penumoconiosis (10 deaths vs 0.38 expected), from respiratory tumours (3 deaths from pleural mesothelioma and 4 from primary peritoneal tumours; an excess of lung cancers, SMR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72-2.11, and an excess of undefined caused of deaths (SMR 6.29, 95% CI 2.52-12.96). The study suggests that asbestos-related diseases and deaths have been observed among those resettled to Italy. In order to increase the precision of the follow up of the Wittenoom cohort, a search outside Australia should be carried out in some European countries for workers whose vital status was unconfirmed. Survivors in Italy are suffering from asbestosis, jeopardizing their life, and are at risk of cancer, but few have received information, actions aimed at reducing the accumulated risk, or compensation. Italy had a multi-million number of migrants for work, and an important percentage of migrants is returned to Italy: the effects of occupational exposures to adverse agents should be expected, but this topic has received up to now little attention.","2214":"","2215":"","2216":"","2217":"","2218":"","2219":"","2220":"Health is a high priority in public health planning, a process by which health, services and resources are connected to each other.

The epidemiological model put forward describes the volume of resources necessary to maintain the health needs of a population as depending upon the prevalence of diseases, the health services used to combat these diseases and the consequent human and financial resources employed. According to this model the management of the supply of health services depends on monitoring the relationship between population, disease, health services and resources.","2221":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the underreporting of some infectious diseases in the pediatric population in the Local Health Unit of Florence in the period 15.09.1997-14.09.1998.

Nine family pediatricians voluntarily participated in the sentinel network, notifying all cases of measles, mumps, pertussis, rubella, scarlet fever and chickenpox diagnosed in the population of children under their professional responsibility, in the period of the study. Chickenpox was the most frequent disease (2,043 cases equal to 73.5% of total notifications). The notification rate for chickenpox obtained with the sentinel network was 41.6 per 1,000 children, meanwhile the notification rate obtained with the current notification system was 23.7 per 1,000. The notification rate for scarlet fever was 24.1 per 1,000 with the sentinel network and 6.0 per 1000 with the current notification system.

To value the level of municipal deprivation in Basilicata (Southern Italy), 1991 Census data were used. As a first analytic step, variables selected as deprivation measures were calculated. \"Elderly\" variable was included at the first step since it was considered as an indicator of social burden and need. As a second analytic step, factorial analysis was performed in order to help in selecting the most valuable ones. The final choice led to five variables (elderly, low education, unemployment, no indoor bathroom, lone parent with children) which were combined in an Index of Deprived Area (IAS). The IAS showed a variation between -5.4 and 7.4. To validate the IAS, the municipal level of income was used: the index increased with decreasing income (r = -0.5). Municipalities were then ranked according to their IAS (decreasing) and divided into five deprivation categories, with about equal population number in each group. After excluding the \"elderly\" indicator, the ranking order showed irrelevant changes (modified IAS). Overall, the IAS seemed to well describe the difference among Municipalities, particularly between the first quintile (54 small towns with high prevalence of old people) and the last group (the urban area of the region). The developed tool and the obtained results may be used by administrators and health\/social workers and professionals in charge of the Regional Epidemiological Observatory to improve the selection of health and social indicators for Local Health Authorities and Municipalities.","2223":"This paper presents the epidemiological analyses based on the first 5 years of activity of the Mesothelioma Registry of Liguria (REM). REM is a population-based cancer registry specialized in the study of both the incidence and etiology of primary pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma in Liguria (Italy). The REM completes normal clinical information with occupational and environmental anamnestic data in order to identify working and living areas at risk for asbestos-related pathologies. The REM started its activity in 1994 describing the incidence of pleural mesothelioma (PM) exclusively in the population resident in the city of Genoa (660,000 inhabitants); since 1996 the REM has studied the entire Liguria Region (1,640,000 inhabitants), where nearly 120 new cases of PM are diagnosed annually (20% are women). In the city of Genoa, between 1986-1987 and 1997-1998, PM crude incidence rate rose from 13.8 to 26.7 per 100,000 males over 40 years old. From 1994 to 1998 the REM registered 495 new patients with histologically (62%) and cytologically (9%) confirmed diagnosis of PM. 54% of them were immunocytohistochemically evaluated. Occupational information has been gathered for 248 subjects, i.e., 61% of cases with sure or probable diagnosis of PM. For 126 patients, occupational asbestos exposure (direct, indirect or only presence in the workplace) was identified on average 40 years before diagnosis. In particular, asbestos exposure was documented in shipyards, docks and cargo handling settings, building trades, iron and steel industries. Interestingly, during the same period (1955-1960), a large fraction of subjects without proved or declared direct asbestos exposure claimed to have worked in the same occupational settings. This suggests a possible unconscious indirect exposure to asbestos fibers in the workplace.","2224":"The study reports the experience of Di Bella Treatment (an unconventional treatment for cancer) for advanced cancer patients in Tuscany.

In addition, residential, housing, household, and individual characteristics were also gathered. Non-responding households totalled nearly 45%, but were homogeneously distributed by area.

Each year about 50,000 spontaneous abortions are notified in Italy and the trend is slightly increasing. The national rate passed from 8 to 9 spontaneous abortions per 100 conceptions during the period 1983-93. Geographically, the rate decreases from North to South (respectively from 11-12 to 6-8 spontaneous abortions per 100 known conception in 1993). The national rate of spontaneous abortion is slightly higher for women with little or no education: 9.0 per 100 known conceptions for women with no or primary school certificate (schooling from 6 to 10 years), 8.8 for those with lower school certificate (ages: 11 to 13 years) 7.8 for high school certificate (ages: 14 to 18 years) and 8.3 for university degree, in 1991. There were no significant differences between occupations, excepting agricultural workers who had the lowest rate: 4.1 per 100 known conceptions compared with 8.2 for women employed in industry, 9.3 for other occupations and 8.9 for housewives, students or the unemployed, in 1991. However, maternal age is confirmed to be a more important risk factor: the risk of spontaneous abortion increased from 6-7 per 100 known conception among women aged less than 30 to 20 per 100 among women aged 40 or more. The same effects are found in a logistic regression model.","2238":"The progressive ageing of the population and the increasing importance of road traffic in our society renders the relationships between elderly people and road traffic an increasingly important problem. In the province of Modena elderly people are not equally distributed over the area, in fact they are concentrated mainly in small towns situated in hill\/mountain areas. This study aims to verify the risk conditions for elderly people in relation to road accidents in different areas in the province of Modena. The time-series analyses of road accidents involving elderly people, from 1991 to 1996, in the province of Modena were carried out on 2,291 cases out of 16,267 total accidents. The results of the analysis showed statistically significant differences for the ratio of fatalities according to the geographical area, divided into low plain, urban and hill\/mountain areas (p = 0.015 urban and hill\/mountain areas). No statistically significant differences were obtained for the division into small, medium and big towns, however such analysis indicated an increased risk for elderly people living in small towns, regardless of the means of transport involved in the accident (p = 0.052). The relationship between old people and road traffic seems to be worse in the small towns situated in hill\/mountain areas, where there is a higher number of elderly people, and where the facilities probably have not adapted themselves to the social-cultural changes that take place.","2239":"","2240":"","2241":"","2242":"","2243":"","2244":"","2245":"","2246":"","2247":"","2248":"","2249":"","2250":"","2251":"","2252":"","2253":"This article deals with the problem of restoring and repairing the supply and distribution of drugs, a vital service damaged by long-term conflicts.

At that time workers employed in jobs with high exposure to asbestos were identified. The mortality experience of these 173 subjects was investigated from 01.01.1979 through 31.12.1997, and compared to that of the population of Emilia Romagna. SMR for all causes was 69, with upper limit of the confidence interval lower than 100; this was largely due to a significant decrease of cardiovascular mortality. Among neoplasms, there was a significant excess of pleural mesothelioma (6 observed, 0.09 expected); one more subject died for peritoneal mesothelioma and one for malignant mesothelioma of unspecified site. About half of the subjects deceased for neoplastic disease (8\/17) were affected by mesothelioma.","2255":"We report herein, the first results of a record linkage between the Italian AIDS Registry and 13 population-based Cancer Registries (about 8-million population in 1991). An anonymous linkage process was carried out on about 339,000 cancer notifications and 6,067 AIDS ones reported between 1982 and 1994. Out of 243 Kaposi's sarcomas (KS) below age 50 years recorded at either type of registry, 90 (37%) were reported as such by both. Sixty-eight percent of individuals with KS at Cancer Registries could be identified at the AIDS Registry. Sixty-two percent of individuals with KS and 65% of individuals reported as having non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) at RAIDS could be also found at Cancer Registries. Among 6,067 persons with AIDS 15-69 years old, observed and expected numbers of cancer and age-standardised incidence ratios (SIR) on a total of 25,759 person-years were computed. Significantly increased SIR was found for Hodgkin's disease (8.9; 95% CI: 4.4-16.0), invasive carcinoma of the cervix uteri (15.5; 95% CI: 4.0-40.1), and non-melanomatous skin cancer (3.0, 95%, CI: 1.3-5.9). As in previous studies, KS and NHL were greatly increased (SIR = 1,300 and 59, respectively). The risk for all cancer types, after exclusion of KS and NHL, was approximately twice the risk of the general population. An increased SIR of Hodgkin's disease in persons with AIDS is thus confirmed, though many-fold smaller than for NHL. An association with invasive carcinoma of the cervix is also shown at a population level. These data indicate the potential of AIDS and Cancer Registries for improving cancer assessment in individuals with HIV\/AIDS and elucidating the role of immune system on cancer onset.","2256":"","2257":"","2258":"","2259":"","2260":"","2261":"","2262":"","2263":"","2264":"","2265":"The allocation of resources destined for environmental rehabilitation of areas contaminated by asbestos requires scientific, political, economical and ethical evaluation. Ethically relevant issues reviewed in this paper include: identification of the populations most expected to benefit from the intervention, risk assessment, effectiveness of different technical approaches, as well as a comparison between populations of current socio-economic standards, level of legal assistance and access to both information and participation in the decision making process. A relevant ethical criterion is minimizing inequalities within and between communities.","2266":"We tested the usefulness of the National Health Service Databases for investigating the incidence of lymphoid malignancies in an Italian community. We analyzed hospital discharge data, drug prescription, pathologic records and death certificates to identify the new cases of Hodgkin's disease, non Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in the municipal population of Reggio Emilia, northern Italy, 1991 through 1996. The completeness of Hospital discharge data was very high, and several incident cases could be identified only through this source. Completeness of the pathologic registry was satisfactory for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and this source independently yielded a few incident cases of lymphoid neoplasms. Analysis of death certificates and drug prescriptions appears to be of limited value in the epidemiology of lymphoproliferative diseases.","2267":"Results on general and cause-specific mortality in a retrospective cohort of intravenous drug users in the Emilia Romagna Region (Italy) are presented. Four thousand two hundred and sixty subjects (3324 males, 936 females) in public treatment centres in Piacenza, Modena and Ferrara provinces have been observed for up to 20 years in the period 1975-95. AIDS age-adjusted death rates dramatically increased all during the period, while overdose and other causes (mostly accidental) increase up to the early nineties and then tend to decrease. This last pattern has not been described in other Italian cohorts, and could be related with changes in therapeutic strategies. General mortality is very high in this cohort, as in other studies (males: SMR 16.7, LC 15.3-18.2; females: SMR 33.4, LC 27.9-39.9). Survival probability after 15 years of observation is 65% in males and females combined. Apart from overdose and AIDS, other relevant excesses are observed for accidental deaths (especially car accidents), cirrhosis, infective causes and cancer in males; in females, accidental deaths (among which homicides) and digestive tract diseases. A higher death risk is observed for males who began drug use before age 20, who contacted treatment centres in the nineties and at an older age, and who came in contact with the law.","2268":"The Authors have monitored coronary and cerebrovascular events occurring in an area of Naples in 1995, using a register according to the simplified methodology derived from the MONICA project. Demographic and mortality data, hospital discharge diagnoses were collected. In people aged 25 to 64, acute coronary events were 365. The fatality rate was 34.8%, with 14.8% of deaths in hospital. 76% of death in hospital occurred within 24 hours. Acute cerebrovascular events were 173. The fatality rate was 23.1%, with 8.1% of deaths in hospital. 63.7% of those who died in hospital had survived more than one week. The attack rates for coronary events were 268.8 for males and 56.1 for females and respectively 96.3 and 56 for cerebrovascular events. Regarding coronary events, these values are greater than attack rates of MONICA project's Area Latina; for cerebrovascular events they are smaller. This study shows that the Naples register is useful for knowing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and for monitoring them.","2269":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely distributed environment pollutants of air, water and soil. Since many PAHs are potent mutagens and\/or carcinogens the occurrence of these compounds in the lower atmosphere is an important element of environmental pollution. We measured PAH levels in airborne particles collected in the town of Arezzo, (Tuscany, Italy), during the period April 1997-February 1998. Air monitoring for 24 h was repeated for 7 days, during two weeks, in each season; a total of 84 air samples were obtained sampling two urban sites where the traffic is the main source of pollution. One site is a residential area. The data of this study indicate a pronounced seasonal variation in PAH levels and show that in cold spells other sources of contamination besides vehicular traffic are important.","2270":"","2271":"","2272":"","2273":"","2274":"","2275":"","2276":"","2277":"","2278":"","2279":"","2280":"","2281":"","2282":"","2283":"Over the last ten years the traditional role of primary care in Great Britain has been undergoing major changes with the major impact being the introduction of what is termed \"GP fundholding\", a process by which GPs hold budgets to purchase care from hospitals on behalf of their patients. This paper addresses how the system of fundholding operates in practice and points out the difference between the new and the previous system in which the health authority would plan care for the whole of a district and costs by hospitals would be covered by an all-inclusive system. The paper studies the rationale of the introduction of the fundholding and examines the evidence on how successful the approach has been. With reference to a systematic literature review of the evidence on fundholding's outcomes undertaken by the author, the paper examines the evidence for and against fundholding under the following headings: efficiency, equity, quality, choice and responsiveness. The paper then addresses more recent changes to the British health care system and shows how these have changed the role of the family doctor irrevocablly.","2284":"The aim of the present work was to compare mortality data during 1980-94 (24 causes of death for males and 25 for females) in populations living in municipalities with different urbanization levels of seven Italian regions (Piemonte, Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Marche, Lazio, Campania and Sicilia). Urbanization levels were established following the classification of the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT, Classificazione dei comuni secondo le caratteristiche urbane e rurali, 1986). A quite uniform configuration of causes of death with characteristic excesses in the urban environment was evident. The only exception was represented by the male population in Lombardia, probably due to the prevalence of occupational exposure. The urban excesses included: all tumors (also for the population &lt; 64 year old), trachea, bronchi and lung tumors (also &lt; 64 year old people), colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, male liver cancer and female breast cancer. Mortality due to stomach cancer and, only in males, to larynx cancer was lower in urban than in the other types areas, except the Southern regions. Concerning some non tumoral pathologies a more dyshomogeneous situation was observed, with a prevalence of urban defects in Piemonte and Lombardia, of urban excesses in the Southern regions and of both excesses and defects in Emilia Romagna and the Central regions. The \"semi-rural\" and \"rural\" types municipalities resulted quite similar, with the exception of Campania and Lazio. In fact, in these two regions a greater association with stomach cancer and lower mortality for all other tumors compared to the urban and, at a lesser extent, to the semi-urban municipalities was found. However, the lower tumor mortality was partly balanced by some other causes of death, again with the exception of Campania and at a lesser extent of Sicilia. On the basis of the causes of death comparisons, the semi-urban municipalities seem to represent a transition type between the urban and the rural ones.","2285":"The combined birth prevalence of cleft palate [CP] and cleft lip with or without cleft palate [CL(P)] in Europe is approximately one in 700 with characteristic regional variations. Orofacial clefting (OC) is therefore now one of the most frequent congenital anomalies, with a higher birth prevalence that Down's Syndrome or Neural Tube defects, but still lower than cardiovascular malformation. Babies with OC require a multidisciplinary medical approach, surgery and rehabilitative treatments over time. This means an important effort in terms of social organization as well as economical costs for the health care system. In Italy, the health care costs for approximately 800 children born with orofacial clefting per year has been estimated at around 150 billion Lire (80 million Euros). The etiology of OC is complex and heterogeneous both for isolated and associated defects; causes linked to environment, genetics and gene-environment interaction are known, although there is still a lot to do, especially in clarifying the role of genetics in producing susceptibility to the environment. Four categories of genes for which there are results suggestive of a genetic susceptibility to OCs are: 1) genes expressed in a particular area of the embryo or in a particular period of the palatine arch development, such as the transforming growth factors alpha and beta (TGF alpha, TGF beta 2, TGF beta 3); 2) genes having biological activities linked to the OC's pathogenesis without direct involvement (e.g. the retinoic acid receptor (RARA), the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase receptor (MTHFR) and the folic acid receptor (FOLR1); 3) genes or locus identified in experimental animals as the homeotic genes MSX-1 and MSX-2; 4) genes involved in the interaction with the xenobiotics metabolism as those in P-450 cytochrome system. Several environmental factors have been implicated in the OC etiology; among those, the folic acid supplementation during the periconceptional period that was found effective in the prevention of neural tube defects. In fact, folic acid deficiency may be responsible for different malformations through a common mechanism that interferes with the embryonic development, depending on the maternal or embryo genotype. Further investigation is required to study in depth how the genotype would modify the role of environmental factors like folic acid. Well-designed and conducted epidemiological studies seem to be able to give worthwhile information. Studies carried out in Europe on these issues are a few, particularly those on gene-environment interaction. Recent results obtained in molecular biology and the availability of wealth of data can allow to perform ad hoc investigations, being important not only for the basic research but also for their public health implications. For this objective a specific scientific network at the European level has been set by the European Science Foundation (ESF), whose first step will be to establish consistent case ascertainment and data collection across Europe and to develop standardized protocols and methods of analysis. It is hoped that in the longer term such multicentre collaborative research will enable combined analysis and lead to the identification of genetic susceptibility to certain environmental factors, including nutrition. Such studies would inform the current debate about the efficacy of folic acid and other nutritional factors in prevention of disease in the developing embryo. Subsequent public health measures targeted according to risk might reduce the prevalence of disorders such as orofacial clefting.","2286":"","2287":"","2288":"","2289":"","2290":"","2291":"","2292":"","2293":"Translation of recommendations on skin cancer prevention formulated by many national and international institutions into efficient steps requires measuring the potential impact in terms of preventable cases. This study analyses the proportion of skin cancers attributable to sun exposure in Turin, Trento and Ragusa. Estimates have been reached by applying the risk models calculated from the case-control study on melanoma in Turin and the Helios multi-centric study on skin carcinomas. The proportion of cases attributable to sun exposure has been subsequently calculated by correcting for the different proportion of skin characteristics among the populations taken into consideration. Attributable risks so calculated show medium to high values for melanoma in Turin (38%) and Trento (29%), while values are lower in Ragusa (17%). As for basal-cell carcinoma, attributable risk values are slightly inferior to those of melanoma. The risk of squamous-cell carcinoma attributable to sun exposure during outdoor work is the highest in Ragusa, with a value of 25%. Taking an annual incidence rate for melanoma of 9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and a preventive intervention with 50% of effectiveness, preventable cases should be 2 cases per 100,000 each year. This figure compared with 8 preventable cases of cervix cancer, in a similar population suggests an extremely cautious attitude in taking on programmes aiming to change life styles.","2294":"During the '80s, evidence was collected that air pollutants concentrations close to, or lower than, air quality standards could negatively influence public health at short term, i.e. within a few days. The European Union financed, between 1993 and 1995, the study \"Short term effects of Air Pollution on Health: a European Approach using epidemiological time-series data\" (APHEA-1 project), involving more than 25 millions inhabitants in 15 cities, investigated between 1977 and 1991. In this paper, the main results, already published in various scientific journals, are reported. The health effects were studied as mortality for natural causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and as emergency hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases, bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The pollutants whose measures were available for the analysis are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM) measured either as black smoke or total suspended particulate, and ozone (O3). The analysis was carried out by each participating group following a detailed protocol, defined during various workshops, through the construction of Poisson regression models, adjusted for autocorrelation and overdispersion, accounting for variables influencing the daily count of deaths, such as long time trends, season, temperature, day of the week. This paper reports the results of the meta-analysis, performed using the values of each city, as relative risk of dying or being admitted to hospital associated with increases of 50 micrograms\/m3 in the 24 hours average concentrations of each pollutant. The daily number of natural deaths was associated with increases in the levels of PM, SO2, O3, and NO2. Cardiovascular and respiratory deaths were associated with increases of the levels of PM, SO2, and O3; cardiovascular deaths were associated also with increases of NO2 concentrations. Emergency hospital admissions for the whole group of respiratory disorders are less consistently associated with PM, SO2, and NO2, whereas there is evidence of association with O3. COPD admissions are related to the air pollutant levels, especially those of O3. Lastly, NO2 levels may play a role in exhacerbating asthma, and SO2 levels can have an effect on asthma in children. A second study is currently going on, involving over 40 millions residents in 34 cities. The aims of this project are: to evaluate the dose-response relationship, to investigate on synergy among pollutants, on the \"harvesting\" phenomenon, on the geographical differences inside Europe and with the U.S. through the collaboration with a similar American study now in progress. The existence of an association between daily variations in the levels of urban air pollution and adverse health effects was confirmed in Europe. This association is weak, but it involves the whole resident population, so it is a major cause of concern from the public health point of view.","2295":"The manicheistic temptation of concluding that the good, but also the best science, is the science made by scientists morally and ideologically committed to alleviate both physical illness and health and social inequalities, would take us far away from the painful complexity of the mixture of good and bad, right and wrong, bright and obscure, and from the ambiguities and ambivalent situations that may originate from it, in which not only scientific research but our entire existence is soaked. The scientist should see very clearly his obligations toward society and his fellow humans in order to resist the ambiguous complexity where the interest for a scientific result can be exploited for ignoble purposes or, as Robert N. Proctor reminds us in his recent book \"The Nazi War on Cancer\", where \"the routine practice of science can so easily coexist with the routine exercise of cruelty.\" Research committed to prevention and to the struggle for health and social equity was for quite a while successfully hampered by closing the financial channels and depriving it of the necessary means. The block by lack of funds has been replaced in recent times by a block by plenty through the attraction exerted on many scientists by availability of conspicuous and sure funds for research on themes chosen by the economic power.","2296":"Cancer registration took place in Italy in the first half of the Seventies with only one Cancer Registry in the province of Varese. More recently several cancer registries started their activity attaining population coverage of approximately 18% of the national population. The contribution from a network of cancer registries in Italy to the activity of cancer research and control is discussed in view of an improved exploitation of this tool.","2297":"We studied the association between self-reported exposure to passive smoking (ETS) and urinary cotinine among 95 ex-smokers, who had quit in the context of a smoking cessation trial in general practice, and among 33 ex-smokers who had been contacted in the context of a study aimed at estimating the spontaneous cessation rate among smokers, listed in the roosters of the General Practitioners participating in the trial, who had not been offered recruitment. The results of multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that duration of exposure at home was strongly related to cotinine levels (increase of 1 ng\/mg every 3 hours of exposure at home), quantified by radioimmunoassay. Duration of exposure in public places showed a similar effect, but the association was significant only among subjects who reported having been exposed in a heavily ETS polluted environment (increase of 1 ng\/mg every 45 minutes of exposure). Among subjects exposed at work cotinine concentration was associated to subjects' judgement of the concentration of ETS, rather than to duration of exposure. Standardized questionnaires may provide a reasonably accurate description of ETS exposure and they can be used to assess exposure in etiologic studies. Non-smokers non exposed to ETS at home may not represent an appropriate control group in such studies. Indeed, they may be exposed to other sources, as indicated by the relatively high levels of urinary cotinine among ex-smokers non exposed at home in our study. Misclassification of these subjects may result in a dilution of the effect of the exposure.","2298":"Compliance and coverage are supposed to be indicators of effectiveness in screening activities. Yet effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a screening programme: adverse effects are intrinsic to screening practice; to persuade to comply to screening programme should imply that the advantages overwhelm the disadvantages; if at community level the balance is in favour of the screening, it is not possible to predict the weight for each individual of any potential harms. To accomplish individual values is fundamental from ethical point of view: we must avoid non responsible participation or uninformed refusal, through a reliable information on screening benefits and harms to the invited population. Therefore the concept of compliance should be abandon: \"participation\" should be used instead. The consequence of a different approach to participation in screening evaluation should be appreciated: new indicators and standards have to be defined. The following ones are proposed: prevalence of informed target population; prevalence of consent to invitation within the informed population; ratio consent\/refusal to invitation; prevalence of participation in the invited group. It is unrealistic to expect an informed participation, to screening programme, from all population but incorporation of patient values and preferences is seen as the next frontier in attempts to devise valid practice guidelines. Research is needed to develop instrument on risk communication and informed consent, taking into account the current organisation of screening programs.","2299":"Over the last two decades ethics in epidemiology has been the subject of a substantial number of conferences, books, articles, guidelines as well as training courses. The relevance of ethics for epidemiology does not make the ethical approach sufficient to exhaust the analysis of the relationship between epidemiology and society: on one side the ethical assessment of an epidemiological investigation is not self-sufficient but depends on the evaluation of the scientific worth of the study (a planned study involving humans is automatically unethical if scientifically unsound) and, on the other side, to be of practical value it needs expanding as to its policy implications. A few remarks on two issues, ethics committees and human reproductive cloning, support the general contention that translating knowledge into effective public health actions may be grounded in ethical considerations but necessitates a substantial development at political level.","2300":"Published epidemiological literature relating BSE was reviewed to point out strategies and methods used by the veterinary epidemiologists involved. Classification keys were used to identify descriptive, analytical and theoretical epidemiological studies used to formulate etiologic hypotheses, to assess the relevance of several risk factors and to monitor and predict the future of the epidemic. Case series, incidence and ecological studies, case-control studies, a cohort study and modelling epidemiology studies have been considered.","2301":"Infection from some types of human papillomavirus has been recognised as carcinogenic for the uterine cervix. With reliable techniques (PCR and Hybrid Capture II) \"high risk\" HPV types are found in a very high proportion of women with invasive cancer and high-grade pre-invasive lesions. On the other hand prevalence is low in cytologically normal women, except in young women, who seem to have a high frequency of transient infections in the years following the beginning of sexual activity. Some studies found a role of the presence and persistence of \"high-risk\" HPV types in the progression of low-grade pre-invasive lesions vs. high-grade rather then vs. spontaneous regression. For these reasons HPV testing has been suggested as a possible tool for primary screening. A few studies suggest that it could allow increasing sensitivity, although problems of extrapolability of results exist. It must, however, be considered that traditional cytological screening is already very protective and that simply adding a further test would lead to an unfavourable cost-benefit ratio. An appealing possibility is applying HPV testing with long intervals between screening rounds. This would reduce the burden for women and plausibly allow reaching higher coverage at each round. A key element is the duration of infection before progression to pre-invasive lesion. A long duration would allow selecting women at low risk of developing a lesion for years (those HPV-negative), who could have long-interval test, and others (those HPV-positive) at high risk, to be followed more strictly. Published data from longitudinal studies are limited and don't allow an adequately precise estimate. Therefore the use of HPV testing for primary screening is very promising but to the moment must be considered as a research object.","2302":"Following the cloning of BRCA1 and BRCA2 it has been suggested that genetic screening may be of benefit for women at high familial risk. To be able to assess whether this is the case more research is needed on the penetrance of the different mutations, their prevalence in the population, the biological and environmental factors affecting the development of cancer in mutation carriers and the natural history of genetically determined breast cancer. Furthermore, studies on the efficacy of preventive measures, on counselling and on psychological effects of testing are also needed.","2303":"Since 1967, the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont measures cancer incidence and lethality among children aged 0-14 residents in the Region. Two thousand seven hundred twenty cases were recorded in the period 1967-94. Males were 55.4%. The highest frequency was observed in the age class 0-4 including 41.3% of cases. The most frequent malignancies were: Acute Lymphocytic Leukemias, CNS Tumours and Lymphomas. Incidence rates showed limited variation, both for total neoplasm and for the largest diagnostic categories. On the contrary, lethality decreased markedly: rate (per million children years) was 77.2 in 1967-69 and 59.4 in 1988-94. This trend as more evident for acute leukemias and CNS tumours. Better diagnostic techniques, anticancer and support therapies are the likely explanation for the improved prognosis. Prevalence increased, as a consequence of improved survival and curability: in the Province of Torino it increased from 62 cases per 100,000 children (age 0-14) in 1980 to 98 cases in 1994.","2304":"CAREX is an international information system on occupational exposure to known or suspected carcinogens, built within the framework of the Europe Against Cancer Programme of the European Union. It provides estimates of the number of exposed workers by country, industry, and agent, including data about 139 agents evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (group 1 and 2A agents, plus selected group 2B ones), across 55 industries classified according to UN-ISIC revision 2. The 1990-3 occupational exposures to these agents were estimated for the fifteen countries of the European Union in two steps. At first, estimates were generated on the basis of the national workforce data, and of the exposure prevalence estimates from two reference countries: Finland and the USA. These estimates are adjusted by economic structure, but they do not take into account country specific patterns of exposure to carcinogens. For selected countries, among which Italy, it was possible to correct these estimates by national experts, who were invited to allow for the exposure patterns that they considered specific to their countries. According to the estimates for Italy, there were about 4.2 million workers, i.e. 24% of the work force, exposed to the agents included in CAREX, with some 5.5 million exposures. The most common exposures were: environmental tobacco smoke (770,000 exposed workers), solar radiation (550,000), diesel engine exhaust (550,000), asbestos (350,000), wood dust (300,000), crystalline silica (260,000), lead and inorganic lead compounds (220,000), benzene (180,000), hexavalent chromium and compounds (130,000) and PAHs (130,000).","2305":"Outcome in palliative care can be defined as patients' quality of life, quality of death and satisfaction with care. In an Italian multicentre prospectic study ('Staging') the quality of life of 571 palliative care patients with advanced cancer disease was assessed since the beginning of palliative care till the end of the study. We analyzed the tissue of quality of life missing data and the possibility to input the missing quality of life evaluation through the quality of life evaluation made by a proxy (doctor, nurse). The greatest functional impairment and an increasing level of some symptoms (fatigue, general malaise, emotional status) were observed during the last two weeks of life, whereas for other symptoms (gastro-intestinal, pain) some degree of control was possible. The quality of life analysis for palliative care patients should consider the different response of different quality of life components to the palliative care intervention.","2306":"This paper reviews estimates of the proportion of lung cancer attributable to occupational exposures and presents estimates for the City of Turin where a population-based case-control study on lung cancer has been conducted in 1991-1992 among the residents. An analysis of six hundred and five cases (505 males and 100 females) and 859 controls (684 males and 175 females) with histological\/cytological confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer and occupational and smoking complete histories has been performed to estimate the proportion of lung cancers attributable to occupation in the city of Turin. The occupational exposure has been assessed with two different classifications: a) classification of a checklist of occupations as obtained from the study questionnaire according to industries and occupations known (List A) and suspected (List B) to be associated with lung cancer; b) translation of ISCO-ISIC codes for industries and occupations according to the same List A and List B. The population attributable risks are comparable when estimated with the two different classifications. In the city of Turin, at the beginning of the Nineties, about 10%-15% of lung cancers in males and 2%-5% in females could be attributed to occupational exposure.","2307":"We present: a) an analysis of the past mortality from Primary Pleural Tumors (PPT) occurred in Italy between 1968 and 1992 by an age-cohort-period model, using a Poisson regression model, estimating the risk of dying by birth cohort, the Lifetime Cumulative risk (25-84 years) by birth cohort, the risk by calendar period and testing the full model (age-cohort-period effects); b) a summary of the incidence of mesothelioma as recorded in Italy by Cancer Registries and Mesothelioma Registries. The highest Lifetime Cumulative Risk of dying from TTP is recorded for the birth cohort 1946-'50 (6.2 per thousand among males, 1.64 among females). Whereas the risk by birth cohort becomes flat among females born after 1936, among males the risk is increasing up to the youngest birth cohorts. By calendar period, the highest risk of dying is observed in the last period (1991-'92). The inclusion in the full model of the calendar period term increases significantly the goodness-of-fit of the model among females, but not among males. The highest incidence of mesothelioma in both genders registered by 150 Cancer Registries all over the world is currently recorded among the population of Genoa and Trieste, where large ship-building plants are located. Even higher incidence mesothelioma rates have been recently recorded in other areas of Italy. The trend in PPT mortality in Italy could have been influenced, but not explained, by the increased awareness over time of the disease, but it fits well with the pattern occurring in most industrialized countries of western Europe, with the unprotected industrial use of asbestos which occurred in Italy, and also with the gender characteristics of the work-force employed in asbestos-exposing activities. A ban of asbestos use has been introduced in Italy in 1992. However, considering that asbestos seems to act as an initiator for mesothelioma, the trend in male mortality for PPT will not peak until two or three decades.","2308":"This paper describes methods and results of the Piedmont Malignant Mesothelioma Registry. The Registry is active since 1990 and collects all histologically confirmed incident cases of malignant mesothelioma (m.m.) occurring in the residents of Piedmont. In the period 1990-95, 346 cases of pleural m.m. (211 males and 135 females) and 41 (28 males and 13 females) of peritoneal m.m. have been observed. Amongst the inhabitants of the Local Health Authority of Casale Monferrato, where manufacturing of cement asbestos has determined serious asbestos exposures both in the work place and general environment, there have been 105 pleural m.m. and 17 peritoneal m.m. (incidence rate were 15.6 for men and 13.0 for women and 3.6 for men and 0.6 for women respectively). Leaving out the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Casale Monferrato, the annual incidence rate in Piedmont (for 10(5) person-years, age standardised on the 1981 Italian population), has been 1.0 in men and 0.6 in women for the pleural m.m. (respectively 154 and 87 cases) and 0.09 and 0.06 for peritoneal m.m. (14 and 10 cases). Possible cases of m.m. (cytological and\/or x-ray diagnosis) have been searched in the file of hospital admission and discharges (SDO) in 1994-95: 46 additional cases were found, with a 25% increase in incidence rates. The analysis of incidence according to geographical aggregations (defined according to the LHA borders) has identified, besides some already known important sources of exposures, as Casale Monferrato and the LHA of Lanzo (Balangero mine), other areas with excess of incidence as the LHA's of Galliate and Caluso which show an increased incidence of pleural m.m. in men or Vercelli and Chieri with increased incidence of pleural m.m. in women. These observation deserves further analysis.","2309":"This paper addresses the issue of occupational cancer and criminal law with respect to: 1) causal links between occupation and cancer; 2) certainty and probability in causal links; 3) occupational and non occupational causes of cancer; 4) cancer predictability and employer behaviour.","2310":"The study of social differences in health is today focused on determinants. The knowledge of determinants is useful for the definition of policies to tackle inequities. The aim of this paper is to analyse the social distribution of cancer incidence, fatality and mortality in the city of Turin during the 80's and to estimate the amount of inequality produced within the health system. The social distribution of the risk of death in Turin during 1981-1989, estimated from the Turin Longitudinal Study, is compared with incidence and fatality during approximately the same time period. Among men, the relative risks for all cancer sites, among social classes, appear to confirm the hypothesis of a multiplicative model of incidence and fatality. In particular, colo-rectal, prostatic, bladder cancers and lymphoma and leukaemia show relative risks similar to the expected ones. Cancers of larynx, lung and stomach seem to be less coherent. Among women, colon-rectum, lung, breast and lymphoma and leukaemia show coherent results, whereas relative risks for uterus are far from the expected. The coherence with the expected values of the social distribution of mortality suggests the adequacy of the multiplicative model for the provision of mortality from incidence and fatality. Therefore it is possible to state that the portion of inequality in health originated within the health system is big enough to suggest the need to put the equity in the access to health services in the agenda of interventions. ","2311":"Using discharge abstract data, we analysed hospital mortality comparing four different methods of risk adjustment. All patients discharged from the S. Giovanni Battista (Molinette) hospital in Turin (Italy) between January 1996 and June 1999 (n = 169,746) were classified with All Patient Refined--Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG). A first analysis evaluated the time trend of hospital mortality by semester. A second analysis compared hospital mortality during the last 12 months among eight units of internal medicine (n = 5592). All comparisons were made through logistic regression models. As the quality of discharge abstracts increased during time and showed variation among units with similar patients, all comparisons were repeated using four models, characterised by increasing predictivity and sensitivity to quality of data. In addition to crude comparisons (A), the other models included as risk factors: B) age and emergency admission; C) same as 'B' plus expected mortality by APR-DRG; D) same as 'B' plus expected mortality by APR-DRG and risk of death subclass. If no risk factors were considered (A), hospital mortality showed an increasing trend, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.02 by semester, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 1.01 and 1.03. The association was weakened when age and mode of admission were taken into account (B) and disappeared when the APR-DRG expected mortality was also considered (C) (OR = 1.00; CI = 0.98-1.01). Finally, if the comparisons were adjusted also for the expected mortality by APR-DRG and risk of death subclass (D) a reversed trend appeared (OR = 0.95; CI = 0.94-0.97). The comparison among the units of internal medicine gave discordant results according to the method used to adjust for confounders. The most striking variations were detected for those units with the best and the worst clinical data. The unit with the poorer clinical data (average number of diagnoses per patient = 2.9) showed a crude OR of 1.38 (CI = 0.99-1.93) and an adjusted OR (D) of 1.71 (CI = 1.10-2.66); the unit with the best quality of data (average number of diagnoses per patient = 4.4) changed the OR from 1.55 (CI = 1.06-2.26) (A) to 0.66 (CI = 0.37-1.17) (D). In conclusion, these results confirm the high sensitivity of the APR-DRG classification to the quality of data and, more in general, suggest to be prudent when using powerful instruments like this to assess quality of care, especially if the quality of data among the units compared is less than optimal or not homogeneous.","2312":"Economical, social and technical interrelations between synthetic dyes' production and bladder cancer in workmen engaged in the manufacture are reviewed. International situation is the background of Italian situation, mainly of the Lombardy region and Turin area. For decades social actors, individuals and institutions, acted as separate bodies, contributed to delay and omit the protection of workers' health. The situation changed when scientific knowledge, technical developments and workers' commitment prioritized workers' health as a main goal. The epidemic of bladder cancers among dyestuff workers was a cornerstone in the development of a different scenario in the production responsibility, workers' participation and eventually scientific community. The authors hypothesise that in our country these events stimulated the growth of epidemiology and epidemiologists; furthermore since then institutions promulgated a new and up-to-date wave of protective legislation in the workers' H&amp;S field.","2313":"A time series study was carried out to assess the relationship between the air pollutants measured by the air quality monitoring network and daily mortality in Turin, Italy. We used TSP, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO concentrations measured from 1-1-1991 to 31-12-1996 at three stations of the city network, chosen to represent different, typical circumstances of exposure to air pollution in the town. The analysis was performed by robust Poisson regression model including loss smoothing functions to allow for long-time trend, seasons, temperature and relative humidity. Dummy variables for the days of the week and holidays were also included. The relative risk of death for a unit increase in the pollutant concentration either during the same day (lag 0) in the previous ones (lag up to 5) was computed. The unit increase was 50 micrograms\/m3 for TSP, SO2, NO2, O3, and 2 mg\/m3 for CO. The average daily number of deaths for natural causes was 21. The relative risks for total mortality were 1.04 for TSP (lag 1), 1.10 for SO2 (lag 2), 1.06 for NO2 (lag 1), 1.01 for O3 (lag 0), 1.03 for CO (lag 1). The relative risks were 1.05 for TSP (lag 0), 1.12 for SO2 (lag 2), 1.07 for NO2 (lag 1), 1.03 for O3 (lag 0), 1.03 for CO (lag 1) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.08 for TSP (lag 2), 1.20 for SO2 (lag 2), 1.12 for NO2 (lag 2), 1.03 for O3 (lag 2), 1.05 for CO (lag 2) for respiratory mortality.","2314":"The purpose of the present paper is to review issues concerning causal reasoning in epidemiology, with special emphasis on the relationship between observation at the individual and population level. The sequence of the three sections of the paper, causality in epidemiology, individual and population, alternative explanations, reflects the need to deal with issues of research methodology mainly derived from discussions in the frame of risk assessment, decision making, regulation and legal setting. In discussing the aforementioned topics, special attention is given to the attribution of causality to a single exposure in the presence of a plurality of potential causes. As a case study, data concerning the occurrence of hepatic and pulmonary tumors among subjects exposed to vinyl chloride are considered making reference to hearings on this topic which took place in Court.","2315":"Since the beginning of the discipline epidemiologists developed a specific methodology to assess causal relationships, even opposed to statistics. A special effort to assure unbiasedness explains the importance of the concept of confounding in epidemiology. However, there is an intrinsic conflict in the formal definition of confounding based on association criteria. This conflict is solved in practice by gathering information on the subject specific matter. Causal criteria for confounding generalize with regards to identifiability of causal relationships in observational studies.","2316":"The review describes on-going studies at the Unit of cancer epidemiology of the National Cancer Institute in Milan-Breast carcinogenesis is reviewed addressing: 1) Hormones and breast cancer 2) Diet and breast cancer 3) Diet and hormones 4) Potentiality of dietary prevention in women at high genetic risk.","2317":"","2318":"Population groups with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) have a greater risk of disease and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between SES and mortality in the metropolitan area of Rome during the six-year period 1990-1995, and to examine variations in mortality differentials between 1990-92 and 1993-95. Rome has a population of approximately 2,800,000, with 6,100 census tracts (CTs). During the study period, 149,002 deaths occurred among residents. We compared cause-specific mortality rates among four socioeconomic categories (SES) defined by a socioeconomic index, derived from characteristics of the CT of residence. Among men, total mortality and mortality for the major causes of death showed an inverse association with SES. Among 15-44 year old men, the strong positive association between total mortality and low SES was due to AIDS and overdose mortality. Among women, a positive association with lower SES was observed for stomach cancer, uterus cancer and cardiovascular disease, whereas mortality for breast cancer was higher in the groups with higher SES. Comparing the periods 1990-92 and 1993-95, differences in total mortality between socioeconomic groups widened in both sexes. Increasing differences were observed for tuberculosis and lung cancer among men, and for uterus cancer, traffic accidents, and overdose mortality among women. The use of an area-based indicator of SES limits the interpretations of the findings. However, despite the possible limitations, these results suggest that social class differences in mortality in Rome are increasing. Time changes in life style and in the prevalence of risk behaviors may produce differences in disease incidence. Moreover inequalities in the access to medical care and in the quality of care may contribute to an increasing differentials in mortality.","2319":"In this paper social differences in health, analysed by different dimensions (perceived health, chronic diseases, functional deficits and disability) and social differences in lifestyle, in particular smoking habit and use of health services for the prevention of some female tumours, are described. The study is based on the data collected in the National Interview Survey on Health Status and Use of Health Care Services, conducted by ISTAT in the 1994. The analysis has been performed separately for males and females, computing Prevalence Rate Ratios (PRR) standardized by age. Educational level and social class, based on Schizzerotto's classification, have been used as determinants of differences in health and lifestyle. Unfavourable perception of health status and most of chronic diseases, referred as diagnosed by a doctor, show an increasing prevalence with decreasing educational level. Less striking differences are observed in the occurrence of injuries and in the restriction of daily life activities caused by diseases. A lower educational level corresponds to a regular increase in the proportion of disabled subjects. Females show higher differences than males in overweight and underweight prevalences in favour of more educated. Smoking habit shows an inverse correlation with education in males and a direct correlation in females, while attempts to quit smoking are more common among more educated individuals. Among women, the tendency to use screening tests for the prevention of some tumours is directly proportional to the educational level. Similar findings were obtained using the social class, with small bourgeoisie and working class showing similar excess risks, compared to bourgeoisie. This study found significant social inequalities in health status and in lifestyle in Italian population in 1994. The discussion argues that in absence of preventive interventions on disadvantaged groups of the population an increase of social differences in health is predictable.","2320":"We evaluate the persistence of social inequalities in overall mortality or mortality by causes (lung cancer, liver cirrhosis; AIDS and overdose) in the Tuscany Longitudinal Study (SLTo), a record linkage-study on the census population identified at the 1981 and 1991 censuses in Leghorn (1981: 175,741 subjects; 1991: 167,512 subjects), and 1991 in Florence (403,294 subjects), Central Italy. The census data allow an evaluation of socio-economic status of each subject, using variables such as education or occupation, or constructing indexes inclusive of deprivation indexes. Follow-up is from the census up to 1995 and for specific causes of death from 1987 (Leghorn) or 1991 (Florence). Estimates of risk are computed comparing rates of mortality among socio-economic groups, by means of poisson regression models, or by means of Standardized Mortality Ratios using the indirect method. The causes of deaths have been selected mainly because explained by known and strong determinants. As far as overall mortality, the results suggest the persistence of gradients by social class, more often negative among males. Mortality from lung cancer has a strong negative social class gradient among males, and a divergent gradient among women in the two towns, which is interpreted as the effect of a different prevalence of smoking by period, social class and sex. High RRs among lower socio-economic groups have been detected for liver cirrhosis mortality. Excess mortality of AIDS and overdose, an expression of the recent drug crisis, concentrates on the lower social strata and in young adults. Whereas mortality from AIDS has been detected among both sexes, deaths from overdose are occurring among males only. Being AIDS and overdose recent diseases, they stress the persistence of social inequalities over time.","2321":"Although the interest for equity is growing, scanty attention has been reserved so far in Italy to health care inequalities. The relation between hospitalization and socioeconomic position in Rome has been studied by evaluating overall heterogeneity and differences in access to effective non-discretionary treatments or at high degree of generic or specific inappropriateness. An area-based socioeconomic index was assigned to 86.4% out of 554.168 discharges of Rome residents identified during 1997 through the hospital information system. The analysis was performed by comparing standardized hospitalization rates across socioeconomic groups through linear trends and risk ratios. A significant inverse relation of overall hospitalization with socioeconomic position was observed for both acute admissions (+44% for most deprived males) and day hospital (+25%). No difference was found in use of effective treatments such as admissions in coronary care units for acute myocardical infarction or surgery for hip fractures. The inverse relation between socioeconomic position and acute hospitalization blunted in day hospital for inguinal hernia repair and actually reversed for cataract removal among females. The hospitalization risk for minor skin diseases, an ambulatory care sensitive condition, resulted inversely associated to socioeconomic position. An excess of hospitalization was also observed for poorest females undergoing appendectomy. Results indicate that observed heterogeneity between socioeconomic groups does not depend only on different health needs but also on an unequal utilization of services: although disadvantaged groups have equal access to treatments of non-discretionary effectiveness, they hardly use innovative services and are more vulnerable in receiving unnecessary treatments.","2322":"Data available from the standard hospital discharge database (SDO) allow us to explore differences in health conditions according to different indicators of socioeconomic status (SES). We analysed all the patients aged 30-59, discharged from the S. Giovanni Battista (Molinette) hospital (the main general hospital in Turin, Italy) during three years (1996-1998) (n = 49949). Three health indicators were used as outcomes: a) emergency admission; b) severity of illness (according to the \"All Patient Refined DRGs\" subclasses); c) hospital mortality. Patients were compared for each outcome according to two different SES indicators: a) level of education; b) employment status. Logistic regression models (both conditional and unconditional) were used to adjust for several potential confounders. Patients with lower education (up to 5 years of schooling), compared to those with 13 or more years of schooling, showed a higher probability of being admitted through the emergency ward (29.1% vs 23.3%), with an odds ratio (OR) = 1.56-95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.45-1.68; of being classified in higher severity subclasses of illness (23.3% vs 17.7%, OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.07-1.22) and of dying in hospital (2.3% vs 1.6%). However, after adjustment for other prognostic factors (as severity of illness and specific expected mortality), this association disappeared (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.84-1.32). Similar, but somewhat stronger, associations were observed when comparing the unemployed versus the employed. The corresponding figures (ORs; 95% CI) were 1.57 (1.42-1.74) for emergency admission; 1.31 (1.18-1.45) for severity of illness and 1.55 (1.10-2.16) for hospital mortality. In conclusion, this study showed that SES differentials in health are clearly measurable through routine hospital information systems, and documented that patients of low SES, particularly unemployed, experienced a delayed access to hospital, were admitted in poorer general health conditions and had a more unfavourable prognosis.","2323":"FOREGROUND: A national deprivation index suitable for geographical analysis of inequalities in health is not yet available in Italy, although the link between deprivation and health has been clearly demonstrated in our country in a number of studies. 1) To describe a deprivation index in Italy at municipal level, based on the percentage of selected census variables (simple components) 2) To analyse general mortality according to deprivation categories at municipal level in Italy 3) To measure the size of ecological bias using the Turin Longitudinal Study.

Factorial analysis were performed in order to help in selecting the most valuable ones. The final choice led to five indicators (low education, unemployment, rented occupier housing, no indoor bathroom, lone parent with childhood). A simple additive index was computed using the method of the sum of normal standard deviates of each component 2) Correlation of indexes with mortality was performed; SMR for each deprivation category were computed; 3) Computation of the index at different levels: individual (one million individuals), census ward (3657 wards), statistic zone (92 statistic zones), two neighborough levels (23 and 10 neighboroughs) was conducted; differential analysis was performed for each level and index category, allowing for comparison among results, adjusting for age. Increasing deprivation was significantly associated with mortality from all causes: there was up to a 20 percent increase in mortality between the highest and lowest quintile. The relationship was linear with no apparent threshold. The slope of the relationship between deprivation and mortality varied among regions. Differentials in inequalities measured by individual and census tract level resulted to be very small; ecological bias arises when larger areas are taken into account. An area based measure of deprivation has proved a valuable tool in examining differentials in death and is likely to prove of continuing value to health authorities in planning the delivery of health care.

The two studies share the same methodology. Each database contains census data, information from population register and from death certificates. The authors approach this issue not in an analytical way (as they did in the works cited in the reference list), but answering some questions, relevant both from a scientific and a political point of view. How big are the health inequalities in Italy? Are the health inequalities in Italy increasing or decreasing? Are the health inequalities due to absolute or to relative deprivation? Does the mortality profile of the Italian population express the presence of old or new health inequalities? Can the health inequalities be reduced? The study's results prove that the health inequalities in Italy are deep and strictly related to individuals' position in the social fabric. Facing the other questions the authors focus only in the Turin data. From the 1970's to the 1990's the health inequalities in Turin have increased, despite of general improvement of population's health condition and the progressive reduction of the size of deprived groups. Turin data support both the hypotheses on the source of health inequalities, using long term unemployment as absolute deprivation's indicator, and status' inconsistency as (a row) indicator of relative deprivation. The growth of drug-related causes of death (AIDS and overdose) shows that in the Turin and--quite reasonably--Italian population old and new health inequalities live together. The essay closes offering evidence on the possibility to reduce health inequalities. For this purpose the authors analyses the Turin trend of avoidable deaths and infant and adolescent mortality.","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"Low-back (lumbosacral) injuries are known as one of more important occupational health problems in health care workers, because of high prevalence and impact of socioeconomic costs.

The adapted study design was the matched (1:1 for age) case-control, enlisting the first injuries occurred in the hospital staff like cases, and personnel in force, matched for age and year of happened case, like controls. Information about diagnoses and occupational data was obtained from the current informative systems.

The risk of occupational injury is not homogeneously allocated into the hospital, and significatively prevails in the orthopaedic wards, in the plaster-rooms, in the operating blocks and in the sterilization plants. Specific manual handling were associated with an increased risk of back pain, while some non occupational factors like cigarette smoking, previous trauma leading to hospital admission, and number of children in female, were resulted weakly associated.","2331":"","2332":"The Canton Ticino is one of the Swiss cantons with the highest number of foreigners (mainly Italians): roughly 25% of the entire canton's population. The aim of this work, which is part of a wider study on the immigration problem in Switzerland, is to evaluate whether the immigrant population in the Canton Ticino presents differences in death rates, both in general and according to cause of death, with respect to the Swiss population. Crude and standardized death rates were calculated for autochthonals, Italians and other foreigners, using data on those deceased in the Canton during 1991 and 1994. Higher death-rates (both sexes and all age groups, except 0-19 years) were calculated for almost all causes of death, of the Swiss group with respect to Italians and other foreigners. The low death-rates found in the immigrants may be due, at least partially, to the \"healthy emigrant\" effect. This effect seems to be stronger than the effect of the often negative factors to which immigrants are exposed in the host country.","2333":"The probability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission is one of the key epidemiological parameters in the spread of the AIDS epidemic. The understanding of its possible determinants is necessary for a thorough interpretation of epidemic dynamics and for the evaluation of alternative strategies to control the epidemic. We carried out a bibliographic review of the main studies reporting data on the probability of HIV transmission through sexual contacts and parenteral routes (by transfusion of blood and blood products, by occupational exposures among health care workers, by sharing needles among injecting drug users). Different values of probability are associated to different routes of transmission. The observed high variability depends on the viral load, on the biological fluid (blood or mucous secretions) through which the virus is transmitted and on several other factors related to source infectiousness and to individual susceptibility, both common to all routes of exposures and specific to each of them. It is currently too early to forecast how the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment, which strongly reduce the viral load in patients with HIV infection, will modify the probability of transmission. Therefore, the compliance with recommended preventive measures still represents an indispensable way to contrast the virus spread.","2334":"Day hospital (DH) is an intermediate way of assistance between ambulatory activity and ordinary hospitalization, with the object of increasing efficiency of hospital services.

Therefore, we have analyzed 100 case sheets, regarding medical DHs, selected at random among the DHs performed in the year. Our analysis has evidenced that 67.7% of DHs had only one access and in 37% of accesses only one service has been performed. 31.1% of DHs required only clinical evaluation, laboratory analyses, ECG or chest X-ray. 59% of DHs had diagnostic reasons, only 10% therapeutic reasons. Only in 35 of the 75 patients who used DH (46.6%), DH was the only recovery in the year, the others have been recovered more than one (from 1 to 6).

PRINCIPAL OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients undergoing a laboratory or other diagnostic tests during three six months periods before guidelines implementation (baseline), during the six months of the implementation phase and during the following four months of adoption of the guidelines in the participating centres. During the four months following the implementation, we observed a reduction of 15% (95% CI: 1%-27%) in the use of azotemia, and a reduction of 34% (95% CI: 18%-50%) for coagulation tests. Corresponding figures for glycemia and chest x-ray indicated a reduction of 44% (95% CI: 32%-54%) and of 22% (95% CI: 8%-34%), respectively. As for other tests (creatinine, ECG), no statistically significant reduction was observed. Most of the observed effect was explained by a reduction in use in patients at a low risk (ASA 1 and 2). In addition, guidelines appeared to have a greater impact in the four small (i.e. &lt; 200 beds) hospitals, as compared with the two centres of greater size. Consistently with the empirical evidence available in this area, this study suggests that guidelines can change clinical practice, when they are implemented through a strategy taking into account adaptation of the recommendations to local circumstances and involvement of health professionals.

To identify persons with AIDS (PWAs) among notified TB cases, a record linkage with the National AIDS Registry was performed. From 1955 to 1993, the TB mortality constantly decreased by a mean of 7.6% per year. From 1955 to 1995, the crude annual total incidence of TB decreased from 25.26 to 9.12 per 100,000. The trend of decrease of pulmonary TB ceased in 1980, whereas the incidence of extrapulmonary TB began to markedly increase in 1980. Between 1992 and 1995, the average annual meningitis notification rate in children &lt; five years was 0.045 per 100,000. In 1995, the curve of incidence rates by age shows two peaks (&gt; 75 years and 25-34 years). Persons with AIDS and foreigner-born persons represented in total 11.3% of TB cases (1992-1995); in the age class 25-34 years, this proportion was 32.5% (34.1% in 1995).

Data were extracted from the Lazio HIS run by the Regional Health Authority. The HIS database includes up to four diagnoses and surgical procedures (ICD-9); the following variables were considered a priori risk factors: type of ischemic disease, comorbidities, and others surgical interventions during the same admission. Logistic regression was performed in order to evaluate the association between hospital and risk of mortality after adjusting for potential confounders (ORs and 95% CI). The overall in-hospital mortality was 4.7% (ranged from 0.0 to 14.7%). Predictors of outcome included: older age, acute myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial ischemia, other heart diseases, chronic renal diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, other heart and vascular interventions. Statistically significant variability in mortality was observed across hospitals; taking hospital A as reference, hospitals D and E showed the highest risks (OR = 6.36 and OR = 3.12, respectively). We conclude that the observed differences in mortality rates among hospitals cannot be explained by differences in case mix, nor by varying coding styles. They are likely to reflect differences in currently unknown aspects of patient care.","2344":"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a recessive autosomic genetic disease with an incidence in mediterranean countries of about 1:3500 born alive. In Italy the considerable genetic variability makes it difficult to identify all the homozygous subjects and, consequently, to estimate the incidence of the disease in healthy carriers. The disease is evolutive and affects various systems, most of all the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Not many years ago, when the clinical definition of CF was first introduced, average survival did not exceed the pediatric age. Nowadays with ever advancing diagnostic and therapeutical techniques many CF patients survive until an adult age. It is therefore necessary to plan adequate health service interventions so as to satisfy as much as possible the needs of both the patients and their families. To this end data collected since 1.1.1988 by the Italian registry for CF (year of birth, sex, region of birth and residence, diagnosis procedures, results of sweat test, pancreatic insufficiency, DNA analysis, status: alive, dead, lost to follow up) of all the patients, diagnosed in the 18 Reference Centres and the 3 local Centres for CF, have proved to be extremely useful.

Expected figures were obtained from mortality rates for the population resident in the region where the plant was located, for each SMR value a 90% confidence interval (CI) was calculated on the assumption of a Poisson distribution. The study detected an increased mortality for primary liver cancer in all three plants; SMR values were 444 in Ferrara (4 Obs. 90% CI 160-1069), 200 in Rosignano (1 Obs. 90% CI 10-869) and 375 in Ravenna (3 Obs. 90% CI 110-1038). In the pooled cohort liver cancer SMR was equal to 364 (8 Obs. 90% CI 108-390). In one plant, Ferrara, observed mortality was above the expected for lung cancer, SMR = 146 (14 Obs. 90% CI 89-229) and for larynx cancer, SMR = 500 (4 Obs. 90% CI 174-1167). One death from pleural cancer was observed in Rosignano (SMR = 1000 90% CI 47-4331). A non significant increase was detected for liver cirrhosis, in Ferrara (SMR 108, 6 Obs. 90% CI 73-332) and Rosignano (SMR 129, 3 Obs. 90% CI 35-332). The study results are confirming the carcinogenic action of vinyl chloride on the liver, they are pointing to its possible role in lung cancer development, as already shown for workers employed in Porto Marghera; an increased risk for larynx cancer is also shown.","2352":"An analysis of death certificates from 1987 to 1996 among residents of the Tuscany Region identified 1518 deaths from pneumoconiosis, the large majority from silicosis, a disease explained by occupational exposure to silica dust. A dozen of deaths are from asbestosis, occurred at younger ages and are concentrated in a restricted area where a cement-asbestos factory was active. Deaths from pneumoconiosis occurred mainly among males, and the rates of the disease are decreasing only in the latest years. About 10% of deaths from silicosis are among subjects dying before 65 years of age. Mortality rates are very high in several areas of the Region, approximating those from lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease. For the above reasons the disease is still of concern from the point of view of public health and actions are suggested to obtain a description of prevalence and incidence of the disease.","2353":"A surveillance programme of exposures and health impairment from work (PRiOR) was developed in Piedmont Region during 1996-97, aiming to: (i) experiment and make available to the health and safety at work services methods and tools to detect currently under-reported cases of work related diseases (disease surveillance); (ii) and build up tools to predict exposure to occupational hazards (hazard surveillance). Within the framework of the disease surveillance system, an active search was carried out in hospital departments for sino-nasal cancer, pleuro-pericardial malignant mesotheliomas, bronchial asthma, and contact dermatitis (the last two diseases only when associated with hypersensitivity to agents possibly entailing occupational exposure). The programme tested and showed the feasibility of such a detection system on a regional basis; a pilot system was set up in order to collect the cases, assess them, and bring them to the attention of the health and safety at work services of the local health authorities. Case detection seems to have been rather complete, and time elapsed from first diagnosis has been kept to a minimum. The exposure histories of the collected cases show exposure patterns not only of historical, but also of current relevance. Evaluating the exposure status either by the occupational histories (neoplastic diseases) or by the hypersensitivity pattern and job title (allergic diseases), the proportion of occupationally exposed cases was remarkably high. At the end of the PRiOR programme, the active search procedures were considered to have yielded positive results. and are going to become a permanent surveillance system.","2354":"","2355":"","2356":"","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"Direct association between obesity and total mortality, has been already established for some cancers especially in women.

Risk seemed to increase from the sixth (odds ratio for BMI &gt; or = 30.0 vs. BMI &lt; 21.7 = 1.0) to the eighth decade (odds ratio = 2.7) of life. Percentages of obesity in Italy by age and geographical area are shown (ISTAT data--Household Multipurpose Survey 1990-91). Percentages of obese women were slightly higher in the South with respect to other Italian areas. Percentage attributable risks according to obesity, by geographical area for women aged 65 years or over, were computed. For South Italy and the Islands, this risk was 8.3 whereas it was 6.7 for Italy. Increased physical activity and reduction of total energy intake may be two preventive measures, especially in the South of Italy and the Islands, against diseases related to obesity.","2360":null,"2361":"Smoking is still one of the greatest causes of premature death in the world. Preventing young people from beginning to smoke is a major public health priority.

Data come from S.I.D.R.I.A.--Italian Studies on Respiratory Disorders in Childhood and the Environment--a collaborative research project which involved 21,846 eight graders living in ten different areas of Northern and Central Italy. Information was provided by both adolescents and parents through ad hoc questionnaires. The response rate was very high (96% for students and 94% for parents). Overall smoking prevalence is 8.8% (95% CI = 7.9-9.7); the prevalence rate is 10.5% and 6.9%, respectively for males and females. Current smoking (&gt; 1 cigarettes\/week) prevalence, 5.1% (6.1% males-4.0% females), is higher then occasional smoking prevalence (&lt; 4 cigarettes\/month), 3.7% (4.4% males-2.9% females). Father's education, household crowding and residence area are associated with students smoking habit. Behavioural variables associated with smoking among students are: parental smoking (OR = 2.11), others smoking in the household (OR = 1.84) and the hours spent in public places with smokers (&gt; 7 hours\/week) (OR = 12.6). These results suggest the need of taking into account the family and social environment in programming health educational activities aimed at reducing smoking among adolescents.","2362":"The relationship between passive smoking and asthma in children and adolescents has been extensively debated. Since cigarette smoking is still widespread in many countries, exposure to passive smoking has a considerable public health importance. We present the results from a large survey conducted in Italy in two random samples of 6-7 yr old children and 13-14 yr old adolescents living in ten areas of Northern and Central Italy (S.I.D.R.I.A.). Standardized questionnaires were filled in by parents of children about respiratory health of their children and their smoking habits. Adolescents filled in a questionnaire about their respiratory health whereas parental smoking data were derived from a questionnaire filled in by parents. Three groups of cases were identified: current asthma, past asthma, and wheeze. Healthy children and adolescents were the control groups. In about 52% of the families at least one parent was a current smoker. Exposure to current smoking increased the risk of current asthma in children. Having both parents smokers increased the risk of current asthma and past asthma. The risk among adolescents were slightly lower with an increased risk of current asthma or wheeze when both parents were smokers. A dose related effect was observed as regards current asthma both in children and adolescents and wheeze in adolescents. Maternal smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of having current asthma and wheeze in children. These results confirm the environmental hazards of parental smoking to respiratory health of children and adolescents, and encourage efforts to reduce smoking in families especially during pregnancy and in infancy.","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"","2366":"","2367":"","2368":"","2369":"Mass media may influence the use of health services either through campaigns promoting the use of specific procedures or through the coverage of health related issues outside the context of a planned intervention. To assess their effect on the utilization of health services a systematic overview of primary research was undertaken. Experimental and quasi experimental studies meeting pre defined entry criteria and providing information on the impact of mass media on objective measures on health services utilization were searched through Medline, Embase, Psychlit, Eric, as well as handsearching key journals. Data on the detail and content of interventions were abstracted and raw data describing health services utilization obtained. Effect sizes were calculated for each study and then pooled across studies on the same topic using a random effects model. Out of 69 papers providing information on the impact of mass media on aspects of health services utilization, 17 interrupted time series met our quality criteria. Fourteen evaluated the impact of formal mass media campaigns, 3 of media coverage of health related issues. The overall methodological quality was rather variable, with 6 studies not performing any statistical analysis, and 7 using inadequate statistical tests (i.e. not taking into account the effect of time trend). All the studies but the concluded positively on the effect of mass media. These positive findings were confirmed by our re-analysis in 7, while in the remaining the effect of mass media was not statistically significant.

Despite the overall limited quality of primary research, this review supports the view that these channels of communication may have an important role in influencing the use of health care interventions. Mass media should be considered as one of the tools that may encourage the use of effective services and discourage those of unproved effectiveness. ","2370":null,"2371":"Proliferation of clinical guidelines has given rise to a number of concerns about the status of clinical advisory statements. Are guidelines advisory or mandatory? What regulatory functions do guidelines serve; do they allow clinical discretion a large enough role? Relationships between legislation and guidelines, and the way courts go about determining the legal status of guidelines, are explained. The following questions in the context of the law of negligence are addressed. Do doctors who deviate from guidelines place themselves at increased risk of being found liable in negligence if patients suffer injury as a result? Could compliance with guidelines protect health care workers from liability in such circumstances? What legal responsibility do the developers and issuers of guidelines have if their guidance is found to be faulty? Common law cases featuring clinical guidelines or protocols have been identified from the databese Lexis, which searches the full text of the transcripts and reports of court cases in UK, Commonwealth and United States jurisdictions. Secondary literature, identified from the bibliography of clinical guidelines maintained by the Department of Health Services Research at the University of Aberdeen (assembled from DHSS-DATA, Embase, Grateful Med, Medline and SIGLE) has also been consulted. The legal status of a guideline turns on whether its development and application have statutory backing, and whether the guideline embodies clinical practices accepted as proper by a responsible body of doctors. The mandatory effects of guidelines can be gauged, to some extent, by the sanctions that apply in the event of non-compliance. US courts have ruled that guideline developers can be held liable for faulty guidelines, and that doctors cannot pass off their liability by claiming that adherence to guidelines has corrupted clinical judgement. Protocols and guidelines provide the courts with examples of clinical standards across a wide range of medical practice. As guidelines proliferate, so they will increasingly be used in court. However, adherence to guidelines has not automatically been equated with reasonable practice, and the courts seem unlikely to follow the standards enunciated in clinical guidelines without critically evaluating their authority, flexibility and scope of application. What usually is done may be evidence of what ought to be done ... but what ought to be done is fixed by a standards of reasonable prudence, whether it is complied with or not.","2372":"","2373":"","2374":"Practice guidelines can be thought as a \"dynamic technology\", whose characteristics vary according to the specific context of application, the type of social relationships they assume, their implicit or explicit goals. In this light, guidelines can be seen as an operational interpretation of the relationships among social components both within and outside the medical profession. The currently dominant models in terms of development of recommendations for clinical practice, using guidelines respectively as assistance to and administrative control over clinical decision making, seem to be both inadequate because of the social models they implicitly assume: the medical-technical dominance and an external political control over the medical profession, respectively. These models fall short in dealing with the complexity of the health care issues we are facing. As an alternative, the notion of guidelines as development of shared clinical policies is put forward. Development of shared clinical policies relies on: a) use of available empirical evidence, whose qualitative and quantitative limitations are fully acknowledged, as the frame of reference for an open conformation among the different stakeholders; b) the acknowledgement that conflicts among different views and vested interests are an organic component of health care.","2375":"","2376":"","2377":"","2378":"","2379":"","2380":"","2381":"We estimated the Cost Per Avoided Hip Fracture (CPAHF, millions Lira) by osteoporosis treatment, on the basis of a review on randomized controlled trials.

The analysis has been carried out taking the province of Pistoia as a sample and the main sanitarian Florentine structures as a pole of migration in the years 1992-93. The patients suffering from breast cancer were 269 in the two years. The expected number of cases of breast cancer in the province is of 137.25\/year. In the period considered the patients that addressed to Florence were 41.63% while the women remained in the province were 58.36%. The migration toward Florence seems to have been mainly affected by age, since most of the hospitalization in this pole referred to patients younger than 54. The sick women choose to be admitted to Florence irrespective of their residence municipality. The provincial hospitals in which the investigation has been carried out are those of Pistoia and Pescia. As far as concerns the type of intervention carried out in the three sanitarian poles, the surgery of conservative type prevails in Florence, the mastectomies in Pescia, while in Pistoia the two types of interventions show a comparable frequency. From such evidences we can assume the choice of the Florentine pole as a structure for the treatment of breast cancer; also in relation to the fact that in the examined province, in the years considered, a service of radiotherapy was not still active.","2383":"In the period 1989-94, mortality rates for the most important causes of death in people migrated to the Tuscany from other Italian regions were analysed.

For this analysis we classified Italy into Tuscany and five broad areas, each including a number of political regions: North-West, North-East, Centre, South and Islands. The number of person-years for calculation of the mortality risks was based on 1991 census data, which also included information on place of birth and on current residence. The risks of death of subjects born in other Italian areas and resident in Tuscany (\"migrated populations\") in comparison to Tuscany born population were assessed by means of Poisson multivariate regression models. For most sites (particularly for lung and breast), cancer mortality rates were higher among North-West and North-East born people and lower among Centre, South and Islands born people. Gastric cancer mortality was higher in Tuscany born subjects. Cardiovascular diseases mortality was generally lower among people born outside of the Tuscany, with the exception of ischaemic heart disease (higher in North-West and Islands born people). Liver cirrhosis mortality was generally higher in North-West, North-East, South and Islands born subjects (with some differences between males and females). Diabetes mellitus mortality was higher in South and Islands born people. AIDS and opioids overdose mortality was higher in North-West born subjects.

The control group was taken from the lists of children attending family paediatricians. The family history data collection for IDDM and non insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) were obtained by a questionnaire, administered to parents.

The introductory section provides the necessary context of Italian industrialization and occupational health regulation. This is followed by a review of Italian epidemiological studies of occupational cancer risks, considered in terms of relative measures of risk and Attributable Risk to carcinogenic agents or exposure circumstances. A section attempts to establish the number of workers who have been exposed to carcinogens in Italy and the intensity of their exposures. Several cohort and case-control studies have addressed the issue of occupational risks, mostly among male workers. The results of these studies suggest that the growing incidence of and mortality by mesothelioma is explained by the widespread and intense exposure to asbestos in some Italian industrial settings. A high Attributable Risk of lung tumors among male populations in industrial areas of northern Italy is explained by occupational exposures. However, insufficient data are available for the clear definition of the extent and intensity of occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances. In Italy, we need to prioritize and maximize resources in occupational cancer epidemiology and to revitalize the role of national institutions. Recent legislation has established new regulations on the handling of carcinogenic substances in industrial settings, a new list of occupational diseases, and a national registry of mesothelioma linked to asbestos exposure. These legislative changes are expected to have positive effects.","2386":"The cause-specific mortality of 233 asbestos cement workers employed by the Fibronit company in Bari and compensated for asbestosis was investigated.

Common measures of reliability and accuracy and (the latter only for slides on which a consensus diagnosis was reached corresponding to the histological diagnosis) were calculated; three new indices of diagnostic variability were also computed. Consensus diagnosis among representatives of participating laboratories on about 90% of the slides was reached both in the first and in the second phase. On 3 slides it was impossible to reach a consensus diagnosis even among external referees. In both phases, the study showed a marked variability among diagnoses, recommendations and judgment on diagnostic difficulty and, on some slides, a worrying lack of reliability in the determination of precancerous lesions.

The results of the first year of activity show that a population-based registry of patients on chronic dialysis treatment can be an useful tool for service planning and epidemiological research.","2402":"To investigate attitudes of medical students from the first, fourth and sixth year towards information of patients in clinical research and practice settings. A multiple-choice questionnaire was administered. Responses were registered on anonymous response-forms. The study was conducted at the two Schools of Medicine of Naples, in southern Italy. 773 students answered the questionnaire. Students believe that the quality of patient care is better within than outside a clinical trial, but anxiety and fear are the most frequent reactions to the idea of being offered the opportunity of participating, as patients, in a clinical trial. The patients' right to be informed of their participation in a clinical experiment is omitted by 30 to 50% of students. The majority of students believe that doctor's uncertainty should not be disclosed. About one-third believe that possible benefits of treatment should not be presented to patients and about one-fifth believe that information on possible drawbacks of treatment should be omitted. Many students believe that information on alternative types of treatment should be denied to patients entering a trial. Fourth year students consistently reported the highest percentage of negative responses. In clinical practice, as compared with clinical research, there is a higher tendency of students to give information to patients. The doctor's role is predominant when students indicate who should decide how much information to give to a patient entering into a clinical trial. Medical education should focus more closely on uncertainty and error analysis; principles of medical research and ethics should be covered throughout academic medical training. ","2403":"Italy finds itself one of the world's leading countries for alcohol consumption. This problem is particularly relevant amongst adolescents. In the past 20 years many preventive interventions of alcohol abuse, addressed to adolescents, have been realized mainly in the United States. To evaluate the effect of educational preventive interventions addressed to youths from 10 to 18 years old on alcohol use. We have done a systematic review of articles indexed on Medline between 1983 and July 1995. We also consulted the bibliography of the articles retrieved for further references. Randomized controlled trials using alcohol consumption as outcome measure have been included. Of the 100 articles found only 21 were included, in which 27 preventive programs, using 5 different types of intervention, were evaluated. Only 3 resulted effective on all the outcome measures utilized and 6 were partially effective. Overall the methodological quality was low. The low methodological quality and the great variability of outcome measures utilized made it difficult to compare the results of different studies and impossible to reach definitive conclusions. All the studies were done in the United States and therefore their results cannot be presently generalized to Italy. Consequently, prior to implementing expensive prevention programs in the Italian schools, it would be opportune to perform further well-designed effectiveness trials.

The necessity for a multivariate concept of causation is emphasized. On the epidemiological side, divergences of clinical approaches from requirements for meeting preconditions for cause are each illustrated by several examples. Association is discussed in terms of comparability of groups, independent observation of associated variables, sampling and measurement. Securing time order among variables is a matter of sequential positioning by design, and the difficulties that inhere in the clinical situation are again illustrated by example. On the clinical side, strengths in generating hypotheses, in discovery of associations without conventional comparison and in potential precision in measuring outcomes are outlined. On the epidemiological side, the discipline adds to clinical medicine unique dimensions analogous with the basic biomedical sciences. These are essential to capturing environmental causes and the antecedent experience of sick individuals. Convergence between the two perspectives is bound to yield, and has yielded, much profit.","2411":"There have been significant developments in epidemiologic methodology during the past century, including changes in basic concepts, methods of data analysis, and methods of exposure measurement. However, the rise of modern epidemiology has been a mixed blessing, and the new paradigm has major shortcomings, both in public health and scientific terms. The changes in the paradigm have not been neutral but have rather helped change- and have reflected changes in-the way in which epidemiologists think about health and disease. The key issue has been the shift in the level of analysis from the population to the individual. Epidemiology has largely ceased to function as part of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the causation of disease in populations and has become a set of generic methods for measuring associations of exposure and disease in individuals. This reductionist approach focuses on the individual, blames the victim, and produces interventions that can be harmful. We seem to be using more and more advanced technology to study more and more trivial issues, while the major causes of disease are ignored. Epidemiology must reintegrate itself into public health and must rediscover the population perspective.","2412":"","2413":"","2414":"","2415":"","2416":"","2417":"","2418":"","2419":"Health administrators are aware that the adoption of prevention programs of proven efficacy does not, by itself, guarantee good results as several factors can reduce effectiveness in a specific contest. Outcome evaluation and performance monitoring is thus growing, also with the aim of a more efficient resource use. On these premises, we describe a proposal for performance monitoring of smoking prevention programs, developed from literature and original data from the authors. The system is made of three components: a) five questions to assess smoking behavior (internal coherence, (Cronbach alpha = 0.731; k ranging from 0.39 to 0.76): b) two indicators (smoking prevalence and precentage of students reached): c) theorical and practical (number to sample according to population size) information for homogeneous and efficient cluster sampling. Performance is evaluated on account of three possible determinants of the results and explicit criteria are given to reach five possible decisions. The system was tested in five Health Districts of the Emilia Romagna Region with a population of 6370 8th class students and guided further planning and implementation. Further implementation and use of the system will give us information about the utility of this proposal, that could also be adopted as a model for the evaluation of other school prevention programs.","2420":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and a public health concern in many developing countries. The main risk factor is the chronic carriage state of the hepatitis B virus which is found in about 20% of the adult population in many African and Asian countries. Other important risk factors are HCV infection, aflatoxin exposure and alcohol consumption. The Gambia Hepatitis Intervention Study was launched in 1986 with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of the hepatitis B vaccination, given in early infancy, in preventing HBV infection, its chronic carriage status, and later, HCC. For this purpose, a randomised vaccine trial was designed and carried out. Over a period of four years a total of 124.577 children were recruited, one half received the usual EPI vaccines (BCG, DTP, OPV, measles, yellow fever) and the other half the hepatitis B vaccine in addition to the EPI ones. Hepatitis B vaccination has been successfully integrated into the \"Expanded Programme of Immunization\" in The Gambia, since every new born baby can receive this vaccination in addition to the EPI vaccine. The first mid point evaluation showed that in four-year-old children, hepatitis B vaccine efficacy was 84% in preventing infection and 94% in preventing chronic carriage status of HBV. Other mid point evaluations are still ongoing. A nationwide Cancer Registry was set up to detect HCC cases in the cohort under study. Follow-up through the Cancer Registry is planned for the next 30 years.","2421":"A cost-effectiveness analysis has been conducted in order to evaluate effects and costs of a nationwide mammographic breast cancer screening programme compared with no screening in a 30 years period. The analysis includes seven different phases of breast cancer, from the screening programme itself to the treatment of terminal illness. The estimates use italian published data and field studies. The calculations were performed with the Miscan computer simulation package: a programme providing for the screening of women aged 50-69 at two years intervals might be expected to result in a 1,650 deaths prevented and 14,500 years of life gained each year. The overall net costs of the programme were assessed at between 2,893 and 3,212 thousand million lire, the cost per life saved between 59.8 and 66.4 million lire and the cost per life-year gained between 6.6 and 7.3 million lire (between 10.7 and 11.5 million lire with a 5% discount rate, an estimate lower than that of German programme).

Birth and residence in volcanic areas were associated with approximately two-fold elevated KS risks. If not due to chance, increased risk in the presence of volcanic soil can have different interpretations, including local immune impairment and correlation with unknown environmental or genetic KS predisposing factors.","2423":"We have conducted a review of the literature on chemical exposures (known carcinogens), mutations in oncogenes\/tumor suppressor genes and the occurrence of malignancies. The underlying hypothesis of the studies on this issue is that specific carcinogenic chemicals induce specific mutations in relevant genes (\"fingerprints\") and that the latter are involved in the causal pathway that leads to cancer. The confirmation of such hypothesis is conditioned by limitations of the available techniques, and by the design of the epidemiological studies. We discuss methodological problems inherent in the identification of oncogene mutations within studies in humans, such as the limited sensitivity of molecular techniques, which may lead to a bias toward the null. Although several studies--concerning mainly lung or bladder cancer and tobacco smoking or some occupational exposures--give support to the theory of \"fingerprints\", further evidence is warranted.","2424":"In the present issue, the report \"L'assistenza sanitaria all'estero-rapporti economici nei confronti dei Paesi CEE\" by the Italian Health Ministry has been examined. The frequency and the cost of the health migration among Italy and other countries of the European Community during 1990-1993 has been presented. The migration of foreign patients to Italy was in agreement with tourism. About 35-40% of the Italian patients cured in the European Community were tourists. The others were patients migrated to obtain specialised treatments not available in Italy. The most frequent causes of migration were cancer, emathological diseases and radiotherapy, followed by transplants, neurological, cardiovascular and orthopaedic diseases. France was the most frequent destination. The overall cost of Italian health migration was 229 Pounds miliard in 1990, 300 Pounds miliard in 1991, and 264 and 216 Pounds miliard in 1992-1993. In the period analysed in the ministerial report, migration seemed to reduce. Migration however was still important especially from the South of Italy.

All the same, it is quite difficult to identify parametres and indicators to be used in the evaluation and quantification of DH, so that both scientific literature reporting experiences and law are lacking. One of the reasons is probably due to the lack of nosological characterization of patients and protocols of DH activity, so that the definition relies only on organizational and technical parameters. Characterization of protocols of intervention is the basic approach to the present DH investigation. Parameters such as: multiplicity of services, weekly planning of the activity and surveillance needed by the patient are considered the fundamental criteria to identify and quantify DH in the present research carried out at the University Regional Hospital of Pisa. The aim of this article is, on one side, to give a methodology of investigation based, as far as possible, on \"explicit\" indicators and parameters, so that the experience may be exported into other contexts and on the other, to give an example of resource analysis and efficiency evaluation which were internally used for \"audit\" review.","2429":"Immunization status to the three types of poliovirus, to tetanus, diphtheria and measles was evaluated in a Gypsy population living at a Roman camp. Information about demographic data and history of immunization was collected from 149 subjects and a blood sample was obtained from 86 individuals to determine antibody titres to the above mentioned infectious agents. Among the responders, only 20.8% had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV), tetanus and diphtheria vaccine, while none was vaccinated against measles. In spite of a low immunization coverage, serological data showed high prevalence of antibodies to the three types of poliovirus (81.4% to polio type 1:94.2% to polio type 2:62.8% to polio type 3) and to measles (76.7%), while antibodies to tetanus and to diphtheria were detected respectively only in 3.5% and 0% of the individuals tested. High levels of antibodies to polio were found also among unvaccinated subjects. For these, a statistically significant positive correlation between age and number of \"contact doses\" from vaccinated family members was observed (r = 0.70; CI 95%: 0.27-0.90). In conclusion, this study uncovers very low levels of immunization to poliovirus, tetanus, diphtheria and measles in the study Gypsy population, and shows the effects of the secondary spread of the OPV, which probably contributed to reduce the risk of contracting the disease in unvaccinated individuals.","2430":"An overview of the epidemiology human echinococcosis\/hydatidosis is presented for the Emilia-Romagna region during the period 1989-1993.

Students were enrolled in either the intervention or the control group, based on the participation of their teachers to the educational programme. A total of 428 students were involved in the programme representing the intervention group, and 658 students not involved in the programme formed the control group. The health education programme included the prevention of alcohol abuse in the first school year (1989-90) and the prevention of tobacco smoking in the second year (1990-91). Each part of the programme included a series of lessons taken by the teachers for about 20 hours. Alcohol use and smoking habits, knowledge about, and attitudes toward alcohol and tobacco use of the students have been assessed by anonymous questionnaires. The questionnaires have been administered during school time at the beginning and the end of each school year, giving a total of 6 questionnaires, from Q1 to Q6.

This study shows an analysis of all physiological deliveries (581 women) at the Burresi Hospital of Poggibonsi (SI), Italy, in 1993. From 1984, in this hospital an experimental delivery-room (SPN), where new methods of delivery-assistance are tested (151 women in the period of study), has been used in parallel with a conventional delivery-room (SP)(430 women). The most important difference between the two environments is that in SPN the woman is free to choose her positions during all the phases of delivery. We have evaluated the effect of the different environments on the perineal outcome-intact perineum (41% SPN vs 32% SP), first-degree tears (32% SPN vs 21% SP), second-degree tears (23% SPN vs 21% SP) and mediolateral episiotomy (3% SPN vs 26% SP). Age of the woman, weight of the infant and parity appeared to be most important factors for perineal tears. The SPN reduces significantly the number of perineal tears, when allowing for the other factors. It was commonly felt that a reduction in the episiotomy-rate increases the number of perineal tears. Our study shows a protective effect for all levels of perineal outcomes associated with the natural delivery-room. However, for primiparous women a higher risk for first-degree tears is documented in the SPN and should be further evaluated.

All indications were approved by the panel: no patient was treated outside established indications (85.6%) or a clinical trial protocol (14.4%). Standard schedules were initially applied to each indication, and were adjusted if needed according to the clinical response. In conclusion, the audit showed that IFN-alpha was correctly prescribed in our teaching hospital; the procedure was well accepted and its application may be useful in modifying prescribing attitudes.","2528":"","2529":"","2530":"In this paper the A.A. illustrate the methodology and development of an evaluation programme of hospital discharge medical records data base quality to implement the DRG system.

The A.A. realized a raise in the compilation level between the two analises, particularly as regards the trascription of surgical procedures and\/or diagnostic and therapeutic procedures passed from 39.9% at 64.1%, and a greater correctness in the primary diagnosis coding passed from 69.9% at 83.3% and in the surgical procedures and\/or diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (coding) passed from 88.7% at 93.7%.","2531":"The study presents mortality rates for lung cancer in the town of Casale Monferrato, where the largest Italian asbestos cement-plant was located. Cases of lung cancer dying in 1989-94 were exhaustively searched for in the register of deaths. Each case of lung cancer has been identified as ever or never employed in the factory with a linkage to the rosters of employees in the plant. Women were also identified as ever or never married to an asbestos-cement worker. The number of person-years at risk for asbestos cement workers and their wives was measured on the basis of the most recent follow-up. Mortality rates were computed separately for those exposed (workers and wives of workers) and for those with no evidence of exposure. Mortality rates for non-exposed were similar to rates in Piedmont (the region where Casale is located). The relative risk (ever exposed vs. never exposed) was 2.8 among men and 2.1 among women. Attributable risk among the exposed was 64.5% for men and 53.1% for women while among the general population it was 18.1% for men and 13.2% for women. The study confirms the dramatic effect of occupational asbestos exposure in Casale Monferrato but does not suggest an increase in lung cancer mortality among people with no occupational activity in the asbestos-cement production.","2532":"This paper investigated differential direct costs determined by the difference between implementation of mammographic screening program for breast cancer detection in the city of Florence (PFD) and the \"absence\" of the PFD. The involved resources have been identified, quantified and evaluated. The results of the I round (1991\/92) of the PFD involve the following different phases: invitations, mass screening, diagnostic assessment. Differential net costs aumonted to 780 million for total cost, and to 53,000 per screened woman. The PFD invited 27,325 women per year; at the I round, the PFD registered an attendance rate of 53.9% and a recall rate of 4.3%, with a total cost of about one thousand million and a cost per screened woman of about L. 64,000. Instead, economic results of alternative \"absence\" of screening registered a total cost of 170 million and a cost per screened woman of about L. 100,000. Costs for detected cancer amount about to 8.2 million for PFD and 5.7 million for \"absence\" of the Program. Sensitivity analysis has been performed texting the fundamental parameters of the PFD: attendance rate, recall rate and life time average of the investiments. The sensitivity analysis, performed on the PFD, registered a variation of total cost from 859 million to 1,216 million and a variation of the total cost per woman screened from L. 43,500 to L. 80,000. Sensitivity analysis results highlighted the fundamental role played by women's attendance and by the percentage of women recalled for diagnostic assessment.","2533":"In this paper we evaluate the principal direct costs (staff, capital and maintenance equipment, supplies, hardware and software system, mail, advertising campaign) of the mammographic screening programme \"Prevenzione Serena\" (Torino), from the recruitment time to the diagnostic assessments of screen positive cases. On the basis of the annual situation of a screening Unit which supplies two-view mammographies, read by two radiologists, and of a 60% attendance rate and a 5% recall rate, we estimate a total annual cost of 1.4 thousand million lire (875,000$), a cost per invited woman of 38,600 lire (24$), per tested woman of 64,400 lire (40$) and per breast cancer detected of 9.2 million lire (5,750$). Staff accounts for about 60% of the total cost.

However, a low perception of this risk among health care workers (HCWs) and a low compliance to infection control measures has been documented by several studies. During a meeting of gynecologists of Southern Italy, a survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices (K.A.P.) on HIV and other blood-borne viral infections was conducted among 143 obstetricians-gynecologists. 133 (93%) HCWs answered the questionnaire. 81% of them recalled almost one occupational exposure during their career and 54% almost two in the past year. Our data suggest a low knowledge about HIV and the other blood-borne viral infections and Universal Precautions (UP): only 16% of HCWs knew the rate of vertical transmission of HIV, less than 15% knew the rate of seroconversion after occupational exposure to HBV and HCV, and finally only 33% knew to which body fluids apply UP. Moreover, 93.7% of HCWs believed that HIV antibody screening of all patients is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of occupation HIV infection. More than 90% of gynecologists used to request HIV-antibodies to pregnant women, 21% after the first trimester. Although HCWs interviewed can not be considered representative of Italian gynecologists, our data suggest the need of an intensive training to increase gynecologists' knowledge about HIV, other blood-borne pathogens and the risk of occupational infections also in order to modify attitudes and practices.","2541":"A study into the smoking habits of the Nursing School students of Bologna Province was carried out. 1077 (97.8%) of all students answered the self administered questionnaire and 44.6% of them were current or occasional smokers. 37.2% of males and 31.1% of females were current smokers. Overall nurse students smoked in a greater proportion in respect of coecal young people and females were generally lighter smokers and smokers of light cigarettes.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the extent to which the clinical diagnosis of stillbirth cause reported in certificates can be considered sensitive and specific. Eighty-five consecutive stillbirths were independently classified by two neonatologists with certificate information, using the new Wigglesworth classification, and the reliability of the classification process was evaluated. Afterwards we compared the classes made with certificate causes and the ones made with clinical-autoptic data (the \"gold standard\") and we estimated sensitivity and specificity of certificate cause of stillbirth. The reliability of the classification process was very high. Values of sensitivity were considered unacceptable, mainly in the field of congenital malformations, intra-partum asphyxia and other specific causes. By contrast, specificity was found to be satisfactory. The accuracy of clinical stillbirth diagnosis is not sufficient and good description needs the contribute of post-mortem necropsy.","2543":"Information on the health condition job related of the population are often collected in specific studies, usually limited over time and concerned with a small part of the general population. Looking at official statistics, sources such as national health surveys (in Europe and in North America) are rich on health data, but often offer little information on job-conditions, and job history. On the other hand, one also can find official sources, mainly concerned with labour and job related topics, in which information related to the health status of the people interviewed are routinely collected. These are the Labour Force Surveys, carried out in the most of developed countries. In the Italian Labour Force Survey (RTFL) the Italian Statistical Institute (ISTAT) quarterly collects information on health-related sick absence, part-time job and unemployment. Data from RTFL of two Italian regions (Lombardy: 1985, '86, '89 and Veneto: 1985, '86) show differentials by age and job-position that are consistent with expectation, encouraging an extensive use of this source for surveillance purposes at the national and regional level.","2544":"This paper discusses the utilization of MDC and DRG for the evaluation of the activities of surgical divisions.

In many instances, the health agency will not be able to demonstrate an excess of the condition in question or establish an etiologic linkage to an exposure. Nevertheless, a systematic, integrated approach is needed for responding to reports of clusters. In addition to having epidemiologic and statistical expertise, health agencies should recognize the social dimensions of a cluster and should develop an approach for investigating clusters that best maintains critical community relationships and that does not excessively deplete resources. Health agencies should understand the potential legal ramifications of reported clusters, how risks are perceived by the community, and the influence of the media on that perception. Organizationally, each agency should have an internal management system to assure prompt attention to reports of clusters. Such a system requires the establishment of a locus of responsibility and control within the agency and of a process for involving concerned groups and citizens, such as an officially constituted advisory committee. Written operating procedures and dedicated resources may be of particular value. Although a systematic approach is vital, health agencies should be flexible in their method of analysis and tests of statistical significance. The recommended approach is a four-stage process: initial response, assessment, major feasibility study, and etiologic investigation. Each step provides opportunities for collecting data and making decisions. Although this approach may not always be followed sequentially, it provides a systematic plan with points at which the decision may be made to terminate or continue the investigation.","2552":"To investigate the relationship between air pollution and histologic type of lung cancer we conducted a case-control study among deceased men in Trieste, Italy. 755 cases of lung cancer and 755 controls were identified through the local autopsy registry. Information on smoking habits, occupation and place of residence was obtained from the subject's next-of-kin. Air pollution at the residence of each subject was estimated from the average value of total particulate at the nearest monitoring station. Spatial models and logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of residence and air pollution on LC after adjustment for age, smoking habits, likelihood of exposure to occupational carcinogens and social group. The risk of lung cancer increased with increasing level of air pollution for all types of lung cancer combined (P = 0.022), for small cell carcinoma (P = 0.016) and for large cell carcinoma (P = 0.049). Compared with inhabitants of the residential area, residents of the rural area had a relative risk (RR) of 0.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-1.0). The RR was 1.5 (1.0-2.2) for residents of the center of the city and 1.4 (1.0-2.1) for residents of the industrial area. In the center of the city the excess risk was almost completely restricted to small cell carcinoma (RR = 2.0) and to large cell carcinoma (RR = 2.6). In the industrial area the risk was increased especially for adenocarcinoma (RR = 2.1). These results provide evidence that air pollution is a moderate risk factor for certain histologic types of lung cancer.","2553":"This paper discusses the analysis of the disease risk as function of distance from prespecified exposure sources. Instead of the usual ecological framework, the proposed model is based on individual data and includes the major individual risks factors as covariates. The risk due to environmental exposure is modelled using excess relative risk as effect measure, while the effect of individual risk factors is modelled using relative risk. A case-control design is proposed to fit this model and to obtain effect estimates.","2554":"Studying the space-time variation of risk for a given disease may give etiological clues and suggestions for planning further studies to investigate the underlying causes. When the observed events are rare, approaches based on maximum likelihood may lead to unstable and largely uninformative estimates of risk and of its time trend due to Poisson sampling variation. In this paper we propose a general Bayesian model for analyzing the variation of risk in space and time. We applied the Bayesian model to the analysis of the geographical variation of breast cancer mortality, to an ecological study on the correlation between lung cancer mortality and degree of urbanization and industrialization and to the analysis of the space-time variation of cumulative prevalence of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) as observed in military examinations between 1954 and 1989.","2555":"An increasingly common public health problem is the perception that disease incidence has increased or a cluster of disease has occurred in a community.

This procedure is organized in several steps: the definition of the spatial domain and of the spatial distance metrics; the choice of the effect indicator and the standard population; the estimate of the density risk surface via kernel methods; the identification of \"local maxima\"; the analysis of local maxima for cluster detection; the description of the identified clusters. The paper investigates the meaning and the characteristics of spatial clusters, describes the procedure for their identification and discusses the opportunity to use an automated approach for map reading.","2558":"Methods for the analysis of the spatial aggregation of health events has received growing attention under the pressure of public opinion concern and as tools for the identification of potential risk sources, for monitoring relevant geographical areas and, finally, for public health decisions.

This paper is aimed at describing one of the methods proposed for the identification of clusters in the case of information at individual level and at presenting its extension to grouped data. This method, the surface density estimation method using the Kernel approach, offers remarkable advantages in terms of simplicity of implementation and flexibility, this latter being an extremely important characteristic in the case of exploratory analyses. For exemplification purposes, the density estimation method has been applied to individual data concerning the spatial distribution of cerebral tumors in Campi Bisenzio (FI) and to the distribution of gastric cancer mortality in the municipalities around Arezzo and Pesaro.","2559":"The Italian Atlas of mortality at municipality level is the result of a research project coordinated by the Emilia-Romagna region and supported by the Health Ministry. To the realisation of this project have collaborated the Institute of Medical Statistics of Milano and the CILEA under the supervision of Prof. Cesare Cislaghi. Compared to previous equivalent products, this Atlas contains a number of methodological and content innovations. This was a consequence of the development of new statistical methods and the need of achieving different aims. First of all, the Atlas was aimed at describing the mortality at small area level, which is obtained via Kernel estimates; secondly, the objective was to identify suspect clusters of deaths which may suggest the existence of high risk areas. The Mortality Atlas is formed by 31 tables, one for each of the analysed cause of death; each table has a circular shape of 100 hundred kilometers radius and contains a variable number of municipalities; each municipality may be present in more than one circle. The Atlas is available on magnetic support and for each cause of death are provided several statistical analyses and indicators included in different files. One of these files can be directly used to build high quality maps using the graphical package MAPINFO.","2560":"The association between air pollution and hospital admission for chronic respiratory and ischemic heart diseases was analyzed through a case-control approach. The study was based on routinely available data in Ravenna and covered the period 1986-88. A control group (n = 37250) was used to evaluate the specificity of the health effects of air pollution. It included all patients admitted into the hospital for conditions other than respiratory or heart diseases. The adjustment for confounding variables (climatic factors and time variables) was attained by multiple logistic regression. The risk of hospital admission for chronic bronchitis (n = 587) increased of 10% for a 10 ppb increase in SO2 concentration (in the range 0-60 ppb). A similar positive association (OR = 1.2) was observed for exposures to more than 10 ppb of SO2 and hospitalization for ischemic heart diseases (n = 1982). An apparently inverse relationship was found between SO2 pollution and hospitalization for asthma (n = 203). The case-control method can be a useful alternative tool to elucidate specific associations, in comparison with the statistical methods most frequently used in time-correlation analysis.","2561":"This work gives an overview of design and analysis of temporal studies using aggregated data in air pollution epidemiology. In the last years time series are often used to study the short-term association between ambient air pollution levels and aggregated health data. Health endpoints are usually daily mortality and\/or daily hospital admission data from routine health registers. Air quality data are commonly obtained from one (or a few) fixed site monitoring stations. To detect the temporal association between the time-pattern in air pollution and the time-pattern in health data particular attention needs to be given to the autocorrelation structure, to the seasonality and long term trend in the data, and to the weather variables. Poisson regression with autocorrelated residuals is the suitable statistical method to analyze time studies. Furthermore, the pollutant variable can be analyzed at different lag-times to account for short latency periods in the manifestation of diseases. Studies with temporal aggregated data show the same disadvantages of the ecologic studies, although, in this case, confounding is less of a problem. Temporal studies usually are based on a large database, so that sufficient power can be achieved to detect even weak associations. Finally, the exposure information on subjects is often better characterized by short-term fluctuations in ambient air quality than is the case in geographic aggregations.","2562":"Short term effects of air pollutant levels on daily mortality were studied, using time series approach, in Milan from the year 1980 to 1989. The Poisson regression with autocorrelated residuals was applied.

A positive and curvilinear relation (with a logarithmic shape) has been found between total daily mortality and concentration levels for each pollutant. This result confirm a steeper increase in mortality at low concentrations, lower than the international standards in use at the moment.","2563":"In the past few years levels of exposure to environmental agents have lowered and people are often exposed to many different chemicals and mixtures.

Comparison between dry chemistry methods on serum samples and liquid phase methods on the same samples yielded the following correlation coefficients: .991 (n = 100) for total cholesterol, .962 (n = 50) for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, .987 (n = 100) for triglycerides, .997 (n = 50) for glucose, and .991 (n = 50) for uric acid. A 12% overestimation of serum triglycerides was observed with dry chemistry methods as compared to liquid phase methods. Accuracy and precision of these dry chemistry methods were evaluated by daily (n = 271 days) determinations of all the above parameters on each of two reference sera (low and high concentration). Dry chemistry methods average bias estimates (observed value - expected value)\/expected value) x 100, measuring method's accuracy, were: 4.2% for total cholesterol, 1.2% for HDL cholesterol, 3.6% for triglycerides, 3.0% for glucose, 4.6% for uric acid.

The sample included of 181 GPs and 242,564 patients with 1,191,122 prescribed items. The regional Health Data Base is the source of all data. Data analysis was performed according to the multiple regression and LISREL models. We assessed for all GPs the years of medical profession, patients listed, percent of patients exent from prescription rates, patients over 60, number of active compounds prescribed and related drug companies. Two factors, the number of active compounds prescribed and patients listed, significantly contributed to the multiple regression model. The model explained 56% of variation in prescribing pointing out the importance of those factors in influencing the cost per patient. LISREL model shows a causal chain going from the years of medical profession to cost per patient passing through the number of active compounds and drug companies related. In fact, the older the GP the less the cost per patient and number of active compounds used. A main finding is that the cost per patient is highly influenced by the number of different active compounds prescribed. As in other studies the percent of patients exent from prescriptions rates and aged over 60 are somehow fundamental in influencing the cost per patient. Finally we discussed models and literature on the issue.","2582":"A pilot phase of a population-based organized screening programme for cervical cancer was run in Turin, Italy, in May-June 1991. Based on the city population lists, 1181 women 25 to 64 years old were invited in two family clinics. Overall compliance to invitation was 41.7%. In order to study the determinants of compliance, a random sample of 372 compliers and 398 non-compliers was interviewed. Interval since last Pap-test was strongly associated with compliance (ORs of complying were 2.52, 1.53, 1.41, 0.50 and 0.16 for intervals longer than 3 years, 1-3 years, 6 months-1 year, 3-6 months and less than 3 months respectively vs. never having had a Pap-test, p &lt; 0.001). Estimated compliance was 39% among never screened women and 65% among those tested since more than 3 years, leading to an over 70% overall estimated coverage (women who complied or had a spontaneous test within 3 years). On the other hand, the effect of a number of sociodemographic variables (age, education, place of birth, marital status) was very weak or opposite (lower compliance among younger and more educated women) to what we found in a previous study on spontaneous Pap-testing. The clinic allocated to pre-fixed appointments had a higher compliance than the clinic with appointments to be arranged (OR = 2.36 95% c.i. 1.66-3.36). Anxiety caused by periodic controls for early diagnosis of cancer was an important negative determinant of compliance (ORs of complying were 0.85, 0.49, and 0.16 for those with mild, moderate and severe levels of anxiety vs. those reassured by the test). We concluded that personal invitations were actually able to reach those women who have a poor level of spontaneous practice and could reduce the selection in access to this preventive practice.","2583":"The EC Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) design is presented: the survey aim is to estimate asthma prevalence and risk factors distribution in the various European countries population.

In the first stage a random sample was sent a Screening Questionnaire by post; in the second stage a subsample was invited to clinical centres in order to undergo lung function tests, allergy tests and a standardised clinical interview. The analysis of the response pattern in Italy shows that both in stage 1 and in stage 2 a selection bias overestimating real prevalence is present. Some methodological issues concerning the design of cross sectional surveys are addressed.","2584":"Most Italian patients who migrate to foreign countries to receive health care, choose France. The Gustave Roussy Institute (IGR) located in Villejuif, a town in the suburbs of Paris, is one of the most important center for cancer diagnosis and treatment in France. The aim of this issue has been to evaluate the admissions of Italian patients in terms of cause of admission, treatment and area of residence of the patients. We analysed the series of Italian patients admitted to IGR from 1988 to 1991; during that period 8159 Italian patients were hospitalized (2.8% younger than 15 years, 84.3% between 15 and 64 years and 12.9% older than 64 years). Most of those patients were resident in the South of Italy (more than 63%) and in particular they came from the region Sicily (27.4%) and Campania (18.8%). A different pattern seems to distinguish patients coming from the Center and the North of Italy from those from the South. In fact the aim of this migration was, for the former, a consultation on the therapy that they had, in large part, already undergone in Italy while the latter wanted to start their treatment there. The admissions related to the three most frequent cancers (breast, lung, lympho-hemopoietic system) have been analysed. The majority of patients were from the South of Italy. Breast cancer patients have migrated to the IGR looking for a post-surgical treatment while lung patients have been in large part treated for the first time at the IGR.","2585":"As a goal, promotion of public health is quite uncontroversial. But attempts to modify people's lifestyles and life conditions in order to realize this goal bring up a number of ethical conflicts. One such conflict concerns the balance between autonomy and paternalism in the process of changing human behaviour. In this paper a model for analysis of such conflicts is presented and applied to assess anti-smoking policies. The model consists of two dimensions: the first specifies the relevant ethical principles, the second specifies the persons involved in or affected by such policies. My conclusion is that anti-smoking policies cannot be justified by reference to the good of the person whose right to selfdetermination is limited, but only by reference to the need to protect others from that person, i.e. prevent them from being exposed to tobacco smoke.","2586":"","2587":"","2588":"","2589":"The aim of the paper is to present some of the characteristics of the compensation systems in EEC countries and to focus on the compensation of asbestos-related diseases: for each country the diseases admitted for compensation, the date of introduction into the schedule, the number of compensations awarded and a comparison between compensations for mesothelioma and mortality are presented. The data have been collected in 1990-91 by asking for information to the Compensation Institutes. The results suggest that the objective of harmonisation of the compensation systems among European countries is far from being achieved and needs re-vitalisation. The gap between knowledge and public health action has been considerable in the compensation of asbestos-related diseases, especially in the compensation of cancers. The results confirm, therefore, from a different perspective the validity of considering asbestos as a case study in public health. Finally, the Authors stress the serious situation in Italy with respect to updating the list of prescribed diseases as epidemiological data are available and to compensating occupationally related asbestos diseases.","2590":"ECIDC (Expected Cases in Dynamic Cohorts) is a new interactive computerized programme in English for personal computers, created specifically to calculate expected cases in prospective cohort studies. Programmes available up to now have calculated the denominators of measurements of frequency, expressed in person-years, using the recruitment date and exit date of each individual in the cohort. ECIDC, instead, calculates directly the number of expected cases, recognizing only the date of recruitment. The programme considers the aging of the cohort, estimates the effect due to competitive mortality and eliminates the expected deaths. Then, it calculates the expected cases by applying incidence or specific mortality from the reference population. ECIDC considers the period effects of both competitive mortality and expected incidence. When observed reference data is lacking, it compiles estimates of age-specific incidence and\/or mortality trends. ECIDC can be used in power calculation for the cohort study. It also can be applied to simulation studies of incidence and mortality trends. The present paper tries out various simulations and shows the potential of the computerized programme.","2591":"We describe the results of a randomized controlled study on the efficacy of a smoking prevention program based on behavioral methods (Waterloo Smoking Prevention Program 1, adapted). 792 children of 12-13 years of age from the Health District of Rozzano (MI) were the study base. The program was delivered directly by voluntary teachers during school classes. Two follow-up, at 18 and 36 month from the end of the program were conducted using self-administered questionnaire and telephonic interviews. At 36 months the proportion of non-smokers was higher in the intervention group (55% vs 44%; OR (adjusted for clustering) = 1.7; p = .03) and that of regular (at least one cigarette a week) smokers lower (22% vs 39%) than in the control group. We found no difference of effect between males and females students. Social pressure associated with starting to smoke (friends, sibsters, parents smokers) measured before intervention had no demonstrable influence on efficacy. We propose this kind of intervention for Italian students as an effective and low-cost program, even though more research is needed to maintain effectiveness of these kind of programs beyond adolescence.","2592":"The paper presents a risk index constructed on the basis of some sexual behaviour-related variables. It is intended for measuring the risk of exposure to HIV infection for the general population. Variables are from a study on Lifestyle and Health conducted on a sample of the population living in the London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow metropolitan area by the Research Unit in Health and Behavioural Change at the Edinburgh University. The construction of the index has been realized through a delphi study which has collected information from a panel of AIDS national experts. Methodological problems in summarising information coming from several variables are discussed. The main task of the study is not to provide a total prediction of HIV infection in the population of Britain, but to assess the component which may stem from sexual behaviours when estimated from self-reports. Major findings are the consistency of the population in the \"medium risk\" group, that, if a spread of AIDS among the heterosexual population can be hypothesized, gives a rather pessimist scenario. Moreover, a trend analysis (possible because of the continuity in the data collection) shows an increase in this \"medium risk\" group, although the \"high risk\" group appears much less consistent (less than two percent) and slowly declining over time.","2593":"","2594":"","2595":"","2596":"","2597":"The great technological progress in the Neurosciences area, which has appeared in the last few years, can cause, beside obvious scientific and practical advantages, an important risk: in fact, efficiency might be preferred at the expense of efficacy.

Incidence comparisons were made using the Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR). Subjects emigrated from the North-East show SIR higher than the Lombardia-born for lung and oesophageal cancer (smoking and alcohol related cancers).

Although it is wellknown that the framework in which such decision has to be taken is complex, most of the scientific knowledge is based on pieces of evidence that derive from studies where complexity is avoided by applying restriction rules. The goal of this approach is to enhance the internal validity while preserving the generalizability of the findings. But in some cases this approach raises more doubts than certainty. It is the case of the process to assemble practice guidelines to reduce the gap between the best care and what is observed into practice using the available knowledge (i.e., available literature or experts' recommendations). As a variety of relevant clinical and patients' personal characteristics are not available at all or little is known on their impact on patients global health status, variables that actually do drive the practice are not included in guidelines that are intended to change it. This paper introduces the conceptual model of such debate and assesses the impact of co-morbidity--a variable seldom taken into account in effectiveness, quality and appropriateness studies- on the kind of medical care given to a sample of 1019 patients with early stage breast cancer.

A total of 487 drug injectors in 1990, and 450 in 1992 have been interviewed both in the street and in treatment services. Twenty-four percent of the subjects interviewed in 1990 reported having used second-hand syringes in the preceding 6 months, as compared to 14% in 1992; in the two years 29% and 13%, respectively, reported having passed a second-hand syringe to other drug injectors. Fifty-six percent (46% in 1992) of primary partners of drug injectors interviewed were not drug users themselves, while the prevalence of non drug using occasional partners was 34% and 43% in the two surveys. In 1990 condom use with primary partner was reported by 48% of drug injectors, and by 41% in 1992; condom use with occasional partners was 56% and 64% in the two years. The differences in sharing behaviours were observed for HIV-1 positive subjects, while HIV-1 negatives reported the same prevalence of use of second-hand syringes in 1990 and 1992; no statistically significant differences have been found for sexual behaviours among the HIV-1 positives, while the HIV-1 negatives reported a lower prevalence of condom use with primary partner. The observed differences in the two years remain also adjusting for the socio-demographic characteristics of the two populations in a multiple logistic regression model.

Discharge data on 940.670 admissions to 101 public hospitals and 185.161 admissions to 55 private hospitals in the Regione Lombardia in 1990, assigned to HCFA-DRGs, 8th version and to stages and substages of principal and unrelated diagnostic categories, based on Disease Staging. The spread of the case-mix is higher in the private sector, which also shows a higher concentration of admissions across hospital for specific medical and surgical conditions. The proportion of more advanced stages of disease is higher in the public sector, for most of the most frequent diagnostic categories. Obstetric care, including abortion, is the largest single public sector activity, while it is virtually not existent in the private sector. Elective surgical procedures, including ENT, cataract and varicose veins surgery make up a substantial proportion of the private hospitals' case load. DRGs-specific ALOS is longer in public hospitals for the most frequent surgical DRGs, mainly due to their preoperative LOS. The net impact of the proposed contractual scheme will save substantial proportion of beddays for most of the conditions considered, except cataract and varicose veins surgery.

The results show that the gradual decrease of gasoline lead concentrations gives a consistent decrease of blood lead level in the general population. In Italy, in the nonoccupationally exposed subjects, the mean blood lead level in 1974 was 32 mcg\/dl and in 1991 was 8,4 mcg\/dl. The mean value in children is presently about 8,3 mcg\/dl.

The resulting health condition is similar to that of the general population, with a few epidemiological peculiarities of the origin countries (a larger diffusion of tubercolosys and intestinal parasitosis) and with acute problems typical of populations with high mobility (traumatology, respiratory diseases).

For each case the operator registered a subjective opinion regarding the adequacy of the intervention and the difficulties incurred. The information collected, highlights the various types of users of each individual service and the legal and social differences which greatly influence the approach to these services and the subsequent usage.

For this aim, a multiple regression model with a selection procedure for independent variables, of the stepwise type, has been used, where the dependent variable is the daily average intake of the nutrient and the independent variables are the consumption of each food included in the complete questionnaire (QC). By combining the results of the model with the 7 nutrients and total energy, 3 reduced questionnaires have been produced (QR): the first two are based on the sole criteria of the inter-individual variance of the intake of the nutrient, explained by the consumption of the foods included in the QR, the third by adding the foods that offer an adequate contribution in order to explain the supply of the nutrient under examination. The application potentials of the 3 QRs have been analysed both by evaluating the inter-class correlation coefficient, deduced by an concordance\/discordance matrix relative to the quintilis values of the nutrient deduced by the QC and by each QR, and by simulating their use in a case-control study; for this aim, the attenuation of the odds ratio trend and the increase of the sample dimension has been calculated following the use of a QR instead of a complete one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2630":"Trends in cancer risk of the Varese province Cancer Registry from 1976 to 1987 have been considered.

Although animal studies have been most often used for quantitative risk assessment, it is generally recognized that well conducted epidemiologic studies would provide the best basis for estimating human risk. However, there are several features related to the design and analysis of epidemiologic studies which frequently limit their usefulness for quantitating risks. The lack of accurate information on exposure in epidemiologic studies is perhaps the most frequently cited limitation of these studies for risk assessment. However, other features of epidemiologic study design such as statistical power, length of follow-up, selection bias, confounding and effect modification may also limit the inferences that can be drawn from these studies. Furthermore even when the aforementioned limitations are overcome, substantial uncertainty exists concerning the choice of an appropriate statistical (or biologic) model for extrapolation beyond the range of exposures observed in a particular study. An empirical example is provided in which estimates of risk varied by nearly 3 orders of magnitude depending on which functional form of the model was chosen. Modeling of epidemiologic data for QRA should be based upon internal comparisons rather than on modeling Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) when possible. Because of the limitations discussed in this paper, epidemiologic data should not be viewed as a panacea for the problems inherent in using animal bioassay data for QRA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2648":"This paper reviews the economic aspects of screening for breast cancer: from a bibliographic search we identified studies on complete economic evaluation of screening programs in different parts of the world.

Allowing for quality of life, the range is 4,050 to 91,650 dollars. A discussion of some examples of sensitivity analysis shows how, and how much, the results change as a consequence of different assumptions regarding crucial variables: discount rate, reference period of the analysis, frequency of screening, age of the target population, volume of activity of each screening unit, compliance, sensitivity and specificity of the test.","2649":"","2650":"The theme of communicating uncertainty in messages of risk is examined in terms of the dominant goal of mobilizing action.

For each point consequent problem(s) and possible solutions are predefined. The model was tested with the results of the screening program for amblyopia of the Community Health Service of USL 32 Treviglio (BG) assuming 40% and 97% sensitivity of the screening test. For this screening the reduction of effectiveness at the seven critical points ranged from 0 to 60%, with a total reduction of effectiveness to 15.6-37.8%.

These facilities can be basically ascribed to the following patterns: day case surgery; day-hospital activity; home-care. Day case surgery is a complex and, in most cases, interdisciplinary procedure; this type of activity necessitates a pre-hospitalization period and often also a \"protected discharge\" or even a home-care service. Some specific criteria regarding day surgery activity have been defined as follows: the main criteria have a clinical nature, but they interact with others belonging to a social and structural-organizational order. The Royal College of Surgeons of United Kingdom has officially recognized in 1985 this medical care typology as one of the constituents of surgical care, and has evaluated that at least 1\/3 of the overall operations could be carried out as day care surgery. In the United States, besides hospital and ambulatory surgery activity, a new pattern known as \"free-standing center\" has been promoted; in 1993, 35% of the operations is expected to be carried out in day case surgery centers. As far as Italy is concerned, in 1988 only day-hospital practice has been adequately recognized as an alternative medical care facility to traditional hospitalization. The Emilia Romagna region, in order to increase day case surgery activity, has issued in 1991 a list of 53 DRGs, in which day bed units treatment was possible. Up to now, however, only a small part of these diseases is treated on a day case surgery basis.","2656":"Methods and results of a study on quality of the hospital discharge data are described.

Exposure estimates of gas concentrations in the area range from 85 to 0.12 ppm. Of the approximately 200,000 persons exposed, 3598 deaths have resulted as of November 1989. Chronic inflammatory damage to the eyes and lungs appears to be the main cause of morbidity. Reproductive health problems in the form of increased spontaneous abortions and psychological problems have been reported. Questions about the nature of MIC toxicity have been raised by the persistence of multi-systemic symptoms in survivors. Animal studies using radio-labeled MIC given by the inhalation route have shown that the radio-label is capable of crossing the lung membranes and being distributed to many organs of the body.

No large differences exist in incidence and mortality for the whole category of lymphomas among different countries. On the other hand data concerning different subclassifications of lymphomas in different countries are not available. The incidence of NHL increased in recent years in USA and in the European countries. Data from the Cancer Registry in the province of Varese, the registry with the longest high-quality registration period in Italy, indicate the same tendency. Also mortality rates show an increasing trend in Europe and in the USA. The cause of changing in incidence and in mortality rates for NHL are unknown. Anyhow many factors, viral, chemical and immunological are known to be associated to the occurrence of lymphomas. Risk factors and in particular environmental factors are reviewed. Problematic aspects, in relation to methodologies adopted in these studies, are focused.","2659":"","2660":"","2661":"","2662":"","2663":"The results of a study on smoking habits of Florence inhabitants (14 years of age or more) are reported. A random sample of general population of the town (1744 males and 1977 females) was recruited throughout the registration office and interviewed by mail or telephone. General compliance was approximately 85%. Thirty-seven percent of males and 25% of females were current cigarette smokers, 29% of males and 11% of females were ex smokers. Males were heavier smokers both as concerns duration of the habit and daily amount of cigarettes. In males born after 1930 the smoking prevalence decreased gradually by period of birth, while it increased in females born before 1960. As a result the smoking habits of younger cohorts were similar in males and in females. In each sex age-adjusted smoking prevalence showed important differences by educational groups and in respect to national averages.","2664":"A population study on 314 very low birth weight infants (VLBW) was carried out in 1987 in the Lazio Region of Italy to investigate the relation between the availability at birth of neonatal intensive care and infant mortality. Fifty-two percent of VLBW infants did not survive the first year of life. The mortality Odds Ratios, adjusted for four potential confounding variables, did not show a beneficial effect of Maternity units with neonatal intensive care (level 3) compared with those with special (level 2) and normal care (level 1). The overall high crude mortality rate together with the homogeneity of odds ratios among the different levels of care suggest that, when a regionalized perinatal care system is missing, as in Lazio region, the availability of neonatal intensive care, per se, does not improve the survival on this group of infants.","2665":"The reliability of the death certificates issued in Ragusa for 379 of the 909 cancer patients registered in 1986 by the Ragusa Cancer Registry, who had died within 31 october 1988, was investigated. Data were available for 365 cases deceased. A consistent proportion (32.8%) of disagreements between diagnosis of the Registry and cause of death reported on death certificate was observed, concerning errors of the second and third digit of ICD-9 (21.9%) and for lack of mention of cancer in the death certificate. The main causes of the loss of information were the issuing of the certificate by a M.D. of the permanent medical ward and not by the family doctor, and the lack of the document released by the hospital upon discharge of the patient, usually containing indication on diagnosis and treatment.","2666":"Familial aggregation of colorectal cancer occurs also among sporadic cases that are not part of defined genetic syndromes. First degree relatives of patients with \"sporadic\" colorectal cancer have a 3-4 fold increased risk of the same cancer. The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between a first degree family history of colorectal cancer and pathological and clinical features of the tumor (site, Dukes' stage, age at diagnosis, sex and survival of patients). 461 patients with colorectal cancer were evaluated (250 males and 211 females) after obtaining informations about their family history of cancer. 52 (11.25%) of them reported to have at least one close relative affected by intestinal cancer. Sex, age and stage of the disease are the only parameters that significantly affect survival. No relationship between family history of colorectal cancer and prognostic variables was observed.","2667":"Selective rubella vaccination in the 11 years old girls, has been carried out in the Regione Veneto (Venetian Land) since 1974. The rubella immunization rate in teh women born between 1962 and 1978, in five sanitary districts, is 68.25%; the trend of increasing vaccination is continuing. Important differences in the organization of vaccination campaign were found among the five districts.","2668":"In Italy there are eight tumor Population-Based Registries (PBRs) that publish incidence data, and only one of them (Ragusa) provides data for Southern Italy. Usually, PBRs are based on data collection from Pathologists and medical records. Our integrated system differentiates from traditional PBRs because the information comes from the General Practitioners (GPs) and is completed with the diagnosis provided by the Pathologists (Ps). During two years we have registered 1,057 new cancers on a middle period population of 212,644. GPs and Ps signed 395 and 879 incident cases, respectively. GPs alone provided 16.8%, Ps alone 62.6%, and either source 20.6% of total cases. After excluding non melanotic skin cancers and bladder carcinoma, the GPs-Ps integrated system counted 828 new cases in two years. These incidence data are the first in our region (Puglia). The 178 cases signed by GPs alone should have been lost if the informations of our PBR had been based only on local Ps' records. Moreover, 94 of GPs cases (11% of total cancers registered) were subjects who moved outside the area for diagnosis and treatment. Even if this article evaluates the effect of under-registration attributable to Ps or GPs, the cancer incidence data and the active involvement of GPs indicate that they could be usefully involved in the registration of cancer data.","2669":"In epidemiology \"risk\" is stated as a probability. This statement implies adopting a definite position regarding the concept of probability in science: whether it has to be intended as a lack of knowledge or a casual component of biological phenomena. On this fundamental premise the authors discuss the epidemiological implications on the issue of \"determinism\" of the recent developments of chemical, physical and biological sciences, particularly the quantum mechanics and the theories of complexity. The authors suggest three major interpretations of the relationship between risk factors and disease: strong determinism, weak determinism and dualism determinism\/indeterminism. For each one of these positions they discuss the consistency, affinity and implications on epidemiological work.","2670":"","2671":"","2672":"The authors report the results of historical cohort study in long-term patients of psychiatric hospitals in Reggio Emilia. The cohort was formed by 790 patients hospitalized before 1978, and has been followed-up until 31\/12\/'89. The results of the study are: 269 subjects deceased (34%); 117 discharges (14.8%) and 411 (52.1%) still in hospital on 1\/1\/'90. An excess mortality was observed in the cohort. Mortality appears to be particularly high among young patient and females.","2673":"During the first six months of 1990, a study was carried out on a group of patients examined at the Neuroradiology Department of a Neurological Institute for skull and cervical spine X-rays. Kind of disturbances, the examination prescribed and patients' places of origin were taken into consideration. We studied 174 patients: 108 suffering from headache, 28 from cervical arthrosis, and the others from miscellaneous diseases. Male\/Female ratio (M\/F) was lower in the group affected by headache; the age was more advanced in the group affected by cervical arthrosis. Skull X-rays were usually normal in headache patients; cervical X-rays were not informative in cervical arthrosis patients. We can conclude that only through a different relationship between the prescribing physician and the Radiologist it will be possible to approach the justification and optimization criteria of medical radiological exposure.","2674":"","2675":"The debate on the efficiency of the health care system in Italy requires a developing dialogue between clinicians, epidemiologists and health economists. In this perspective the meaning of economic efficiency and its relationship with effectiveness are presented, either at production unit level either at system level. Application of criteria of efficiency is not independent from value judgements. The conflict between clinical freedom and controls on health care expenditure have ever been and it may not be eliminated, but compounded by expliciting the criteria of choice and by defining the responsibilities of health policy makers and clinicians. An example is represented by the recent Oregon's experiment. In the agenda of the future change of the Italian National Health Service, mechanisms of cost-effectiveness resource allocation criteria are suggested to be included.","2676":"After the 1978 psychiatric reform law, public inpatient facilities (SPDC) and private clinics, with a higher number of available beds, coexist in the metropolitan area of Turin. Presented data, concerning the population of a specific catchment area, allow a comparison between the admissions in the two kinds of facilities. Patients hospitalized in 1981 were followed up to 1989, evaluating their contacts with the Community Mental Health Centre (SSM). A higher number of admissions in private clinics emerges, but there is no progressive increase during the considered period. The SPDC has evolved towards a sort of 'specialization' in psychotic syndromes; lengths of stay, moreover, were shorter. Public services (SPDC and SSM) seem to play a limited role in meeting the demand for psychiatric care expressed by the considered population.","2677":null,"2678":"The use of caesarean section is constantly increasing in all countries of the western world. This article considers various aspects of the phenomenon, from the most frequent justifications for the increase in caesarean sections, to the consequences of this practise on the health of the mother and of the fetus\/newborn infant. The often-suggested link between the increase in the number of caesarean births and the decrease of the perinatal mortality rate is also discussed. The caesarean section is potentially capable of offering large benefits, but at the same time is not without risk for the mother and the child. In order to reduce this risk meticulous attention must be paid to the anesthesiological and surgical techniques employed and surgery must be used only when absolutely necessary.","2679":"","2680":"","2681":"","2682":"","2683":"","2684":"","2685":"","2686":"","2687":"","2688":"","2689":"","2690":"","2691":"","2692":"","2693":"","2694":"","2695":"","2696":"","2697":"","2698":"","2699":"","2700":"","2701":"","2702":"","2703":"","2704":"","2705":"","2706":"","2707":"","2708":"","2709":"","2710":"","2711":"","2712":"","2713":"","2714":"","2715":"","2716":"","2717":"","2718":"","2719":"","2720":"","2721":"","2722":"","2723":"","2724":"","2725":"","2726":"","2727":"","2728":"","2729":"","2730":"","2731":"","2732":"We studied the prevalence of intestinal parasites in a random sample of immigrants and Italians employed in the food industry. Prevalence ranged from 20.8% among immigrants to 5.6% among Italians. Where helminths are widespread among Indochinese, protozoa are more common among africans. Three cases of Entamoeba histolytica in asymptomatic subjects were identified and successfully treated. We observed high levels of Giardia intestinalis both in Italians (2.2%) and immigrants (3.9%). Prevalence of intestinal protozoa was significantly associated with year of immigration, showing higher levels for new immigrants. The public health implications of parasite screening and treatment among recent immigrants were also discussed.","2733":"We have studied smoking habit in the sample enrolled in the ten year follow-up of the \"Pordenone Study on the Precursors of Atherosclerosis in Childhood\". The response rate at ten year follow-up was very high (about 90%). Prevalence of smoking is 45.1% among males and 25.6% among females. Males and females aged 23 present a prevalence of smokers higher than the other groups while the group aged 26 smoke less. Males began to smoke at 16.4 years, females at 16.7. Mean daily consumption is 12.6 cigarettes among males, and 5.0 among females. Juvenile experimentation with cigarettes and juvenile smoking habit are strong predictors to smoke ten years later; while parental smoking behaviour is not so influential. Therefore we conclude that smoking habit acquired in youngs has a high probability to be maintained in adults, remarking the importance of planning a preventive intervention as early as possible.","2734":"A sample of high school students in grade 9 and 13 (14-15 and 18-19 years old respectively) in Brescia, North Italy, were interviewed to assess the relationship of smoking habit with attitudes, knowledge, behavioural and socio-environmental factors among adolescents. The associations between smoking habit, considered as a dichotomous response variable, and the other variables were assessed by estimating the prevalence ratios. The following variables were found to be associated with the students' smoking: best friend and\/or partner smoking, sibling smoking, alcohol drinking and the students' judgement of the health risks of smoking. Although no conclusion can be drawn on the causal relationship of these associations due to the cross-sectional design of the survey, these findings suggest that social environment influences adolescents' smoking more than family life does. Furthermore, the knowledge of the health risks of smoking was not associated to adolescents' smoking.","2735":"A two-part study was undertaken to assess the comparability of the coding of underlying cause of death between ISTAT (Central Statistics Office providing \"national\" mortality statistics) and RMR (Mortality Registry of Tuscany Region providing \"local\" mortality statistics). In Part I was compared mortality data of the Province of Florence (years 1985-1986) from the files of ISTAT with those of RMR. The source of the cause of death is the same for both systems (ISTAT certificate), but the data collection and coding of RMR are different from those of ISTAT. In Part II was compared a set of 219 Tuscany death certificates (year 1988) coded by ISTAT and RMR. The results showed an high degree of completeness of RMR (only--0.65% vs. ISTAT) and a satisfactory level of correspondence in the number of deaths for circulatory diseases, for neoplasms and for cancers of most important sites (lung, stomach, intestine, pancreas, breast). Discrepancies were found for some other diseases; for some of these causes of death, also age-adjusted mortality rates showed discrepancies (for example ischaemic heart disease). The cause of these differences have been analyzed.","2736":"","2737":"","2738":"","2739":"","2740":"Sixty-seven incident cases of polyneuropathy (PNP) occurred among shoe workers exposed to solvents in the last ten years (1979-1988) in the Montebelluna area (Veneto region, northern Italy).

The disease has been diagnosed by means of neurological investigation and electroneuromyographical examination; it appears always as subclinical. The National Institute of Compensation (INAIL) confirmed the case series. In the present study data are discussed on the personal characteristics of the cases, including an evaluation of social and health consequences of the disease, and the work environment where PNP cases arose; attention is posed on the chemicals used, on jobs performed by the workers, and on duration of exposure. The study stresses the need to improve further the work conditions where solvents are used and to maintain a surveillance system for this occupational disease.","2741":"","2742":"This present work aims to give a critical description of the organization and operative aspects of project ORDET (prospective study on diet and hormones in the aetiology of breast cancer). A number of problems which could arise when carrying-out a prospective study are described: they concern participant recruitment, laboratory organization, planning of a biological bank plus relative security checks in order to ensure full workability and personnel standardization in questionnaire administration and anthropometrical measurements. The methods adopted by ORDET, or at least some of them, could be useful for those engaged in the planning phase of a similarly designed project using a biological bank.","2743":"","2744":"The authors have collected clinical data regarding patients admitted to a private psychiatric institutions in the Naples hinterland. The aim was that of determining the reliability of official data collected from the central regional statistical office of patients admitted in 1988. The duration of stay and the \"revolving door\" phenomenon of the cases as well as the nosographic classification at dismissal of the patients is influenced by variables not strictly of clinical nature.

The study consisted in the interview of 15 cases, 20 controls and their 35 relatives. Significative agreement between patients and relatives responses was found; homogeneous level of agreement was found neither among different alcohol consumption measures or between cases and controls. Some hypotheses on the factors that reduce the questionnaire reproducibility and on validity of estimated association measures between alcohol dose, detectable from questionnaire, and risk of chronic hepatopathies are presented. The possibility of using the questionnaire in studies on other diseases and population-based case-control studies, is discussed.","2746":"In this review we considered smoking cessation interventions delivered by general practitioners in consideration of their privileged position as health promoters. We selected 11 randomized trials on: a) counselling; b) nicotine gum; c) perception of health hazards in relationship with cigarette smoking. The interventions were delivered to smokers during clinical encounters. Amount of time spent by physicians during clinical encounters and number of reinforcing sessions emerged as the most important factors in a successful intervention. Nicotine gum prescription and perception of health hazards did not show any significant effect but the opportunity as reinforcing sessions.","2747":"The effectiveness of a screening programme for HIV infection among prisoners is discussed, in relation to validity of screening test, natural history ad modalities of transmission of the infection, hypothetical objectives of the programme, in comparison with alternatives prevention programmes.

All interviewed and non interviewed subjects were compared in a logistic regression model with respect to age, sex, educational level, civil status and area of birth. No large differential selection with respect to these variables was found between interviewed and non interviewed cases. Lower proportions of interviewed subjects were found among older controls and controls with lower education. These results suggest the possibility of selection bias in this case-control study. In particular, biased measures of effects might be estimated when analyzing variables related to educational level.","2754":"","2755":"The second European Atlas of Avoidable deaths, which will be shortly issued, concerns the period 1979-83 for Italy. The causes of deaths included were: tuberculosis, neoplasms of the cervix uteri and those of the uterus with no specified site, Hodgkin's disease, chronic rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive and cerebrovascular disease, childhood respiratory infections, asthma, appendicitis, abdominal hernia, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, maternal and perinatal deaths. In Italy marked excesses for cholecystitis-cholelithiasis, Hodgkin's disease, hypertensive and cerebrovascular disease and perinatal mortality were observed. A remarkable decrease was observed in comparison with the first Atlas (1974-78); but the European countries generally maintained the differences amongst them and their rank. Proposals to assess the causes of the observed differences are suggested (death certificate quality evaluation studies, case-reference studies, cohort studies) and the role of confidential enquiries is discussed.","2756":"In the years 1981-85, 2438 malignant neoplasms of peritoneum occurred in Italy: the crude mortality rate was 0.86 X 10(-5) per year. The standardized mortality rates of Italian provinces ranged from 0.20 to 1.86 X 10(-5) per year. Some degree of misclassification can affect the ascertainment of peritoneal tumors as a death cause. In some of the Provinces with the highest mortality rates dockyards or asbestos-cement industries are located (e.g. Genova, La Spezia; Alessandria); in other Provinces the presence of industries involving an important use of asbestos could not be ruled out.","2757":"In Florence between 1985 and 1987 two hundred twenty eight women deceased for uterine cancer (ICD-9 code 179, 180, 182); for 79.4% of these the diagnosis reported on the death certificate was \"unspecified\" cancer of the uterus. Death certificates were cross-checked with the Tuscany Cancer Registry files, with clinical records and with other sanitary archives with the aim of identifying the specific cancer site (cervix\/corpus). All deaths before the age 45 were attributed to cervical cancer, but these only represented 6.6% of all subjects deceased for this neoplasia. Age adjusted mortality rates for cervical cancer (0-64 and 0-74 years) were then estimated; in Florence these are low compared to other European and Italian areas, while those from corpus uteri are ranked in an intermediate position. These data are consistent with the incidence rates as given by the Cancer Registry, and may be associated with the existence of a population screening for cervical cancer in the area, which exists since 1970, addressed to women aged 18-60 with a compliance of approximately 50%.","2758":"From Rutstein's sentinel events list, causes were selected which are regarded as most amenable to medical intervention. Considerable variation in mortality between Health Districts (in Northern Italy) was found in most of these diseases.

The overall seroprevalence rate for HIV antibody was 39% (95% confidence interval-CI-35-43%). HIV prevalence had risen from 32% in 1984-85 to 47% in 1986-88. Age was not associated with HIV infection risk, whereas gender was, women being at lower risk of infection than men (odds ratio-OR- = 0.7, 95% CI: 0,5-1.0). Seropositivity rates showed a strong east-west geographical gradient: intravenous drug users living in the western part of the study area had a nearly sevenfold higher risk of infection (95% CI = 4.4-13.9) than those living in the eastern part. Sharing of drug injection equipment was by far the most important risk factor. IVDUs who reported to always share injection equipment had a fourfold higher risk of HIV infection, as compared with those who never did (95% CI = 1.6-12.7). The duration of drug addiction (odds ratio = 2.6), the use of heroin in high-incidence cities (odds ratio = 2.3) and of cocaine in addition to heroin (odds ratio = 1.5) and the practice of prostitution (odds ratio = 2.3) were also important determinants of HIV infection. Over the study period, the odds ratios associated with area of residence decreased, whereas those associated with the use of heroin in high-incidence cities and with prostitution increased.","2761":"Our study was performed in 1986-'87 and 1987-'88 school years on 12.354 three to eighteen years old students (the whole scholastic population of zone 20 of Milan) in order to apply dietary education on obese subjects. Mean prevalence of obesity was 13.4% with elevated percentages in 11 to 13 years old students (17.9%), with respect to primary (14.1%), high school (12.4%) and nursery school (4.7%).

Overall 511 (39%) reported some BSE practice, but only 109 (8%) did it regularly and in a way deemed correct by caring physicians. Patients reporting any practice of the exam had a greater chance (OR = 1.42, 95% Cl = 1.13-1.79) of being diagnosed with a primary tumour smaller than 2 cm. This effect was mostly evident in the subgroup reporting optimal BSE practice. About half the patients with a primary tumour smaller than 2 cm. still had radical surgery.

The major process in the plant, until the end of World War II, was chromium and vegetable tanning. A historical cohort study was carried out on a total of 353 male workers. The expected number of death was estimated on the basis of local mortality rates. An SMR for lung cancer of 449 (95% C.L. 180-925) was found for the entire cohort. Excluding workers non specifically employed in tanning operations, the SMR for lung cancer increased to 1087 (95% C.L. 352-2533). In order to control for potential confounders a nested case-control study was planned. The next-of-kin of 8 cases deceased for lung cancer and 32 controls matched by age were interviewed on smoking habits and previous jobs. Logistic regression analysis showed an O.R. of 6.94 (95% C.L. 1.18-40.73), adjusted for smoking habits and occupational history, for subjects involved in tanning operations.

Some of these compounds cause chronic irritation of the respiratory mucosa, while others are carcinogenic in experimental animals, particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitroarenes. This review aims to describe epidemiologic evidences of carcinogenicity of engine exhausts. The study of the effects in humans of the exposure at issue is impaired by several difficulties: widespread exposure of a large part of the population, with low levels of exposure; aspecific effects, shared with other exposures; concurrent exposures acting on the same targets, particularly the respiratory mucosa (smoking, occupational exposures); difficulties in the quantitation of exposure to exhaust. We review the epidemiologic studies concerning occupational exposures published up to June, 1988. Overall, excess risks for lung and bladder cancers and for hematolymphopoietic malignancies have been reported, particularly in people exposed to diesel exhaust. Excesses are modest, and their interpretation is often impaired by lacking or inadequate consideration of the effects of potential confounders. The review considers, for each study, enrollment procedures, information on exposure, and inclusion of potential confounders. In addition, aspects concerning internal coherence, such as a dose-response relationship, are considered. Particularly relevant are two studies on USA railroad workers, showing a relative risk of 1.4 among those exposed to diesel exhaust. The authors used, in the estimation of exposure, actual measurement of dose in recent years for some jobs and workplaces. Levels of exposure to respirable dusts were around 82-330 micrograms\/m3, after allowing for cigarette smoking. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, these is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans of diesel exhaust, and inadequate evidence for gasoline exhaust.","2785":"","2786":"","2787":"","2788":"","2789":"Over the last ten years the Italian National Research Council (CNR) has launched an educational program aimed at facilitating the delivery of the most up to date care to cancer patients in community hospitals.

Some of them in addition endorsed other educational activities and sponsored multicenter trials. In 1988, the CNR funded a study to assess the impact of the whole effort. In particular the evaluation program was designed to see whether: a) the guidelines had a large diffusion in the target physicians' population; b) their content was accepted by those exposed to them and, c) practice patterns were consistent with the guidelines' recommendations. The above mentioned end-points were investigated through physicians' surveys and patterns of care studies carried out in a nationwide sample of 45 community hospitals and, on the whole, involving 1874 doctors (response rate was 41%) and 1483 patients with one of the three cancers. Results indicate a very limited impact of the program. Awareness of the guidelines was unsatisfactorily low (65%, 47% and 48% for breast, colo-rectal and ovarian cancer, respectively) and seemed to be more related to individual physicians' interest than to the functioning of the program. Analysis of practice patterns showed serious deficiencies even in centers where a more widespread awareness of the guidelines might have been expected to result in a better quality of care. We conclude that any assessment of interventions based on diffusion of information must include careful analysis of the process of diffusion itself and that the availability of clinically relevant messages must also be realistically considered before deciding whether the \"guidelines approach\" is the strategy most likely to succeed.","2790":"Liver cirrhosis is considered as a double etiology disease, being its incidence and mortality associated either to alcohol consumption or to a previous viral hepatitis infection of type \"B\" or \"neither A nor B\". A two components mathematical model is here used to estimate the proportion of liver cirrhosis mortality attributable to alcohol consumption and the proportion from hepatitis. The model has been fitted to mortality data of the 95 Italian provinces in 5 periods of three years each from 1969 to 1983. In 1981-83, the first-component (interpretable as due to alcohol) is estimated to account for 31% in males and 28% in females of total mortality from liver cirrhosis. Estimates are given also for large geographical areas, regions and provinces.","2791":"","2792":"The short-term temporal cycles in the frequency of suicide for the Province of Florence 1985-1987 has been analyzed. The authors initially present a comparison between the Date of Suicidal Act and the recorded Death Certificate Date. In their data the difference, still debated in the literature, appears of no practical importance. The results show that suicides peak on Spring and Fall, with a temporal variation with regard to the first decade of the month, high at the beginning and low at the end. No evident pattern has been explained by day of the week, unlikely any reports from the literature. On the contrary, the effect of the National Holidays are striking, showing a decrease on the holidays and a sharp rise on the subsequent day.","2793":"","2794":"","2795":"","2796":"","2797":"","2798":"We carried out a retrospective research into the hospital care cost of 52 AIDS cases we observed in our department, in the period 1984-1988. These patients required an average of 3.2 hospital admissions per year, and 101.3 hospitalization days per year, spending more than one fourth of their life span after their diagnosis of AIDS, in a hospital. The total care cost was Lit. 1,133,614,000, mostly due to the hospital stay (65.0%), but the introduction of expensive drugs will increase the cost of treatment. The average daily cost per patient was Lit. 227,900. Prognosis and cost vary according to the kind of opportunistic infection or neoplasm. The prolongation of hospitalization in consequence of social and economic problems is very frequent. A better accessibility of diagnostic systems, and a development of day-hospital and social services could reduce AIDS patients costs.","2799":"The quality of the certificates of death for 2429 cases, all the residents died at home in the USL 70 during the period 1.8.83-31.12.87, was evaluated thanks to the necroscopic activity of the Legnano's Hospital pathologist. All the information, oral or written, available about each case was used to check the family doctor's certificate. Any correction to the certificate was discussed with the certifier. During the period a gradual and progressive reduction of error in the statement of the underlying cause of death was shown. The improvement comes out using different quality indicators.","2800":"A case-Control Study for the association between Central Nervous System Malignancies and residence in a small area within the municipality of Campi Bisenzio (Florence, Italy) has been performed following a spontaneous reporting of three cases of brain cancer. All incident cases of SNC tumours diagnosed in the period 1973-82 with histological or radiological confirmation among residents in the study area are recruited as cases. Five controls for each case, matched by sex and age (+ - 1 year), are randomly chosen from demographic files in the municipality. The residential history for each subject enrolled in the study is recorded from the same demographic files. The relative risk for ever resident in the 46-50 electoral sections relative to never resident was 7.33 (C.I. 95% 2.6-20.3). A trend for duration of residence was also relevant (less than 5 years RR = 2.1, 5-10 years RR = 8.4, more than 10 years RR = 11.3; chi-square for trend = 41 p = 0.00002).","2801":"In order to apply the \"sentinel health event\" methodology we reviewed the certificates of 4541 deaths occurred in the period 1\/01\/83-31\/12\/88 in the USL 1 (Lunigiana) in the Tuscany Region. The histories of 6 work accidents, 6 cases of pleural mesothelioma, and 2 cases of sinunasal cancers have been collected by means of personal interviews and investigation at various workplaces. It should be noted that a case of sinunasal cancer was discovered in a farmer who used lead arsenate as an insecticidal. Furthermore the wife of a shipyard worker died of pleural mesothelioma. The death of a shipyard worker caused by pleural mesothelioma, provoked the critical review of the other workers of the same company who were also exposed to asbestos. Moreover, 73 deaths were recorded as due to silicosis; among them, 29 occurred in quartzite quarrymen. In addition, among 153 total cases of lung cancer, 9 were found to be associated with silicosis.","2802":"The investigation intends to estimate the frequency of some Sentinel health events (SHE) in order to evaluate, preliminarily in methodological terms, the applicability of the survey on some probable SHE, which derive from the death certificates sent to Public health board. The work load has been estimated in relation to the different demographic economic and social realities existing in Emilia Romagna Region. Moreover, the suitability (applicability), in operative terms, of the list suggested by the National group for the SHE (CISM), has been examined. In the end, some questions have been raised and some organizational suggestions have been proposed, in order to guarantee the constancy and validity of the survey and above all the knowable acceptance of the insiders.","2803":"","2804":"The effectiveness of premarital screening program for HIV infection is discussed, in relation to hypothetical objectives: improvement of individual health, prevention of transmission of HIV infection and estimate of prevalence among sexually active population. Taking into account validity of screening test, natural history of HIV infection, availability of effective early treatment and possible social outcomes, the hypothesis of lack of effectiveness of this program is held.","2805":"The surveillance of occupationally related disease is a research topic in many countries. A working group on the information system within the Italian Association for Occupational Health has recently proposed to reorganize the national surveillance system. In Epidemiologia e Prevenzione a series of contributions relevant to this issue will be published. This paper reviews the on-going research in our country and abroad (United States, United Kingdom, Scandinavian Countries and Canada).","2806":"A mail questionnaire, collecting information mainly on occupational history, was sent to 50 subjects who had been interviewed at home with a longer questionnaire three years before, and to 26 subjects who refused at that time to be interviewed. The 50 subjects were sampled among controls enrolled in a population based case-control study on soft tissue sarcomas; the 26 were all non-respondent controls in the same study. The questionnaire was returned by 83% and 14% respectively. A comparison between home and mail interviews suggests that the quality of information is strictly comparable for 78% of the items. For discordant items, about 50% showed a better quality of information from home interviews; in the other 50% a better information was provided by the mail interview.","2807":"As no similar study has been conducted in Italy, the Local Health District (USL) of Rozzano (Milano), decided to carry on a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of a Smoking Prevention Program. In this article we describe study protocol and give data related to program steps already carried out. A team of four MDs involved in school health and a Health Research consultant were in charge for the study. 1013 students from the second class of the secondary school (12y age) were stratified into four subgroups, according to their risk of becoming a smoker and their teachers smoking status. They were subsequently randomized (with blocking) to two groups: the smoking prevention (which was based on the Waterloo Smoking Program) and the cardiovascular risk prevention (based on an ad hoc program by the USL) which was the control group. Both interventions consisted in six weekly lessons which were delivered in 37 classrooms (777 students or 61% of all the eligible student population, 72% of randomized students) by an equal number of teacher who voluntarily joined the program, during school hours. A larger number of teachers (53) formerly joined the program but not all accomplished it. Problems with program planning and delivering are described, together with the criteria which guided this approach.","2808":"Smoking habits of 882 employees of Magenta general hospital (province of Milan) (135 doctors, 594 nurses and 153 technicians and clerical staff) were investigated in May 1986, by means of a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 84%). Forty-five percent of men and 34% of women reported to be current smokers, respectively 13% fewer and 41% more, after age-standardization, than the general population of the same province. Smoking habits of the three professional groups considered did not differ substantially, but a higher number of doctors as compared to nurses admitted to smoke occasionally in front of patients. The vast majority (80%) agreed with a total ban of smoking inside the hospital but the underestimation of smoking-related health hazards, especially outside the cancer field, turned out to be also very common. Only 34% of doctors, 13% of nurses and 16% of technical and clerical staff identified smoking as the leading preventable cause of death in Italy.","2809":"An integrated epidemiological system for the surveillance of acute viral hepatitis (Seiva) has been performed in Italy. Aim of the present work is to evaluate diagnostic completeness and reliability of the surveillance system in the Piedmont Region. Results show that 15% of Acute Viral Hepatitis are not reported by the system and that the potential diagnostic errors are 7.3% of the cases.","2810":"Occupational surveillance systems, which examine mortality patterns by occupation or industry, may contribute to hypothesis generation and priority setting for occupational cancer research and control. In the City of Torino the Local Population and Family Register records and the Census records are matchable through a computerized record linkage procedure. Since the early 1980's we have incorporated demographic events, occurring among residents, into the Census data source, covering birth, death and migration. This paper deals with the occupational mortality, from 1981 to 1985, of 262, 314 men and 146, 125 women, aged 15-64, who held a job at the 1981 Census. Mortality from 31 selected causes of death, including 22 cancer sites, among individuals employed in specific occupations (64 categories) and economic activities (80 categories) was compared with the mortality experienced by the whole cohort of active people. The surveillance design does not take into account potential confounders such as cigarette smoking, alcohol and previous work history. Despite the short duration of follow-up, some occupation-cancer associations, consistently documented in others surveillance studies, have been detected in our study: lung cancer among motor vehicle drivers (SMR 143, 27 obs), metal molders (SMR 178, 8 obs), welders (SMR 241, 7 obs) and wood workers (SMR 218, 12 obs), leukemias and electrical workers (SMR 367, 6 obs).","2811":"","2812":"","2813":"","2814":"","2815":"","2816":"","2817":"","2818":"","2819":"","2820":"","2821":"","2822":"","2823":"","2824":"","2825":"","2826":"","2827":"","2828":"","2829":"","2830":"","2831":"","2832":"","2833":"","2834":"","2835":"","2836":"","2837":"","2838":"","2839":"","2840":"","2841":"","2842":"","2843":"","2844":"","2845":"","2846":"","2847":"","2848":"","2849":"","2850":"","2851":"","2852":"","2853":"","2854":"","2855":"","2856":"","2857":"","2858":"","2859":"","2860":"","2861":"","2862":"","2863":"","2864":"","2865":"","2866":"","2867":"","2868":"","2869":"","2870":""},"articletitle":{"0":"[Geocoding one million of addresses using API: a semiautomatic multistep procedure].","1":"[Errata Corrige Epidemiol Prev 2020; 44 (5-6):410-416].","2":"[Uniformity and comparability of national Health Information Systems for home care, nursing homes, and hospices in Italy].","3":"[Application of an algorithm for the validation of congenital anomaly cases using hospital discharge records].","4":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HIV infection in the Spanish VACH Cohort: a descriptive study.","5":"Health-related lifestyles among Italian university students: A cross-sectional study.","6":"[Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on total and cause-specific mortality in Rome (Italy) in 2020].","7":"[Incidence of cancer among children and adolescents (0-19 years) in Lazio Region (Central Italy), 2009-2015].","8":"Boosters and time from the last anti-COVID-19 vaccine dose: lead public health choices by real-time epidemiological assessment.","9":"[Mortality study of residents of the municipality of Piazzola sul Brenta (Veneto Region, Northern Italy), 2003-2018].","10":"[The citizen sentinel paradigm meets epidemiology].","11":"[What has become of the mad cow disease?]","12":"[Screening and COVID-19: what to do and how make a virtue out of necessity?]","13":"[COVID-19: Trust in numbers has to be earned].","14":"[The functions of epidemiology in reorganizing the Italian NHS.
