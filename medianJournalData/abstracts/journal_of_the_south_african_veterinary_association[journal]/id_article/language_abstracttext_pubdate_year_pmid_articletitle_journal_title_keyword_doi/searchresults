As the farmed buffalo population expands, the potential impacts on population health and disease transmission warrant investigation. A retrospective study of skin biopsy and necropsy samples from 429 animals was performed to assess the spectrum of conditions seen in buffaloes in South Africa. Determination of the cause of death (or euthanasia) could not be made in 33.1% (136\/411) of the necropsy cases submitted due to autolysis or the absence of significant lesions in the samples submitted. Infectious and parasitic diseases accounted for 53.5% (147\/275) of adult fatal cases and non-infectious conditions accounted for 34.9% (96\/275). Abortions and neonatal deaths made up 11.6% (32\/275) of necropsy cases. Rift Valley fever, bovine viral diarrhoea, malignant catarrhal fever, tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, anaesthetic deaths, cachexia and hepatotoxic lesions were the most common causes of death. The range of infectious, parasitic and non-infectious diseases to which African buffaloes were susceptible was largely similar to diseases in domestic cattle which supports concerns regarding disease transmission between the two species. The similarity between diseases experienced in both species will assist wildlife veterinarians in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in captive African buffaloes. The present study likely does not represent accurate disease prevalence data within the source population of buffaloes, and diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis and foot and mouth disease are under-represented in this study. Hepatic ductal plate abnormalities and haemorrhagic septicaemia have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported in African buffaloes.","3":null,"4":"Etorphine-azaperone is the most commonly used drug combination for chemical immobilisation of free-ranging white rhinoceroses, but causes several profound physiological disturbances, including muscle tremors. The addition of benzodiazepine sedatives, such as midazolam, has been proposed to reduce the muscular rigidity and tremors in immobilised rhinoceroses. Twenty-three free-ranging, sub-adult white rhinoceros bulls were darted and captured using a combination of etorphine plus either azaperone or midazolam. Skeletal muscle tremors were visually evaluated and scored by an experienced veterinarian, and tremor scores and distance run were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. No statistical differences were observed in tremor scores (p = 0.435) or distance run (p = 0.711) between the two groups, and no correlation between these variables was detected (r = -0.628; p = 0.807). Etorphine-midazolam was as effective as etorphine-azaperone at immobilising rhinoceroses, with animals running similar distances. Although the addition of midazolam to the etorphine did not reduce tremor scores compared to azaperone, it might have other beneficial immobilising effects in rhinoceroses, and further investigation is necessary to elucidate possible methods of reducing muscle tremoring during chemical immobilisation of rhinoceroses.","5":"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a slow growing but locally invasive neoplasm, most commonly caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Whilst SCC accounts for 15% of skin tumours in domesticated cats, cutaneous SCC in non-domesticated felids (apart from captive snow leopards) appears to be uncommon, with only three reports in the literature to date. In this report, a captive African lion (Panthera leo) presented with two ulcerative lesions on the nasal planum. Histopathology of the lesions revealed epidermal keratinocyte dysplasia and neoplastic basal- and supra-basal epithelial cells with dyskeratosis and evidence of basement membrane breaching and dermal invasion, consistent with a diagnosis of SCC. There was also evidence of laminar fibrosis and inflammation of the subjacent dermis suggesting that the SCC most likely resulted from UV-induced neoplastic transformation of the epidermal squamous epithelium following actinic keratosis. The lion was treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy and remained in remission until his death (euthanised 17 months later because of age-related chronic renal failure). This is the first report of cutaneous SCC in a lion with evidence of actinic damage and resolution after radiation therapy.","6":"Hypoxaemia is a common complication in anaesthetised or immobilised elephants. It is presumably because of hypoventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. To prevent hypoxaemia, orotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation are recommended. This case report describes a hypoxaemic period despite positive pressure ventilation in a 46-year-old female Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) anaesthetised with azaperone-etorphine, medetomidine and an etorphine constant rate infusion in lateral recumbency for a dental procedure. The hypoxaemia was corrected utilising positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm - 10 cm H2O, a technique that has not previously been reported in the management of anaesthetised elephants. PEEP decreases atelectasis, shunt fraction, and increases lung compliance. Positive end-expiratory pressure was achieved by partial occlusion of the tailpiece of a manually triggered demand valve ventilator during expiration. This is a simple effective method of generating PEEP and correcting hypoxaemia without the need for any additional specialised equipment. However, PEEP decreased arterial blood pressure and should be implemented with caution if arterial blood pressure is not monitored.","7":"The aim of this study was to describe the antibiotic use practices of veterinarians and para-veterinarians in Nigeria. An online survey was distributed during November through December 2018 via email and phone to veterinarians and para-veterinarians to collect information on antibiotic use practices. Data were downloaded into Excel and descriptive statistics were presented and analysed. The survey was completed by 390 respondents. Almost all respondents (98.5%, 384\/390) recommended the use of antibiotics to treat animal patients, and of these, 93.2% (358\/384) were veterinarians and 6.8% (26\/384) were para-veterinarians. Most respondents reported commonly recommending the use of oxytetracycline (82.6%, 317\/384), tylosin (44.5%, 171\/384) and gentamycin (43.8%, 168\/384). A third (32.0%, 122\/384) of respondents did not undertake antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) prior to antibiotic treatment. At least 60% of the respondents recommended the use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-bacterial pathogens, including viral, helminth and fungal pathogens. Over 55% (217\/390) were not aware of government-issued guidelines on antibiotic use in animals, although of those aware, 69% (74\/107) utilised the guidelines. Across all respondents, the majority believed legislation or regulation by government can influence the use of antibiotics by animal health professionals. The study highlights areas that can be targeted as part of intervention strategies to promote antimicrobial stewardship by animal health professionals in Nigeria, including the need for increased use of AST as a tool for supporting disease management, increased awareness of appropriate antibiotic use and greater dissemination of antibiotic use guidelines and enforcement of relevant regulation by government authorities.","8":"Anaesthesia in pinnipeds is considered a much higher risk than in most terrestrial mammals because of their frequent proximity to water and physiological and anatomical adaptations related to diving, which also influence their anaesthesia management. Anaesthetising and immobilising entangled seals does not allow for selection of animals that are at a safe distance from the water's edge. Medetomidine-midazolam-butorphanol (MMB) sedation was trialled on eight entangled Cape fur seals (CFS) (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) to determine if it was safe to use on animals that entered the water post-darting. The MMB was given at an estimated dose of 0.03 mg\/kg, 0.2 mg\/kg and 0.2 mg\/kg, respectively, via remote darting. Sedation was reversed with intramuscular atipamezole (0.15 mg\/kg) and naltrexone (0.4 mg\/kg) to antagonise the effects of medetomidine and butorphanol, respectively. Moderate sedation was achieved in six animals. Six of the animals entered the water after being darted. There was a single mortality and a single animal that was too lightly sedated for capture. The preliminary results indicate that MMB produces suitable sedation for disentanglement of CFS. Additionally, MMB might be suitable for application to field-based biological research.","9":"Holstein cows on a farm in the Humansdorp district, Eastern Cape province, South Africa, developed reddened, painful teat skin 3 days after grazing a mixed forage crop dominated by bulb turnip (Brassica rapa, Barkant cultivar). The crop was grazed 45 days after planting and 10% of the herd developed symptoms. More characteristic non-pigmented skin lesions started manifesting 1-2 days after the appearance of the teat lesions. Affected cows had elevated serum activities of gamma-glutamyl transferase, glutamate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase. These blood chemistry findings confirmed a secondary (hepatogenous) photosensitivity. As a result of the severity of the teat and skin lesions, seven cows were slaughtered and tissue samples from five of them were collected for histopathological examination. Liver lesions in cows that were culled 3 or more weeks after the onset of the outbreak showed oedematous concentric fibrosis around medium-sized bile ducts and inflammatory infiltrates in portal tracts. Characteristic lesions associated with other known hepatobiliary toxicities were not found. No new cases were reported 5 days after the cattle were removed from the turnips. The sudden introduction of the cows, without any period of transitioning or adaptation to grazing turnips, as well as the short latent period, clinical signs of photosensitisation, blood chemistry and histopathology, confirmed a diagnosis of Brassica-associated liver disease, a condition seen in New Zealand but not previously described in South Africa. Brassica forage crops are potentially toxic under certain conditions and farmers must be aware of these risks.","10":"Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) may serve as a reservoir or a sentinel for infectious disease pathogens that can affect human and wildlife health. To understand the role of tick-borne diseases in rural and lesser developed regions, we investigated the prevalence of several tick-borne pathogens in communal dogs of Zimbabwe. Blood samples from 225 dogs in northwest Zimbabwe were assessed by serology for Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, and 241 samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Ehrlichia. There was a high seroprevalence (73%) of E. canis-specific antibodies in domestic dogs in northwest Zimbabwe, but follow up analyses via PCR and genetic sequencing indicated only 7.5% of the canines were actively infected with the organism. Whilst indicating that an organism serologically related to E. canis is likely present in the region, this data also shows that the organism is currently present in a relative minority of the domestic dogs in the region. Its presence as evidenced by both serologic and PCR analysis is significant because of the 'one health' paradigm, where humans and wildlife may be affected by the exposure to this pathogen in domestic dogs.","11":"Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used to image intervertebral disc extrusion (IVDE) in dogs. The current gold standard for CT imaging is the use of multi-slice CT (MS CT) units. Smaller high-definition volumetric imaging (HDVI) mobile CT has been marketed for veterinary practice. This unit is described as an advanced flat panel. The goal of this manuscript was to evaluate the ability of the HDVI CT in detecting IVDE without the need for CT myelography, compared with the detection of acute disc extrusions with a MS CT without the need for MS CT myelogram. Retrospective blinded analyses of 219 dogs presented for thoraco-lumbar IVDE that had a HDVI CT (n = 123) or MS CT (n = 96) were performed at a single referral hospital. A total of 123 cases had HDVI CT scans with surgically confirmed IVDE. The IVDE was identified in 88\/123 (72%) dogs on pre-contrast HDVI CT. The remaining 35\/128 (28%) cases required a HDVI CT myelogram to identify the IVDE. Ninety-six cases had MS CT scans with surgically confirmed IVDE. The IVDE was identified in 78\/96 (81%) dogs on the pre-contrast MS CT. The remaining 18\/96 (19%) cases had a MS CT myelogram to identify the IVDE. Multi-slice CT detected IVDE significantly more than HDVI CT (p = 0.032). This study showed that the ability of HDVI CT for detecting IVDE is lower than that of MS CT. The HDVI CT system may be useful in smaller referral practices, with a lower case load where space is limited.","12":"Pulmonic stenosis (PS) is the most common congenital heart disease in dogs and is commonly seen in small breeds, such as Chihuahuas. Conventional treatments have limitations specific to small dogs, including the invasive nature of open-heart surgery and size limitations in percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. Here, transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided balloon valvuloplasty via thoracotomy was performed for three small dogs with PS. The procedure was feasible in all cases, including those for which percutaneous treatment was not an option. Although the procedure is invasive, because of the need for thoracotomy, it is one of the treatment options that may be effective for PS, especially in small dogs, as it allows visualisation of the pulmonary artery lesion without relying on the experience of the surgeon.","13":"The study described a novel, rapidly performed, successful and safe surgical procedure in rats to achieve a reduction in the number of conceptuses. The objectives were to investigate the total foetal count and foetal health in both uterine horns after unilateral salpingectomy compared to the control group. Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were allocated to the study of which 10 rats underwent unilateral salpingectomy with six controls before all 16 were mated at 8-10 weeks of age. Gestational length was taken as 22 days coma? determined from the day of appearance of the copulatory plug. The female rats were terminated on day 19 or 20 of the gestational period. The foetuses in each horn were mapped and counted for comparison between the salpingectomy and control groups. The gravid uteri, individual foetal weights and placental weights were measured and compared between the two groups. This study described a novel, rapidly performed, successful and safe surgical procedure in rats. The mean number of foetuses in the salpingectomy group was significantly smaller than the control group. No significant differences in foetal and placental development were observed between the groups. These observations support future investigation of unilateral salpingectomy in other species as an alternative surgical method for population control.","14":null,"15":"Genetic diversity within partial 18S rRNA sequences from Hepatozoon protozoan parasites from wild felines in South Africa was assessed and compared with data from domestic cats to assess patterns of host specificity. Lions, leopards, servals, a caracal and an African wildcat were all positive for parasites of the Hepatozoon felis-complex. However, haplotypes were not species-specific, and potential mixed infections were widespread. Additional genetic markers are needed to untangle the extremely complex situation of these parasites in both domestic cats and wild felines in South Africa.","16":null,"17":"Accurate diet formulations are required to fulfil the nutrient requirements of birds in order to achieve optimal production. Knowing how the skin, nodule and feather production characteristics vary with diets of different nutrient densities will help in least-cost modelling. Feather growth and nodule development are factors that were previously neglected in ostrich diet formulation, both of which are essential for the development of a predictive production model. In this trial, 120 birds were placed in 15 pens. Varying energy regimes (high, medium and low) and accompanying protein and amino acid profile levels (level 1-5) were assigned ad libitum to each pen. A randomly selected bird from each pen was slaughtered at 1, 35, 63, 103, 159, 168 and 244 days of age. During the slaughter, each bird was weighed, stunned, exsanguinated, defeathered and eviscerated. Feathers from four regions of the skin were plucked and weighed. The shaft diameter of the wing feathers was measured. The nodule size of the tanned skin was measured for each slaughter age. The data were transformed to natural logarithms and regressed against the total feather weight and the total featherless empty body protein weight to set up allometric growth equations. A prediction equation to determine nodule size of the live bird was proposed. Feed cost optimisation is paramount, and results from this study will aid in setting up least-cost optimisation (simulation) formulation models.","18":"No abstract available.","19":"The influence of varying dietary protein and energy levels on the relative growth of body components of ostriches was evaluated over a 244-day growth period. One hundred twenty 1-day-old ostrich chicks were randomly assigned to 15 pens. Three varying energy regimes (high, medium and low) and five protein levels (1-5) were supplied ad libitum to each pen. A randomly selected bird from each pen was slaughtered at 1, 35, 63, 103, 159, 168 and 244 days of age. Each bird was weighed, stunned, exsanguinated, defeathered and eviscerated. Individual body components were dissected and weighed at every slaughter age. Proximate analysis was performed on these components, which were ground with the remainder of the carcass, excluding gut content, but including blood and feathers. Based on the analysis of ostrich feathers and the known mass of the feathers, the protein mass contribution of the feathers was deducted from the protein accretion of the bird. All the data were transformed to natural logarithms and regressed against the featherless body protein growth. Intercepts and slopes were compared to determine differences in growth rate ascribed to nutrient densities. Neither dietary energy nor dietary protein level had a significant effect on the relative growth of the measured components in this study. Allometric coefficients were established, which could be helpful to improve the accuracy of simulation modelling attempts for ostrich nutrition.","20":null,"21":"Bovine brucellosis affects food safety, food security and human health in rural communities in the North West Province, South Africa. The World Organisation for Animal Health suggests routine sero-surveillance and vaccination of cattle for control and to prevent zoonotic transmission. Although sero-surveillance and subsidised vaccination have been in place for decades, data from Bojanala have not previously been analysed. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse historical data on routine sero-surveillance of bovine brucellosis and state subsidised vaccination, in communal, commercial and dairy cattle in the study area. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional retrospective analysis of records from all adult cows bled by the state veterinary services during routine sero-surveillance for bovine brucellosis, in the Bojanala Region, North West Province, between 2009 and 2013. Fewer communal (N = 11 815) and dairy (N = 6696), than commercial beef (N = 28 251) cows, were tested. Overall herd prevalence (33.33%), differed significantly from individual prevalence (3.18%) in all groups. Communal herds had both the highest herd prevalence (38.8%) and the highest individual prevalence (5.2%). Both herd and individual sero-prevalence were lowest in dairy cattle, possibly because registered dairy herds are routinely tested. Over the 5-year study period, only 24 086 (7.15%) of the 342 500 cows eligible for free vaccination, were vaccinated. The annual number of cattle tested was highly variable. Dairy cattle that were regularly tested had a significantly lower herd and individual prevalence. Herd prevalence would be useful for spatial mapping, whilst individual prevalence could better reflect the risk of zoonotic transmission.","22":"Impalas (Aepyceros melampus) are common African antelope. A retrospective study was conducted of 251 impala cases from game farms, national parks and zoos submitted by veterinarians and pathologists in South Africa (2003-2016). Histopathology slides as well as records of macroscopic lesions and additional diagnostic tests performed were examined. Non-infectious conditions, such as acute pulmonary congestion and oedema, cachexia, traumatic injury and anaesthetic-related mortality were the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial sepsis was the most common infectious disease, whilst skeletal muscle and myocardial sarcocystosis and verminous cholangitis and pneumonia were the most common parasitic diseases. Although the retrospective nature of this study limits the significance of the relative prevalence of lesions in the three locations, management decisions and diagnostic plans may be informed by the results. Impala from game farms had significantly more cachexia cases than those from other locations. Impala from zoos had significantly more lymphoid depletion than those from other locations. These findings suggest that nutrition and pasture management, enclosure design, management of intra- and interspecies aggression and improved anaesthetic protocols could improve animal welfare and survival of impala on game farms and in zoos. This report presents a detailed survey of diseases and conditions found in impala that provides baseline data for veterinary pathologists.","23":null,"24":"The haemostatic status of dogs with canine parvovirus (CPV) enteritis, within 24 h of admission after initial fluid administration, has been described previously, but the haemostatic status at admission and after standard fluid resuscitation, as well as after initial fluid redistribution, has not been investigated previously. The objective of this study was to characterise the haemostatic status at admission and describe the effect of crystalloid fluid resuscitation on haemostatic variables in dogs with CPV enteritis. Twenty-seven client-owned, hospitalised dogs with confirmed natural CPV infection and 15 healthy age-matched controls were included in a prospective, observational clinical study. The volume of resuscitation fluid, haematocrit (HCT), platelet count, thromboelastography (TEG) variables, antithrombin (AT) activity, fibrinogen- and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured in all dogs at admission, after fluid resuscitation and, in 10 dogs, after receiving an additional 3 hours of maintenance-rate crystalloid fluids. For the CPV group at admission, the median TEG reaction time (R) and maximum amplitude (MA) or clot strength, as well as the median HCT, fibrinogen and CRP concentrations, were significantly increased compared to the controls. After fluid resuscitation, median R was significantly shorter, MA significantly increased and HCT and AT activity significantly decreased compared to admission values. The haemostatic variables remained unchanged after 3 h of maintenance-rate crystalloid therapy. The increased clot strength present in dogs with CPV enteritis at admission was exacerbated after fluid resuscitation and persisted for hours after large-volume crystalloid fluid administration.","25":"Although theoretical training of veterinary students is uncomplicated even for larger groups, practical training remains a challenge. Much has been said about the value of practical training in curriculum design. Yet, the impact of practical training on theoretical knowledge needs further research. A cohort of 89 students with very limited clinical practical experience completed an assessment at the end of their theoretical training in small ruminants. The scores obtained by the students were compared with those obtained by a group of 35 veterinarians who volunteered to participate in the study. In addition to comparing the scores between students and practitioners, the cognitive level of each of the questions was considered. Overall, veterinarians achieved higher test scores than did the students. The veterinarians outperformed the students in all cognitive levels except for 'applying' type questions where there was no difference. Different levels of experience, namely young veterinarians (n = 11), established veterinarians (n = 13) and veterinarians approaching retirement (n = 11), were evaluated against the revised Bloom's cognitive levels. When modelling congress attendance frequency, years' experience, proportion of time spent with ruminants and revised Bloom's levels, congress attendance was not a significant variable, and thus, only the other three variables remained. This investigation found that practical experience has a positive effect on theoretical knowledge. The type of practical experience and where such practical experience is included in a curriculum need further research. Working for a number of years in a specific discipline will provide the best support for theoretical knowledge.","26":"Chickens have been implicated in most Salmonella disease outbreaks because they act as carriers of the pathogen in their gut. There are over 2500 serotypes of Salmonella that have been reported worldwide and 2000 of these serovars can be found in chickens. The main objective of this study was to determine the Salmonella serotypes found in poultry farms around Mafikeng district, South Africa. Salmonella was identified according to the guidelines of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (ISO 6579:2002) standard techniques. Faecal samples were collected and analysed for Salmonella using conventional cultural methods and polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S Ribosomal Deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) gene for Salmonella identification. Out of 130 presumptive Salmonella isolates determined by urease and triple sugar iron tests, only 46 isolates were identified as Salmonella serotypes of which S. Typhimurium was the most frequent with 18 (39.1%), followed by S. Heidelberg with 9 (19.6%), S. bongori with 7 (15.2%), S. Enteritidis with 6 (13.0%) and both S. Paratyphi B and S. Newport with 3 (6.5%) each. Seven virulence genes including invA 100%, spy 39%, hilA 9%, misL 30%, sdfI 13%, orfL 11% and spiC 9% were detected from these Salmonella isolates in this study. The presence of these virulence genes indicates high pathogenicity potential of these isolates which is a serious public health concern because of zoonotic potential of Salmonella.","27":null,"28":"This study investigated the occurrence and phylogenetic relationship of protozoan parasites and Ehrlichia infecting domestic animals from three municipalities in uMkhanyakude district of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. A total of 208 blood samples collected from clinically healthy cattle, sheep, goats and dogs from uMkhanyakude district were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, using either genus or species-specific primers to determine the occurrence and phylogenetic relationship of various protozoan parasites and Ehrlichia of veterinary importance. A total of 5\/109 (4.6%) cattle were PCR-positive for the presence of Toxoplasma gondii, 33\/109 (30.3%) for Babesia bovis, 24\/109 (22.02%) for Babesia bigemina and 20\/109 (18.3%) for Trypanosoma sp., while 3\/10 (30%) of sheep were PCR-positive for Theileria ovis and none of the goats were positive for any of the detected pathogens. The co-infection of 4\/109 (3.7%) B. bovis and B. bigemina was detected in cattle. Only Ehrlichia canis was detected in dogs with infection rate of 20\/48 (41.7%). Sequences of PCR-positive isolates (B. bovis, B. bigemina, E. canis, T. ovis and T. gondii) showed that they were closely related to their relevant species from various countries. These findings have expanded our knowledge about the prevalence and phylogenetic similarity between protozoan parasites and Ehrlichia isolates of South African origin. To date, this is the first study in South Africa to detect T. gondii infections from cattle blood using PCR.","29":"No abstract available.","30":"Otobius megnini has been associated with certain clinical conditions in horses in both California and Mexico. A number of cases similar to those described previously have been identified by the author in South Africa. This case report summarises these cases to demonstrate that the clinical condition occurs readily in South Africa and may be increasing in occurrence. The disease has minimal coverage in the literature making it more likely that a veterinarian, unfamiliar with the disease, will miss the diagnosis. The author would like to make veterinarians aware of this as a potential differential diagnosis. This study is a retrospective review of clinical data. Clinical records of patients with similar clinical signs and treatment were reviewed and grouped together as relevant cases for this case report. Ten cases of O. megnini associated neuromuscular dysfunction are reported, suggesting a link between the occurrence of the tick and the clinical condition. Clinical signs include third eyelid prolapse, localised muscle fasciculations, elevated heart rate and limb stamping. Serum chemistry changes commonly show increased aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase enzymes activities. The occurrence of the ticks within South Africa and the increasing number of cases presented demonstrate the need for more investigation into the pathophysiology of this condition.","31":"There is currently no scientific evidence regarding the current climatic or other epidemiological factors that could influence the occurrence of heartwater in South Africa. The objective was to determine whether climatic changes or other epidemiological factors influence the occurence of heartwater in South Africa. A survey was conducted to scrutinise these factors using both veterinarians and farmers working in known areas in which heartwater had previously been confirmed to establish the value of each of these factors. Based on the observations, meaningful tendencies were noted, and conclusions drawn. These include changes in the spatial distribution of heartwater in many areas, with serious expansion, in some instances, of up to 150 km. In total, 48% of veterinarians and 42% of farmers reported seeing increase in the number of farms affected by heartwater. Climate change as a causative factor indicated by observations of increased average temperatures, milder frosts, less rain and shorter rainy seasons was identified by the majority of farmers but not by as many veterinarians. Respondents in both groups considered vegetation change an important factor. Increasing number of wildlife, especially antelope, was seen as a major factor by most veterinarians and also by many farmers. Both groups identified the movement of livestock and wildlife as an increasingly important factor that should be of major concern for both industries because it leads to the avoidable spread of many diseases apart from heartwater. Movement controls should be reinstated and reinforced by vigorously enforced legislation. The role of genetically determined resistance or resilience to heartwater infection in ruminants should be investigated. Breeding better adapted animals could provide part of a sustainable approach to the disease.

The proportional distribution of pets was determined based on species, sex, age, owner gender, town of origin and naming categories. Overall, 84.4% (n = 2909) of the animals presented for sterilisation were dogs and the remainder were cats (15.6%, n = 539). Of the dogs presented for sterilisation, 51.9% (n = 1509) were male and 48.1% (n = 1400) were female. In cats, 51.4% (n = 277) were male, whilst 48.6% (n = 262) were female. Overall, the majority of pets (68.2%) were presented for sterilisation from urban areas than rural areas (31.8%). About 49.8% of men and 24.2% of women that presented pets for sterilisation came from urban areas, whilst 20.1% of the women and 11.7% of the men that presented pets for sterilisation were from rural areas. Of all the pets presented for sterilisation, the majority were male-owned (64%, n = 2206). Pets were mainly presented for sterilisation at 2 years (41.1%), 2 to 4 years (32.4%) and 4 to 6 years (15.4%). The naming of pets was mainly after people (42.4%), circumstances (20.6%) and appearance (15.5%). This community engagement exercise yielded valuable demographic data indicating that pet origin, sex and species and owner gender were important factors in determining the voluntary presentation of pets for sterilisation in the study area.","36":"Pancreatitis is a common clinical condition seen in companion animals. The correlation of the region of the pancreas affected to the presentation of clinical signs has not been previously described. A retrospective study on the clinical findings in 293 client-owned dogs diagnosed with suspect pancreatitis based on history, clinical signs, laboratory testing and abdominal ultrasonography was performed. Based on ultrasonography, dogs were divided into three groups: group 1: 41 dogs with ultrasonographic changes consistent with pancreatitis within the left lobe of the pancreas; group 2: 105 dogs with ultrasonographic changes compatible with pancreatitis within the right lobe of the pancreas; and group 3: 147 dogs with ultrasonographic evidence of diffuse pancreatitis. No significant differences regarding age, breed and sex were evident. Furthermore, statistical significance was demonstrated with the presence of pain in group 3; poor appetite in groups 2 and 3; and vomiting and diarrhoea in group 3. Pain is expected to occur with a higher frequency in diffuse pancreatitis, but it is not a common clinical sign. This may represent a more severe form of the disease when the pancreas is diffusely affected. Vomiting was more common than diarrhoea with both clinical signs more prevalent in dogs with diffuse pancreatitis, and this could be ascribed to gastric and intestinal tract involvement. Poor appetite occurred more frequently in dogs with diffuse and right lobe pancreatitis. A possible explanation can be attributed to the fact that the duodenum has many receptors and is referred to as the 'organ of nausea'.","37":null,"38":null,"39":"Disorders of sexual development (DSD) in wild mammals are rarely described. A male South African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) was identified with bilateral cryptorchidism. The testes were intra-abdominal, smaller and less ovoid than in normal male giraffes. The right testis was situated more cranially than the left and connected to a longer deferent duct with normal ampullae. One distended vesicular gland filled with mucoid material was identified. A short penis, situated in the perineal area, was directed caudally and presented hypospadias. Histologically, testicular hypoplasia was present; the epididymis tubules contained no spermatozoa and the deferent duct and vesicular gland were inflamed. The blood testosterone concentration was 16.27 nmol\/L and oestrone sulphate concentration was 0.03 ng\/mL. The aetiology of the abnormalities is unknown.","40":"Seal biologists at Marion Island (Southern Ocean) are in frequent contact with seals. During research activities, biologists may be bitten by seals, yet no standardised protocol for treating such bites is in place. Information on 22 seal bite cases at Marion Island was collected. Treatment of these bites varied, reflecting a need for standardised protocols for the treatment of bites. Recommendations for the in-field treatment of bites are presented. Five of the 22 cases had some symptoms which resembled 'seal finger' - a zoonotic infection, usually of the hands, that is contracted after a person comes into contact with tissues of seals or is bitten by one. However, in four of these cases, symptoms subsided within 4 days without antibiotic treatment; in the fifth case antibiotics were administered and symptoms subsided in 4 days. There is little evidence of the occurrence of seal finger at Marion Island, but this deserves further investigation.","41":"A feather cyst in the cervical region which, through complications of inward growth, resulted in compression of the cervical spinal cord of a Lohmann Brown layer is described. It is postulated that expansion of the cyst exerted pressure on the adjacent cervical vertebra and through bone lysis created an opening through which the cyst protruded, thereby exerting pressure on the spinal cord. The affected spinal cord segment was reduced to a fifth of its normal diameter. The bird most likely died of starvation because of limb and neck paralysis and disorientation. Although the cause of the feather cyst was not conclusively identified, moulting and trauma could have triggered its formation and subsequent growth.","42":"Adenoviral infections may cause mild to severe morbidity or fatality in a large array of animal species. In crocodilians, hatchlings under 5 months of age are usually affected. However, there is a paucity of information on actual incidences in hatchlings originating from South Africa. Two cases of adenoviral hepatitis in crocodile hatchlings about 2 weeks old, bred on a commercial farm in South Africa, are described. Both hatchlings showed typical clinical signs of hepatitis. The identification of intranuclear inclusion bodies in the liver was used to differentiate between adenoviral hepatitis and chlamydial hepatitis. Although vertical transmission has never been proven in crocodiles, the young age of the affected hatchlings raises the possibility of vertical transmission. The lack of epidemiological information on adenoviral hepatitis in crocodiles highlights the need for further characterisation of the virus and targeted surveillance.","43":"Infectious arthritis or tenosynovitis in broiler and breeder chickens results in major loss of productivity because of reduced growth and downgrading at processing plants. The most common causative agents of avian infectious arthritis are the bacterium Mycoplasma synoviae and avian reoviruses (ARVs) (family Reoviridae, genus Orthoreovirus). In this study, we evaluated the occurrence of these two pathogens in arthritis or tenosynovitis lesions of broilers and breeder flocks in southern Brazil using molecular detection. Tissue sections from tibiotarsal joints with visible lesions from 719 broilers and 505 breeders were analysed using pathogen-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. In breeders, 41.2% (n = 296) of lesions were positive for M. synoviae, 26.4% (n = 190) were positive for ARV, while co-infection was present in 12.2% (n = 88) of the samples. In broilers, 20.8% (n = 105) of lesions were positive for M. synoviae, 11.9% (n = 60) for ARV and 7.7% (n = 39) of these cases were positive for both pathogens. Post-mortem examination revealed lesions with varying degrees of gross pathological severity. Histopathological examination showed intense, diffuse lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates with heterophil accumulation, primarily in the synovial capsule and digital flexor tendon, in all samples. Improved strategies for early detection and control of these major avian pathogens are highly desirable for preventing the spread of infection and reducing economic losses in the poultry industry.","44":"Cases of rumen impaction caused by ingestion of Gonometa postica cocoons occurred at a farm in eastern-central Namibia. Ten animals died on the farm over the previous 5 months. Rumenotomies were successfully performed on three affected animals. The authors were of the opinion that the affected animals ingested the cocoons around the time of weaning, which then resulted in tangled masses that gradually stretched and enlarged because of entrapment of ingesta, eventually causing impaction of the rumen in the young adult animals. These are the first reported cases of ruminal impaction attributable to G. postica cocoon ingestion in Namibia.","45":"Mortality in cattle associated with ingestion of cocoons (matlhoa in Setswana) of both Gonometa postica and Gonometa rufobrunnea is rare and has only previously been reported in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. A case history of gradual weight loss, bloat, dyschezia with dry faeces and laboured gait, resulting in sudden death after drinking water and associated with ingestion of pupal cocoons of Gonometa spp., was reported by keepers at Mmaditau crush in Botswana in 2013. The crush was a shared holding in a communal area with 15 registered animal keepers. The objective of this study was to profile the history, clinical signs, post-mortem findings, morbidity and mortality from the outbreak using the descriptive study method. Altogether, 81 cattle out of a total of 507 died of impaction from August to December 2013. On autopsy, a loosely connected mass of ingesta, intertwined in ropy silky strands, was observed. It was concluded that there is no readily accessible and available form of treatment at crush level, leaving only evasive husbandry practices as the feasible option. To aid evasive husbandry management practices, temporal and spatial monitoring of population dynamics of Gonometa spp. is recommended, particularly during a drought spell when animals are prone to develop pica, as the basis for an early warning system to farmers.","46":null,"47":null,"48":"Understanding the knowledge and perceptions of veterinary students of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as potential future prescribers of antimicrobials may serve as an opportunity to improve stewardship of AMR. Pre-final (n = 42) and final (n = 29) year veterinary students of the University of Pretoria completed questionnaires to determine their knowledge and perceptions of AMR. Of the 71 respondents, mixed practice (48%) and small animal practice (45%) were the most preferred career choices post-graduation, with the field of gross pathology being the least preferred. Over 80% of the respondents believed that veterinary practitioners' misuse of antimicrobials contributes to AMR and a higher percentage (98.6%) believed that farmers' misuse of antimicrobials encourages the development of AMR, in particular, in food animals (60.6%) compared to companion animals (50.7%). Agreement in the ranking of abuse of antimicrobials between pre-final and final year students was fair (36.4%; kappa 0.3), and the most abused antimicrobials in descending order listed by the students were tetracyclines, penicillins, sulphonamides and aminoglycosides. There was wide disparity between training and potential field application, as well as variations in the correct matching of antimicrobials to their respective antibiotic classes. Responses to the clinical application of antimicrobials also varied widely. Despite the apparent teaching of AMR to veterinary students, gaps may exist in the translation of theoretical concepts to clinical applications, hence the need for focused and targeted antimicrobial prescription and stewardship training to bridge these potential identified gaps.","49":"A definitive diagnosis of extensive suture line exostoses affecting the nasofrontal, nasolacrimal, nasomaxillary, frontolacrimal, lacrimozygomatic and lacrimomaxillary suture lines in a 7-year-old Thoroughbred mare with chronic bilateral epiphora and facial deformation was achieved using standing computed tomography (CT) examinations. Positive contrast dacryocystorhinography using CT revealed partial bilateral obstruction of the nasolacrimal ducts. Minimally displaced depression fractures of the right nasal bone, the right maxillary bone and right frontal bone were also demonstrated. The cosmetic appearance of the periosteal reaction associated with the suture line exostosis and epiphora significantly improved within 3 months of diagnosis and treatment.","50":"The growing population of free-roaming dogs in informal communities in South Africa may increasingly place humans at risk of possible zoonotic infections including, but not limited to, Brucella canis. Worldwide, the prevalence of B. canis infection has increased during the last two centuries, resulting in increased reports of dog and human infections. This study investigated the risk factors associated with B. canis infection in dogs in three predefined areas: Gauteng, the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, of South Africa. Dogs aged 7 months and older presented to welfare organisations and breeders in the study areas were selected for sampling. A comprehensive questionnaire on dog ownership, general health and vaccination status was completed prior to sampling. One blood sample of 8 mL was collected aseptically per dog. Then, equal amounts (4 mL) were transferred to the different vacutainer tubes. The 2-mercaptoethanol-tube agglutination tests were used after validation. Fifty-two dogs out of the combined sample of 1191 dogs from the three study areas tested positive for B. canis, representing an overall occurrence of 4.4%. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted to identify risk factors associated with B. canis in dogs within the study areas. Dog age (0.371; p 0.05) and external parasite infestation (0.311; p 0.05) were significantly associated with the B. canis infection. Ownership and sterilisation need to be further investigated as possible risk factors because both had odds ratios of 1684 and 1107, respectively, in the univariate model.","51":"Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, has been detected in food products of animal origin globally. Limited data have been reported on the factors contributing to antibiotic resistance of food-borne pathogens in South Africa. The primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of S. aureus, including antibiotic-resistant strains, in poultry meat products as well as the evaluation of potential risk factors for contamination of poultry meat products with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus isolates. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted in municipalities located across the nine provinces of South Africa, which included abattoirs, meat processing facilities, retail outlets and cold stores at the major ports of entry into South Africa. Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from various poultry meat products were tested for susceptibility to 14 antibiotic compounds representing 10 antibiotic classes using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Potential risk factors were evaluated using a logistic regression model. Of the 311 samples tested, 34.1% (n = 106) were positive for S. aureus (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.9% - 39.7%). Seventy-two of the 106 isolates were randomly selected for antibiotic sensitivity testing. Twenty-one per cent (n = 15) of the isolates selected for sensitivity testing were methicillin-resistant strains (95% CI, 12.2% - 32.0%). Multi-drug resistance was detected in 22.2% (n = 16) of these isolates tested (95% CI, 13.3% - 33.6%). Origin of the product (p = 0.160), type of meat product (p = 0.962), type of facility (p = 0.115) and facility hygiene practices (p = 0.484) were not significantly associated with contamination of poultry meat products with methicillin-resistant strains. The study provides baseline data for further studies on antibiotic resistance risk assessments for food-borne pathogens, including S. aureus, which should guide the implementation plans of the South African National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy Framework, 2017-2024.","52":"The objective of this study was to gain better insight into factors associated with the capture-related mortality rate in cheetahs. A link to an online questionnaire was sent to zoo and wildlife veterinarians through the Species Survival Plan Programme and European Endangered Species Programme coordinators and via the 'Wildlife VetNet' Google group forum. The questionnaire consisted of 50 questions relating to the veterinarians' country of residence and experience, the medicine combinations used, standard monitoring procedures, capture-related complications and mortalities experienced in this species under different capture conditions. In addition, necropsy data from the national wildlife disease database of the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa were examined for cases where anaesthetic death was listed as the cause of death in cheetahs. A total of 75 veterinarians completed the survey, with 38 from African countries and a combined total of 37 from Europe, the United States (US) and Asia. Of these, 24% (n = 18\/75) had experienced at least one capture-associated cheetah mortality, with almost all of the fatalities (29\/30) reported by veterinarians working in Africa. A lack of anaesthetic monitoring and the absence of supplemental oxygen were shown to be significant risk factors for mortality. Hyperthermia, likely to be associated with capture stress, was the most common reported complication (35%). The results suggest that free-ranging rather than habituated captive cheetahs are particularly at risk of dying during immobilisation and transport. The capture-related fatalities in this species do not appear to be associated with either the veterinarian's level of clinical experience or the immobilisation agents used.","53":null,"54":"Equid herpesvirus type 1 is primarily a respiratory tract virus associated with poor athletic performance that can also cause late gestation abortion, neonatal foal death and encephalomyelopathy. Horizontal transmission is well described, whereas evidence of vertical transmission of equid herpesvirus type 1 associated with the birth of a healthy foal has not been demonstrated. This study sampled a population of Thoroughbred mares (n = 71), and their healthy neonatal foals and foetal membranes, to test for the presence of both equid herpesvirus types 1 and 4 using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Foetal membrane swabs and tissue samples were taken immediately post-partum, and venous blood samples and nasal swabs were obtained from both mare and foal 8 h after birth. Neither equid herpesvirus type 1 nor equid herpesvirus type 4 nucleic acid was detected in any sample, and it was concluded that there was no active shedding of equid herpesvirus types 1 and 4 at the time of sampling. Consequently, no evidence of vertical transmission of these viruses could be found on this stud farm during the sampling period.","55":"Osteoarthritis is a common cause of lameness in horses, resulting in poor performance. Intra-articular platelet-rich plasma can deliver a collection of bioactive molecules, such as autologous growth factors and proteins involved in the quality of tissue repair. Horses (n=5) with osteoarthritis affecting antebrachiocarpal, middle carpal or metacarpophalangeal joints, and horses (n=5) without osteoarthritis of the corresponding joints (radiographically free of osteoarthritis), were used for the production of platelet-rich plasma which was subsequently injected into selected joints. Clinical and synovial fluid changes after intra-articular injection of platelet-rich plasma as well as synovial platelet-derived growth factor-BB and transforming growth factor-beta 1 concentration changes were evaluated in these joints and compared between normal joints and joints with osteoarthritis. A gravity filtration system produced a moderately concentrated platelet-rich plasma, representing a 4.7-fold increase in baseline platelet concentration. The synovial effusion score was significantly different between the control joints and joints with osteoarthritis on Day 0 with a higher score in the group with osteoarthritis. Within the control group, the synovial effusion score was significantly higher on Days 1 and 2 compared to Day 0. For both groups, the synovial fluid nucleated cell count, predominantly intact neutrophils, was significantly increased on Days 1 and 2, with no significant difference between groups. The mean synovial platelet-derived growth factor-BB and transforming growth factor-beta 1 concentrations were increased for both groups but significantly lowered in the group with osteoarthritis on Day 1 compared to normal joints. Concentrations for platelet-derived growth factor-BB remained unchanged on Day 5, compared to Day 1, with no significant difference between groups. In conclusion, intra-articular treatment with platelet-rich plasma resulted in increased synovial growth factor concentrations in joints but with lower concentrations in joints with osteoarthritis. A transient inflammatory reaction was seen both clinically as an increase in synovial effusion and cytologically in both normal joints and joints with osteoarthritis.","56":"Canine parvovirus first emerged in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), most likely as a variant of the feline panleucopaenia virus. Relatively recently, canine parvovirus-2a and canine parvovirus-2b infections have been identified in both symptomatic and asymptomatic domestic cats, while canine parvovirus infections have also been demonstrated in wild felids. This report documents the first known case of canine parvovirus-2b detected in unvaccinated serval (Leptailurus serval) from South Africa. The serval presented with clinical signs of vomiting, anorexia and diarrhoea that responded to symptomatic treatment. Two weeks later, severe leucopaenia, thrombocytopenia and death occurred. Typical enteric histological lesions of parvovirus infection were not observed on histopathological examination of the small intestine; however, histological lesions consistent with septicaemia were present. Canine parvovirus was detected in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded small intestine using polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of the canine parvovirus viral capsid protein gene showed similarities between the sample from the serval and canine parvovirus-2b isolates from domestic dogs in Argentina and South Africa. A case of canine parvovirus-2b in a domestic dog from South Africa in 2012 that fell within the same clade as the serval sample appears distantly related because of the long branch length. The significance of these findings is explored. More extensive surveys of canine parvovirus in domestic and wild felids and canids are needed to understand the epidemiology of canine parvovirus in non-domestic felids in South Africa.","57":"Hepatoblastoma was diagnosed in a 3-year-old Thoroughbred gelding presented with forelimb lameness with bilateral fatigue fractures of the proximal third metacarpal bones. An abdominal mass was detected on ultrasound examination of the abdomen. Absolute erythrocytosis was diagnosed after clinical and haematological evaluation. The fractured metacarpal bones were surgically removed but complications after surgery were fatal. The liver mass was diagnosed as a hepatoblastoma based on histology and immunochemical staining. The combination of hepatoblastoma and fatigue fractures has not been described previously in horses. A potential link between the hepatic and orthopaedic pathologies is hypothesised.","58":"Bilateral paranasal sinus diseases are rarely reported in horses. Treatment using a bilateral frontonasal bone flap on a standing, regular-sized adult horse has not been described previously. A 13-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was evaluated for bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge. Radiographic, endoscopic and computed tomographic examinations revealed bilateral sinus pathological changes consistent with an ethmoid haematoma involving the maxillary and frontal sinuses. A bilateral frontonasal bone flap was created under standing sedation and local anaesthesia. A tracheotomy was performed initially to ensure a patent airway during the procedure. Additional analgesia had to be given to transect the dorsal part of the nasal septum while elevating the flap. The sinus masses were removed and communications with the nasal cavities created uneventfully. Small sequestra were removed transendoscopically from the left caudal maxillary sinus 4 weeks after the initial procedure. The horse made a complete recovery with an excellent cosmetic outcome. Histopathology revealed the mass to be a sinus cyst. We concluded that a bilateral sinus bone flap can be used in adult regular-sized horses to access the left and right paranasal sinuses simultaneously. Regional nerve blocks should be performed in order to increase analgesia. A temporary tracheotomy prevents any airway obstruction during the procedure. The post-operative cosmesis is excellent.","59":null,"60":"A non-ossified unilateral subcutaneous fibroma was diagnosed in the distal femoral region of a 5-year-old Nooitgedacht mare. Histopathological examination of the excised mass revealed long interweaving bundles of semi-mature monotonous collagenous connective tissue with fusiform nuclei without mitotic figures. The mare made an uneventful recovery following surgical removal of the neoplasm. Subcutaneous fibromas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skin swellings associated with the limbs of horses.","61":"Physeal fractures of the distal femur are among the most commonly encountered fractures in skeletally immature dogs. These fractures respond poorly to conservative management and thus early surgical reduction and stabilisation are recommended. A 7-month-old intact male Border collie presented with a history of chronic lameness. Clinical examination revealed a predominantly non-weight-bearing lameness of the right hindlimb and concurrent muscle atrophy. A pronounced, but atypical, procurvatum deformity of the right distal femur was diagnosed on survey radiographs. Malunion of a Salter-Harris Type III physeal fracture was suspected as there was an associated history of trauma. A cranially based closing wedge ostectomy was performed to address the femoral deformity and subsequently stabilised using a supracondylar bone plate. The dog recovered well and was moderately weight-bearing lame on the right hindlimb 6 weeks post-operatively. Ten months following the operation the range of motion had improved in the right stifle and no signs of lameness were evident at a walk. We advocate surgical correction of sagittal plane deformities of the distal femur using the CORA method. Overall, a good functional outcome was achieved, which is consistent with previously reported cases with similar deformities.","62":null,"63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":"A 12-year-old spayed Newfoundland bitch was presented with chronic non-productive vomiting, regurgitation and coughing of six weeks' duration. On clinical examination, the dog was depressed with no other significant findings. Haematology and biochemistry investigations detected no abnormalities. Thoracic and abdominal radiographs revealed a megaoesophagus and an abnormally positioned pylorus. A thoracic and abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed the abnormal position of the stomach, together with moderate aspiration pneumonia. Laparoscopic examination of the peritoneal cavity revealed the greater omentum wrapped over the stomach, with a fold visualised between the abnormally positioned pyloric antrum and the gastric corpus. A 180-degree clockwise gastric rotation was laparoscopically diagnosed and corrected. The normal position of the stomach was confirmed before a laparoscopic-assisted incisional gastropexy was performed. Post-operatively the vomiting and regurgitation resolved and the patient was discharged. Twenty-four hours after discharge, the dog was presented with deteriorating clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia. The owner declined treatment, additional diagnostics as well as a necropsy and requested euthanasia. Chronic gastric volvulus should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis in dogs with non-specific, chronic gastrointestinal signs. Radiography, computed tomography and laparoscopy are valuable diagnostic aids in making this diagnosis. Chronic gastric volvulus can be successfully reduced laparoscopically as reported here for the first time.","68":null,"69":null,"70":"A 4-month-old female blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) was presented for bilateral pelvic limb fracture repair. Clinical examination under anaesthesia revealed a water-hammer pulse and a haematocrit of 0.13. A xenotransfusion was performed using bovine (Bos taurus) erythrocytes because of inability to acquire a wildebeest donor. Clinical parameters improved following transfusion and the post-operative haematocrit value was 0.31. The wildebeest remained physiologically stable with a gradually declining haematocrit for the next three days. On the third post-operative day, the wildebeest refractured its femur and was humanely euthanised because of the poor prognosis for further fracture repair. Xenotransfusion using blood from domestic ruminants represents a life-saving short-term emergency treatment of anaemic hypoxia in wild ungulates. Domestic goats could be used as blood donors for rare ungulates where allodonors are not available.","71":"Several ruminant species have been shown to be susceptible to Schmallenberg virus (SBV), but adult animals usually recover after showing mild or no clinical signs. However, transplacental infection can occur and lead to abortion, malformations and stillborn lambs, calves and goat kids. During November and December 2014, malformations were observed in 11 stillborn calves from two farms in the north-eastern region of Namibia. Blood samples were collected from 9 of the 11 cows that delivered stillborn and malformed calves. All these animals tested negative for Rift Valley fever, bovine viral diarrhoea and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and were serologically positive for bluetongue virus, SBV and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus. Clinical findings and serological results suggested that SBV may be circulating in Namibia.","72":null,"73":"Reports were received that Cape spurfowl (Pternistis capensis) fell during flight and scrambled uncoordinatedly for cover and some died. Three carcases were submitted for necropsy examination, which revealed mainly congestion of the carcases and haemorrhages. Common causes of acute mortalities in birds were first excluded, but there was a history of possible exposure to imidacloprid-treated barley seeds. Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, is used to protect various crops against invertebrate pests. The combined crop contents and pooled liver samples collected from the Cape spurfowl during necropsy were submitted for liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for imidacloprid analysis. Imidacloprid and several of its metabolites were detected in the samples. Farmers should cover sown seeds with a layer of soil and remove any spilled seeds, as granivorous birds are susceptible to imidacloprid intoxication. Regulatory authorities should re-evaluate the risk posed by imidacloprid-treated seeds for pollinators and granivorous birds.","74":null,"75":"Axial sesamoiditis or osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSBs) in the horse is described as a rare condition. The cause remains unknown and speculative, with vascular, infectious, and traumatic aetiologies implicated. It is specifically associated with injury of the palmar or plantar ligament (PL), also known as the intersesamoidean ligament. Imaging findings are generally rewarding and radiological changes are typical, if not pathognomonic, for the condition. Lesions consist of bone lysis at the apical to mid-body axial margins of the PSBs, with variable degrees of joint effusion. Radiographic technique warrants careful attention to make a diagnosis, and exposure factors may need to be adjusted. Perineural, intra-articular and intra-thecal anaesthesia does not seem to provide consistent improvement of lameness in these cases, with literature reporting inconsistent findings. Ultrasonographic findings include digital flexor sheath effusion, loss of the normal fibre structure of the PL at its attachment to the PSBs, abnormal echogenicity or change in thickness of the PL, and irregular hyperechoic cortical margins of the axial margins of the PSBs. Scintigraphy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, although not necessary to make a diagnosis, may add valuable information regarding the location and extent of lesions. The prognosis remains guarded to poor for return to athletic function. The focus of this paper is a comprehensive review of the proposed aetiopathogenesis of the condition, the prognosis, and a summary of the literature findings with focus on the notable diagnostic imaging features, including radiography, ultrasonography, scintigraphy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.","76":null,"77":"Both domestic and wild carnivore species are commonly diagnosed with rabies virus (RABV) infection in South Africa. Although the majority of confirmed rabies cases in wild carnivore species are reported from the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), the rest are from other wild carnivores including the highly endangered wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Lyssavirus infection was confirmed in two wild dogs and a spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) in the Madikwe Game Reserve, North West province in South Africa, in 2014 and 2015, using a direct fluorescent antibody test and immunohistochemistry. There had been no new wild dog introductions to the Madikwe Game Reserve for many years and the wild dogs were last vaccinated against rabies approximately 11 years prior to the incident. The first euthanised wild dog was the last surviving of a break-away pack of 6, and the second was the last of a larger pack of 18, the rest of which died with no carcasses being found or carcasses too decomposed for sampling. Subsequent antigenic typing of the lyssaviruses indicated that they were canid RABVs. The RABVs originating from 22 wild carnivore species, 7 dogs, and a caprine, mostly from the North West province, were genetically characterised by targeting a partial region of the nucleoprotein gene. The nucleotide sequence analyses of these viruses and two previously characterised RABVs confirmed that the outbreak viruses were also canid rabies, phylogenetically clustering with virus isolates originating from black-backed jackals recovered between 2012 and 2015 from the North West province, and domestic dogs from neighbouring communal areas. The source(s) of the mortalities and possible reservoir host(s) for the virus could only be speculated upon from data on specific predator numbers, movements and behaviour, kills, park management and the changing environmental ecology, which were monitored closely in Madikwe over several years. The most likely rabies sources were from boundary fence contacts between wild carnivores within the park, with domestic dogs or cats and\/or naturally occurring wild carnivores outside the park. The associated risk of zoonotic infection and threat to important and endangered predators may be mitigated through regional rabies control primarily in domestic dogs and cats, as well as by preventative vaccination of at-risk park employees and their pets. The importance of ongoing prophylactic rabies protection by regular vaccination of highly endangered wildlife carnivores and the submission of carcasses for rabies diagnosis of any wild or domestic animals behaving uncharacteristically or found dead is emphasised.","78":null,"79":null,"80":"No abstract available.","81":"The steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) is a small antelope of the family Bovidae native to the African continent. Urolithiasis, the formation of urinary calculi in the urinary tract, can be caused by a variety of factors such as diet, dehydration, infection and anatomical predisposition. Urolithiasis, with uroliths identified as magnesium calcium phosphate carbonate in composition, was diagnosed in a hand-reared 5-month-old steenbok. Perineal urethrostomy was performed as a component of the broad treatment regime that included fluid therapy, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment. However, the animal died 4 days later as a result of systemic hypoxia and energy depletion because of stress and cachexia. The challenges of post-surgical treatment, the importance of positive energy balance in small ruminants under stressful circumstances, as well as the role of diet of hand-reared antelope in predisposition to urolith formation are highlighted.","82":"Although porcupine quill injuries are common in dogs, the detailed appearance of the quill on diagnostic ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging has not been sufficiently described. A 4-year-old, intact, female Jack Russel terrier presented with severe neck pain and ataxia after an altercation with a porcupine 2 weeks earlier. Radiology, diagnostic ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were all utilised to identify a quill imbedded in the cervical vertebral canal and cervical musculature and were compared to each other. Surgical removal of the quill, guided by imaging findings, led to the resolution of the clinical signs in the patient. Previous ultrasound imaging reports have just stated that the quill consists of paralell hyperechoic lines, and do not mention the finer hyperechoic lines inbetween and do not try to provide a reason for the appearance. Previous computed tomography (CT) reports just mention identifying the quill on CT images (whether or not CT could identify the fragments), but do not go into detail about the attenuating appearance of the quill nor try to relate this to the composition of the quill. This is to the authors' knowledge the first report with detailed imaging descriptions of a case of cranial cervical vertebral canal porcupine quill foreign body in a dog. This is also the first report to allude to a possible difference in imaging findings related to quill structure because of keratin orientation and melanin content. The ideal imaging modality to use remains elusive, but ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could all identify the quill.","83":"The Asiatic blue tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, a known vector of bovine babesiosis and bovine anaplasmosis, is of great concern in the cattle industry. For this reason, detailed knowledge of the distribution of R. microplus is vital. Currently, R. microplus is believed to be associated mainly with the northern and eastern Savanna and Grassland vegetation in South Africa. The objective of the study was to record the distribution of R. microplus, and the related endemic Rhipicephalus decoloratus, in the central-western region of South Africa that comprises Albany Thicket, Fynbos and Savanna vegetation. In this survey, ticks were collected from 415 cattle in four provinces (Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Western Cape and Free State provinces) and from the vegetation in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa between October 2013 and September 2015. More than 8000 ticks were collected from cattle at 80 localities of which R. microplus was present at 64 localities and R. decoloratus at 47 localities. A total of 7969 tick larvae were recorded from the vegetation at 20 localities of which 6593 were R. microplus and 1131 were R. decoloratus. Rhipicephalus microplus was recorded in each of the regions that were sampled. Rhipicephalus microplus is now present throughout the coastal region of the Eastern Cape province and at multiple localities in the north-eastern region of the Northern Cape province. It was also recorded in the western region of the Western Cape province and one record was made for the Free State province. The observed range changes may be facilitated by the combined effects of environmental adaptability by the tick and the movement of host animals.","84":null,"85":"Contamination with mycotoxins is of concern to pet owners and veterinary practitioners owing to their ability to cause disease and exacerbate the pathological changes associated with other diseases. Currently, there is a lack of information regarding the mycotoxin content of common premium brand (PB) and grocery brand (GB) cat feeds. Therefore, we undertook to determine the mycobiota content of feed samples, from both categories (n = 6 each), and measured the levels of aflatoxin (AF), fumonisin (FB), ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) by high performance liquid chromatographic analysis. There were high concentrations of mycotoxins in both categories of feed, regardless of the notion that PBs are of a higher quality. The concentration of these toxins may contribute to the development of related pathologies in felines.","86":"Serology is primarily used in the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis. Bacterial culture and isolation is the gold standard in diagnosing brucellosis but, like serology, it does not offer complete (100%) diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been suggested to offer better specificity and sensitivity. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Brucella abortus species specific (BaSS) PCR directly from different samples in the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in naturally infected cattle in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa with known infectious status from culture. The BaSS PCR had a low diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 70%, but was able to identify vaccine strains using abomasal fluid from aborted foetuses and detect Brucella DNA from decomposing samples. The best sample for the BaSS PCR was abomasal fluid.","87":"Dry pelleted dog food in the South African market is available via supermarkets, pet stores (standard brands [SBs]) and veterinary channels (premium brands [PBs]). For the purpose of this study, the supermarket channel included the cheaper quality foods and PBs were sold via the veterinary channel (n = 20). These feeds were analysed for four main mycotoxins (aflatoxins [AF], fumonisin [FB], ochratoxin A [OTA] and zearalenone [ZEA]) using standard welldescribed extraction, characterisation and quantitation processes. Irrespective of the brand or marketing channel, all foods were contaminated with fungi (mainly Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus parasiticus) and mycotoxins (most prevalent being aflatoxins and fumonisins). This was observed in all 20 samples irrespective of the marketing channel or perceived quality. Also, many samples within each marketing channel failed the 10 ppb limit for aflatoxin set by regulations in South Africa. Although fumonisin was detected in all samples, a single sample failed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) limit of 100 ppb. Both OTA and ZEA were found at low concentrations and were absent in some samples. This study suggested that higher priced dog food does not ensure superior quality or that it is free from contamination with fungi or mycotoxins. However, analysis of the more expensive PBs did reveal contamination concentrations lower than those of the SBs.","88":"Dogs (Canis familiaris) are often free-roaming in sub-Saharan African countries. Rabies virus circulates in many of these populations and presents a public health issue. Mass vaccination of dog populations is the recommended method to decrease the number of dog and human rabies cases. We describe and compare four populations of dogs and their vaccination coverage in four different villages (Hluvukani, Athol, Utah and Dixie) in Bushbuckridge Municipality, Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the villages of Athol, Utah and Dixie, while data from a Health and Demographic Surveillance System were used to describe the dog population in Hluvukani village. All households of the villages were visited to obtain information on the number, sex, age and rabies vaccination status of dogs. From May to October 2013, 2969 households were visited in the four villages and 942 owned dogs were reported. The populations were all young and skewed towards males. No differences were observed in the sex and age distributions (puppies 0-3 months excluded) among the villages. Athol had a higher proportion of dog-owning households than Hluvukani and Utah. Vaccination coverages were all above the 20% - 40% threshold required for herd immunity to rabies (38% in Hluvukani, 51% in Athol, 65% in Dixie and 74% in Utah). For the preparation of vaccination campaigns, we recommend the use of the relatively stable dog:human ratio (between 1:12 and 1:16) to estimate the number of dogs per village in Bushbuckridge Municipality.","89":null,"90":null,"91":null,"92":"Rhodococcus equi is a common cause of pneumonia in foals and has extensive clinical, economic and possibly zoonotic consequences. This bacterium survives well in the environment and may be considered as normal flora of adult horses. Certain strains of this bacterium are extremely virulent in foals, and early identification and intervention is crucial for prognosis. Rhodococcus equi is endemic in many parts of the world and occasionally isolated in Israel. This study was designed to evaluate R. equi seroprevalence in adult horses in Israel to indirectly indicate the potential level of exposure of susceptible foals. Sera were collected from 144 horses during spring 2011 and from 293 horses during fall 2014, and the presence of antibodies against virulent R. equi was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Equine seroprevalence of R. equi was found to be 7.6% in 2011 and 5.1% in 2014. Only one farm had seropositive horses in 2011, whereas several farms had seropositive horses in 2014. No significant risk factors for seropositivity were found. Rhodococcus equi appears to be endemic in Israel. This is the first survey of R. equi in Israel that provides information on the epidemiology of this important bacterium.","93":null,"94":"A 5-year-old, intact, male Yorkshire Terrier presented with a 6-day history of lethargy and anorexia. Clinical examination revealed dental plaque accumulation, abdominal effort during respiration and muffled heart sounds. Thoracic radiographs revealed an enlarged globoid cardiac silhouette and mild pneumopericardium, transthoracic ultrasonography revealed a pericardial effusion after which pericardiocentesis, cytology and culture diagnosed septic pericarditis. Three multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated, two of which have been implicated in gas-producing infections before. Medical management failed to resolve the pericarditis and euthanasia was opted for. A chronic osseocartilaginous oesophageal foreign body cranial to the heart base was found on necropsy. Septic pericarditis and pneumopericardium are rare conditions in dogs. This is the first case to describe a multidrug-resistant polybacterial aetiology causing mild pneumopericardium and only the second case to describe septic pericarditis associated with an oesophageal foreign body.","95":"A 4-year-old Thoroughbred gelding underwent an explorative celiotomy for a suspected small intestinal obstruction. During surgery, an impacted diverticulum of the ileum was suspected, necessitating a jejunocaecostomy. The owner opted for euthanasia. On post-mortem examination and histopathology, a true diverticulum on the mesenteric side of the ileum, with ileal hypertrophy, was diagnosed.","96":"Ticks are major vectors of arthropod-borne infections and transmit a wide variety of zoonotic pathogens. This study was conducted mainly to determine the occurrence of canine tick-borne bacterial and rickettsial pathogens especially those with zoonotic potential. We examined 276 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 38 Haemaphysalis elliptica and 4 Amblyomma hebraeum ticks from 90 dogs and 4 cats from the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, North West and Mpumalanga provinces. DNA of Coxiella burnetii (41%), Ehrlichia or Anaplasma (18%), Rickettsia spp. (37%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum-like bacterium (18%) and Ehrlichia canis (19%) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a total of 147 pooled DNA samples. All samples were negative for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA. Ehrlichia canis was detected in samples from all the provinces except the North West; A. phagocytophilum was absent in KwaZulu-Natal samples, whereas Rickettsia species and C. burnetii were detected in all sampled provinces. The PCRpositive samples were confirmed by direct sequencing of the product. Data from this study calls for a joint effort by both veterinary and medical sectors to conduct epidemiological studies of the zoonotic pathogens in both animals and humans.","97":"Antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus aureus in human and veterinary medicine is a serious worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus in commercial broiler chickens as well as to establish antimicrobial susceptibility and the distribution of genetic determinants conferring resistance and virulence. One hundred and ninety-four samples were aseptically collected from broiler chicken slaughterhouses and retail outlets around the Durban metropolitan area in South Africa. Microbiological and molecular methods were used to detect the presence of S. aureus as well as its resistance- and virulence-associated genes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the presence of S. aureus by amplifying the nuc gene. Approximately 54% of 194 samples were positive for S. aureus. The disc diffusion technique was used to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the S. aureus isolates to a battery of 10 antimicrobial agents, namely ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and trimethoprim. The results demonstrated that S. aureus isolates of abattoir origin had a high level (79.4%) of resistance to tetracycline, followed by ampicillin, vancomycin, cefoxitin, trimethoprim, erythromycin and streptomycin with resistance rates of 65.1%, 61.9%, 60.3%, 58.7%, 57.1% and 46.0%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus isolates of retail origin exhibited higher antimicrobial resistance prevalence rates than those of abattoir origin. Tetracycline had the highest resistance rate (100%), followed by cefoxitin (91.7%), erythromycin (83.3%), streptomycin (83.3%) and kanamycin (66.7%). All isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents. Out of the four virulence genes that were screened, only two were detected (coagulase and protein A); however, their prevalence rates were very low. All antimicrobial resistance genes screened were detected (mecA, BlaZ and tetK), although their prevalence did not correspond with antimicrobial susceptibility testing.","98":"The objective of this study was to determine whether somatic cell count (SCC) was an effective test, with a sensitivity exceeding 85%, to determine species-specific bacterial infections. In addition, the relation between the SCC and various udder pathogen groups was investigated. SCC thresholds of greater than 200 000 cells\/mL were used in quarter and greater than 150 000 cells\/mL in composite milk samples. A retrospective study was conducted on a data set for 89 635 quarter and 345 467 composite cow milk samples. Eleven SCC threshold values were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy for the following bacteria: Gram-positive major pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis; Gram-negative major pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Serratia spp.; minor pathogens: coagulase-negative staphylococci, Micrococcus spp., Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus canis, Trueperella pyogenes and other Enterobacteriaceae. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated taking the effect of clustering into account with quarter milk samples. Most samples yielding major Gram-positive pathogens (88.9% in quarter and 79.9% in composite samples) and minor pathogens (61.4% in quarter and 51.7% in composite samples) had SCC greater than 200 000 cells\/mL. Sensitivity of the SCC test to detect major pathogens at an SCC threshold of greater than 200 000 cells\/mL in quarter samples and greater than 150 000 cells\/mL in composite milk samples was 88.2% and 84.2%, respectively, but specificity was low (57.7% and 52.8%, respectively).","99":"A 3-year prospective study investigated the incidence of milk fever in Jersey and Holstein cows at a commercial dairy farm in Beatrice, Zimbabwe. The overall incidence of milk fever at the farm was 7.98%. Incidence of milk fever in Jerseys (14.78%) was significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) than that in Holsteins (4.82%). Incidence of milk fever in Jerseys beyond their fourth parity (24.85%) was significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) than that in Jerseys in their second (5.90%), third (6.49%) and fourth (8.73%) parities. Incidence of milk fever in Holsteins beyond their fourth parity (8.29%) was significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) than that in Holsteins in their second (1.43%), third (1.82%) and fourth (2.91%) parities. No significant difference existed in milk fever incidences between the second, third and fourth parities in either Jersey or Holstein cows. Incidence of milk fever in Jersey cows producing over 6114 litres per 305-day lactation (27.07%) was significantly higher than that in Jerseys producing less than 6114 litres of milk per 305-day lactation (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Incidence of milk fever in Holsteins producing more than 9149 litres per 305-day lactation (10.49%) was significantly higher than that in Holsteins producing less than 9149 litres of milk per 305-day lactation (p &amp;lt; 0.05). No significant difference existed between incidences of milk fever between the first, second and third quartile producers (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in either Jersey or Holstein cows. This study confirms that the risk of developing milk fever is higher in Jerseys and also increases with increasing parity and higher levels of milk production in both breeds, thus advocating for special considerations when dairy cows fit these criteria.","100":"Two confirmed cases of fatal disseminated toxoplasmosis occurred in an urban zoological collection of meerkats (Suricata suricatta). Both cases are suspected to be the result of feral cats gaining access to the enclosure. Toxoplasmosis has rarely been documented in meerkats. Subsequent to prophylactic treatment of all the animals and structural changes being implemented within the enclosure, no new cases have been recorded to date. Very little information is available on the disease in viverrids.","101":"This case report shows that Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection can cause clinical disease in domestic dogs, and should be considered as a differential diagnosis for gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions. A male dachshund presented with lethargy and pain. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were found on abdominal ultrasound examination. Cytological examination of lymph node aspirates was consistent with granulomatous inflammation, which was culture-confirmed as MAP. Although we were unable to confirm the source of infection, the dog's history included exposure to sheep in the Western Cape.","102":"Bedding material, which is a significant part of rodent housing, affects the health and well-being of laboratory animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate perlite as a bedding material for rodents and to compare it with wood shavings, expanded perlite and corncobs. The animals used in this experiment were 48 male and 48 female Sprague-Dawley rats. The bedding materials collected from experimental groups were analysed microbiologically. Blood samples from rats were subjected to biochemical analysis for catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde, superoxide and dismutase, and foot pad skins of rats were subjected to histopathological examination. Body weight was determined at the end of the 30-day period. Perlite as the only bedding material had no effect on body weight, and it resulted in less microbial activity compared with the wood shavings, expanded perlite and corncobs. However, using perlite alone had negative effects on the skin, the moisture percentage of bedding and stress parameters. A wood shavingsperlite combination gave better results than perlite alone and appropriate perlite and other bedding material mixtures may result in bedding materials conducive to animal health and welfare. The frequency of changing the bedding material should be limited to once weekly.","103":"Rabies is a neglected zoonotic disease with veterinary and public health significance, particularly in Africa and Asia. The current knowledge of the epidemiology of rabies in Mozambique is limited because of inadequate sample submission, constrained diagnostic capabilities and a lack of molecular epidemiological research. We wanted to consider the direct, rapid immunohistochemical test (DRIT) as an alternative to the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) for rabies diagnosis at the diagnostic laboratory of the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), Directorate of Animal Science, Maputo, Mozambique. Towards this aim, as a training exercise at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Rabies Reference Laboratory in South Africa, we performed the DRIT on 29 rabies samples from across Mozambique. With the use of the DRIT, we found 15 of the 29 samples (52%) to be negative. The DRIT-negative samples were retested by DFA at the OIE Rabies Reference Laboratory, as well as with an established real-time Polymerase chain reaction, confirming the DRIT-negative results. The DRIT-positive results (14\/29) were retested with the DFA and subsequently amplified, sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses, confirming the presence of rabies RNA. Molecular epidemiological analyses that included viruses from neighbouring countries suggested that rabies cycles within Mozambique might be implicated in multiple instances of cross-border transmission. In this regard, our study has provided new insights that should be helpful in informing the next steps required to better diagnose, control and hopefully eliminate rabies in Mozambique.","104":"The diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of the Rose Bengal test (RBT), the complement fixation test (CFT), the serum agglutination test (SAT), the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and the indirect ELISA (iELISA) were determined in naturally infected cattle in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa with known infectious status from culture (gold standard). Natural brucellosis infection status of animals was determined by culturing and identification of Brucella abortus biovar 1 from abomasal fluid, milk, hygroma fluid, lymph nodes or uterine discharges samples. The diagnostic specificity (DSp) of the tests mentioned above was determined using samples from known negative herds. There was no statistically significant difference between the tests in their ability to diagnose brucellosis. The RBT and iELISA had the highest DSe of 95.8%, whereas RBT and CFT had the highest DSp of 100%. In South African laboratories, the RBT and CFT serological tests are used, because of the cost efficacy of CFT when compared to the less labour intensive but more expensive iELISA.","105":"Little is known about the mechanisms causing tremors during immobilisation of rhinoceros and whether cardiorespiratory supportive interventions alter their intensity. Therefore, we set out to determine the possible mechanisms that lead to muscle tremors and ascertain whether cardiorespiratory supportive interventions affect tremor intensity. We studied tremors and physiological responses during etorphine-azaperone immobilisation in eight boma-held and 14 free-living white rhinoceroses. Repeated measures analysis of variance and a Friedman test were used to determine differences in variables over time and between interventions. Spearman and Pearson correlations were used to test for associations between variables. Tremor intensity measured objectively by activity loggers correlated well (p &amp;lt; 0.0001; r2 = 0.9) with visual observations. Tremor intensity was greatest when animals were severely hypoxaemic and acidaemic. Tremor intensity correlated strongly and negatively with partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) (p = 0.0003; r2 = 0.9995) and potential of hydrogen (pH) (p = 0.02, r2 = 0.97). It correlated strongly and positively with adrenaline concentrations (p = 0.003; r2 = 0.96), and adrenaline correlated strongly and negatively with PaO2 (p = 0.03; r2 = 0.95) and pH (p = 0.03; r2 = 0.94). Therefore, hypoxaemia and acidaemia were likely associated with the intensity of tremors through their activation of the release of tremorgenic levels of adrenaline. Tremors can be reduced if circulating adrenaline is reduced, and this can be achieved by the administration of butorphanol plus oxygen insufflation. Furthermore, to assist with reducing the risks associated with rhinoceros immobilisation, tremor intensity could be used as a clinical indicator of respiratory and metabolic compromise.","106":null,"107":"Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is caused by a zoonotic arbovirus that is endemic to eastern and southern Africa. It has also been reported in West and North Africa, Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, but people can also become infected while handling blood or other body fluids of animals and humans with RVF. In 2007, there was a large outbreak of RVF in Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan and Somalia. Outbreaks were also reported in South Africa in 2008-2011. The epidemiology of RVF and factors for disease occurrence in Rwanda are neither clear nor documented. Therefore, we conducted a crosssectional study from December 2012 to March 2013 to generate baseline information on RVF in cattle. Purposive sampling of cattle (n = 595) was done in six districts, and serum samples were screened with competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We performed a statistical analysis on the generated data, and risk factors associated with RVF seroprevalence were determined by a simple logistic regression. Overall, RVF seroprevalence was 16.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] [13.8% - 20.0%]). The highest seroprevalence was recorded in Kirehe district (36.9%) followed by Ngoma (22.3%), and the least was recorded in Nyagatare (7.9%). RVF was more likely to occur in adult cattle (19.9% [odds ratio {OR} = 1.88, 95% CI {0.98-3.61}]) compared to young cattle (10.5% [OR = 0.47, 95% CI {0.26-0.83}]). Pure exotic or cross-breeds were significantly exposed to RVF virus (seroprevalence 22.9% [OR = 4.26, 95% CI {1.82-9.99}]) in comparison to 14.1% (OR = 0.55, 95% CI [0.35-0.86]) in local breeds. Sex differences were not statistically significant. These findings indicated that cattle have been exposed to RVF virus in six districts in Rwanda with a significant risk in adult, exotic or cross-breeds in Kirehe district.","108":"Samples of gerbils and their potential predators were screened for the presence of Hepatozoon parasites (Apicomplexa: Adeleorina) using both microscopic examination and sequencing of partial 18S rRNA sequences. Positive samples were compared to published sequences in a phylogenetic framework. The results indicate that genets can be infected with Hepatozoon felis. A Cape fox was infected with Hepatozoon canis, whereas the sequence from an infected rodent fell within a group of parasites primarily recovered from other rodents and snakes.","109":"Paraquat is a bipyridylium non-selective contact herbicide commonly used worldwide. When ingestion occurs by humans and animals either accidentally, intentionally or maliciously, paraquat selectively accumulates in the lungs resulting in the production of oxygen-free radicals, causing membrane damage and cell death. Intoxicated subjects typically show progressive and fatal pulmonary haemorrhage, collapse and oedema. In individuals surviving the acute phase, pulmonary fibrosis develops. Gastrointestinal-, renal- and central nervous system clinical signs may also occur. Owing to the lack of effective treatment and absence of an antidote, the prognosis is poor. The clinical presentation, clinicopathological findings and treatment are briefly described of three dogs from one South African household, intoxicated with paraquat. Macroscopic and microscopic lesions in one dog that was necropsied, as well as pulmonary ultrastructure are detailed and illustrated for academic reference. All dogs presented with tachypnoea and dyspnoea 2-3 days after accidental paraquat ingestion. Treatment was aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption, enhancing elimination by diuresis and avoiding further oxidative damage by administration of antioxidants. All dogs, however, became progressively hypoxic despite treatment and were euthanised. Paraquat toxicity should be a differential diagnosis in dogs with unexplained progressive respiratory and gastrointestinal signs and renal failure. The local veterinary profession should be aware of accidental or intentional paraquat toxicity of animals. Existing literature, variations possible in canine clinical signs, measured parameters, lesions, as well as possible treatments, promising experimental antidotes and management options are discussed.","110":null,"111":"When immobilising wildlife, adverse side effects can include hypoxaemia, acidosis and hypertension. Pulmonary gas exchange and acid-base status were evaluated during immobilisation of 25 free-ranging and one boma-held black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in Zimbabwe. The effect of different body positions on arterial oxygenation was evaluated. A combination of the following drugs was used: an opioid (etorphine or thiafentanil), azaperone and an a2 -adrenoceptor agonist (detomidine or xylazine). Respiratory and heart rates, rectal temperature and pulse oximetry-derived haemoglobin oxygen saturation were recorded. Serial arterial blood samples were analysed immediately in the field. Marked hypoxaemia and hypercapnia were recorded in immobilised free-ranging black rhinoceroses. Arterial oxygenation was higher during sternal compared to lateral recumbency. Most rhinoceroses developed acidaemia of respiratory and metabolic origin. Initially high lactate concentrations in free-ranging rhinoceroses decreased during immobilisation. Pulse oximetry was unreliable in the detection of hypoxaemia. Positioning in sternal recumbency and routine use of oxygen supplementation are recommended in the management of immobilised rhinoceroses as measures to improve arterial oxygenation.","112":"Over the past decade, several clustered, multispecies, wildlife mortality events occurred in the vicinity of two man-made earthen dams in the southern and south central regions of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. On field investigation, heavy cyanobacterial blooms were visible in these impoundments and analysis of water samples showed the dominance of Microcystis spp. (probably Microcystis aeruginosa). Macroscopic lesions seen at necropsy and histopathological lesions were compatible with a diagnosis of cyanobacterial intoxication. Laboratory toxicity tests and assays also confirmed the presence of significant levels of microcystins in water from the two dams. These outbreaks occurred during the dry autumn and early winter seasons when water levels in these dams were dropping, and a common feature was that all the affected dams were supporting a large number of hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius). It is hypothesised that hippopotamus' urine and faeces, together with agitation of the sediments, significantly contributed to internal loading of phosphates and nitrogen - leading to eutrophication of the water in these impoundments and subsequent cyanobacterial blooms. A major cause for concern was that a number of white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) were amongst the victims of these bio-intoxication events. This publication discusses the eco-epidemiology and pathology of these clustered mortalities, as well as the management options considered and eventually used to address the problem.","113":null,"114":"Although nasal masses are uncommon in sheep and may have several causes, including neoplasia and bacterial, fungal and viral infections, these lesions may lead to economic losses resulting from weight loss and even death. It is therefore important to differentiate between various categories of upper respiratory tract obstructions and lower respiratory tract infections. The correct aetiological diagnosis of obstructive masses is essential for appropriate treatment and management to be given or action to be taken. The presentation, clinical signs, treatment and pathology of a case of suspected mycotic rhinitis in a 6-year-old Mutton Merino ewe, are described.","115":"A 9-year-old sterilised female domestic short-hair cat was referred with a history of vomiting and anorexia of 3 months' duration. Biochemistry, full-blood counts, thoracic radiographs, feline pancreatic-specific lipase, abdominal ultrasonography and feline immunodeficiency virus\/feline leukaemia virus (FIV\/FeLV) SNAP tests had been performed. Mild hypochloraemia and moderate hypokalaemia were evident on initial presentation. Abdominal ultrasonography initially revealed unilateral renal nodules on the left side. These were subjected to fine-needle aspiration and cytological evaluation. A neuroendocrine tumour was suspected, and biopsies via midline coeliotomy were taken to confirm the diagnosis. Initial histopathology diagnosed primary renal carcinomas or neuroendocrine neoplasia; however, the definitive diagnosis became renal paragangliomas after immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were performed. The cat was regularly monitored with serum biochemistry parameters, blood pressure determinations, thoracic radiographs and subsequent abdominal ultrasonography. Biochemistry, radiography and blood pressures remained normal over a 24-week follow-up period, while subsequent ultrasonography revealed tumour progression in both number and size in both kidneys. Primary neuroendocrine tumours of the kidney are frequently incorrectly diagnosed as other renal tumours such as renal cell carcinoma, mesonephric tumours or undifferentiated carcinomas. This case report highlights the importance of additional testing, including immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy, to obtain a definitive diagnosis of paragangliomas.","116":"Although there is evidence of high seroprevalence of antibodies to Babesia spp. in dogs in central Namibia, clinical babesiosis is rarely diagnosed. Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, the vector of Babesia vogeli, is common in Namibia while Haemaphysalis elliptica, the vector of the highly virulent but morphologically indistinguishable Babesia rossi, has rarely been recorded, mainly in northern Namibia. On the basis of vector occurrence, clinical cases of canine babesiosis in Windhoek, central Namibia, have been ascribed to B. vogeli. DNA extracted from a blood smear made from a sick dog was subjected to the reverse line blot hybridisation assay. The polymerase chain reaction amplicons hybridised with the B. vogeli-specific probe, but not with the Babesia canis- and B. rossi-specific probes. Although attempts at cloning and sequencing of the full-length 18S rRNA gene were unsuccessful, we can confirm that B. vogeli occurs in central Namibia.","117":null,"118":"Information obtained from abattoirs on the causes of lung condemnation is important in preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases and for promoting food security. In this study, we assessed the causes of lung condemnation in cattle at three abattoirs represented as ANA, QTA and EBA to evaluate the financial losses associated with lung condemnation. A retrospective study (n = 51 302) involving the use of abattoir slaughter records of 2010-2012 and an active abattoir survey (n = 1374) was conducted from July to December 2013. The retrospective study revealed the main causes of lung condemnation as pneumonia (1.09%, 2.21% and 0.77%), emphysema (1.12%, 1.14% and 1.1.6%) and abscessation (0.71%, 1.06% and 0.77%), from ANA, QTA and EBA, respectively. The combined monetary loss because of lung condemnation during the period 2010 to 2012 was estimated as ZAR 85 158 (USD 7939) for the abattoirs surveyed. Conversely, during the active abattoir survey, agonal emphysema (15%, 15% and 23%) and improper eviscerations with faecal contamination (10%, 38% and 42%) were the major factors that led to lung condemnation at ANA, QTA and EBA, respectively. Other causes of lung condemnations were haemorrhage (10%) for QTA and pleurisy (12%) for EBA. The weight loss of lungs during the active abattoir survey was 6450 kg, while the associated monetary loss was estimated as ZAR 29 025 (USD 2706). This study identified major causes of lung condemnation as pleuritis, improper evisceration, pneumonia, abscesses, haemorrhages and lung worms and their associated monetary losses. The results of this study may be useful as baseline data for future comparison in similar surveys, for tracking of some zoonotic diseases affecting lungs and for further research in the Eastern Cape Province or other provinces of South Africa.","119":"There is a lack of information in comparing the healing rate between the left and right sides of the maxilla and mandible. Osteogenesis of alveolar bone was evaluated with digital radiology by comparing differences in bone density (BD) at different time points within the left and right maxilla and mandible. Alveolar bone defects were created in five healthy Chacma baboons. Standardised x-ray images were acquired over time and the densities of the selected trauma areas were measured pre-operatively, post-operatively and at 3 and 6 weeks post-operatively. Differences in densities were statistically tested. There was no significant difference when the grey scale averages of the combined first and fourth quadrants (right side) and combined second and third quadrants (left side) were compared pre-operatively (t = 0.70), immediately post-operatively (t = 0.34), 3 weeks post-operatively (t = 0.40) and 6 weeks post-operatively (t = 0.66). There was also no significant difference between the values for the first and second quadrants (maxilla) pre-operatively (t = 0.37), immediately post-operatively (t = 0.30), 3 weeks post-operatively (t = 0.30) and 6 weeks post-operatively (t = 0.38); the third and fourth quadrants (mandible) were also not significantly different pre-operatively (t = 0.29), immediately post-operatively (t = 0.69), 3 weeks post-operatively (t = 0.07) and 6 weeks postoperatively (t = 0.06). However, the results showed an increased predisposition of the right side to regenerate faster than the left side and indicated sufficient information to investigate the effect of laterality and preferred side of mastication on the rate of healing and alveolar BD in the maxilla and mandible. ","120":"A questionnaire of 15 questions was completed by four categories of respondents with the aim of establishing the experience and opinions of these groups on the constraints including animal health problems for communal, small-scale sheep and goat farming in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The questionnaires were completed independently and categories were representative of the areas investigated. Analysis of responses was done by means, ranges, votes and clusters of responses. Comparisons between the responses of the four categories were made to identify similarities or contrasts. The results revealed that of non-veterinary concerns, stock theft was the major problem for these farms. Nutrition was a further major constraint. A third area of significant concern was the provision or availability of facilities like fences, water troughs, dips and sheds. Lack of marketing and business skills were also seen as important deficiencies to be rectified so as to promote profitable farming. Of the most important veterinary problems identified, the provision, availability, cost and care of drugs and vaccines were seen as major stumbling blocks to effective disease control, as well as lack of access to veterinary services. The most important diseases that constrain small-ruminant livestock farming in the farming systems investigated were sheep scab and other ectoparasites, heart water, enterotoxaemia, internal parasites and bluetongue. A lack of knowledge in key areas of small-stock farming was revealed and should be rectified by an effective training and support programme to improve the contribution of small-ruminant farming to livelihoods in these communities. ","121":"Although significant animal suffering caused by preventable diseases is frequently seen in developing countries, reports of this are scarce. This report describes avoidable animal suffering owing to a suspected canine distemper (CD) outbreak in unvaccinated dogs owned by low-income families in Mozambique that killed approximately 200 animals. Affected dogs exhibited clinical signs, and gross and microscopic lesions compatible with CD. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of canine distemper virus (CDV) in the kidney of one dog from the cohort. This brief communication again illustrates that large outbreaks of CDV in unvaccinated dogs occur and that large-scale avoidable suffering and threats to the health of dogs and wild canines continue. Mass vaccination supported by government and non-government organisations is recommended. ","122":"The aim of this study was to screen for selected parasites and antibody levels against vectorborne pathogens in owned dogs in Lilongwe, Malawi. The study population consisted of 100 dogs; 80 participating in vaccination-spaying campaigns and 20 visiting a veterinary clinic as paying clients. All dogs went through a general physical examination including visual examination for signs of ectoparasites. A total of 100 blood samples were analysed using commercial snap tests and 40 faecal samples by egg flotation in saturated sodium chloride. The sampled dogs had a seroprevalence of 12% for Anaplasma spp., 22% for Ehrlichia spp., 4% for Dirofilaria immitis and 1% for Leishmania spp. Eggs from Ancylostoma spp. were found in 80% of the faecal samples, whereas eggs of Trichuris vulpis, Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina were only present in 3%, 8% and 13% of the samples, respectively. Ectoparasites such as Ctenocephalides sp., Trichodectes sp. and ticks were present on 98%, 25% and 11%, respectively, of the campaign dogs. Among client dogs, 35% had Ctenocephalides fleas, 10% had Trichodectes lice and none had ticks. Public education and prophylactic treatment could be used to improve the animal welfare of dogs; this would most likely also have positive impact on public health. ","123":"In this on-farm investigation, we report on stillbirths, weakness and perinatal mortality seen in calves on a commercial beef farm in the Roossenekal area, Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Post-mortem examination of these calves and histopathological examination of organ and tissue samples did not indicate an infectious aetiology. Affected calves had marginal to deficient whole blood selenium concentrations. Whole blood samples collected from adult cattle on this farm and five neighbouring farms were deficient in selenium. The potential contributions of other minerals to the symptoms seen are a subject of ongoing investigation, but selenium deficiency was marked in this herd and required urgent correction. Methods to correct the deficiency included the use of injectable products, and an oral selenium supplement chelated to methionine. Selenium availability to plants is primarily determined by the selenium content of the parent bedrock, the presence of other minerals and the pH of the soil. The apparent sudden onset of this problem implicates a soil factor as being responsible for reducing selenium's bioavailability in this area. Selenium deficiency can have a significant impact on human health. HIV and\/or AIDS, various forms of cancer and several specific clinical syndromes are associated with selenium deficiency in humans, and the impact on human health in this area also requires further investigation. ","124":"The nutraceutical industry has proliferated in recent years, with the most popular form of supplementation being the multivitamin-multimineral (MVMM) supplement. In the animal health sector, supplement use has also expanded. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of MVMM supplementation, beneficial or otherwise, on the general health status of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) strain, an animal model used in hypertension research. A commercially prepared MVMM supplement was given tri-weekly via oral dosing for 8 weeks to two groups of seven adult female SHR and Wistar rats. Their corresponding control groups were dosed with deionised water only. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, growth rate and food and water intake were measured weekly. At the end of 8 weeks, the animals were euthanased and a full blood profile, urine sodium to potassium ratio, blood urea nitrogen levels and total plasma cholesterol was measured for all groups. The results indicated that growth rate was higher for the SHR supplemented group. Supplementation also decreased diastolic blood pressure in both Wistar and SHR groups and increased red blood cell count and decreased total cholesterol in the SHR group. No adverse effects on the general health status of the animals were observed. MVMM supplementation may therefore be useful in aiding growth and delaying the onset of hypertension and its effects. It may also assist in the longevity of the breeding stock of SHR rats. ","125":"Members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) cause tuberculosis (TB) in both animals and humans. In this article, three animal-adapted MTC strains that are endemic to the southern African subregion - that is, Mycobacterium suricattae, Mycobacterium mungi, and the dassie bacillus - are reviewed with a focus on clinical and pathological presentations, geographic distribution, genotyping methods, diagnostic tools and evolution. Moreover, factors influencing the transmission and establishment of TB pathogens in novel host populations, including ecological, immunological and genetic factors of both the host and pathogen, are discussed. The risks associated with these infections are currently unknown and further studies will be required for greater understanding of this disease in the context of the southern African ecosystem.

Benign gastric outflow obstruction was diagnosed in the proximal duodenal area. The initial surgical plan was to perform a pylorectomy with gastroduodenostomy (Billroth I procedure), but owing to substantial scar tissue and adhesions in the area a palliative gastrojejunostomy was performed. This procedure provided a bypass for the gastric contents into the proximal jejunum via the new stoma, yet still allowed bile and pancreatic secretions to flow normally via the patent duodenum. The gastrojejunostomy technique was successful in the surgical management of this case, which involved proximal duodenal stricture in the absence of neoplasia. Regular telephonic followup over the next 12 months confirmed that the patient was doing well.

A Thoroughbred racehorse presented with long-standing abscessation of the right hind hoof. Owing to the long-standing nature, the abscess draining tract was surgically explored. A focal mass was found within the solar horn. Histopathology revealed the mass to be a keratoma. A similar mass was removed from the left hind hoof a few months later after similar presenting signs. This case shows that keratomas can occur in more than one hoof within a short period and should be considered a differential diagnosis for long-standing lameness localised to the hoof. ","129":"Gallbladder mucocoele (GBM) is an abnormal, intraluminal accumulation of inspissated bile and\/or mucous within the gallbladder. Older, small- to medium-breed dogs seem to be predisposed, but no sex predilection has been identified. Clinical signs are often non-specific and include vomiting, lethargy, anorexia, abdominal pain, icterus and polyuria-polydipsia. Results of a complete blood count may be unremarkable, but serum biochemistry usually reveals increased liver enzymes. The ultrasonographic appearance is diagnostic and well described in the literature. Surgical intervention for the treatment of GBM remains the therapeutic gold standard, with short- and long-term survival for biliary surgery being 66%. The worst outcome is seen in those dogs requiring cholecystoenterostomy. With GBM becoming an apparently increasingly common cause of extrahepatic biliary disease in canines, it is essential that clinicians become familiar with the current literature pertaining to this condition. Numerous predisposing factors are highlighted in this review article and the role of certain endocrinopathies (e.g. hyperadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism) in the development of GBM is touched upon. Furthermore, the aetiopathogenesis of this disease is discussed with reference to the latest literature. Cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice, but other options are considered based on a current literature review.

To date, only two filarial pathogens (Dirofilaria repens and Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides) and three tick-borne pathogens (Babesia canis vogeli, Hepatozoon canis and Ehrlichia canis) have been reported. Most studies have focused solely on dogs and cats in the urban Windhoek and surrounding areas, with almost nothing reported in rural farming areas, in either the populous northern regions or the low-income urban areas where animal owners have limited access to veterinary services. With the development of several biomedical training programmes in the country, there is now an excellent opportunity to address zoonotic vector-borne diseases through a One Health approach so as to assess the risks to small companion animals as well as diseases of public health importance. ","131":"During a six-year period (from January 2009 to December 2014), specimens collected from 344 cases of suspected organophosphorus and carbamate pesticide poisonings in wildlife, including birds, were submitted to the Toxicology Laboratory (ARC-OVI) for analysis. A positive diagnosis was made in 135 (39%) of these cases. The majority of cases were from birds, which included Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres) and African white-backed vultures (Gyps africanus) and bateleur eagles (Terathopius ecaudatus). In one incident 49 vultures were killed when a farmer intentionally laced carcasses with carbofuran in an attempt to control jackal predation. There were 22 incidents of poisoning in helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). On nine different occasions blue cranes (Anthropoides paradiseus) were poisoned, in one incident 14 birds were reported to have been killed. Over the period of investigation, there were 20 cases of poisoning involving mammalian species, the majority being vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The carbamate pesticides were responsible for 57 incidents of poisoning. Aldicarb, carbofuran and methomyl were detected in 26, 18 and 12 cases respectively. The majority of organophosphorus pesticide poisonings were caused by diazinon (n = 19), monocrotophos (n = 13) and methamidophos (n = 10). ","132":null,"133":null,"134":null,"135":"Whilst lead poisoning in raptors, scavenging birds and waterfowl is well studied and common knowledge, there is surprisingly little literature detailing the risk to mammalian scavengers and captive carnivores fed hunted meat. This case report describes the death of two captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) following acute onset of nervous symptoms. Clinical signs included hyper-excitability, seizures, arched back, tail held abnormally high and hyper-salivation. Necropsy findings included bullets or a bullet in their stomachs. Kidney and liver lead levels from one cheetah (15.6 ppm and 17 ppm respectively) were consistent with a diagnosis of lead poisoning; liver from the second cheetah was not available for testing. Both animals were routinely fed hunted antelope or game birds. This is the first report of oral lead poisoning in captive large carnivores, although these are unlikely to be the first cases. Without awareness of the risks of feeding hunted game, lead exposure will continue to be an underdiagnosed reality in the rehabilitation of endangered carnivores. ","136":"Lesions in canine stifle joints after previous trochleoplasty surgery were documented. In four clinical cases arthrotomies were performed due to stifle pain after previous trochlear deepening procedures. A small area of hyaline cartilage remained in the groove of the stifles in cases where previous wedge trochleoplasties had been performed. All of the stifles had significant areas of eburnation on the axial aspect of the medial trochlear ridge. The stifle joints of a dog that was euthanased due to severe irreversible osteoarthritis were photographed. The dog had undergone previous surgery for patellar luxation and cranial cruciate ligament ruptures. The trochlear grooves in this dog had almost no visible articular cartilage left.","137":"Ehrlichia canis is a major pathogen in dogs throughout Africa, yet it has not been reported in Namibia. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of canine ehrlichiosis in central Namibia using the ImmunoComb assay (Biogal, Galed Laboratories). The study included 76 dogs that presented to the Rhino Park Veterinary Clinic in the north-western suburb of Khomasdal, Windhoek, Namibia, as well as 30 stray dogs from the Windhoek branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Of the 106 dogs tested, 53.8% were seropositive at titres &amp;gt; 1:80. Dogs that presented with symptoms of E. canis infection had a significantly higher seroprevalence (86.6%) compared with apparently healthy dogs (41.6%) (P = 0.00). Location of habitation was significant (P &amp;lt; 0.017), with a high percentage of dogs exposed to E. canis living in the northern or north-western part of Windhoek. As the first study to serologically establish E. canis as a major pathogen in dogs in central Namibia, it is notable that the highest proportion of seropositive dogs came from low-income areas. Further investigation is necessary to describe the ecology of this important tick-borne pathogen of companion animals in Namibia.","138":"It remains a challenge for the role of the dairy veterinarian to move beyond that traditionally held. In larger herds with a high reproductive workload, we are at great risk of becoming specialist technicians. Instead we seek greater involvement, to deliver comprehensive services and to be recognised for them, personally and financially. Given the frequency of our visits, knowledge and analytical skills we are in a unique position to provide inputs that complement advice given by other consultants. Failure to do so has economic consequences for both veterinarian and dairyman. The opportunity for and value of inputs will differ for every client, and we need to remain cognizant of their motivation. This review article shares perspectives, opportunities and tools that might enable moving beyond the traditional role. It starts with a review of available research describing the dynamic between dairyman and veterinarian and how this might impact an animal health production management programme. A description of the experiences of others follows, interspersed by the personal experiences of the author, working with large total mixed ration-fed herds in the United States of America. The following attributes and roles can be associated with a significant economic impact: gatekeeper; conduit; executor; verifier; monitor; facilitator and mediator; trainer, motivator and coach; applied nutritionist; technologist; champion of animal welfare, food safety and judicious antibiotic use; and confidant. Each is elucidated and described in context, revealing a need for continuing education. The nature of the relationship between veterinarian and client will determine the opportunity for and value of each. The veterinarian is in a unique position to become an integral part of the management team and to be fairly compensated as such. The onus rests on the veterinarian to broaden his\/her knowledge and skills and to demonstrate their value.","139":"Ingestion of indigestible foreign bodies in cattle is a pathological condition of both economic and health importance. It is has mostly been reported in association with feed scarcity. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and nature of indigestible foreign materials in abattoir fore-stomach specimens in Ngoma district, Rwanda. Each chamber was opened by incision, then given a thorough macroscopic examination by visual inspection and palpation for the presence of foreign materials. The results show that there is an overall occurrence of 17.4% foreign bodies in cattle. The highest occurrence (25.3%) was recorded in June (the driest month). Results further show that the majority of the foreign bodies were plastics (65.0%). More foreign bodies (29.5%) were found in older animals (5 years and above) than in younger and middle-aged animals (16.5 % and 6.0%, respectively). There was a higher prevalence of foreign bodies in female cattle (20.0%) than in males (15.7%). The presence of cassette tape, as observed in the study, has not been reported elsewhere. The high representation of plastics in animals (65.5%) in the light of a government plastic bag ban in supermarkets presents a major challenge to livestock production in Rwanda. What is disturbing is that it is not known if this problem is increasing or decreasing as there are no previous studies for comparison. However, the results will serve as a reference point for future studies to understand the true trend and true burden of plastic bags in livestock. ","140":"This survey of ixodid ticks was the first to compare the species composition and population dynamics of free-living ticks in intensive, sable antelope breeding enclosures, now commonplace in commercial wildlife ranching in South Africa, with those of multi-herbivore enclosures. The species composition, abundance and seasonal abundance of questing ixodid ticks on the vegetation in intensive breeding enclosures for sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), on which strategic tick control is practised, were compared with those of ticks in a multi-species herbivore enclosure surrounding the breeding enclosures in which no tick control is practised. A total of eight ixodid tick species were collected by drag-sampling the woodland and grassland habitats in each enclosure type monthly from July 2011 to July 2013. Rhipicephalus decoloratus, a potential vector of fatal tick-borne disease in sable antelopes, was the most abundant, accounting for 65.4% of the total number of ticks collected in the sable enclosures, whilst representing only 25.4% of number of ticks collected in the multi-species herbivore enclosure. Rhipicephalus decoloratus and R. evertsi evertsi were more abundant than R. appendiculatus (both p &amp;lt; 0.05) and Amblyomma hebraeum (p &amp;lt; 0.001 and p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). Rhipicephalus decoloratus larvae were collected throughout the year, with peak collections in November 2012 and October to December 2013 in the sable enclosures; and in April\/May 2012 and February\/April 2013 in the multi-species herbivore enclosure. More R. decoloratus were recovered in the second year than in the first year in the grassland habitat of the sable enclosures (V = 7.0, p &amp;lt; 0.05) possibly as a result of acaricide resistance. The apparent temporal over-abundance of R. decoloratus in sable antelope breeding enclosures, in the face of strategic tick control, is of concern and requires further investigation. ","141":"In response to farmer requests after milk from their herds was rejected by processors due to poor quality, a study was carried out from April to October 2011 to determine the prevalence of sub clinical mastitis, associated risk factors and causative micro-organisms. Samples were collected from 195 dairy cows on 23 randomly selected dairy farms delivering milk to Isangano, Kirebe and Nyagatare milk collection centres in Nyagatare District, Rwanda. The Draminski Mastitis Detector was used to detect sub clinical mastitis in individual cows based on milk electrical conductivity changes. Risk factors for mastitis that were evaluated included teat-end condition, cow dirtiness, breed, parity, age and stage of lactation. Relationships of these factors with mastitis status were determined using Chi-square analysis, and relative importance as causes of mastitis was assessed using logistic regression. Samples from 16 sub clinical mastitis positive dairy cows were analysed to identify causative micro-organisms using Dairy Quality Control Inspection analytical kits. Sub clinical mastitis prevalence was 52% across the farms. It was higher with increases in, amongst other risk factors, teat-end damage severity, cow dirtiness, and level of pure dairy breed genetics. The risk factors considered accounted for 62% of mastitis prevalence; teat-end condition alone accounted for 30%. Most of the mastitis cases (87.5%) were caused by coliform bacteria. Considering that farmers are upgrading their local Ankole cows to cross-breed dairy cows that are more susceptible to mastitis, results from this study indicate the need to dip the teats of cows in sanitisers, improve cow hygiene, and introduce mastitis prevention and control programmes.","142":"The distributions of endemic tick vector species as well as the presence of species not endemic to Free State Province, South Africa, were determined during surveys or opportunistic collections from livestock, wildlife and vegetation. Amongst endemic ticks, the presence of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus was confirmed in the north of the province, whilst Rhipicephalus decoloratus was collected at 31 localities mostly in the centre and east, and Ixodes rubicundus at 11 localities in the south, south-west and centre of the province. Amongst the non-endemic species adult Amblyomma hebraeum were collected from white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum) on four privately owned farms, whilst the adults of Rhipicephalus microplus were collected from cattle and a larva from vegetation at four localities in the east of the province. The collection of Rhipicephalus evertsi mimeticus from a sheep in the west of the province is the second record of its presence in the Free State, whereas the presence of Haemaphysalis silacea on helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) and vegetation in the centre of the province represents a first record for this species in the Free State. The first collection of the argasid tick, Ornithodoros savignyi, in the Free State was made from a domestic cow and from soil in the west of the province. The localities at which the ticks were collected have been plotted and the ticks' role in the transmission or cause of disease in domestic livestock and wildlife is discussed. ","143":"Biochemical and molecular analysis were conducted on 34 strains of Mycoplasma species isolated between 2003 and 2009 from the genital tract of clinically healthy Dorper sheep and sheep with ulcerative vulvitis and balanitis. Earlier publications identified the causative agent as Mycoplasma mycoides mycoides large colony (MmmLC) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes. The aims of the study were to characterise Mycoplasma species isolated from the genital tract of Dorper sheep with polymerase chain reaction assay, cloning and gene sequencing. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) results revealed six predominant Mycoplasma species: Mycoplasma arginini, Mycoplasma bovigenitalium, Arcanobacterium laidlawii, MmmLC, Mycoplasma sp. ovine\/caprine serogroup II and M. canadense. Sequencing of the 34 isolates were analysed using phylogenetic methods, and 18 (50%) were identified as M. arginini with 99% - 100% similarity to M. arginini from England and Sweden. Six isolates showed 99% similarity to M. bovigenitalium strains from Turkey and Germany. Two isolates had 99% similarity to an M. sp. ovine\/caprine sero group II from the United Kingdom. BLAST for two isolates revealed 99% similarity to Acholeplasma laidlawii from India, another two were 99% similar to MmmLC strain from Sweden, two showed 98% similarity to Mycoplasma sp. Usp 120 from Brazil, and two isolates have a 97% - 99% similarity to M. mm. Jcv1 strain from the United States of America. Finally, one isolate showed similarity of 99% to Mycoplasma canadense strain from Italy. The findings support the hypothesis that ulcerative vulvitis and balanitis of Dorper sheep in South Africa (SA) is a multifactorial disease with involvement of different Mycoplasma species.","144":"Buffalo reproduction is considerably affected by late maturity, poor oestrus symptoms and long postpartum periods. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of Eazi Breed controlled internal drug release (CIDR), an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device, in relation to oestrus and fertility. Five hundred true anoestrus buffalo cows, in the age group 4-6 years in 10 villages of Dharwad district in Karnataka state in India, were randomly selected and treated with CIDR for 9 days. Two mL of Cidirol (1 mg oestradiol benzoate) was administered intramuscularly to all animals on day 10. Forty-two buffaloes (8.4%) that failed to show oestrus signs (1.6%) or showed weak signs of oestrus (6.8%) after the first treatment were treated again 72 h after the Cidriol injection with a new device, and inseminated after the expression of oestrus. After the second treatment all the animals showed oestrus signs. The percentage of buffaloes showing intense oestrus was 67.40%, intermediate oestrus was shown by 25.80%, whilst 6.80% buffaloes showed weak oestrus even after the second treatment. The buffaloes showing oestrus signs were inseminated twice with an interval of 12 h, starting 12 h after the start of the oestrus signs. In 86 buffaloes showing prolonged oestrus signs a third insemination was done. The conception rates were 85.16%, 60.47% and 44.11% respectively in buffaloes showing intense, intermediate and weak oestrus. Transrectal palpation of the genital tract was performed 45-60 days post-insemination to diagnose pregnancy status, and in doubtful cases pregnancy was reconfirmed at 90 days after insemination. Out of 500 buffaloes treated in this way 380 animals became pregnant and the pregnancy rate was 76%. This study revealed the usefulness of Eazi Breed CIDR along with Cidirol treatment in buffaloes to improve their reproductive performance.","145":"Induction of anaesthesia occasionally has been associated with undesirable behaviour in dogs. High quality of induction of anaesthesia with propofol has been well described while in contrast variable induction and recovery quality has been associated with diazepam-ketamine. In this study, anaesthetic induction and recovery characteristics of diazepam-ketamine combination with propofol alone were compared in dogs undergoing elective orchidectomy. Thirty-six healthy adult male dogs were used. After habitus scoring (simple descriptive scale [SDS]), the dogs were sedated with morphine and acepromazine. Forty minutes later a premedication score (SDS) was allocated and general anaesthesia was induced using a combination of diazepam-ketamine (Group D\/K) or propofol (Group P) and maintained with isoflurane. Scores for the quality of induction, intubation and degree of myoclonus were allocated (SDS). Orchidectomy was performed after which recovery from anaesthesia was scored (SDS) and times to extubation and standing were recorded. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Kappa Reliability and Kendall Tau B tests. Both groups were associated with acceptable quality of induction and recovery from anaesthesia. Group P, however, was associated with a poorer quality of induction (p = 0.014), prolonged induction period (p = 0.0018) and more pronounced myoclonus (p = 0.003), but had better quality of recovery (p = 0.000002) and shorter recovery times (p = 0.035) compared with Group D\/K. Diazepam-ketamine and propofol are associated with acceptable induction and recovery from anaesthesia. Propofol had inferior anaesthetic induction characteristics, but superior and quicker recovery from anaesthesia compared with diazepam-ketamine. ","146":"Pig production is one of the most important animal agricultural activities in South Africa, and plays a definite role in providing food security for certain population groups in the country. As with all animal production systems, it is subject to the risk of outbreak of transboundary diseases. In the present overview, evaluations of the perceived risk of selected transboundary animal diseases of pigs, as collated from the willing participants from the provincial veterinary services of South Africa, are presented. A scenario tree revealed that infected but undetected pigs were the greatest perceived threat. The provincial veterinary services, according to participants in the study, face certain difficulties, including the reporting of disease and the flow of disease information amongst farmers. Perceived strengths in surveillance and disease monitoring include the swiftness of sample despatch to the national testing laboratory, as well as the ease of flow of information between the provincial and national agricultural authorities. The four factors were identified that were perceived to most influence animal health-service delivery: transport, access, livestock policy and resources. African swine fever was perceived to be the most important pig disease in South Africa. Because the decentralisation of veterinary services in South Africa was identified as a potential weakness, it is recommended that national and provincial veterinary services need to work together and interdependently to achieve centrally controlled surveillance systems. Regionally-coordinated surveillance activities for certain transboundary diseases were identified as needing priority for the southern African region. It is proposed that an emergency preparedness document be made available and regularly revised according to the potential risks identified on a continuous basis for South Africa. ","147":"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a generic doxycycline tablet (DoxyVet) against Ehrlichia canis infection in dogs. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by the bacterium E. canis and transmitted by the brown kennel tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Six disease-free and tick-free dogs were infested with E. canis infected ticks. Once diagnosed (with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] analysis and platelet counts) as positive for infection, doxycycline tablets were administered orally once a day for 20 consecutive days, at a target dose level of 10 mg\/kg. The actual dose administered was calculated as ranging between 10 mg\/kg and 11.7 mg\/kg. The PCR analysis, 28 days after the first administration of the tablets, failed to detect E. canis in any of the dogs. On Day 56 of the study, four of the dogs were diagnosed with E. canis for the second time and a fifth dog was diagnosed on Day 70. The platelet counts of the sixth dog remained within normal levels and it was discharged from the study on Day 84. Doxycycline tablets were then administered to the remaining five infected dogs for 28 consecutive days. Four of these dogs had no positive PCR results during the following 3 months. The fifth dog was diagnosed with E. canis for the third time 58 days after the last tablets of the second treatment had been administered, after which it was rescue treated (doxycycline for a further 28 days). The results indicate that doxycycline administered in tablet form (DoxyVet) at 10 mg\/kg - 11.7 mg\/kg body mass once daily for 28 consecutive days clears most dogs of infection. The importance of a concomitant tick-control programme is therefore stressed.","148":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) is one of the idiopathicimmune-mediated small-vessel vasculitides described in humans which are characterised by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. It most commonly involves capillaries, venules and arterioles of the ear, nose and throat, lungs and glomeruli. A case of destructive haemopurulent rhinitis associated with relapsing periods of pyrexia, lethargy and stiffness as well as generalised pulmonary infiltrates in a young Anatolian shepherd dog is presented that closely resembles granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) as reported in humans. Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) were detected in the dog's serum. Signs resolved promptly and completely once immunosuppressive doses of prednisone were administered, and have not recurred. This is the first report onthe use of pANCA to investigate rhinitis in dogs. It is also, to the authors' knowledge, the first description of a relapsing haemopurulent lytic rhinitis in this species. The concurrent manifestations of erosive haemopurulent rhinitis, ground-glass opacities on pulmonary computed tomography, pyrexia and listlessness resemble GPA as described in humans.","149":"A flightless wild juvenile rock pigeon (Columba guinea) with pox-like lesions was picked up on the premises of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Onderstepoort. The pigeon was housed overnight for possible treatment the following day but died before any other intervention could be instituted. At necropsy, coalescing masses of yellowish nodular cutaneous tumour-like lesions principally on the featherless areas were noticed on the dead pigeon's head as well as the beak. Histological examination of the sampled skin lesions revealed multifocal areas of hypertrophic and hyperplastic epidermal epithelial cells with eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies). Extract from the lesion was processed and inoculated on the chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and this produced pocks on one of the CAM at day 7 post-inoculation. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of poxvirus in the CAM with the pock lesions.","150":"The commercially available vaccine Oncept is indicated for the management of dogs with stage II or III oral melanoma after local control has been achieved. Survival times in dogs with both oral and digit melanoma have been shown to be significantly increased following vaccination. This retrospective study was designed to document the investigators' experiences with Oncept vaccine when used as an adjunct therapy for treatment of stage II-IV oral, digit and malignant melanoma of other sites after local control had been achieved in dogs presented to a South African specialist referral veterinary practice. Thirty-eight dogs diagnosed with melanoma (25 oral, 6 digit and 7 infiltrative at various other sites) underwent a combination of surgical excision and Oncept vaccination. At the end of the study period there were 16 live and 22 dead dogs; median survival time of the live dogs was 29 months (range 2-46 months) versus 8 months (range 2-16 months) for those that died from progressive disease. This study showed that by using a combination of surgical excision and vaccination with Oncept survival times in dogs with malignant melanoma of the oral cavity, digit and other sites can be increased significantly.","151":"This report describes four suspected rabies cases in domestic dogs that were involved inhuman exposures. In all these cases, the animals were buried for substantial times beforerabies testing was performed. Animal rabies is endemic in South Africa and domestic dogsare the main vector for transmission to humans. Diagnosis of rabies in humans is complicated,and diagnosis in the animal vector can provide circumstantial evidence to support clinicaldiagnosis of rabies in humans. The gold standard diagnostic method, fluorescent antibodytest (FAT), only delivers reliable results when performed on fresh brain material and thereforedecomposed samples are rarely submitted for diagnostic testing. Severely decomposed brainmaterial was tested for the presence of rabies virus genomic material using a quantitativereal-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-real-time RT-PCR) assaywhen conventional molecular methods were unsuccessful. This may be a useful tool in theinvestigation of cases where the opportunity to sample the suspected animals post mortem wasforfeited and which would not be possible with conventional testing methodologies becauseof the decomposition of the material. ","152":"Information on intoxication of livestock by plants in Brazil, in terms of cause, clinical signs and pathology, is compared with information on livestock poisoning by plants in South Africa. Plant poisoning, including mycotoxicosis, is considered to be one of three major causes of death in livestock in Brazil, which is one of the top beef producing countries in the world, with a cattle population of more than 200 million. Cattle production in South Africa is on a more modest scale, but with some 600 species of plants and fungi known to cause toxicity in livestock, as opposed to some 130 species in Brazil, the risk to livestock in South Africa appears to be much greater. The comparisons discussed in this communication are largely restricted to ruminants. ","153":"There are few publications on the clinical haematology and biochemistry of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and these are based on captive populations. Baseline haematology and serum biochemistry parameters were analysed from 108 blood samples from wild, adult African penguins. Samples were collected from the breeding range of the African penguin in South Africa and the results were compared between breeding region and sex. The haematological parameters that were measured were: haematocrit, haemoglobin, red cell count and white cell count. The biochemical parameters that were measured were: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, inorganic phosphate, creatinine, cholesterol, serum glucose, uric acid, bile acid, total serum protein, albumin, aspartate transaminase and creatine kinase. All samples were serologically negative for selected avian diseases and no blood parasites were detected. No haemolysis was present in any of the analysed samples. Male African penguins were larger and heavier than females, with higher haematocrit, haemoglobin and red cell count values, but lower calcium and phosphate values. African penguins in the Eastern Cape were heavier than those in the Western Cape, with lower white cell count and globulin values and a higher albumin\/globulin ratio, possibly indicating that birds are in a poorer condition in the Western Cape. Results were also compared between multiple penguin species and with African penguins in captivity. These values for healthy, wild, adult penguins can be used for future health and disease assessments.","154":"A 7-year-old male entire West Highland white terrier was referred to the Small Animal Hospital at the University of Glasgow for bilateral, chronic, medically unresponsive otitis media and externa. A history of cranio-mandibular osteopathy was also reported. Bilateral total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy was performed with the aid of a pneumatic burr. Extensive bone proliferation was present bilaterally originating from the caudal mandibular ramus and tympanic bulla which incorporated the horizontal canal on each side. The right facial nerve was identified leaving the stylomastoid foramen and running in a cranial direction through a 1.5 cm diameter cuff of bone surrounding the horizontal canal and external acoustic meatus. Despite careful dissection, a facial nerve neurotmesis ensued which required microsurgical epineurial repair. Neurologic examination performed 12 h post-operatively revealed abnormalities consistent with right facial nerve paralysis. At 3 months, the facial nerve function was found to have improved significantly and was assessed to be normal four months after surgery. To the authors' knowledge, this clinical communication described the first reported clinical case where unilateral facial nerve paralysis resulting from iatrogenic facial nerve neurotmesis was successfully treated by microsurgical epineurial repair. ","155":"Domestic dogs are common amongst communities in sub-Saharan Africa and may serve as important reservoirs for infectious agents that may cause diseases in wildlife. Two agents of concern are canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV), which may infect and cause disease in large carnivore species such as African wild dogs and African lions, respectively. The impact of domestic dogs and their diseases on wildlife conservation is increasing in Zimbabwe, necessitating thorough assessment and implementation of control measures. In this study, domestic dogs in north-western Zimbabwe were evaluated for antibodies to CDV, CPV, and canine adenovirus (CAV). These dogs were communal and had no vaccination history. Two hundred and twenty-five blood samples were collected and tested using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to CPV, CDV, and CAV. Of these dogs, 75 (34%) had detectable antibodies to CDV, whilst 191 (84%) had antibodies to CPV. Antibodies to canine adenovirus were present in 28 (13%) dogs. Canine parvovirus had high prevalence in all six geographic areas tested. These results indicate that CPV is circulating widely amongst domestic dogs in the region. In addition, CDV is present at high levels. Both pathogens can infect wildlife species. Efforts for conservation of large carnivores in Zimbabwe must address the role of domestic dogs in disease transmission. ","156":null,"157":null,"158":"Upper airway endoscopy at rest has been the diagnostic method of choice for equine upper respiratory tract (URT) conditions. Development of high-speed treadmill endoscopy improved the sensitivity of URT endoscopy by allowing observation of the horse's nasopharynx and larynx during exercise. However, treadmill exercise may not always accurately represent the horse's normal exercise as track surface, rider, tack and environmental variables are altered. Recently, the development of dynamic overground endoscopy (DOE) has addressed some of these shortcomings. A retrospective study was undertaken to describe the URT abnormalities detected during DOE in racehorses presenting with poor performance and\/or abnormal respiratory noise. Patient records of Thoroughbred racehorses undergoing DOE from November 2011 to August 2012 were reviewed. Data collected included signalment, primary complaint, distance exercised, maximum speed and dynamic airway abnormalities detected. Fifty-two horses underwent DOE for investigation of poor performance and\/or abnormal respiratory noise. The main abnormalities detected included axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds (40%), vocal cord collapse (35%), abnormal arytenoid function (33%) and dorsal displacement of the soft palate (25%). A total of 40 horses were diagnosed with one or more abnormalities of the URT (77%). Fifteen horses (29%) had a single abnormality and 25 horses (48%) had multiple abnormalities. This study showed that DOE is a useful technique for investigating dynamic disorders of the URT in racehorses in South Africa. The total number and type of dynamic pathological conditions were comparable with those identified in similar populations in other geographical locations. ","159":"Ticks, sera and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood were collected from dogs evaluated at the Amakom Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. Sera were evaluated for Dirofilaria immitis antigen and antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia canis. Conventional polymerase chain reaction assays designed to amplify the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Ehrlichia spp. or Anaplasma spp. or Neorickettsia spp. or Wolbachia spp., Babesia spp., Rickettsia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Bartonella spp. and the haemoplasmas were performed on DNA extracted from EDTA blood and all positive amplicons were sequenced. This small survey shows that the following vector-borne pathogens are present in urban Ghanian dogs: Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis,Dirofilaria immitis and Anaplasma platys. Bartonella henselae was isolated from ticks but not from the dogs.","160":"Goats are rarely anaesthetised; consequently, scant information is available on the efficacy of anaesthetic drugs in this species. Alfaxalone is a relatively new anaesthetic agent, of which the efficacy in goats has not yet been studied. In this study, the sedative and alfaxalone sparing effects of midazolam and butorphanol, administered alone or concomitantly, in goats were assessed. Eight clinically healthy goats, four does and four wethers, were enlisted in a randomised crossover manner to receive intramuscular sedative treatments consisting of saline 0.05 mL\/kg, or midazolam 0.30 mg\/kg, or butorphanol 0.10 mg\/kg, or a combination of midazolam 0.30 mg\/kg with butorphanol 0.10 mg\/kg before intravenous induction of general anaesthesia with alfaxalone. Following induction, the goats were immediately intubated and the quality of anaesthesia and basic physiological cardiorespiratory and blood-gas parameters were assessed until the goats had recovered from anaesthesia. The degree of sedation, quality of induction and recovery were scored. When compared with saline (3.00 mg\/kg), midazolam,administered alone or with butorphanol, caused a statistically significant increased level of sedation and a reduction in the amount of alfaxalone required for induction (2.00 mg\/kg and 1.70 mg\/kg, respectively). Butorphanol alone (2.30 mg\/kg) did not cause significant changes in level of sedation or alfaxalone-induction dose. During induction and recovery, the goats were calm following all treatments, including the control group. Cardiorespiratory and blood-gas parameters were maintained within clinically acceptable limits. The present study showed that midazolam, administered alone or combined with butorphanol, produces a degree of sedation that significantly reduces the dose of alfaxalone required for induction of general anaesthesia in goats, without causing any major adverse cardiorespiratory effects.","161":"Since 2007, West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported in South African horses, causing severe neurological signs. All cases were of lineage 2, except for one case that clustered with lineage 1 viruses. In the present study, gross and microscopic lesions of six South African lineage 2-infected horses and the one lineage 1 case are described. Diagnoses were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of central nervous system (CNS) tissue and one by RT-PCR of a brain virus isolate. The CNS of all cases was negative by RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for African horse sickness (AHS), equine encephalosis virus, equine herpes viruses 1 and 4, other zoonotic flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and shunivirus, and either by immunofluorescence or IHC for rabies. Gross visceral lesions were nonspecific but often mimicked those of AHS. The CNS histopathology of WNV lineage 2 cases resembled the nonsuppurative polioencephalomyelitis reported in the Northern Hemisphere lineage 1 and recent Hungarian lineage 2 cases. Occasional meningitis, focal spinal ventral horn poliomalacia, dorsal and lateral horn poliomyelitis, leucomyelitis, asymmetrical ventral motor spinal neuritis and frequent olfactory region involvement were also seen. Lineage 2 cases displayed marked variations in CNS lesion severity, type and distribution, and suggested various viral entry routes into the CNS, based on findings in experimental mice and hamsters. Lineage 1 lesions were comparable to the milder lineage 2 cases. West Nile virus IHC on CNS sections with marked lesions from all cases elicited only two antigen-positive cells in the olfactory cortex of one case. The presence in the CNS of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophage-monocytes was confirmed by cluster of differentiation (CD) 3, CD20, multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (MUM1) and macrophage (MAC) 387 IHC. ","162":"The effect that compressed air massage (CAM) has on skeletal muscle has been ascertained by the morphological and morphometric evaluation of healthy vervet monkey and rabbit skeletal muscle. How CAM may influence the process of healing following a contusion injury is not known. To determine how CAM or other physiotherapeutic modalities may influence healing, it is necessary to create a minor injury that is both reproducible and quantifiable at the termination of a pre-determined healing period. An earlier study described changes in the morphology of skeletal muscle following a reproducible contusion injury. This study extended that work in that it attempted to quantify the 'severity' of such an injury. A 201 g, elongated oval-shaped weight was dropped seven times through a 1 m tube onto the left vastus lateralis muscle of four New Zealand white rabbits. Biopsies were obtained 6 days after injury from the left healing juxta-bone and sub-dermal muscle and uninjured (control) right vastus lateralis of each animal. The tissue was fixed in formal saline, embedded in wax, cut and stained with haematoxylin and phosphotungstic haematoxylin. The muscle was examined by light microscopy and quantification of the severity of injury made using a modified, 'in-house' morphological index and by the comparative morphometric measurement of the cross-sectioned epimysium and myofibres in injured and control muscle. The results showed that a single contusion causes multiple, quantifiable degrees of injury from skin to bone - observations of particular importance to others wishing to investigate contusion injury in human or animal models. ","163":"Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease are transboundary viral diseases endemic in Africa and some parts of the Middle East, but with increasing potential for global emergence. Wild ruminants, such as the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), are thought to play a role in the epidemiology of these diseases. This study sought to expand the understanding of the role of buffalo in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) by determining seroprevalence to these viruses during an inter-epidemic period. Buffaloes from the Kruger National Park (n = 138) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 110) in South Africa were sampled and tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies against LSDV and RVFV using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) and the serum neutralisation test (SNT). The I-ELISA for LSDV and RVFV detected IgG antibodies in 70 of 248 (28.2%) and 15 of 248 (6.1%) buffaloes, respectively. Using the SNT, LSDV and RVFV neutralising antibodies were found in 5 of 66 (7.6%) and 12 of 57 (21.1%), respectively, of samples tested. The RVFV I-ELISA and SNT results correlated well with previously reported results. Of the 12 SNT RVFV-positive sera, three (25.0%) had very high SNT titres of 1:640. Neutralising antibody titres of more than 1:80 were found in 80.0% of the positive sera tested. The LSDV SNT results did not correlate with results obtained by the I-ELISA and neutralising antibody titres detected were low, with the highest (1:20) recorded in only two buffaloes, whilst 11 buffaloes (4.4%) had evidence of co-infection with both viruses. Results obtained in this study complement other reports suggesting a role for buffaloes in the epidemiology of these diseases during inter-epidemic periods.","164":"A castrated 9-year-old intact male boerboel cross-breed dog was presented with a month-long history of stranguria. On physical examination, a mass was noted at the caudal extremity of the os penis. Haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis were all unremarkable. Abdominal and urethral ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged bladder and a dilated urethra, which was followed to the caudal extremity of the os penis. A hyperechoic, roughly spherical,vascularised mass was noted at the caudal os penis, which resulted in obstruction of the penile urethra. Radiographs demonstrated a soft tissue mass with osteolysis of the os penis. Cytology suggested an osteosarcoma. Treatment included amputation of the penis and adjuvant doxorubicin with carboplatin. Histopathology of the penis confirmed a haemangiosarcoma. The patient survived for 20 months. This is only the second published case report describing a penile haemangiosarcoma, and the first published report demonstrating the treatment and outcome of a case of haemangiosarcoma of the os penis. Based on published and unpublished reports, haemangiosarcoma appears to be the most common neoplasm of the canine penis.","165":"The multi-drug resistance (mdr-1) gene mutation is a phenomenon well known to current veterinary practitioners. The mutation causes a predisposition for, amongst other phenomena, macrocyclic lactone-induced neurotoxicosis in affected canines, a condition that can be fatal. Various herding dog breeds can be heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation, and prevalence differs only slightly in dog populations between geographical regions. This report provides prevalence data of the canine mdr-1 mutation in 306 South African dogs. ","166":"The use of insect repellents to reduce the attack rate of Culicoides species (Diptera:Ceratopogonidae) should form part of an integrated control programme to combat African horse sickness and other diseases transmitted by these blood-feeding midges. In the present study the repellent effects of a commercially available mosquito repellent, a combination of citronella and lemon eucalyptus oils, on Culicoides midges was determined. The number of midges collected with two 220 V Onderstepoort traps fitted with 8 W 23 cm white light tubes and baited with peel-stick patches, each containing 40 mg of active ingredient, was compared with that of two unbaited traps. Two trials were conducted and in each trial the four traps were rotated in two replicates of a 4 x 4 randomised Latin square design. Although more midges were collected in the baited traps, the mean number in the baited and unbaited traps was not significantly different. This mosquito repellent did not influence either the species composition or the physiological groups of Culicoides imicola Kieffer. The higher mean numbers in the baited traps, although not statistically significant, may indicate that this mosquito repellent might even attract Culicoides midges under certain conditions.","167":"The current South African Veterinary Council (SAVC) has a long and laborious history associated with the legislation responsible for its establishment. The forerunner of the SAVC, the South African Veterinary Board, was established in terms of the Veterinary Act 1933 (Act No. 16 of 1933), which was launched through Parliament as a private motion by Dr Hjalmar Reitz M.P. After several amendments, the Act was replaced with the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Act 1982 (Act No. 19 of 1982), superseding the existing Board with the SAVC. One of the reasons for replacing this Act was to comply with Government policy for professional statutory bodies to become self-funding, with fees paid by registered professionals, and to constitute councils that were more representative of the profession. Apart from providing some background information, this article was virtually entirely confined to some historic aspects of the SAVC, using, as its basis, the main developments that occurred during the terms of office of its various presidents, serving from 1982 to 2011. The presidents concerned are: Prof. B.C. Jansen (28 March 1983 - 28 March 1986), Dr G.E. Frost (14 April 1986 - 31 March 1992), Prof. R.I. Coubrough (07 April 1992 - 21 March 1994), Dr P.C. Ardington (21 March 1994 - 31 March 1998), Prof H.M. Terblanche (31 March 1998 - 31 March 2004), Prof. S.S. van den Berg (01 April 2004 - 30 July 2007) and Dr R. Moerane (06 August 2007 - 31 July 2013). ","168":"In South Africa, outbreaks of African horse sickness (AHS) occur in summer; no cases are reported in winter, from July to September. The AHS virus (AHSV) is transmitted almost exclusively by Culicoides midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), of which Culicoides imicola is considered to be the most important vector. The over-wintering mechanism of AHSV is unknown. In this study, more than 500 000 Culicoides midges belonging to at least 26 species were collected in 88 light traps at weekly intervals between July 2010 and September 2011 near horses in the Onderstepoort area of South Africa. The dominant species was C. imicola. Despite relatively low temperatures and frost, at least 17 species, including C. imicola, were collected throughout winter (June-August). Although the mean number of midges per night fell from &amp;gt; 50 000 (March) to &amp;lt; 100 (July and August), no midge-free periods were found. This study, using virus isolation on cell cultures and a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, confirmed low infection prevalence in field midges and that the detection of virus correlated to high numbers. Although no virus was detected during this winter period, continuous adult activity indicated that transmission can potentially occur. The absence of AHSV in the midges during winter can be ascribed to the relatively low numbers collected coupled to low infection prevalence, low virus replication rates and low virus titres in the potentially infected midges. Cases of AHS in susceptible animals are likely to start as soon as Culicoides populations reach a critical level.","169":"Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious disease of sheep and other domestic and wild ruminants caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV). Currently 26 serotypes of the virus have been identified. In South Africa, 22 serotypes have been identified and BT is controlled mainly by annual vaccinations using a freeze-dried live attenuated polyvalent BTV vaccine. The vaccine is constituted of 15 BTV serotypes divided into three separate bottles and the aim is to develop a vaccine using fewer serotypes without compromising the immunity against the disease. This study is based on previously reported cross-neutralisation of specific BTV serotypes in in vitro studies. Bluetongue virus serotype 4 was selected for this trial and was tested for cross-protection against serotype 4 (control), 1 (unrelated serotype), 9, 10 and 11 in sheep using the serum neutralisation test. The purpose of the study was to determine possible cross-protection of different serotypes in sheep. Of those vaccinated with BTV-4 and challenged with BTV-1, which is not directly related to BTV-4, 20% were completely protected and 80% showed clinical signs, but the reaction was not as severe as amongst the unvaccinated animals. In the group challenged with BTV-10, some showed good protection and some became very sick. Those challenged with BTV-9 and BTV-11 had good protection. The results showed that BTV-4 does not only elicit a specific immune response but can also protect against other serotypes.

The present study was designed to evaluate whether different strains (Ulster 2C, B1, live LaSota and inactivated LaSota) of Newcastle disease vaccines had an effect on the haematological profile of female turkeys. Seventy-five female turkeys were allocated to treatment groups according to vaccination strain. All the birds, except those in the control group, were vaccinated at 32 weeks of age and revaccinated at 40 and 48 weeks of age. Blood samples were obtained for haematological analyses and serum samples for the haemagglutination inhibition test. Haemoglobin concentration was significantly lower (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in vaccinated female turkeys than in the control birds 28 days after vaccination. Monocytes were significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in 44-week-old female turkeys vaccinated with inactivated LaSota strain compared with the other groups. Turkeys vaccinated with the B1 strain showed significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) total white blood cell counts compared with the other groups vaccinated with various commercial strains of the Newcastle disease virus. In conclusion, female turkeys showed significant differences in haemoglobin concentrations, monocytes and white blood cell counts when vaccinated against Newcastle disease.

Sera were collected for detection of the p27 antigen, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, whilst whole blood was collected for haematology. FeLV p27 antigen was detected using a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit. Data on risk factors were analysed using a logistic regression model. Of the 100 cats tested, 41% (95% CI: 31.19% - 50.81%) (41\/100) were positive for the FeLV p27 antigen. Sex and health status of cats were not significantly (p &amp;gt; 0.05) associated with infection. Intact cats (OR = 9.73), those living in multicat housing (OR = 5.23) and cats that had access to outdoor life (OR = 35.5) were found to have higher odds of infection compared with neutered cats, those living in single-cat housing, and without access to outdoor life, respectively. Biochemistry and haematology revealed no specific changes. The results showed that FeLV infection was high in sampled cats, providing evidence of active infection. Thus, it would be prudent to introduce specific control measures for FeLV infection in Zimbabwe. ","173":"Fifteen crocodiles were randomly divided into three groups of five animals. They represented high-infection, medium-infection and low-infection groups of 642 larvae\/kg, 414 larvae\/kg and 134 larvae\/kg bodyweight, respectively. The parameters assessed were blood glucose, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). The humoral immune response to Trichinella zimbabwensis infection was evaluated in all three groups by an indirect ELISA method. The results showed deviations from normal parameters of blood glucose, CPK, LDH, AST and ALT when compared with reported levels in uninfected reptiles. Contrary to studies involving mammals, hypoglycaemia was not observed in the infected groups in this study. Peak values of blood glucose were reached on post-infection (PI) Day 49, Day 42 and Day 35 in the high-infection, medium-infection and low-infection groups, respectively. Peak values of LDH and AST were observed on PI Day 56, Day 49 and Day 42 in the high-infection, medium-infection and low-infection groups, respectively. Peak values of CPK were observed on Day 35 PI in all three groups. Peak ALT values were reached on Day 56 in the high-infection group and on Day 28 PI in both the medium-infection and low-infection groups. No correlations between the biochemical parameters and infection intensity were observed. Peak antibody titres were reached on Day 49 PI in the medium-infection group, and on Day 42 PI in both the high-infection and low-infection groups. Infection intensity could not be correlated with the magnitude of the humoral immune response or time to sero-conversion. Results from this study were in agreement with results reported in mammals infected with other Trichinella species and showed that antibody titres could not be detected indefinitely.","174":"Idiopathic lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis (LPR) is recognised frequently in dogs with clinical signs typical of other chronic nasal diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine clinical signs, survey radiographic, rhinoscopic and histologic abnormalities and the response to therapy in dogs with LPR. It was a retrospective study of 33 client-owned animals of various breeds and ages that had been diagnosed with LPR. During the study period, a total of 110 dogs were diagnosed with nasal disease, of which 33 (30%) were diagnosed with idiopathic LPR. The median age was 9 years (range 2.3-17 years) and there were 15 female and 18 male dogs. The majority of dogs showed a mucoid nasal discharge, bilateral stertor and no overt radiographic changes. The most common finding on rhinos copy was hyperaemic nasal mucous membranes with mucoid material accumulation within the nasal cavity. In all 33 dogs bacterial culture yielded no pathogenic bacteria and fungal culture was negative. Histologically, all 33 dogs showed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration within the nasal mucosa. All 33 dogs were treated with systemic and topical corticosteroids for varying lengths of time and dosing intervals. Eleven dogs were treated with concurrent cyclosporine and three dogs underwent allergy testing followed by desensitisation therapy. The best response was seen in the dogs that underwent desensitisation therapy, followed by those treated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine. ","175":"This study examined the role of the state in providing veterinary services to resource-poor stock farmers. Communal stock farmers in most rural areas have low incomes and generally poor access to commercial veterinary healthcare. The state veterinary services thus offer a means for stock farmers to maintain the health of their livestock and receive information on animal healthcare. Interviews and participant observation were used to collect data about animal healthcare practices in Hertzog, a village in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.The findings were that the state played an important role in animal healthcare and in the education of farmers. However, the lack of a skilled workforce was a constraint to effective service delivery, whilst veterinary educational institutions that disseminate information to the stock farmers were not utilised. It is thus important to fully utilise training centres to educate stock farmers and for more incentives to be given to state employees, so as to attract the necessary skilled personnel to improve service delivery. ","176":"Due to the lack of skin elasticity defects of the distal hind limb can be a challenge to close. This article assesses a well-described, but completely under-used technique for closure of wounds on the distal tarsus. The technique was used with good success in six cases presenting to the Bryanston Veterinary Hospital with a wide range of underlying pathology ranging from trauma to neoplastic disease of the tarsus. All six cases were treated with a reverse saphenous conduit flap and two of them underwent radiation therapy with no adverse side effects. All cases showed excellent results with a very low degree of flap necrosis that never exceeded 15% of the total flap area. This skin flap provides an excellent treatment method that is reliable in closure of defects of the distal tarsus with few adverse effects. To the author's knowledge there has been only one previously published report on the clinical use of this type of skin flap, even though the flap is well described in most texts.","177":"The minimum diameter method of morphometry (MDM) is used to measure and detect changes in myofibre diameters (FD). The MDM is used to identify pathology in skeletal muscle. In such studies, an assumption is made that the mean FD in a particular muscle in both limbs is essentially the same. This study explored this premise to determine the accuracy of MDM as a means of morphometric analysis. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the left (G1) and right (G2) tibialis anterior of four vervet monkeys and from the massaged left (G3) and untreated right (G4) tibialis anterior of four animals. Wax sections were prepared for MDM and FD was measured. Three specimens were re-measured on four occasions. The mean FD of each biopsy from G1 and G2 limbs were compared and the number of measurements necessary to produce a meaningful result determined. Repeated measurement showed a difference of &amp;lt; 3.0% in FD means between the first and three subsequent measurements. There was no significant difference of FD means between G1 and G2, whilst the difference between G3 and G4 was 11.2%. When &amp;gt; 175 FD were measured, the difference from the final mean was less than 2.0%. These data show that, (1) FD data derived from a muscle in an untreated limb can be used as a control for experiment mediated changes of FD in the other, (2) MDM is a reliable means of measuring FD and (3) 150-175 FD are needed to provide a dependable result. ","178":null,"179":"A number of key questions remain unanswered in the pathogenesis of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). As MMVD typically afflicts small-breed dogs, a genetic basis has been implied. In addition, the fact that not all dogs within a risk group develop MMVDis still unexplained. Research into the pathogenesis of MMVD typically falls under three categorical divisions, namely genetic factors, mechanical factors of the valve and systemic factors. Genetic studies have implicated certain loci in the pathogenesis of MMVD. Of particular interest is the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 locus, as IGF-1 is also associated with growth. The mechanical structure and function of the mitral valve have also received much attention in recent years. What has emerged is the notion of a highly complex dynamic structure, which has an uneven distribution of stress and strain according to the flow of blood. Research efforts have also identified a number of systemic factors such as cytokines and signalling pathways that may contribute to the failure of the valve. Serotonin remains an area of interest in this field. Taken together, the amalgamation of research efforts in these three areas will go a long way towards resolving the understanding of this disease.Another area of focus in MMVD has been the development of clinical tests to diagnose the onset of congestive heart failure. To this end, echocardiographic indices and biochemical markers have been investigated. Echocardiographic indices such as left atrial to aortic ratio and the N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have been identified as specific risk factors to predict progression. Advanced imaging studies such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have enabled investigators to determine the earliest remodelling changes that occur in MMVD.","180":"The aim of this communication is to provide preliminary information on the tick-borne pathogens of potential zoonotic importance present in southern Africa, mainly focusing on their geographical distribution and host range, and to identify research gaps.

Diagnosis of congenital primary hypothyroidism was confirmed by low serum total thyroxine and high thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations. Appropriate supplementation of levothyroxine was instituted. The kitten subsequently developed mild renal azotaemia and renal proteinuria, possibly as a consequence of treatment or an unmasked congenital renal developmental abnormality. Early recognition, diagnosis and treatment are vital as alleviation of clinical signs may depend on the cat's age at the time of diagnosis. ","182":"The historical evolution of veterinary services in South Africa is closely linked to the colonial history of the past and the eventual political formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, as well as the establishment of a fully democratic South Africa in 1994. The majority of the early pioneering veterinarians had close links to military activities and were originally mostly of British origin. The appointment of the first colonial chief veterinary officers occurred in the late 1800s. These appointments were dictated by the need to combat devastating animal diseases, such as rinderpest and African horse sickness, mainly because they affected draught oxen (used for travel) and horses (used in combat). Veterinary field services was established in 1962 as a separate functional entity within government services when M.C. Lambrechts became Director of Veterinary Services of South Africa. In the context of this article, veterinary field services refers to that sphere of veterinary service delivery conducted by government-appointed or seconded veterinarians applying disease control and prevention, as required by animal health legislation. Paging through the history of veterinary field services in South Africa confirms that the problems faced by the veterinary services of today were just as real during the times of our pioneers. The pioneers of veterinary services transformed unknown animal diseases into textbook descriptions still used today and also demonstrated the important link to, and use of, the observations made by farmers, as well as the need for continued basic and applied research on animal diseases. This article provided a brief overview of the evolution of veterinary field services and the important role played by pioneers over the last two centuries to make South Africa relatively free and safe from the most important trade-sensitive and economically important animal diseases. ","183":"In African societies, traditional slaughter is linked to celebrations like weddings or births, as well as funerals and ancestor veneration. Participants in traditional slaughter of goats are at risk of exposure to hazards during slaughter, food preparation and consumption of goat meat. For risk mitigation strategies to be implemented, identification of the population at risk is required. This study is based on the premise that the demographic profile of people involved in traditional slaughter of goats is important for risk communication. Both structured and informal interviews were recorded and analysed using a thematic analysis. A total of 105 people were interviewed at taxi ranks in Tshwane, Gauteng. Of these, 48 were women and 57 men. The median age of women and men was 40.6 years and 44.3 years, respectively. The majority of respondents (61.9%, n = 65) interviewed were from the Gauteng Province. Sixty percent (n = 63) of respondents had a secondary education, whilst less than 4.81% (n = 5) of respondents had no formal education. This study demonstrated that interviewing commuters at taxi ranks gave access to a cross section of gender, age, language and origin. It was found that both genders were involved in traditional slaughter of goats. Risk communication strategies should thus target women as well as men. Communication strategies to mitigate the risks of traditional slaughter of goats should take into consideration the dynamic nature of demographic and cultural norms. In light of the wide demographic profile of the respondents, it was concluded that it should be possible to use taxi ranks for successful dissemination of food safety and occupational health risk mitigation messages. ","184":"Theileriosis is a tick-borne disease caused by a piroplasma of the genus Theileria that can causeanaemia and thrombocytopenia. Its clinical importance for dogs' remains poorly understood,as only some develop clinical signs. In this study, physical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes of six client-owned diseased dogs presented at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital are described retrospectively. In the dogs, Theileria species (n = 4) and Theileria equi (n = 2) were detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-reverse blothybridisation assay in blood samples, whilst PCR for Babesia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia were negative. The most common physical findings were pale mucous membranes (five out of six dogs), bleeding tendencies (five out of six dogs) and lethargy (three out of six dogs). All dogs were thrombocytopenic [median 59.5 x 10(9)\/L (range 13-199)] and five out of six dogs were anaemic [median haematocrit 18% (range 5-32)]. Bone marrow core biopsies performed in two dogs showed myelofibrosis. Theileriosis was treated with imidocarb dipropionate and the suspected secondary immune-mediated haematological disorders with prednisolone and azathioprine. Five dogs achieved clinical cure and post-treatment PCR performed in three out of five dogs confirmed absence of circulating parasitaemia. An immune-mediated response to Theileria species is thought to result in anaemia and\/or thrombocytopenia in diseased dogs with theileriosis. A bleeding tendency, most likely secondary to thrombocytopenia and\/or thrombocytopathy, was the most significant clinical finding in these cases. The link between thrombocytopenia, anaemia and myelofibrosis in theileriosis requires further investigation and theileriosis should be considered a differential diagnosis for dogs presenting with anaemia and\/or thrombocytopenia in endemic tick-borne disease areas.","185":"Fowl adenovirus (FAdV) is a member of the genus Aviadenovirus and causes a number of economically important poultry diseases. One of these diseases, inclusion body hepatitis (IBH), has a worldwide distribution and is characterised by acute mortality (5% - 20%) in production chickens. The disease was first described in the United States of America in 1963 and has also been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Ireland, but until now, not in South Africa. Adenoviruses isolated from the first outbreak of IBH in South Africa were able to reproduce the disease in chicken embryo livers. The aim of the present study was to characterise the viruses and determine the pathogenicity of the FAdV strains responsible for the first reported case of IBH in South Africa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the L1 loop region of the fowl adenovirus hexon gene using degenerate primer pair hexon A\/B was used to identify the viruses that were isolated. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the amplification products was used for the differentiation of 14 isolates of fowl adenovirus. Sequencing of the PCR products followed by amino acid comparison and phylogenetic analysis using the L1 loop region of the hexon protein was done to determine the identity of the isolates. Amino acid sequences of the hexon genes of all the South African isolates were compared with those of reference strains representing FAdV species. Amino acid comparison of 12 South Africa field isolates to FAdV reference strains revealed a high sequence identity (&amp;gt; 93.33%) with reference strains T8-A and 764. Two of the isolates had high sequence identity (93.40%) with reference strains P7-A, C2B and SR48. Phylogenetic analysis of the L1 loop region of the hexon protein of all 14 South African isolates was consistent with their RFLP clusters. The mortality rates of embryos challenged with 106 egg infective doses (EID50) FAdV 2 were 80% - 87% and mortality rates for embryos challenged with 105.95 (EID50) FAdV 8b were 65% - 80%.

There are 12 FAdV types (FAdV1to FAdV8a and FAdV8b to FAdV11), classified into five species based on their genotype (designated FAdVA to FAdVE). A total of 218 000 chickens, 2-29 days of age, were affected over a 1-year period, all testing positive by microscopy, virus isolation and confirmation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Affected birds were depressed, lost body weight,were weak and had watery droppings. Pathological changes observed during necropsy indicated consistent changes in the liver, characterised by hepatomegaly, cholestasis and hepatitis. Lesions were also discernible in the spleen, kidney and gizzard wall and were characterised by splenomegaly, pinpoint haemorrhages, nephritis with haemorrhage,visceral gout and serosal ecchymosis of the gizzard wall. Histopathological lesions were most consistently observed in the liver but could also be seen in renal and splenic tissue. Virus isolation was achieved in embryonated eggs and most embryos revealed multifocalto diffuse hepatic necrosis, with a mixed cellular infiltrate of macrophages and heterophils(necro-granulomas), even in the absence of macroscopic pathology. Virus isolation results were verified by histopathology and PCR on embryonic material and further characterised by nucleotide sequence analysis. Two infectious bursal disease virus isolates were also made from the Klerksdorp flock. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the L1 hexon loop of all the FAdV isolates indicated homology (99%) with prototype strains P7-A for FAdV-2, as well as for FAdV-8b. ","188":null,"189":"Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease of dogs. The current management of MMVD in dogs is mostly pharmacological, and the recommendations for treatment are based on a number of veterinary studies. Notwithstanding the current consensus regarding the medical management of MMVD, there remains active debate as to which drugs are the most effective. In order to understand how recommendations are constructed in the pharmacological management of diseases, the veterinarian needs to understand the concept of evidence-based veterinary medicine, and how the findings of these studies can be applied in their own practices. This review summarises the current veterinary literature and explains how the consensus regarding the management of MMVD has been reached. This review highlights the limitations of veterinary studies in order to provide veterinary practitioners with a sense of the difficulty there is in establishing the benefit of one treatment over the other. Veterinarians should therefore apply treatment recommendations based on the best evidence, integrated with a pathomechanistic understanding of the disease process and clinical experience.","190":"The effects of vaccination on avian blood parameters are poorly understood. The present study was designed to evaluate whether different strains (Ulster 2C, B1, live LaSota and inactivated LaSota) of Newcastle disease vaccines had an effect on the haematological profile of female turkeys. Seventy-five female turkeys were allocated to treatment groups according to vaccination strain. All the birds, except those in the control group, were vaccinated at 32 weeks of age and revaccinated at 40 and 48 weeks of age. Blood samples were obtained for haematological analyses and serum samples for the haemagglutination inhibition test. Haemoglobin concentration was significantly lower (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in vaccinated female turkeys than in the control birds 28 days after vaccination. Monocytes were significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in 44-week-old female turkeys vaccinated with inactivated LaSota strain compared with the other groups. Turkeys vaccinated with the B1 strain showed significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) total white blood cell counts compared with the other groups vaccinated with various commercial strains of the Newcastle disease virus. In conclusion, female turkeys showed significant differences in haemoglobin concentrations, monocytes and white blood cell counts when vaccinated against Newcastle disease.","191":"A number of key questions remain unanswered in the pathogenesis of myxomatous mitralvalve disease (MMVD). As MMVD typically afflicts small-breed dogs, a genetic basis hasbeen implied. In addition, the fact that not all dogs within a risk group develop MMVDis still unexplained. Research into the pathogenesis of MMVD typically falls under threecategorical divisions, namely genetic factors, mechanical factors of the valve and systemicfactors. Genetic studies have implicated certain loci in the pathogenesis of MMVD. Ofparticular interest is the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 locus, as IGF-1 is also associatedwith growth. The mechanical structure and function of the mitral valve have also receivedmuch attention in recent years. What has emerged is the notion of a highly complex dynamicstructure, which has an uneven distribution of stress and strain according to the flow ofblood. Research efforts have also identified a number of systemic factors such as cytokinesand signalling pathways that may contribute to the failure of the valve. Serotonin remainsan area of interest in this field. Taken together, the amalgamation of research efforts inthese three areas will go a long way towards resolving the understanding of this disease.Another area of focus in MMVD has been the development of clinical tests to diagnose theonset of congestive heart failure. To this end, echocardiographic indices and biochemicalmarkers have been investigated. Echocardiographic indices such as left atrial to aortic ratioand the N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have beenidentified as specific risk factors to predict progression. Advanced imaging studies such ascardiac magnetic resonance imaging have enabled investigators to determine the earliestremodelling changes that occur in MMVD.","192":"Congenital malformations of the branchial arches, clefts and grooves have not been previously reported in sheep. These defects may be due to infectious agents (especially viruses), toxins or genetic abnormalities. Defects were reported in two of a set of quadruplet lambs born prematurely to an eight-tooth Mutton Merino ewe. The lambs weighed between 2.0 kg and 2.5 kg; this is below the normal expected birth weight of 3.5 kg for quadruplet lambs, below which viability is compromised. The firstborn lamb was severely affected by bilateral oroauricular fistulae. The second lamb was unilaterally affected on the right, less severely than the first. The third lamb was normal and the fourth was mummified. The occurrence of another case in this small flock almost a decade earlier indicates that there could be genetic involvement. ","193":"Land redistribution was legislated in 1994; it was designed to resolve historical imbalances inland ownership in South Africa. Between 2002 and 2006, a longitudinal observational studywas conducted with 15 purposively selected small-scale dairy farmers in a land redistributionproject in Central North West Province. Four farmers left the project over the period. For thepurposes of this study, a small-scale dairy farm was defined as a farm that produces less than500 L of milk a day, irrespective of the number of cows or size of the farm. The study wasconducted in three phases. In the first phase, situational analysis using participatory ruralappraisal (PRA) and observation was used to outline the extent of the constraints and designappropriate interventions. Feeds that were used were tested and evaluated. In the secondphase, three different feeding systems were designed from the data obtained from PRA. Thesewere: (1) A semi-intensive farm-based ration using available crops, pastures and crop residueswith minimal rations purchased. (2) An intensive, zero-grazing dairy system using a totalmixed ration. (3) A traditional, extensive or dual-purpose system, where the calf drank fromthe cow until weaning and milking was done only once a day. In the third phase, adoptionwas monitored. By July 2006, all remaining farmers had changed to commercially formulatedrations or licks and the body condition score of the cows had improved. It was concluded thatveterinary extension based on PRA and a holistic systems approach was a good option forsuch complex problems. Mentoring by commercial dairy farmers, veterinary and extensionservices appeared to be viable. Further research should be done to optimise the traditionalmodel of dairy farming, as this was relatively profitable, had a lower risk and was less labourintensive. ","194":"A case of polymelia with a rudimentary wing is described in an eight-week-old Nera black chicken (Gallus domesticus). It is a rare disorder with chromosomal aberrations, which are associated with congenital limb malformations. The condition was observed during routine physical examination of a flock of 2000 poultry birds in the month of February 2008 in Ibadan, Nigeria. After physical examination, the bird was found to have two extra well-developed legs, which were shorter than the normal legs. These extra legs were also found to be non-functional. Similarly, a rudimentary wing, which was highly vestigial, was found on the left lateral side of the bird very close to the cloaca. The bird died at the age of eight weeks. This is the first reported case of polymelia with a rudimentary wing in a domestic chicken in Nigeria. ","195":null,"196":null,"197":"The post-occipital sinus of the spinal vein is often used for the collection of blood samples from crocodilians. Although this sampling method has been reported for several crocodilian species, the technique and associated anatomy has not been described in detail in any crocodilian, including the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). The anatomy of the cranial neck region was investigated macroscopically, microscopically, radiographically and by means of computed tomography. Latex was injected into the spinal vein and spinal venous sinus of crocodiles to visualise the regional vasculature. The spinal vein ran within the vertebral canal, dorsal to and closely associated with the spinal cord and changed into a venous sinus cranially in the post-occipital region. For blood collection, the spinal venous sinus was accessed through the interarcuate space between the atlas and axis (C1 and C2) by inserting a needle angled just off the perpendicular in the midline through the craniodorsal cervical skin, just cranial to the cranial borders of the first cervical osteoderms. The most convenient method of blood collection was with a syringe and hypodermic needle. In addition, the suitability of the spinal venous sinus for intravenous injections and infusions in live crocodiles was evaluated. The internal diameter of the commercial human epidural catheters used during these investigations was relatively small, resulting in very slow infusion rates. Care should be taken not to puncture the spinal cord or to lacerate the blood vessel wall using this route for blood collection or intravenous infusions.","198":"Based on a review of the literature, reference intervals for water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) serum biochemistry and haematology have not previously been published. The current study was done to establish reference intervals for water buffalo heifers. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry stated that at least 120 values are necessary to obtain reliable estimates for reference intervals. A total number of 127 clinically healthy buffalo heifers (1-2 years old) were included in the study. Animals were examined at buffalo farms that belong to Assiut Governorate, Egypt. Three types of samples were collected: serum samples for biochemical analysis, whole blood samples for haematological analysis and faecal samples for parasitological examination. Animals that fitted the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Biochemical analysis included serum total proteins, albumin, total globulins, alpha, beta and gamma globulin levels, and aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. In addition to the above, serum creatinine, urea, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, copper, zinc, iron, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, glucose levels and 20 haematological variables were measured. The 95.0% reference intervals were calculated by removing the upper and lower 2.5% of the interval for each serum biochemical constituent to give the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. Confidence intervals were calculated for each reference limit. Reference intervals from the current study were compared with established values for cows. The current study is as far as could be determined the first that establishes reference intervals for the serum biochemical and haematological parameters in water buffalo heifers.","199":null,"200":"Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a contagious tumour in sheep caused by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV). This tumour originates from the pneumocyte type II and Clara cells and grossly appears as hard, prominent nodules in different lobes. The clinical signs of the disease are similar to those of other chronic respiratory diseases and are not pathogonomic. Therefore, post mortem examinations and histopathological studies are the most reliable ways to diagnose OPA, particularly subclinical cases of this neoplasm. In this study, out of 1000 sheep lungs grossly inspected, 50 animals were suspected of OPA. The suspected lungs as well as 25 apparently normal lungs were examined by histopathological and PCR methods. The proviral DNA was detected in 1\/25 apparently normal lungs and 8\/50 of the suspected lungs and subsequently confirmed by histopathological studies. The PCR-positive lung samples from five sheep revealed lesions of 'atypical' OPA and those from three sheep showed the 'classic' form of the disease. The tumours were multifocal and the masses were distributed throughout the cranioventral and diaphragmatic lung lobes. The stroma of the tumours in the atypical cases was more severely affected with inflammatory cell infiltration and connective tissue proliferation. The histopathological characteristics of maedi including hyperplasia of the perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphoid cells, interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and smooth muscle hyperplasia were also associated with OPA, especially the atypical form of this adenocarcinoma. Atypical OPA was more prevalent than the classic form. Geographic and climatic conditions, duration of exposure to the virus and the immune status of individual animals might be responsible for the differences between the two pathological entities of OPA. ","201":"High incidence of neoplasia in captive jaguar (Panthera onca) has been recorded but there have been no reports of cutaneous adenocarcinoma of the sebaceous gland. A high incidence of neoplasia has been detected in captive jaguars, possibly associated with longevity and husbandry practices in captivity. Neoplasm is a major cause of mortality in jaguar. Tumours of sebaceous gland are common in older domestic felids. A case of cutaneous adenocarcinoma of the sebaceous gland was diagnosed in a male captive jaguar in the Zoological Garden, Alipore, Kolkata, India and was managed successfully. The tumour was observed as a superficial, ulcerated, multilobulated intradermal mass. After preoperative haematological evaluation the tumour was excised through routine surgical procedure under chemical immobilisation. Post-operative management was uneventful. Local tumour recurrence was not noticed till one year after post-operation.","202":"The study determined the prevalence and major types of gastrointestinal parasites in pigs and assessed the health management practices on farms in Burayu District in West Shoa Zone of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. The study was performed from November 2007 to April 2008 using standard coprological examination and a well-organised questionnaire survey. Of the 272 pigs examined for the presence of gastrointestinal parasites, 36 (13.2%) were infected with one or more types of parasite. Neither age nor management system proved to be a statistically significant factor in the prevalence of parasites. The highest prevalence of parasites was recorded in December, January and April, whereas the lowest was observed in February. Significant variation in the prevalence of parasites was noticed amongst study months. The majority of farmers did not use acaricides to treat and control external parasites. Anthelmintics were not used by any of the farmers. Some 76.1% of the farmers never used any type of treatment for sick pigs; 21.7% of the farmers used modern treatment and 2.2% of the farmers used traditional medicines. More than 95.0% of pigs were kept on soil floors and only 10.9% of the housing systems had good ventilation. Dung was removed at least every three days, with the majority of farmers (91.2%) removing it every morning. This study provided evidence for the occurrence of internal parasites in pigs kept in Burayu District in Oromia. Further epidemiological studies are needed to determine the zoonotic and economic importance of pig parasites in other parts of Ethiopia. ","203":"A cross-sectional study was conducted in order to detect antibodies for Brucella canis (B. canis) in dogs from urban Harare and five selected rural communities in Zimbabwe. Sera from randomly selected dogs were tested for antibodies to B. canis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Overall, 17.6% of sera samples tested (57\/324, 95% CI: 13.5-21.7) were positive for B. canis antibodies. For rural dogs, seroprevalence varied from 11.7% - 37.9%. Rural dogs recorded a higher seroprevalence (20.7%, 95% CI: 15.0-26.4) compared with Harare urban dogs (12.7%, 95% CI: 6.9-18.5) but the difference was not significant (p = 0.07). Female dogs from both sectors had a higher seroprevalence compared with males, but the differences were not significant (p &gt; 0.05). Five and two of the positive rural dogs had titres of 1:800 and 1:1600, respectively, whilst none of the positive urban dogs had a titre above 1:400. This study showed that brucellosis was present and could be considered a risk to dogs from the studied areas. Further studies are recommended in order to give insight into the epidemiology of brucellosis in dogs and its possible zoonotic consequences in Zimbabwe. Screening for other Brucella spp. (Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis and Brucella suis) other than B. canis is also recommended.","204":"L-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an autosomal recessive error of metabolism that manifests as an encephalopathy. The most common presenting signs are seizures, tremors, ataxia and\/ or dementia. Some affected dogs show only subtle behavioural changes. Amongst canines, the condition has been best described in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. Although this is the first reported case in South Africa, at least three other affected dogs have been indentified by polmerase chain reaction (PCR) in this country. Affected dogs have normal haematology, serum biochemistry and routine urine analysis. This report discusses the advantages and limitations of the three main diagnostic modalities, namely: magnetic resonance imaging, urine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and genetic testing. The aim of this report is to increase awareness of the condition, assist diagnosis in encephalopathic dogs and improve detection of carriers amongst breeding stock. ","205":"This study was performed to investigate the analgesic effect of lidocaine and a combination of lidocaine and ketamine following epidural administration in dromedary camels. Ten 12-18-month-old camels were randomly divided into two equal groups. In group L, the animals received 2% lidocaine (0.22 mg\/kg) and in group LK the animals received a mixture of 10% ketamine (1 mg\/kg) and 2% lidocaine (0.22 mg\/kg) administered into the first intercoccygeal (Co1-Co2) epidural space while standing. Onset time and duration of caudal analgesia, sedation level and ataxia were recorded after drug administration. Data were analysed by U Mann-Whitney tests and significance was taken as p &amp;lt; 0.05. The results showed that epidural lidocaine and co-administration of lidocaine and ketamine produced complete analgesia in the tail, anus and perineum. Epidural administration of the lidocaine-ketamine mixture resulted in mild to moderate sedation, whilst the animals that received epidural lidocaine alone were alert and nervous during the study. Ataxia was observed in all test subjects and was slightly more severe in camels that received the lidocaine-ketamine mixture. It was concluded that epidural administration of lidocaine plus ketamine resulted in longer caudal analgesia in standing conscious dromedary camels compared with the effect of administering lidocaine alone.","206":"","207":"A two-year-old male German shepherd dog was admitted to Shahid Bahonar Veterinary Hospital with clinical signs that included lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration. Physical examination revealed nothing significant. Routine paraclinical tests only revealed a stress leukogram. Radiography revealed a mass in the stomach. Whilst performing a laparotomy, the surgeon observed an unusual mass in the subserosal layer of the proximal part of the jejunum. The histopathology of the mass revealed some scattered sebaceous and sweat glands associated with the cyst wall that confirmed the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. Intestinal dermoid cysts are very rare and to our knowledge this is the first report of an intestinal dermoid cyst in a dog.","208":"A study was conducted in the Luwero and Nakasongola districts in central Uganda to determine and compare the prevalence and distribution of antibodies against Brucella abortus in cattle under contrasting husbandry practices, using two serological tests. Three hundred and fifteen serum samples were systematically sampled from 29 farms and subsequently tested using the Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) and Indirect Antibody Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (I-ELISA). The overall prevalence of antibodies against Brucella abortus in the Nakasongola and Luwero districts was 2.4% and 4.7% on RBPT, compared with 1.2% and 3.34 % on I-ELISA. There was no significant difference between the results obtained by RBPT and indirect antibody ELISA (p &gt; 0.05). It was noted that antibodies against Brucella abortus were widely spread over different farms regardless of the cattle grazing system (p &gt; 0.05). Based on the findings, it is feasible to use RBPT as a cheaper screening alternative for brucellosis. A comprehensive national brucellosis study should be undertaken to study the epidemiology and prevalence of brucellosis in Uganda.","209":null,"210":"This study analysed 60 dog food samples obtained from commercial outlets following the 2011 aflatoxicosis outbreak in South Africa. Results obtained from the selected dog food samples revealed that 87% of samples were contaminated with aflatoxins (AFs) (mainly AFB1 and AFB2). Amongst these samples, 45 (75%) were above the 20 parts per billion (ppb) set by most countries and 10 ppb regulated by the Fertilizers, Farm Feeds, Agricultural Remedies and Stock Remedies Act (Act No. 36 of 1947) for South Africa. In addition to AFs, other mycotoxins were also detected in the same samples with fumonisins (FBs) (mainly FB1 and FB2) contaminating 98% of samples with 49 (81.81) above the tolerable limit of 1000 ppb in feedstuff set up by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) (USA). The FBs mean obtained was 1556 ppb (Table 1) with contamination varying between 5.2 and 4653.8 ppb. Ochratoxin A (OTA) was detected in 41 (68%) of the analysed samples, with a mean value of 13.7 ppb. Amongst these samples, 15 (25%) were above the 20 ppb highest limit set by the Codex Alimentarius standard. Zearalenone (ZEA) was detected in 96% of samples, with a mean value of 354.1 ppb. Thirty-three samples (55%) were above the regulated level 1000 ppb tolerable limit. The recoveries were up to ten times the tolerable daily limits of the FDA and EU. The correlation between mycotoxin findings and clinical signs reported on patients presented for aflatoxicosis led to the conclusion that the outbreak was associated with the presence of other mycotoxins found simultaneously in the analysed samples by additive or synergistic effects.","211":"Limited data are available on the risk factors responsible for the occurrence of brucellosis amongst different cattle production systems in Nigeria despite its significant impact on livestock production. Consequently, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in three cattle production systems in Yewa Division of Ogun State, south-western Nigeria. A total of 279 blood samples (sedentary = 88; transhumance = 64; trade = 127) were examined for antibodies to Brucella sp. using the Rose Bengal test (RBT) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). Overall, 24 (8.6%) and 16 (5.7%) of the animals tested seropositive for Brucella using RBT and cELISA, respectively. The herd seroprevalences based on RBT and cELISA were 31.6% and 15.8%, respectively. The results using cELISA reveal higher seroprevalence in the trade cattle (7.9%; confidence intervals [CI] = 3.2% - 12.6%) and those in a sedentary system (5.7%; CI = 0.9% - 10.5%) than in cattle kept under a transhumant management system (1.6%; CI = 1.5% - 4.7%). Age (&gt; 3 years; p = 0.043) and breed (Djali; p = 0.038) were statistically significant for seropositivity to brucellosis based on cELISA, but sex (female, p = 0.234), production system (trade and sedentary; p = 0.208) or herd size (&gt; 120; p = 0.359) was not. Since breeding stock is mostly sourced from trade and sedentary cattle, it is important that routine serological screening should be conducted before introducing any animal into an existing herd.","212":null,"213":"A study was conducted to compare the excision sampling technique used by the export market and the sampling technique preferred by European countries, namely the biotrace cattle and swine test. The measuring unit for the excision sampling was grams (g) and square centimetres (cm2) for the swabbing technique. The two techniques were compared after a pilot test was conducted on spiked approved beef carcasses (n = 12) that statistically proved the two measuring units correlated. The two sampling techniques were conducted on the same game carcasses (n = 13) and analyses performed for aerobic plate count (APC), Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, for both techniques. A more representative result was obtained by swabbing and no damage was caused to the carcass. Conversely, the excision technique yielded fewer organisms and caused minor damage to the carcass. The recovery ratio from the sampling technique improved 5.4 times for APC, 108.0 times for E. coli and 3.4 times for S. aureus over the results obtained from the excision technique. It was concluded that the sampling methods of excision and swabbing can be used to obtain bacterial profiles from both export and local carcasses and could be used to indicate whether game carcasses intended for the local market are possibly on par with game carcasses intended for the export market and therefore safe for human consumption.","214":"In July 2006, a case of two out of three lambs born to one ewe in a flock of 45 had signs that, in retrospect, were possibly consistent with Schmallenberg virus infection. This occurred in the Onderstepoort area (Gauteng Province) but a definitive diagnosis was not made. Then, in May 2008, a farmer in the Delmas area (Mpumalanga Province) reported that deformed lambs had been born to several ewes in the flock. Six of the approximately 50 mated ewes gave birth to lambs showing varying degrees of arthrogryposis, torticollis, kyphosis, mandibular brachygnathia and hydrocephalus. Of these, only two were born alive but they died within a few hours. Blood was collected from the ewes with deformed lambs, a random sample of ewes that had given birth to normal lambs and a lamb that was normal but had a twin that was deformed. The samples were tested for Wesselsbron and Akabane antibodies using a complement fixation test and a haemagglutination\/haemagglutination inhibition test that were available at that time. Bluetongue virus antibodies were also tested for using a commercial Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. All samples showed negative results for all diseases tested. At the time Rift Valley fever virus had not been diagnosed in that region for many years and so it was not included in the testing. It is unlikely that this was the cause as no liver pathology was detected on postmortem examination of the lambs and no adult ewes had died. The farmer reported that another farm just a few kilometres away experienced the same deformities in some of their lambs but this farm was not investigated. During investigation it was thought that the cause was possibly a new strain of Akabane virus, although there was no way to confirm it. However, with the recent discovery of the Schmallenberg virus, it is possible that this virus has been present in South Africa for at least the last four years without being identified.","215":"Intravenous anaesthesia is gradually becoming popular in veterinary practice. Traditionally, general anaesthesia is induced with intravenous drugs and then maintained with inhalation agents. Inhalation anaesthetic agents cause more significant dose-dependent cardiorespiratory depression than intravenous anaesthetic drugs, creating a need to use less of the inhalation anaesthetic agents for maintenance of general anaesthesia by supplementing with intravenous anaesthesia drugs. Better still, if anaesthesia is maintained completely with intravenous anaesthetic drugs, autonomic functions remain more stable intra-operatively. Patient recovery from anaesthesia is smoother and there is less pollution of the working environment than happens with inhalation anaesthetic agents. Recently, a number of drugs with profiles (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) suitable for prolonged intravenous anaesthesia have been studied, mostly in humans and, to a certain extent, in dogs and horses. There is currently very little scientific information on total intravenous anaesthesia in goats, although, in the past few years, some scholarly scientific articles on drugs suitable for partial intravenous anaesthesia in goats have been published. This review article explored the information available on drugs that have been assessed for partial intravenous anaesthesia in goats, with the aim of promoting incorporation of these drugs into total intravenous anaesthesia protocols in clinical practice. That way, balanced anaesthesia, a technique in which drugs are included in anaesthetic protocols for specific desired effects (hypnosis, analgesia, muscle relaxation, autonomic stabilisation) may be utilised in improving the welfare of goats undergoing general anaesthesia.","216":"Dietary fat contributes significantly to the energy requirements of poultry. Not all species are able to increase their absorptive capacity for fats in response to a high fat diet. The effects of a high fat diet (10% canola oil) on the lipid absorption and deposition in the liver, breast and thigh muscles of male and female Japanese quail were investigated. Thirty-eight Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were randomly divided into a high fat diet (HFD) and a standard diet (STD) group. The birds were fed the diets for seven weeks after which half of the birds were subjected to oral fat loading tests (OFLT) with plant oils containing long-chain and medium-chain triglycerides. The remaining birds were included for the lipid deposition measurements. Thereafter the birds were euthanised, blood samples were collected and liver, breast and thigh muscle lipid deposition was determined. Female quail on both diets had significantly higher plasma triglyceride concentrations (p &amp;lt; 0.05) compared with their male counterparts. No significant differences in plasma triglyceride concentrations were observed after the OFLTs. Female quail had significantly heavier liver masses compared with the males but there was no significant difference in the liver lipid content per gram liver mass. Female quail on the HFD had higher lipid content (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the breast muscle compared with their male counterparts whilst male quail on the HFD had higher lipid content (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the thigh muscle in comparison with both males and females on the standard diet. Dietary supplementation with 10% canola oil did not alter gastrointestinal tract lipid absorption, but it caused differences between the sexes in muscle lipid accumulation, the physiological significance of which requires further investigation.","217":null,"218":null,"219":"Successful treatment of canine pyoderma has become compromised owing to the development of antimicrobial resistance with accompanying recurrence of infection. Canine skin samples submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for microbiological culture and sensitivity between January 2007 and June 2010, from which Staphylococcus intermedius was isolated, were selected for this investigation. Antimicrobial resistance of S. intermedius was most prevalent with reference to ampicillin followed by resistance to tetracycline and then potentiated sulphonamides. In general, antimicrobial resistance was low and very few methicillin-resistant isolates were detected. Temporal trends were not noted, except for ampicillin, with isolates becoming more susceptible, and potentiated sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole), with isolates becoming more resistant. In general, both the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion and broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration tests yielded similar results for the antimicrobial agents tested. The main difference was evident in the over-estimation of resistance by the Kirby-Bauer test for ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, penicillin and doxycycline. Knowledge of trends in bacterial resistance is important for veterinarians when presented with canine pyoderma. Analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. intermedius isolated from canine pyodermas will guide veterinarians' use of the most appropriate agent and encourage prudent use of antimicrobials in companion animals.","220":"This article reports the first documented treatment of venomous snakebite with a polyvalent snake antivenom from the South African Institute for Medical Research in endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Three juvenile male animals (6.5 months of age) showed clinical signs after being bitten by an unidentified venomous snake. The signs included loss of appetite, disorientation, impaired locomotion, excessive facial swelling, profuse salivation, reduced respiratory effort and an apparent depressed mental state. Intravenous treatment with isotonic Ringer lactate solution, hetastarch 6% and dexamethazone, subcutaneous administration of procaine benzylpenicillin and benzathine benzylpenicillin, and ultimately intravenous administration of the polyvalent snake antivenom resulted in the complete recovery of all three wild dogs.","221":"A two-year-old Thoroughbred colt was presented to the Equine Clinic, Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital for head trauma after rearing and falling backwards, hitting his head on the ground. Following medical therapy for acute onset neurological impairment secondary to a suspected basilar skull fracture, the horse was anaesthetised and computed tomography of the skull was performed. A diagnosis of a comminuted basilar skull fracture was made and skull radiographs were taken for comparison. The horse was subsequently euthanased owing to the poor prognosis; necropsy findings were compatible with imaging findings. The value and limitation of computed tomography versus radiography for the diagnosis of basilar skull fracture are discussed in this report.","222":"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is prevalent in all countries with intensive poultry flocks. This disease is characterised primarily by respiratory signs, but some IBV strains may also infect other organs such as the intestinal and urogenital tracts. The aim of this study was to characterise the histopathological lesions and tissue tropism of Iranian isolate IR\/773\/2001(793\/B) of avian infectious bronchitis virus in different organs of experimentally infected SPF chickens. Forty-two one-day-old, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were divided randomly into two groups (21 chicks to each group). At the age of 12 days, one group was inoculated intra-ocularly with 10(3) EID 50 of the 793\/B isolate, and the other was kept as the control group. Tissue samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days post-inoculation (PI). The IBV virus was detected in the caecal tonsils and cloaca from the 2nd to the 12th day PI. The virus was also detected in the kidneys from days 4-10 PI and in the bursa of Fabricius from days 4-12 PI. The virus was detected in the trachea, lungs and thymus. The most obvious histopathological lesions were found in the trachea, kidney, lungs and bursa of Fabricius. Amongst the lymphoid tissues, histopathological changes were found most frequently in the bursa of Fabricius. The results of this study indicated that the 793\/B serotype of IBV is unlikely to cause mortality, severe clinical signs or gross lesions in infected chickens, but its replication in some tissues including the bursa of Fabricius could render birds susceptible to other micro-organisms.","223":"The history of veterinary science in South Africa can only be appreciated, studied, researched and passed on to coming generations if historical sources are readily available. In most countries, material and sources with historical value are often difficult to locate, dispersed over a large area and not part of the conventional book and journal literature. The Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria and its library has access to a large collection of historical sources. The collection consists of photographs, photographic slides, documents, proceedings, posters, audio-visual material, postcards and other memorabilia. Other institutions in the country are also approached if relevant sources are identified in their collections. The University of Pretoria's institutional repository, UPSpace, was launched in 2006. This provided the Jotello F. Soga Library with the opportunity to fill the repository with relevant digitised collections of diverse heritage and learning resources that can contribute to the long-term preservation and accessibility of historical veterinary sources. These collections are available for use not only by historians and researchers in South Africa but also elsewhere in Africa and the rest of the world. Important historical collections such as the Arnold Theiler collection, the Jotello F. Soga collection and collections of the Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research and the Journal of the South African Veterinary Association are highlighted. The benefits of an open access digital repository, the importance of collaboration across the veterinary community and other prerequisites for the sustainability of a digitisation project and the importance of metadata to enhance accessibility are covered.","224":null,"225":"A survey was conducted to determine the occurrence of risk factors for Toxoplasma gondii infection amongst farmers in Thika District, Kenya. Interviews were conducted in a total of 385 households using a structured questionnaire. The water consumed at household level originated from taps (74.3%), rivers or streams (15.1%), wells (5.4%) and boreholes (5.2%). A number of households (46.8%) consumed water without boiling or applying any form of treatment. All respondents washed vegetables before cooking, whilst 99.0% washed fruits before eating. Boiled milk was preferred by 99.5% of the farmers. The majority (85.2%) consumed beef more often, whilst 1.6% consumed pork. The majority (98.7%) consumed thoroughly cooked meat. Meat was preserved by 17% of farmers. Only four farmers (1.2%) who practised mixed farming used gloves when handling livestock manure. Five farmers (1.6%) reported the occurrence of abortion in ruminants and pigs on their farms within the last two years before the study. Almost half (44.9%) of the households owned cats, which were kept mainly as pets (79.8%) and for deterring rodents (20.2%). The majority of households (91.3%) fed the cats on leftovers, whilst 8.1% fed cats with raw offal. Sixteen households (9.2%) provided housing for cats. Only five households (2.8%) had litter boxes, but none of the households with litter boxes used gloves when cleaning them out. Disposal of cat faeces was done mainly by women (55.5%). Only one farmer (0.3%) had some knowledge about toxoplasmosis, but was not aware of the transmission mechanism. The study highlights the need for public health education to raise awareness of risk factors for toxoplasmosis.","226":"Certain carnivore research projects and approaches depend on successful capture of individuals of interest. The number of people present at a capture site may determine success of a capture. In this study 36 lion capture cases in the Kruger National Park were used to evaluate whether the number of people present at a capture site influenced lion response rates and whether the number of people at a sampling site influenced the time it took to process the collected samples. The analyses suggest that when nine or fewer people were present, lions appeared faster at a call-up locality compared with when there were more than nine people. The number of people, however, did not influence the time it took to process the lions. It is proposed that efficient lion capturing should spatially separate capture and processing sites and minimise the number of people at a capture site.","227":null,"228":null,"229":"Canine rabies is enzootic throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, including the Republic of South Africa. Historically, in South Africa the coastal provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape were most affected. Alarmingly, outbreaks of canine rabies have been increasingly reported in the past decade from sites where it has previously been under control. From January 2010 to December 2011, 53 animal rabies cases were confirmed; these were mostly in domestic dogs from southern Johannesburg, which was previously considered to be rabies free. In addition, one case was confirmed in a 26-month old girl who had been scratched by a pet puppy during this period. The introduction of rabies into Gauteng Province was investigated through genetic analysis of rabies positive samples confirmed during the outbreak period. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of incidental cases reported in the province for the past ten years were also included in the analysis. It was found that the recent canine rabies outbreak in the Gauteng Province came from the introduction of the rabies virus from KwaZulu-Natal, with subsequent local spread in the susceptible domestic dog population of southern Johannesburg. The vulnerability of the province was also highlighted through multiple, dead-end introductions in the past ten years. This is the first report of a rabies outbreak in the greater Johannesburg area with evidence of local transmission in the domestic dog population.","230":"The presence of bluetongue virus (BTV) in indigenous goats from the Karamoja region of northern Uganda was investigated. A total of 300 goats were sampled (serum and whole blood) from five districts within the Karamoja region. The samples were analysed for the presence of bluetongue (BT) antibodies using a commercial Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for the presence of BTV viral RNA by real-time Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), because BTV is an RNA virus. Of the 300 goats tested, 269 (90%) were positive for BTV antibodies, indicating high levels of BTV circulation within the region. Out of the 150 whole blood samples tested for the presence of the virus by real-time RT-PCR, 84 (56%) were positive for BTV RNA. This study, which is the first of its kind in Uganda, showed a high seroprevalence of BT antibodies and active circulation of BTV in a high proportion of goats in the Karamoja region.","231":"Brucellosis is an endemic disease in the animal population in Nigeria and of major public health importance, particularly amongst livestock workers who are ignorant of the risk of Brucella infection. Therefore, to gain insight into the knowledge and practices related to brucellosis transmission amongst livestock holders (LH) and livestock marketers (LM) in Yewa, an international livestock trading centre in south-western Nigeria, we conducted an interviewbased study using a cluster sampling technique. In all, a total of 157 respondents comprising 54 LH and 103 LM were interviewed. Two-thirds (69.5%) of the two groups had poor knowledge of brucellosis with no significant difference between them (p = 0.262). Furthermore, consumption of unpasteurised milk, uncooked meat and its products, co-habitation with animals, and poor hygiene were significant risk practices identified as possible means of transfer of Brucella infection from animals to humans amongst these livestock workers (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, our findings revealed that poor knowledge and practices related to the consumption of unpasteurised or unboiled dairy products, contaminated beef, and unhygienic practices are factors that will facilitate Brucella infections amongst livestock workers in Nigeria. Therefore, there is a need for more public health enlightenment programmes, as well as implementation of brucellosis control measures in the cattle populations.","232":"An adult male greyhound was diagnosed with a thyroid carcino-sarcoma by means of histopathology and positive immuno-histochemistry staining for cytokeratin and vimentin. Surgery and radiotherapy of the area were successful in local tumour control. Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended to treat and prevent further metastasis. The use of carboplatin, metronomic cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and toceranib failed to control the progression of distant metastasis. The survival time was seven months from the time of diagnosis. This is the eighth case of carcino-sarcoma of the thyroid documented in veterinary medicine and the first one treated with a multimodal approach based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As documented in human medicine, chemotherapy appeared to be ineffective to prevent or delay the progression of the metastatic disease in this case.","233":"The objective of the study was to assess pH measurements between offal organs of different species and the association between pH taken 4 h post-slaughter and different predictor variables in the liver and lungs. A linear regression analysis was conducted on selected variables to identify the main predictors and their interactions affecting the pH of meat 4 h post-slaughter. In an increasing order of magnitude during winter, the pH achieved at 16 h - 36 h post-slaughter in springbok heart, liver, spleen, kidney and lungs was significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) higher than pH 6.0. The pH attained in springbok carcasses was (p &amp;lt; 0.05) below 6.0, whilst no significant differences were observed from the regulatory reference (pH 6.0) in the heart. There was a positive association between the pH of game meat 4 h post-slaughter and liver congestion. The pH of game meat 4 h post-slaughter increased by 0.11 units (p &amp;lt; 0.05) per millilitre increase in liver congestion and decreased by 0.04 units (p&amp;lt; 0.05) per minute increase in the shooting-to-bleeding interval, irrespective of the species. The lack of a statistically significant association between some selected variables and pH changes in this study suggested that either the factors may have a small effect which is only detectable with large data-sets and\/or the effect may be modified by other unidentified factors. As some of the offal organs had final pH readings above 6.0, alternative measures are required to inactivate certain endogenous pathogens in edible wild game offal sourced from endemic areas.","234":"Laryngeal paralysis is the effect of an inability to abduct the arytenoid cartilages during inspiration, resulting in respiratory signs consistent with partial airway obstruction. The aetiology of the disease can be congenital (hereditary laryngeal paralysis or congenital polyneuropathy), or acquired (trauma, neoplasia, polyneuropathy, endocrinopathy). The most common form of acquired laryngeal paralysis (LP) is typically seen in old, large breed dogs and is a clinical manifestation of a generalised peripheral polyneuropathy recently referred to as geriatric onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy. Diagnosing LP based on clinical signs, breed and history has a very high sensitivity (90%) and can be confirmed bylaryngeal inspection. Prognosis after surgical correction depends on the aetiology: traumatic cases have a good prognosis, whereas tumour-induced or polyneuropathy-induced LP has a guarded prognosis. Acquired idiopathic LP is a slow progressive disease, with dogs reaching median survival times of 3-5 years after surgical correction.","235":"Despite the large number of collection records, there are no recent collections of ixodid ticks of this magnitude in the Waterberg area, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Free-living ticks on a commercial game farm were obtained by a total of 432 drag-samples in eight sample sites from September 2003 to August 2008. The ticks were collected to establish the difference between tick species and densities associated with acaricide-controlled (semi-intensive) and control-free areas on a game farm in the Thabazimbi District, Limpopo Province, South Africa. A total of eight tick species were collected, namely Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus, Haemaphysalis elliptica, Hyalomma rufipes, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Rhipicephalus zambeziensis and Rhipicephalus spp. The most abundant tick species collected was Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus. The difference in species and numbers reflects the effectiveness of acaricide treatment against ticks and its relevance to tick numbers on a game farm.","236":"A five-year-old male Boerboel presented for examination, collapsed for an unknown period of time. On clinical examination, multifocal subcutaneous masses and enlarged prescapular lymph nodes as well as neurological deficits that suggested a multifocal neurological syndrome were found. Fine needle aspirates of the prescapular lymph nodes revealed cells suggestive of osteosarcoma. Radiographs showed foci of mineralisation within the soft tissue masses as well as diffuse pulmonary metastasis and a caudodorsal mediastinal mass believed to be a Spirocerca lupi nodule. Computed tomography imaging, necropsy and histopathology confirmed S. lupi oesophageal neoplastic transformation (extraskeletal osteosarcoma), believed to be the primary lesion, and the majority of secondary metastasis to the brain, spine, heart, multiple muscular groups and abdominal organs. This is the first known report of extraskeletal osteosarcoma metastasis to the brain and spinal cord in a dog.","237":"The pineal glands of adult yak were studied electron microscopically. Nucleolus-like bodies (NLBs) were found mostly in the pinealocytes and the interstitial cells of the pineal glands of the yak. The NLBs were electron-dense, round or ovoid bodies with a diameter of 50 nm - 500 nm. Two types of granules were identified as melanin. These may correspond to different stages of a progressive storage of melanin. Rough endoplasmic reticula with abundant ribosomes were observed. There was no correlation between the number of NLBs and the sex of the animals.","238":"A skeletal muscle tumour (rhabdomysarcoma) was diagnosed in a 4-year-old captive female  terrestrial tortoise (Geochelone nigra) weighing 7 kg presented at the Veterinary Teaching  Hospital, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. The tumour was located at the anterior right  portion of the body and ventral to the carapace. The location of the tumour prevented the  tortoise from extending its head from the body. The tumour was a sessile, smooth white  mass, with a soft myxomatous consistency. The histological features that were diagnostic of  rhabdomyosarcoma included a sparse population of haphazardly arranged spindle-shaped  cells within a homogenous matrix (anisocytosis), occasional tumour giant and binucleate  cells, and some well differentiated myofibrils with cross striations within the cytoplasm. The  paucity of information on tumours in the land tortoise was the reason for this report, which  appears to be the first report of rhabdomyosarcoma in the tortoise.","239":null,"240":"Lung aspiration disorders in bovines are invariably diagnosed as infectious aspiration  pneumonias. There is a distinct differentiation between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration  pneumonitis in humans that can be applied to bovines. The nature and quantity of the aspirate  can result in differing pathogeneses which can require differing therapeutic approaches.  Whilst blood gases were important in detecting and prognosticating lung problems, changes  in barometric pressure with altitude have to be considered when interpreting partial pressures  of oxygen. Anatomical differences in the lungs of bovines can explain why this species is more  prone to certain pneumonic problems. Pulmonary physiotherapy is important in treating lung  disorders in humans and should be considered as an adjunct therapy in bovine respiratory  conditions. A case work-up was used to highlight some of the points discussed in this article.","241":"Accurate diagnostic approaches to differentiate peripheral nerve sheet tumours from others  have not been firmly established. The aim of this case report was to diagnose neurofibroma  using a combination of diagnostic imaging, histopathology and immunohistochemistry,  which were applied to a canine neurofibroma arising in the left mandible. The tumour was  surgically excised and examined histologically. Round or spindle cells, with elongated, dense  and homogenous chromatin and pale cytoplasm typical of Schwann cells in an abundant  fibromyxomatous stroma, with ruby collagen fibres were seen. Immunohistochemistry  demonstrated that S-100 and vimentin were more than 70% positive. Neurofibroma may  therefore be recognisable using markers such as S-100 and vimentin.","242":null,"243":"The occurrence of proventricular dilatation disease caused by avian bornavirus (ABV) in  captive psittacine birds has long been suspected in South Africa. This report documents the first  detection by polymerase chain reaction and gene sequence analyses of ABV from three clinical  cases of proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) in captive bred blue and gold macaws (Araara  rauna) resident in this country. Lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis, gastrointestinal myenteric  gangioneuritis and leiomyositis were the most prominent histopathological changes and ABV  genotype 4 was detected in tissues from all three birds. Immunohistochemical stains for ABV  antigen revealed positive labelling of neurons and glial cells of the brain, myenteric ganglia  and nerve fibres as well as smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract of all three birds.  In one bird, positive labelling of the peripheral nerves was observed. The identical sequence  of the analaysed genome fragment of all three samples, history that all of these birds had  originated from the same breeding facility, and young age at presentation raise the question  of possible vertical transmission.","244":"Ten lions (Panthera leo) that were treated with a single injection of doramectin at a dose ranging  between 0.2 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg showed clinical signs consistent with avermectin toxicity,  namely ataxia, hallucinations, and mydriasis. Two subsequently died whereas the other eight  lions recovered after 4-5 days with symptomatic therapy. Post-mortem examinations of the  two that died showed cyanosis, severe pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion, and pericardial  effusion, with histopathology not revealing any abnormalities. In both these lions, doramectin  brain and liver tissue concentrations were elevated. Although doramectin is regularly used  in wild felids, to date there have been no reports of avermectin toxicity in the literature. This  article highlights the potential for doramectin toxicity in this species.","245":"In South Africa dogs are frequently presented to veterinarians following snakebite. The  offending snakes are usually puff adders (Bitis arietans), cobras (Naja spp.) and mambas  (Dendroaspis spp.). Night adder (Causus rhombeatus) bites in dogs have not yet been reported  in South Africa. This article deals with three cases of dogs bitten by night adders in which  extensive tissue damage was noted and one fatality occurred. Night adder bites may be  indistinguishable from puff adder bites. Non-specific treatment included addressing the  hypovolaemia and swelling. Specific treatment involving immunotherapy using the South  African polyvalent antivenom would be ineffective as it does not contain immunoglobulins  against night adder venom. Veterinarians should also include night adders as the possible  cause of dogs suffering from severe and painful swellings suspected to be due to snakebites.","246":null,"247":"A 10-year-old male cross-breed dog was brought to Nihon University Animal Hospital with a  history of acute onset of paralysis in the pelvic limbs 13 days previously. Magnetic resonance  imaging revealed an intramedullary linear tract in the spinal cord at the thoracic vertebrae  12-13 region, which appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images, but was hypointense and  isointense on T1-weighted images when compared with normal parenchyma of the spinal  cord. A hemilaminectomy was performed and a blob of what appeared to be fibrous tissue  was found adhering to the surface of the  dura mater. The diameter of the blob was about  4 mm. A durotomy was performed over the affected area and chondroid material was found  within the spinal cord. Material from the nucleus pulposus penetrated the dura mater from  the ventral aspect of the spinal cord in previously reported intramedullary intervertebral disc  herniation cases, but, in this case, penetration occurred from the left ventrolateral aspect and  progressed through to the right lateral aspect, forming a visible blob of what appeared to be  fibrous tissue on the surface of the dura mater at the exit point. To the best of our knowledge,  this was the first case report of an intramedullary intervertebral disc herniation originating  from the ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord in a dog.","248":null,"249":"Necropsies were performed on 36 grower pigs that died peracutely on farms in the northern  parts of South Africa. All these pigs were suffering from haemorrhagic enteritis and suspected  toxaemia. Samples of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken for histopathological  examination and a section of ileum was collected for microbiological examination from each  animal. Histological lesions characteristic of enterotoxigenic Clostridium infection were found.  Large, Gram-positive bacilli were sometimes abundant in sections and mucosal smears of the  intestine. However, only 40% of the cultures were positive for Clostridium perfringens.","250":null,"251":"Pansteatitis was confirmed in sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell), from three main  locations within the Kruger National Park (KNP); the Olifants River Gorge, Engelhard Dam  on the Letaba River and from the Sabie River in the Sabiepoort. An increasing prevalence  of pansteatitis was observed in catfish during repeated samplings from the Olifants Gorge  from 2009 to 2011 and co-existence of old and recent lesions indicated on-going incitement  of pansteatitis. Only a low prevalence of pansteatitis was observed in catfish sampled from  the Olifants River upstream of the Gorge in the KNP and no pansteatitis was observed in  catfish sampled from a rain-filled dam not connected to the Olifants River. Common to both  the Olifants Gorge and the Sabiepoort is the damming of the rivers in Mozambique to form  lakes Massingir and Corumana respectively. Anthropogenic activities resulting in potential  pollution of the rivers differ greatly between these two catchments, providing argument  against a primary pollution-related aetiology of the pansteatitis found at these two sites.  Compared with other sites, analysis of stomach contents of catfish from the Olifants Gorge  and the Sabiepoort strongly suggested that consumption of a predominantly fish diet was  associated with the development of pansteatitis in these fish. In a farmed population of catfish  used as positive control, development of pansteatitis could be ascribed to consumption of  rancid fish waste from a trout slaughterhouse. In the Olifants Gorge, alien invasive silver  carp,  Hypophthalmychthys molitrix (Valenciennes), seasonally migrate upstream out of  Lake Massingir to spawn. This schooling species is an obligate phytoplankton feeder with  consequent high levels of adipose tissue n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the Olifants Gorge,  at least, this may explain seasonal exposure to levels of polyunsaturated fats in the diets of  catfish and crocodiles to which these animals are not adapted. The possible roles of diet,  membrane lipid composition and metabolic rate of fish, sediment pollution and seasonal drop  in environmental temperature in the pathogenesis of pansteatitis in the catfish are discussed.  Further studies are needed to verify some of these speculations.","252":"Culicoides midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), are involved in the transmission of various  pathogens that cause important diseases of livestock worldwide. The use of insect repellents  to reduce the attack rate of these insects on livestock could play an important role as part of  an integrated control programme against diseases transmitted by these midges. The objective  of this study was to determine whether high frequency sound has any repellent effect on  Culicoides midges. The number of midges collected with 220 V Onderstepoort white light  traps fitted with electronic mosquito repellents (EMRs), emitting 5-20 KHz multi-frequency  sound waves, was compared with that of two untreated traps. Treatments were rotated in two  replicates of a 4 x 4 randomised Latin square design. Although fewer midges were collected  in the two traps fitted with EMRs, the average number collected over eight consecutive nights  was not significantly different. The EMRs also had no influence on any of the physiological  groups of Culicoides imicola Kieffer or the species composition of the Culicoides population as  determined with light traps. The results indicate that high frequency sound has no repellent  effect on Culicoides midges. There is therefore no evidence to support their promotion or use  in the protection of animals against pathogens transmitted by Culicoides midges.","253":"The presence of white spots in the kidneys of cattle at slaughter (so-called white-spotted  kidneys) can be an indication of infection with Leptospira, a spirochaete of public health concern  because it causes zoonotic disease. In this study, 24 kidneys of 180 slaughtered cows (13.3%)  showed focal to multifocal white spots at inspection. These kidneys, together with matching  urine (n = 18) and blood (n = 24) samples, were examined by polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) targeting the LipL32 gene. Leptospiral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected in  19 (79.2%) out of 24 kidneys, as well as 7 (29.2%) blood and 10 (55.5%) urine samples of cows  with white spots in their kidneys. Histopathological findings revealed multifocal infiltration  of mononuclear cells, including lymphocytes and a few plasma cells in the renal interstitial  tissues. In addition, 14 apparently normal kidneys and associated urine and blood samples  were similarly examined by PCR but did not provide any positive results. In this study, high  detection of leptospirosis in kidneys with interstitial nephritis suggests that Leptospira spp.  are associated with white spotted kidneys. The present findings indicate that white spotted  kidneys can be due to leptospirosis in this region in southwestern Iran, which indicates an  increased risk of zoonotic disease. The data show that LipL32-based primers are useful for  PCR-based diagnosis of leptospirosis.","254":"In 2008, a suspected outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was reported on a farm in the  Bela-Bela area, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Seven calves died on the affected dairy  farm, where no RVF vaccination programme was practised. No apparent clinical disease was  reported in the other 300 cattle (33 calves included) or 200 sheep on the farm. During the  outbreak, blood samples from 77.7% (233\/300) of the cattle and 36.5% (73\/200) of the sheep were  collected on the affected farm and 55 blood samples were taken from cattle on a neighbouring  farm. Eight weeks later, 78% of the cattle (234\/300) and 42.5% of the sheep (85\/200) were bled  on the affected farm only. All sera were tested by an Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-capture Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an indirect Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA.  Selected IgM-positive (n = 14), IgG-positive (n = 23) and samples negative for both IgM and  IgG-specific antibodies against RVF virus (n = 19) were tested using the serum neutralisation  test (SNT). Sera from IgM-positive (n = 14) and negative (n = 20) animals were also tested by a  TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On the affected farm, 7% (16\/233) of the cattle were  IgM-positive and 13.7% (32\/233) IgG-positive at the first bleed and 2% were IgM-positive at  the second bleed, whilst the number of cattle positive for IgG-specific antibodies increased  by 21.3% compared with the first bleed. Only 1.4% of sheep were positive for both IgM and  IgG antibodies at the first collection; at the second bleed, IgM-positive cases decreased to  1.2%, whilst IgG-positive cases increased to 2.4%. Whilst no IgM-positive cattle were found  on the neighbouring farm, 5.5% of cattle were IgG-positive. The SNT confirmed most of the  ELISA results, whilst  PCR results were all negative. Although serology results indicated  virus circulation on both farms, the negative PCR results demonstrated that the animals were  not viraemic at the time they were sampled. The movement of infected mosquito vectors by  wind over long distances into a low-lying area that favoured their breeding on the Bela-Bela  farm may have led to an outbreak of the disease there, but the reason for the low level of virus  circulation amongst susceptible animals remains unclear.","255":"In late 2006 an unusual ulcerative condition in wild fish was reported for the first time in Africa  from the Chobe and upper Zambezi Rivers in Botswana and Namibia. Concern increased  with subsistence fishermen reporting large numbers of ulcerated fish in their catches. In April  2007 the condition was confirmed as an outbreak of epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS).  The causative agent, Aphanomyces invadans, is a pathogenic water mould of fish that shows  little host specificity. Ulcers follow infection of tissues by oomycete zoospores, resulting in  a granulomatous inflammation associated with invading oomycete hyphae. Granulomatous  tracts surrounding oomycete hyphae within the necrotic tissues characterise the diagnostic  histological picture. The upper Zambezi floodplain at the confluence with the Chobe River  spans the four countries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, making disease control  a challenge. The floodplain ecosystem supports a high fish diversity of around 80 species,  and is an important breeding and nursery ground. The annual cycle of flooding brings about  changes in water quality that are thought to favour the infectivity of A. invadans, with diseased  fish appearing soon after the plains become flooded. Since 2006 the disease has spread rapidly  upstream along the upper Zambezi and its tributaries. By 2010 the disease was reported from  the Okavango Delta in Botswana and in 2011 from the Western Cape Province of South Africa.  EUS has the potential to disrupt floodplain ecosystems elsewhere in Africa where high fish  diversity forms the basis of subsistence fisheries and local economies, and is a direct threat to  freshwater fish culture.","256":null,"257":"Recent outbreaks of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 2 and 8 in many European countries  provided an opportunity to investigate the possibility of improving the safety of the modified  live vaccines administered mainly in South Africa. Modified live vaccines (MLV) released at  a titre of 5 x 104 PFU\/mL, raised concerns and prompted the need to determine the minimum titre which will still be protective and also safe. The BTV serotypes 2 and 8 vaccines were  produced at the following titres: 102 PFU\/mL, 103 PFU\/mL and 104 PFU\/mL, and were injected into 24 sheep which were then monitored. Blood was collected on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 28 and 4 months post vaccination, for seroconversion and viraemia studies. These sheep were later challenged at 4 months post vaccination using BTV infected cell culture material, they were then observed and bled and again tested for viraemia. There was no viraemia post vaccination, however, a febrile reaction did occur and seroconversion was demonstrated at low titres for both BTV 2 and 8. Although viraemia was demonstrated post challenge, sheep vaccinated with the low titre BTV 2 vaccine showed more than a 90% protection index at a  lower titre of 103 PFU\/mL, compared with BTV 8 that showed a protection index above 90%  at all the titres used. It is recommended that for BTV 2 vaccine, sheep should be vaccinated at  a titre of 103 PFU\/mL and at a titre of 102 PFU\/mL with BTV 8 vaccine.","258":"The purpose of this study was to set a benchmark for a monitoring and surveillance  programme on the volumes of antimicrobials available and consumed by animals for the  benefit of animal health in South Africa. This survey was collated from data available from  2002 to 2004. The authorised antimicrobials available in South Africa were firstly reviewed.  The majority of available antimicrobials were registered under the Stock Remedies Act 36 1947.  Secondly, volumes of antimicrobials consumed were then surveyed and it was found that  the majority of consumed antimicrobials were from the macrolide and pleuromutilin classes,  followed by the tetracycline class, the sulphonamide class and lastly the penicillin class.Results showed that 68.5% of the antimicrobials surveyed were administered as in-feed  medications. 17.5% of the total volume of antimicrobials utilised were parenteral antimicrobials,  whereas antimicrobials for water medication constituted 12% of the total and 'other' dosage forms,  for example the topical and aural dosage forms, constituted 1.5% of the total. Intramammary  antimicrobials represented 0.04% of the total.  The surveillance systems for veterinary  antimicrobials used by other countries were scrutinised and compared. It was concluded that  a combination of the surveillance systems applied by Australia and the United Kingdom is the  best model (with modifications) to apply to the animal health industry in South Africa. Such  a surveillance system, of the volumes of veterinary antimicrobials consumed, should ideally  be implemented in conjunction with a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and  monitoring programme. This will generate meaningful data that will contribute to the rational  administration of antimicrobials in order to preserve the efficacy of the existing antimicrobials  in South Africa.","259":"Blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are pests in the livestock and labour-intensive farming systems  along the major rivers in South Africa. Since 1995, blackflies have been controlled in the  Orange River with the larvicide Bacillus thuringienses var. israelensis (Bti). During 2006-2007, the views of livestock farmers concerning blackfly annoyance were determined by means of questionnaires. The results of the questionnaires were substantiated by seasonal abundance  surveys of the sub-adult stages of blackflies, conducted in 2007 at 13 sites in the Orange River  and 11 sites in the Vaal River. More than half (52%) of the 39 participating farmers along  the Orange River and 79% of the 52 participating farmers along the Vaal River stated that  they experienced severe blackfly problems. The majority of farmers were unaware of the  availability of products that could be used to protect their animals against blackfly attacks  and were willing to be involved in blackfly research. High numbers of blackfly sub-adult  stages found in both rivers supported the high annoyance levels reported by the respondents.  Simulium chutteri, Simulium damnosum s.l., Simulium hargreavesi, Simulium adersi and Simulium alcocki were identified at Christiana and Delportshoop on the Vaal River, whilst S. chutteri, S. damnosum  s.l., S. adersi,  S. alcocki and Simulium gariepense were identified at Marksdrift and Ses Bridge on the Orange River. Despite the extensive control of blackflies, farmers still experience problems and this contention is supported by surveys conducted along the rivers.","260":"Urine samples can be a very useful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of animal health. In this  article, a simple technique to collect urine from the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) was described, based on a similar unpublished technique developed for the American alligator  (Alligator mississippiensis) using a canine urinary catheter. With this technique, it was possible to collect relatively clean urine samples from Nile crocodiles of different sizes using canine urinary catheters or small diameter stomach tubes. Based on the gross anatomical features  of the cloaca of the Nile crocodile, it was confirmed that urine accumulates in a chamber  consisting of the urodeum and coprodeum. Faecal material is stored temporarily in the very  short rectum, which is separated from the urinary chamber by the rectocoprodeal sphincter.","261":"This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical effects of ketamine, diazepam and a  ketamine and diazepam combination in the general anaesthesia of pigeons. Thirty-two  pigeons of both sexes with body weights ranging from 280 g to 300 g were allocated randomly  to four groups comprising eight birds each. Group D received a 0.5 mL mixture of diazepam  (0.2 mg\/kg) and normal saline, group K a 0.5 mL mixture of ketamine 5% (30 mg\/kg) and  normal saline, group D, group KD a 0.5 mL mixture of ketamine 5% (10 mg\/kg), diazepam  (0.2 mg\/kg) and normal saline, whilst group C (control) received 0.5 mL of normal saline only.  Each mixture was administered intramuscularly.Under standard operating room conditions, general anaesthesia was not observed in group  C (normal saline alone). In group D, sedation and muscle relaxation without complete loss  of consciousness was observed. Induction time of anaesthesia in group KD was significantly  quicker than group K (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Duration of anaesthesia in group KD was significantly longer than group K (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Recovery took longer in group KD in comparison with group K, but the difference was not statistically significant (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The birds in group KD were calm and sedated, with good muscle relaxation, whilst in group K the birds were excited and showed a drop in body temperature.According to the results of this study, the combination of low dose ketamine hydrochloride  (HCL) and diazepam overcame the adverse effects of ketamine alone. This combination  produced a more rapid induction of anaesthesia, as well as an increase in anaesthesia  duration, with good muscle relaxation and a smooth and slow recovery. Use of a combination  of ketamine HCL given at 10 mg\/kg and diazepam given at 0.2 mg\/kg for anaesthesia in  pigeons is therefore recommended.","262":null,"263":"The ventilatory effects of intravenous midazolam (MDZ) were evaluated in isoflurane- anaesthetised goats. Eight female goats aged 2-3 years were fasted from food and water  for 12 h. Anaesthesia was then induced using a face mask with isoflurane in oxygen, whilst  the trachea was intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube and anaesthesia maintained with  isoflurane at 1.5% end-tidal concentration. Ventilation was spontaneous. The goats were  treated with either a saline placebo (PLC) or MDZ intravenously at 0.2 mg\/kg. Analysis of  variance for repeated measures was used for the analysis of data. Significance was taken at  the 0.05 level. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant (p &amp;gt; 0.05) for tidal volume, ventilation rate, tidal volume\/kg (VT\/kg) and end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure. Within treatments, VT and VT\/kg differed 5 min after MDZ administration; this was statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The occurrence of apnoea in the MDZ-treated goats was statistically significant (p = 0.04) compared with the PLC treated goats. Intravenous MDZ at 0.2 mg\/kg administered to isoflurane-anaesthetised goats may result in transient apnoea and a mild decrease in VT and VT\/kg.","264":null,"265":"In the early colonial history of South Africa, horses played an important role, both in general  transportation and in military operations. Frequent epidemics of African horsesickness (AHS)  in the 18th century therefore severely affected the economy. The first scientific research on the  disease was carried out by Alexander Edington (1892), the first government bacteriologist of  the Cape Colony, who resolved the existing confusion that reigned and established its identity  as a separate disease. Bluetongue (BT) was described for the first time by Duncan Hutcheon in  1880, although it was probably always endemic in wild ruminants and only became a problem  when highly susceptible Merino sheep were introduced to the Cape in the late 18th century.  The filterability of the AHS virus (AHSV) was demonstrated in 1900 by M'Fadyean in London,  and that of the BT virus (BTV) in 1905 by Theiler at Onderstepoort, thus proving the viral  nature of both agents. Theiler developed the first vaccines for both diseases at Onderstepoort.  Both vaccines consisted of infective blood followed by hyper-immune serum, and were  used for many years. Subsequent breakthroughs include the adaptation to propagation and  attenuation in embryonated eggs in the case of BTV and in mouse brains for AHSV. This  was followed by the discovery of multiple serotypes of both viruses, the transmission of  both by Culicoides midges and their eventual replication in cell cultures. Molecular studies  led to the discovery of the segmented double-stranded RNA genomes, thus proving their  genetic relationship and leading to their classification in a genus called Orbivirus.  Further  work included the molecular cloning of the genes of all the serotypes of both viruses and  clarification of their relationship to the viral proteins, which led to much improved diagnostic  techniques and eventually to the development of a recombinant vaccine, which unfortunately  has so far been unsuitable for mass production.","266":"The reason or reasons why it took Sir Arnold Theiler so many years to unravel the riddle of  the aetiology of lamsiekte in cattle and whether P.R. Viljoen's lifelong grudge for receiving  insufficient credit from Theiler for his research contribution was justified are analysed in this  paper. By 1912, Theiler knew that Duncan Hutcheon had advocated the use of bonemeal as  a prophylactic against the disease in the early 1880s. Hutcheon's colleague, J.D. Borthwick,  had shown conclusively in a field experiment in 1895 that lamsiekte did not occur in cattle  fed a liberal allowance of bonemeal; and bone-craving had been identified by Hutcheon and  several farmers as being associated with the occurrence of the disease (a 'premonitory' sign).  Hutcheon regarded a phosphate deficiency of the pastures as the direct cause of lamsiekte.  However, Theiler did not accept this, was convinced that intoxication was involved and  developed a 'grass toxin' theory. Viljoen (1918) also latched onto the grass toxin theory.  He did not believe that osteophagia existed, stating categorically that he had not observed  it on the experimental farm Armoedsvlakte where &amp;gt; 100 cases of lamsiekte had occurred  during the &amp;gt; 3 years that he spent there. Moreover, he did not believe in the prophylactic  value of bonemeal. However, careful analysis of a subsequent publication, of which he was a  co-author, revealed that in late 1918 and early 1919 he reproduced the disease by drenching  cattle with blowfly pupae and larvae as well as with crushed bones from decomposing bovine  carcasses. For this breakthrough he did not get proper credit from Theiler. Reappointed to  study lamsiekte on Armoedsvlakte in the autumn of 1919, Theiler, probably already aware  that the toxin he was seeking was in the decomposing bones or carcass material rather than  the grass, deliberately 'walked with the cattle' on the farm to encounter a classic manifestation  of bone-craving (osteophagia). The penny then immediately dropped. Theiler, actually  rationalising an hypothesis that was about four decades old, did so with a vengeance. Within  less than two years he had reproduced lamsiekte by exposing cattle with natural bone-craving  to rotten carcass material, had chemical proof that the grazing was phosphorus-deficient, had  developed a satisfactory bonemeal prophylactic dosage programme, and the bacterial toxin  concerned - perhaps the trickiest contribution - had been produced in culture. Hence the table  was set for the later development of an excellent lamsiekte vaccine.","267":"Until the middle of the 19th century, very few references exist regarding the occurrence of  animal diseases in Namibia. With the introduction of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia  (CBPP) in 1859, this picture changed completely and livestock owners implemented various  forms of disease control in an effort to contain the spread of this disease and minimise its  devastating effects. After the establishment of the colonial administration in 1884, the first  animal disease legislation was introduced in 1887 and the first veterinarian, Dr Wilhelm  Rickmann, arrived in 1894. CBPP and the outbreak of rinderpest in 1897 necessitated a  greatly expanded veterinary infrastructure and the first veterinary laboratory was erected at  Gammams near Windhoek in 1897. To prevent the spread of rinderpest, a veterinary cordon  line was established, which was the very beginning of the Veterinary Cordon Fence as it is  known today. After the First World War, a small but dedicated corps of veterinarians again  built up an efficient animal health service in the following decades, with veterinary private  practice developing from the mid-1950s. The veterinary profession organised itself in 1947  in the form of a veterinary association and, in 1984, legislation was passed to regulate the  veterinary profession by the establishment of the Veterinary Council of Namibia. The outbreak  of foot and mouth disease in 1961 was instrumental in the creation of an effective veterinary  service, meeting international veterinary standards of quality and performance which are still  maintained today.","268":null,"269":"This study was designed to investigate the effects of prolonged oral administration of calcium hypochlorite in the drinking water of commercial cockerels. It was carried out in order to ascertain probable toxicity associated with prolonged exposure to calcium hypochlorite. Thirty-two healthy birds were used; they were grouped into four groups of eight. Group 1, which served as the control, received 10 mL\/kg body weight of physiological saline. Groups 2, 3 and 4 received 0.0375 g, 0.375 g and 0.75 g of calcium hypochlorite per 10 litres of drinking water for six weeks respectively. Six weeks after the administration of calcium hypochlorite, blood was collected from the jugular vein to assess liver function, lipid profiles and for markers of oxidative stress. The results revealed a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) increase in alanine aminotransferase activity in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the control. Also, there was a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity. Similarly, there was a significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) increase in total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels compared with the control. There was a significant increase in malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide generation with a concomitant significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) decrease in serum glutathione level in a dose-dependent manner when compared with the control. In this study, calcium hypochloriteinduced hepatic damage via oxidative stress and decrease in antioxidant defense system was found. Therefore, prolonged exposure of chickens to calcium hypochlorite is potentially harmful. ","270":"Careful assessment of nutritional needs of dogs and cats must be taken into consideration in order to maintain optimum health, be part of a treatment regimen for a diseased state, or to maximise the quality of life in all animals. Therefore, the goal of these WSAVA Guidelines is that a nutritional assessment and specific nutritional recommendation be made on every patient on every visit. This will become known as the 5th Vital Assessment (5VA), following the four vital assessments of temperature, pulse, respiration and pain that are already addressed on each patient interaction. Routinely doing a brief screening evaluation of the nutritional status during history taking and the physical examination can be seamlessly performed as part of every patient exam. Nutrition-related risk factors that can be easily identified from the history and physical examination include age (growing or old), suboptimal body condition score (overweight or thin), muscle loss, atypical or homemade diet, medical conditions, or changes in appetite. An extended evaluation would follow, if one or more risk factors is identified on screening. These guidelines provide criteria to evaluate the animal and the diet, as well as key feeding and environmental factors. In addition, recommendations for interpretation, analysis, and action are included so that a plan for optimising the animal's nutritional status can be instituted. Client compliance with nutritional recommendations requires input from the veterinarian, veterinary technicians\/nurses, and the hospital staff. A team approach to continuous nutritional education, implementation of appropriate protocols, and focused client communication, utilising these WSAVA Nutritional Guidelines, are key components to reach this 5VA goal.","271":"Rabies is caused by several Lyssavirus species, a group of negative sense RNA viruses. Although rabies is preventable, it is often neglected particularly in developing countries in the face of many competing public and veterinary health priorities. Epidemiological information based on laboratory-based surveillance data is critical to adequately strategise control and prevention plans. In this regard the fluorescent antibody test for rabies virus antigen in brain tissues is still considered the basic requirement for laboratory confirmation of animal cases. Occasionally brain tissues from suspected rabid animals are still submitted in formalin, although this has been discouraged for a number of years. Immunohistochemical testing or a modified fluorescent antibody technique can be performed on such samples. However, this method is cumbersome and cannot distinguish between different Lyssavirus species. Owing to RNA degradation in formalin-fixed tissues, conventional RT-PCR methodologies have also been proven to be unreliable. This report is concerned with a rabies case in a domestic dog from an area in South Africa where rabies is not common. Typing of the virus involved was therefore important, but the only available sample was submitted as a formalin-fixed specimen. A real-time RT-PCR method was therefore applied and it was possible to confirm rabies and obtain phylogenetic information that indicated a close relationship between this virus and the canid rabies virus variants from another province (KwaZulu-Natal) in South Africa.","272":"Zoo animals, including tigers, have been reported to suffer from barbiturate intoxication, with pentabarbitone being most commonly recorded. Clinical signs range from mild ataxia to general anaesthesia with recovery over hours to days with several factors affecting hepatic barbiturate metabolism and tissue partitioning. Botulism is an often fatal intoxication in man, animals, birds and certain fish. The occurrence in carnivores is uncommon to rare, with only 2 reports found of botulism in felids. This report relates to 3 adult captive cohabiting tigers that simultaneously developed signs of abdominal discomfort, progressive ataxia, recumbency and comatose sleep resembling stage 2 anaesthesia, alternating with periods of distracted wakefulness and ataxic movements. These signs occurred 4 days after being fed the carcass of a horse that had ostensibly died of colic and not been euthanased. The male tiger that was the dominant animal in the feeding hierarchy was worst affected and had to be given intravenous fluids. The female that was lowest in hierarchy was unaffected. After 48-72 hours of treatment at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital the females could eat and made an uneventful recovery. The male tiger showed partial recovery but died during the night a few hours after drinking water on his return to the owner. Necropsy revealed severe oesophageal dilation and impaction with decaying grass; some of this material and water were present in the pharynx and trachea, and had been aspirated causing acute widespread bronchopneumonia. Colon content tested negative for common pesticides but, together with liver, tested positive for barbiturate. Serum taken on the day of admission had tested negative for barbiturate and the residual serum from the 3 animals later tested negative for botulinum toxin. Colon and oesophageal content from the male at necropsy were positive for Clostridium botulinum toxin type C by the mouse bioassay neutralisation test, confirming that this male had had concomitant barbiturate toxicity and botulism, and had succumbed to aspiration bronchopneumonia secondary to pharyngeal, laryngeal and oesophageal paralysis and oesophageal","273":"A 7-year-old female beagle was evaluated for symptomatic hypercalcaemia and primary hypothyroidism. Clinical findings were typical for hypothyroidism. Plasma parathyroid hormone was low and obvious causes for the hypercalcaemia were ruled out by means of abdominal ultrasonography, ultrasonography of the parathyroid glands, survey thoracic radiographs, and fine needle aspirate cytology of the spleen, liver, and peripheral lymph nodes. Treatment with thyroxine resulted in resolution of the hypercalcaemia after approximately 9 weeks of therapy. This is the 1st report of primary adult-onset hypothyroidism associated with symptomatic hypercalcaemia in a dog.","274":"A 3-month-old female German Shepherd puppy was presented for routine vaccination. Clinical evaluation revealed a grade 5\/6 continuous murmur with the point of maximal intensity over the left 4th intercostal space. Echocardiography revealed a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The PDA was closed by a team of general practitioners using the Jackson-Henderson technique, via a standard 4th intercostal thoracotomy. A multi-modal approach to analgesia and premedication was employed. A successful outcome was achieved with no murmur or evidence of cardiac disease present 6 months after surgical occlusion. The literature is reviewed with an emphasis placed on choosing techniques that are appropriate to the level of expertise of the surgical and anaesthetic teams, as well as the surgical facilities available.","275":"The treatment rationale for dogs poisoned by aldicarb is reviewed from a pharmacological perspective. The illegal use of aldicarb to maliciously poison dogs is a major problem in some parts of the world. In South Africa, it is probably the most common canine poisoning treated by companion animal veterinarians. Aldicarb poisoning is an emergency and veterinarians need to be able to diagnose it and start with effective treatment immediately to ensure a reasonable prognosis. Successful treatment depends on the timely use of an anti-muscarinic drug (e.g. atropine). Additional supportive treatment options, including fluid therapy, diphenhydramine, benzodiazepines and the prevention of further absorption (activated charcoal) should also be considered. Possible complications after treatment are also briefly discussed.","276":"An outbreak of necrotic dermatitis in sheep was intensively investigated. Initially 19 of 147 Letelle (Merino-type) ewes were identified but closer inspection revealed 57 sheep that had skin lesions, some very slight, and that the majority (46 or 80%) had lesions only above the lips. A small number of them had multiple lesions on the legs or vulvae apart from lip lesions. Seven had only vulvar lesions and 2 only leg lesions. Among the sheep with lip lesions, twice as many had lesions on the right as on the left. Electron micrographs did not reveal any virus particles from the lesions, but all bacterial swabs yielded pure cultures of beta-haemolytic, Gram-positive cocci that were catalase, coagulase and DNase positive. The organism was identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Histopathology was consistent with a dermotoxic insult. A review of available literature indicated that this outbreak was consistent with a diagnosis of ovine necrotic (staphylococcal) dermatitis, supported by data on signalment, lesions, distribution, size, number, epidemiology as well as specific tests. The range of differential diagnoses and possible confusers are discussed.","277":"In order to assess the level of Rhodococcus equi infection in southeast Turkey, 679 sera from healthy foals and adult horses and 78 sera from donkeys were tested by indirect ELISA using a R. equi reference strain (ATCC 33701) as antigen. Eighty (11.7%) sera from horses and 9 (11.5%) sera from donkeys with titres &gt;0.85 were positive. The prevalence of seropositive horses in Sanliurfa Province was higher than in Diyarbakir Province; 56 (13.9%) horses in Sanliurfa Province and 24 (8.7%) horses in Diyarbakir Province were defined as seropositive. In Sanliurfa Province 14.5% of female (n=343) and 10.1% of male (n = 59) horses tested were defined as seropositive, while in Diyarbakir Province more males (11.4%, n=114) were seropositive than females (6.7%, n=163). Horses 1 to 5 years of age were found to have the highest seropositivity rate in both provinces. A total of 78 sera from donkeys were investigated in Sanliurfa Province, of which 9 (11.5%) were positive by ELISA. Among the 9 positive sera, 6 (12.8%) were from donkeys 1-5 years old and 3 (13.6%) were from donkeys &gt;5 years of age. No positive sera were found in donkeys less than 1 year old. Five (12.5%) sera of females and 4 (10.5%) sera of males tested were positive. These results indicate the existence of R. equi in the horse populations in Sanliurfa and Diyarbakir Provinces. Similar infection rates were found for donkeys in Sanliurfa. This suggests the importance of serological surveys to diagnose R. equi infection in the region and to prevent the zoonotic risk.","278":"The aim of this work was to determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) ceftazidime administered to lactating (LTG; n=6) and non-lactating (NLTG; n=6) healthy Creole goats in 2 trials (T1 and T2). During T1 and T2, goats randomly received a single dose of i.m. or i.v. ceftazidime (10 mg\/kg). Serum concentration of iv ceftazidime in NLTG and LTG goats is best described by 2 and 3 compartment models, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters of iv and im ceftazidime administered to LTG and NLTG showed statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in the constants (lamda(z), T1 vs. T2 [i.v.] 0.5 +\/- 0.1 vs. 0.3 +\/- 0.1\/h; T1 vs. T2 [i.m.] 0.5 +\/- 0.2 vs. 0.3 +\/- 0.1\/h) and in the mean times (t(1\/2), T1 vs. T2 [i.v.] 1.6 +\/- 0.3 vs. 2.3 +\/- 0.6 h; T1 vs. T2 [i.m.] 1.6 +\/- 0.7 vs. 2.6 +\/- 0.9 h) of elimination. The bioavailability of ceftazidime in LTG and NLTG was 113.0 +\/- 17.8 and 96.0 +\/- 18.0%, respectively. Ceftazidime concentration in milk at 2 h was: i.v. = 1.9 +\/- 0.2 and i.m. = 2.4 +\/- 0.5 microg\/ml; the penetration in milk was i.v. = 18.3 +\/- 13.5 and im = 14.3 +\/- 10.6%. Ninety-six hours after i.v. and i.m. administration, residues of the drug were not found in milk. In conclusion, ceftazidime, when administered to goats, showed high concentration times in serum, good penetration into milk and a bioavailability that makes it suitable to be used by the i.m. route.","279":"Two hundred and thirty-nine cattle from Gauteng Province in South Africa were tested for various pathogens causing reproductive diseases includingbovine viral diarrhoea\/mucosal disease (BVD\/MD) virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis\/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR\/IPV) virus, Neospora caninum and Brucella abortus usingvarious tests. For BVD\/MD virus, 49.37% tested positive, 74.47% for IBR\/IPV virus, 8.96% for Neospora caninum and 3.8% for Brucella abortus. The result for Brucella abortus is higher than the national average, possibly due to the small sample size. A high seroprevalence of antibodies to both BVD\/MD virus and IBR\/IPV virus was evident. These 2 viruses should be considered, in addition to Brucella abortus, when trying to establish causes of abortion in cattle. The clinical significance of Neospora caninum as a cause of abortion in Gauteng needs further investigation. One hundred and forty-three bulls were tested for Campylobacter fetus and Trichomonas fetus, and a low prevalence of 1.4% and 2.1% respectively was found in this study. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","280":"A confirmed case of human brucellosis motivated an investigation into the potential source of infection in Namibia. Since domestic animals are principal sources of Brucella infection in humans, 1692 serum samples were screened from sheep, goats and cattle from 4 presumably at-risk farms and 900 springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) serum samples from 29 mixed farming units for Brucella antibodies by the Rose-Bengal test (RBT) and positive cases confirmed by complement fixation test (CFT). To assess the prevalence of human brucellosis, 137 abattoir employees were tested for Brucella antibodies using the standard tube agglutination test (STAT) and by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cattle and sheep from all 4 farms were negative by RBT and CFT but 2 of the 4 farms (Ba and C) had 26\/42 and 12\/285 seropositive goats, respectively. Post mortem examination of seropositive goats revealed no gross pathological lesions typical of brucellosis except enlarged mesenteric and iliac lymph nodes seen in a single buck. Culture for brucellae from organs of seropositive animals was negative. None of the wildlife sera tested positive by either RBT or CFT. Interviews revealed that besides the case that prompted the investigation, a family and another person from other farms with confirmed brucellosis shared a common history of consumption of unpasteurised goat milk, home-made goat cheese and coffee with raw milk and prior contact with goats, suggesting goats as the likely source of infection. All 137 abattoir employees tested negative by STAT, but 3 were positive by ELISA. The 3 abattoir workers were clinically normal and lacked historical connections with clinical cases. Although goats are often associated with B. melitensis, these studies could not explicitly implicate this species owing to cross-reactivity with B. abortus, which can also infect goats. Nevertheless, these data reinforce the need for a better National Control Programme for brucellosis in Namibia.","281":"This study involves the evaluation of pre-purchase radiographic studies of South African Thoroughbred yearlings. Radiographic changes were recorded and compared with similar international studies. The study differs from other studies in that a lower prevalence of pedal osteitis (1.26%), dorsal osteochondral fragmentation of the metatarsophalangeal joint (1.60%), distal metacarpal sagittal ridge changes (15.7%), ulnar carpal bone lucencies (8.33%), carpal osteophytes (1.19%), distal intertarsal and tarsometatarsal joint radiographic changes (9.92%), tarsal osteochondrosis lesions (4.40%) and stifle osteochondrosis lesions (0.4%) was found. The prevalence of dorsal osteochondral fragments in the metacarpophalangeal joint was similar to other studies (1.60%). A higher prevalence of vascular channels as well as irregular borders and lucencies was evident in the proximal sesamoid bones. There was a higher prevalence of palmar metacarpophalangeal and plantar metatarsophalangeal osteochondral fragments (2% and 7.10% respectively). Palmar metacarpal disease, metacarpal supracondylar lysis, proximal sesamoid bone fractures and carpal osteochondral fragmentation were absent in the current study. Additional findings recorded in the current study were proximal interphalangeal joint hyperextension (left front 15.13%, right front 18.91%), the solar angle (right front 2.38 degrees, left front 2.79 degrees), the prevalence of carpal bone 1 (30.95%) and carpal bone 5 (1.59%). Management, nutrition and genetics in the various groups of Thoroughbred yearlings should be further investigated in order to explain the reasons for the differences recorded in the current study.","282":"Concise descriptions are given of the life histories of the 10 members of the classes of 1938 and 1939. All of them initially joined the government service, Hugo, Steenekamp and Schatz spending their entire careers in the South African Veterinary (Field) Services. Mansvelt, the first recipient of the much-coveted Theiler medal, was the 2nd veterinarian to be appointed Director of Veterinary Services, a position specially created for the 'Field' in 1962. Having first established a successful private practice, Hofmeyr was appointed as the 1st full-time professor of surgery of the Onderstepoort Faculty in 1958 and its 1st full-time Dean in 1976. Albertyn opted for a career in public health, becoming director of 1 of the largest local municipal abattoirs. Turner spent virtually his entire career in private practice and was eventually joined by Brown who had served in the British Colonial Veterinary Service for many years. Fick was a government veterinarian for his entire career, first in South Africa, then in the British Colonial Service (for 13 years) and finally returning to South Africa. Like Hugo, Muller filled a senior position in veterinary (field) services before he opted for a farming career.","283":"The history of sheep scab is briefly discussed since it was first mentioned in 180 BC. It was probably introduced to South Africa by the early settlers and was mentioned as a problem by Simon van der Stel, although its cause was only discovered in 1809. Various measures taken over the centuries to control or eradicate the disease, which has always been of considerable economic importance, are discussed, as well as the failures and reasons why it is still with us today.","284":"Uterine torsion is a twisting of the uterus or uterine horn perpendicular to its long axis. We report a case of uterine torsion in an adult breeding Sprague Dawley rat. The rat died a month after her last recorded delivery. Post mortem examination of the rat revealed 270 degrees torsion of the right uterine horn. The uterus contained a single foetus. The liver was pale and enlarged. The rest of the viscera appeared normal. Histopathological examination showed acute hepatic necrosis and pulmonary congestion with mild lymphocytic infiltrates peribronchially. The acute hepatic necrosis may have been associated with septicaemia due to compromised blood vessels following the uterine torsion. The presence of a single foetus could have resulted in foeto-maternal disproportion with resultant uterine torsion. Torsion of the uterus can be accompanied by haemostatic and metabolic complications, which could have caused the death of the rat. Although uterine torsion is a rare condition in rats, it should be considered as a potential complication of gestation in animal breeding units.","285":"Clinical disease resulting from the vertical transmission of Anaplasma marginale has only been reported on 5 occasions despite studies demonstrating successful in utero transmission. During the reported experimental induction of congenital anaplasmosis in calves, the outcome was variable but mostly led to inapparent or mild infection. There are previous case reports of fatal congenital anaplasmosis following natural infection. The clinical findings in a 2-day-old calf presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital with clinical signs of congenital anaplasmosis, which was unresponsive to treatment, are described. Subsequent post mortem diagnostic tests revealed that this calf was co-infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). It is postulated that immunosuppression resulting from BVDV infection predisposed to severe, fatal anaplasmosis in this calf.","286":"Rabbits obtained from a South African rabbit breeder exhibited deformities of the distal forelimbs. The clinical, radiological and histological presentation of mid-antebrachial valgus formation (a.k.a distal foreleg curvature) in these rabbits was consistent with an autosomal recessive trait associated with a chondrodystrophic lesion of the distal ulna epiphysis 1st described in the 1960s. The impact this might have on South African farming enterprises and laboratory facilities has not been established, but the heritability and welfare implications of this condition make it a concern. Mildly affected animals can adapt to the deformity with some housing adjustments, but severely affected animals may require humane euthanasia.","287":"The health and quality compliance of game carcasses (n = 295) intended for the South African export market and aspiring to comply with the strict hygiene requirements of the European Union were compared with game carcasses (n = 330) available for the local market and currently not subjected to meat safety legislation. Samples were collected in similar seasons and geographical areas in South Africa from 2006 to 2009. Aerobic plate counts (APC) of the heart blood verified that both groups possessed similar ante mortem bacterial status. For health compliance APC, tests for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were performed on the carcasses. Surfaces of the local carcasses were swabbed using the European Enviro-biotrace sponge technique at 3 and 72 h post mortem. Unskinned but eviscerated export carcasses in the abattoir were skinned and sampled by incision using a corkborer 72 h post mortem. Temperature and pH readings were recorded at 3 and 72 h post mortem from the longissimus dorsi muscle and the readings at 3 h differed (P = 0.035). Temperatures at 72 h were lower for export than local carcasses (P &lt; 0.001) because of earlier introduction and maintenance of the cold chain. The pH readings also differed between groups at 3 and 72 h (P &lt; 0.001). APC results for the local group exceeded the maximum permissible count (&lt; 10(5)). S. aureus results showed differences (P &lt; 0.001), with readings from the local group being higher. The same tendency was exhibited for E. coli (P = 0.008). Imposition of hygiene guidelines for game ranchers producing meat for the local market is therefore recommended.","288":"A pilot survey was conducted in 2 districts in Mozambique to determine the most important health problems facing smallholder pig producers. While African swine fever is the most serious disease that affects pigs at all levels of production in Mozambique, it is likely that productivity is reduced by the presence of mange and gastrointestinal parasites, while in traditional systems the conditions are favourable for the development of porcine cysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, which poses a health risk to communities. Results of the pilot survey confirmed that, with the exception of African swine fever, ecto- and endoparasites are probably the most important health risks for producers. Porcine cysticercosis is more prevalent among pigs in traditional, free-ranging systems, while mange becomes a serious factor when pigs are permanently confined.","289":"Complications related to extraluminal migration of ingested kebab (sosatie) sticks are infrequently diagnosed in small animals. A total of 8 cases diagnosed with extragastric migration of ingested kebab sticks were retrospectively evaluated. No significant breed or sex predilection was found but there was a tendency for animals to present at a younger age (less than 3 years). Clinical signs (of variable duration) were non-specific and included haemoptysis, abdominal pain, regurgitation, subcutaneous abscessation and chronic draining sinus tracts, making a clinical diagnosis difficult. Ultrasonography proved invaluable in facilitating the diagnosis of kebab stick migration in 6 of the cases and computed tomography unexpectedly identified a kebab stick that had migrated into the thorax in 1 patient. Survey radiography was generally found to be insensitive in identifying the kebab sticks. The aim of this article is to alert veterinarians to a clinical syndrome that may not be considered a differential diagnosis in patients with non-specific inflammatory disease of the thorax, abdomen or pelvic regions and to illustrate the usefulness of the various diagnostic imaging modalities in facilitating a diagnosis of kebab stick ingestion and its possible secondary complications.","290":"The objective of this study was to conduct a preliminary survey of diseases that might be present in the wild Nile crocodile population in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Blood samples were collected from crocodiles ranging in size from 34.0 cm to 463.0 cm total length. Samples were examined for blood parasites and underwent a haematological analysis. Before release the crocodiles were examined for various clinical abnormalities. Of the 144 crocodiles examined, none were visibly sick or displayed any signs of disease. No antibodies to Mycoplasma crocodyli were detected. Hepatozoon pettiti was present in 55.3% of blood smears examined, but there was no significant difference in any of the haematological values between the infected and uninfected crocodiles, and a high prevalence of Hepatozoon infection is not uncommon in other species. Only 7.6% of the examined crocodiles were infested with leeches. Further research is required for several of the crocodilian diseases, in particular to elucidate the role of wild crocodilians as reservoirs of infection.","291":"In this study, the spinal nerves that constitute the lumbosacral plexus (plexus lumbosacrales) (LSP) and its distribution in Chinchilla lanigera were investigated. Ten chinchillas (6 males and 4 females) were used in this research. The spinal nerves that constitute the LSP were dissected and the distribution of pelvic limb nerves originating from the plexus was examined. The iliohypogastric nerve arose from L1 and L2, giving rise to the cranial and caudal nerves, and the ilioinguinal nerve arose from L3. The other branch of L3 gave rise to the genitofemoral nerve and 1 branch from L4 gave rise to the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve. The trunk formed by the union of L4-5 divided into medial (femoral nerve) and lateral branches (obturator nerve). It was found that the LSP was formed by all the ventral branches of L4 at L6 and S1 at S3. At the caudal part of the plexus, a thick branch, the ischiadic plexus, was formed by contributions from L5-6 and S1. This root gave rise to the nerve branches which were disseminated to the posterior limb (cranial and caudal gluteal nerves, caudal cutaneous femoral nerve and ischiadic nerve). The ischiadic nerve divided into the caudal cutaneous surae, lateral cutaneous surae, common fibular and tibial nerve. The pudendal nerve arose from S1-2 and the other branch of S2 and S3 formed the rectal caudal nerve. The results showed that the origins and distribution of spinal nerves that constitute the LSP of chinchillas were similar to those of a few rodents and other mammals.","292":"Toxicity in cattle by the shrub Nolletia gariepina was induced experimentally by intraruminal administration of 3 g\/kg dried, milled plant material as a single dose. The animals had to be starved for 24 hours before dosing, as dosing on a full rumen did not induce any signs of toxicity during 5 days of observation and clinical pathology monitoring. Clinical signs were not specific and varied according to the duration (acute versus subacute) of the toxicological process. Clinical pathological parameters indicated renal and to a lesser extent hepatic damage, with raised serum concentrations of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Increased urinary sodium and potassium concentration and GGT activity, as well as proteinuria, were evident. Histological and electron microscopic examinations revealed acute renal tubular epithelial cell degeneration and necrosis, especially of the proximal convoluted tubules. Mild hepatocellular degeneration was also noticeable.","293":"This prospective longitudinal study investigated the progression of haematological changes in 32 transfused and 54 non-transfused dogs naturally infected with Babesia rossi over the 1st 6 days following diagnosis and treatment. The effect of patient age on the results of complete blood counts was determined. Haematology data were analysed at presentation and at 24 hours, 3 days and 6 days after presentation. Dogs were treated with diminazene aceturate at diagnosis and a blood transfusion was given if deemed clinically required. Mildly to moderately regenerative normocytic normochromic anaemia was observed in all dogs throughout the study period. Transfused dogs more often had an inflammatory leukogram at presentation and at 24 hours, than dogs that were not transfused. In dogs with a left shift, a concurrent normal or decreased segmented neutrophil count was found more commonly than neutrophilia. Severe thrombocytopenia that resolved within a week was common. Blood transfusion alleviated the anaemia, but had no significant effect on white blood cell or platelet responses. Blood cell responses were not significantly influenced by age. In conclusion, the red blood cell and white blood cell responses were less than expected in dogs with babesiosis, given the degree of anaemia and inflammation present. The magnitude of thrombocytopenia and rapid return of the platelet count to normal suggested a possible immune-mediated mechanism for the thrombocytopenia.","294":"Yellow tulp (Moraea pallida Bak.), collected predominantly during the flowering stage from a number of sites in South Africa, showed large variation in digoxin equivalent values, indicating variability in yellow tulp toxicity. Very low values were recorded for tulp collected from certain sites in the Northern Cape.","295":"Three clinically healthy Labrador puppies developed ataxia, hypermetria and convulsions shortly after eating the burnt crust of maize porridge. Two of the puppies died. Acrylamide toxicity was considered based on the history of all 3 puppies developing nervous signs after being exposed to a starch-based foodstuff that was subjected to high temperature during preparation. Acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity is thought to partially result from a distal axonopathy.","296":"A 4-year-old, 1.8 kg, male, castrated Maltese was presented for evaluation of urolithiasis. Urinary calculi were composed of ammonium biurate. Preprandial and postprandial bile acids were 44.2 and 187.3 micromol\/l, respectively (reference ranges 0-10 and 0-20 micromol\/l, respectively). Single-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) with volume-rendered imaging (VRI) was obtained. VRI revealed a portocaval shunt originating just cranial to a tributary of the gastroduodenal vein and draining into the caudal vena cava at the level of the epiploic foramen. CTA revealed a 3.66 mm-diameter shunt measured at the level of the termination of the shunt and a 3.79 mm-diameter portal vein measured at the level between the origin of the shunt and the porta of the liver. Surgery was performed using cellophane banding without attenuation. Follow-up single-phase CTA with VRI was obtained 10 weeks after surgery. VRI revealed no evidence of portosystemic communication on the level of a cellophane band and caudal to the cellophane band. CTA demonstrated an increased portal vein diameter (3.79-5.27 mm) measured at the level between the origin of the shunt and the porta of the liver. Preprandial and postprandial bile acids were 25 and 12.5 micromol\/l, respectively (aforementioned respective reference ranges), 3 months post-surgery. No problems were evident at 6 months.","297":"Cystic renal disease is rare in dogs and although infected renal cysts have been reported in humans, no report could be found in dogs. A 58 kg, 5-year-old, castrated, male Boerboel presented with weight loss, pyrexia, lethargy and vomiting, 20 months after an incident of haematuria was reported. The initial ultrasonographic diagnosis was bilateral multiple renal cysts of unknown aetiology. The cysts had significantly increased in size over the 20-month period and some contained echogenic specks which could be related to infection, normal cellular debris or haemorrhage. In both kidneys the renal contours were distorted (the left more than the right). The abnormal shape of the left kidney was largely due to multiple cysts and a large crescent-shaped septate mass on the cranial pole of the kidney. Aspirates of the septate mass were performed (left kidney) and the cytology and culture were indicative of an abscess. It is suggested that the previous incident of haematuria provided a portal of entry for bacteria into the cysts resulting in renal cortical abscess formation.","298":"Putative Nicotiana glauca (wild tobacco) poisoning was diagnosed in a flock of ostriches near Oudtshoorn, South Africa. Post mortem examinations (n = 7) were performed on ostriches (Struthio camelus) that had died. Suspicious leaf remnants (weighing 80-770 g), packed in a layer on top of other plant material, were carefully separated from the proventricular content and submitted for chemical determination of anabasine, the major toxic principle contained by this plant. A standard solid phase extraction method was used followed by an optimised liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry procedure. Anabasine was detected in the leaf remnants (114-177 microg\/g dry weight) removed from the proventriculus of the ostriches that succumbed as well as in control N. glauca leaves (193 microg\/g dry weight). The analytical methods used in this study revealed the presence of anabasine in the suspicious leaf remnants, indicating that the birds had been exposed to N. glauca and had died of this poisoning.","299":null,"300":"Skin lesions associated with papillomaviruses have been reported in many animal species and man. Bovine papillomavirus (BVP) affects mainly the epidermis, but also the dermis in several species including bovine, the best-known example being equine sarcoid, which is associated with BVP types 1 and 2. This publication describes and illustrates the macroscopic and histological appearance of BPV-associated papillomatous, fibropapillomatous or sarcoid-like lesions in Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) from the Gariep Dam Nature Reserve, 2 giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) from the Kruger National Park, and a sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) from the Kimberley area of South Africa. An African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) cow from Kruger National Park also had papillomatous lesions but molecular characterisation of lesional virus was not done. Immunohistochemical staining using polyclonal rabbit antiserum to chemically disrupted BPV-1, which cross-reacts with the L1 capsid of most known papillomaviruses, was positive in cells of the stratum granulosum of lesions in Giraffe 1, the sable and the buffalo and negative in those of the zebra and Giraffe 2. Fibropapillomatous and sarcoid-like lesions from an adult bovine were used as positive control for the immunohistochemistry and are described and the immunohistochemistry illustrated for comparison. Macroscopically, both adult female giraffe had severely thickened multifocal to coalescing nodular and occasionally ulcerated lesions of the head, neck and trunk with local poorly-circumscribed invasion into the subcutis. Necropsy performed on the 2nd giraffe revealed neither internal metastases nor serious underlying disease. Giraffe 1 had scattered, and Giraffe 2 numerous, large, anaplastic, at times indistinctly multinucleated dermal fibroblasts with bizarre nuclei within the sarcoid-like lesions, which were BPV-1 positive in Giraffe 1 and BPV-1 and -2 positive in Giraffe 2 by RT-PCR. The sable antelope presented with a solitary large lesion just proximal to the right hind hoof, which recurred after excision, and was BPV-1 positive by RT-PCR. Other wart-like growths were present elsewhere on the body. The Cape mountain zebra either succumbed from their massive lesions or were euthanased or removed from the herd because of them. The lesions were BPV-1 and\/or -2 positive by RT-PCR. The buffalo lesions were wart-like papillomatous projections in the inguinal and udder region. Stratum granulosum cells that stained immunohistochemically positive in the various species appeared koilocyte-like, as described in human papillomaviral lesions.","301":"The optimal dose of medetomidine-ketamine-buprenorphine was determined in 25 Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) undergoing surgical implantation of a temperature logger into the abdominal cavity. At the end of anaesthesia, the squirrels were given atipamezole intramuscularly to reverse the effects of medetomidine. The mean dose of medetomidine was 67.6 +\/- 9.2microg\/kg, ketamine 13.6 +\/- 1.9 mg\/kg and buprenorphine 0.5 +\/- 0.06 microg\/kg. Induction time was 3.1 +\/- 1.4 min. This produced surgical anaesthesia for 21 +\/- 4.2 min. Atipamezole 232 +\/- 92 microg\/kg produced a rapid recovery. Squirrels were sternally recumbent in 3.5 +\/- 2.2 min.","302":"Uric acid was used as a test for liver disease before the advent of enzymology. Three old studies criticised uric acid as a test of liver function. Uric acid, as an end-product of purine metabolism in the liver, deserved re-evaluation as a liver function test. Serum totalbile acids are widely accepted as the most reliable liver function test. This study compared the ability of serum uric acid concentration to assess liver function with that of serum pre-prandial bile acids in dogs. In addition, due to the renal excretion of uric acid the 2 assays were also compared in a renal disease group. Using a control group of healthy dogs, a group of dogs with congenital vascular liver disease, a group of dogs with non-vascular parenchymal liver diseases and a renal disease group, the ability of uric acid and pre-prandial bile acids was compared to detect reduced functional hepatic mass overall and in the vascular or parenchymal liver disease groups separately. Sensitivities, specificities and predictive value parameters were calculated for each test. The medians of uric acid concentration did not differ significantly between any of the groups, whereas pre-prandial bile acids medians were significantly higher in the liver disease groups compared with the normal and renal disease group of dogs. The sensitivity of uric acid in detecting liver disease overall was 65% while the specificity of uric acid in detecting liver disease overall was 59%. The sensitivity and specificity of uric acid in detecting congenital vascular liver disease was 68% and 59%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of uric acid in detecting parenchymal liver disease was 63% and 60%, respectively. The overall positive and negative predictive values for uric acid in detecting liver disease were poor and the data in this study indicated uric acid to be an unreliable test of liver function. In dogs suffering from renal compromise serum uric acid concentrations may increase into the abnormal range due to its renal route of excretion.","303":"Papillomavirus was detected electron microscopically in cutaneous fibropapillomas of a giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) and a sable antelope (Hippotragus niger). The virus particles measured 45 nm in diameter. Histopathologically, the lesions showed histopathological features similar to those of equine sarcoid as well as positive immunoperoxidase-staining of tissue sections for papillomavirus antigen. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected bovine papillomavirus (BPV) DNA. Bovine papillomavirus-1 was characterised by real-time PCR in the sable and giraffe, and cloning and sequencing of the PCR product revealed a similarity to BPV-1. As in the 1st giraffe, the lesions from a 2nd giraffe revealed locally malignant pleomorphism, possibly indicating the lesional end-point of papilloma infection. Neither virus particles nor positively staining papillomavirus antigen could be demonstrated in the 2nd giraffe but papillomavirus DNA was detected by real-time PCR which corresponded with BPV-1 and BPV-2.","304":"Staphylococcus aureus is 1 of the most important causes of bovine mastitis and is responsible for significant economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide. One of the principal approaches used in treating intramammary infections is the administration of antimicrobials. Due to the propensity of S. aureus to develop resistance, antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring is necessary to ensure that treatment regimens are effective. As part of this investigation, 90 S. aureus strains isolated from mastitis cases submitted to Allerton Provincial Veterinary Laboratory during 2008 and 2009 were evaluated for their susceptibility to a panel of 10 antimicrobials. Only 8 of the 90 S. aureus isolates tested (8.9%) were found to be susceptible to all of the antimicrobials evaluated. A very high level of resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted: 47.8% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin and 65.6% were resistant to ampicillin. Minimal resistance to oxacillin, cephalothin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1.1%) was found. Seventeen (18.9%) of the isolates tested were found to be resistant to 3 or more antimicrobials. The need for vigilant monitoring of bacterial resistance trends in the dairy industry is warranted as the potential public health implications are significant.","305":"Several faecal examination techniques have shown variable sensitivity in demonstrating Spirocerca lupi (S. lupi) eggs. The objective of this study was to determine which faecal examination technique, including a novel modified centrifugal flotation technique, was most sensitive to diagnose spirocercosis. Ten coproscopic examinations were performed on faeces collected from 33 dogs confirmed endoscopically to have spirocercosis. The tests included a direct faecal examination, a faecal sedimentation\/flotation test, 4 direct faecal flotations and 4 modified faecal centrifugal flotations. These latter 2 flotation tests utilised 4 different faecal flotation solutions: NaNO3 (SG 1.22), MgSO4 (SG 1.29), ZnSO4 (SG 1.30) and sugar (SG 1.27). The sensitivity of the tests ranged between 42% and 67%, with the NaNO3 solution showing the highest sensitivity in both the direct and modified-centrifugal flotations. The modified NaNO3 centrifugal method ranked 1st with the highest mean egg count (45.24 +\/- 83), and was superior (i.e. higher egg count) and significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the routine saturated sugar, ZnSO4 and MgSO4 flotation methods. The routine NaNO3 flotation method was also superior and significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the routine ZnSO4 and MgSO4 flotation methods. Fifteen per cent (n = 5) of dogs had neoplastic oesophageal nodules and a further 18% (n = 6) had both neoplastic and non-neoplastic nodules. S. lupi eggs were demonstrated in 40% of dogs with neoplastic nodules only and 72.9% of the dogs with non-neoplastic nodules. The mean egg count in the non-neoplastic group (61) was statistically greater (P = 0.02) than that of the neoplastic group (1). The results show that faecal examination using a NaNO3 solution is the most sensitive in the diagnosis of spirocercosis. The modified centrifugal flotation faecal method using this solution has the highest egg count. The study also found that dogs with neoplastic nodules shed significantly fewer eggs than dogs with non-neoplastic nodules.","306":"The universal notoriety of Robben Island as a penitentiary for political prisoners, notably in the 19th and 20th centuries, overshadows its previous historical significance established centuries ago. The Island, initially a source of seals and penguins to European mariners rounding the southern tip of Africa, and later for several other reasons, including its proximity to the Cape of Good Hope, played a pivotal role in the selection of this halfway station. The seals would provide blubber for train oil and the penguins, meat and eggs. The transhumant Peninsular Khoekhoe was to provide cattle and sheep by a barter process as before. Inconsistent access to Khoen livestock forced the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC) to consider their own breeding programmes and ultimately the establishment of Free Burgers. Van Riebeeck confirmed the suitability of Robben Island for the fattening and breeding of sheep and this island made a substantial contribution to the provision of sheep and mutton to the fleets and the local community. Khoen sheep did not do well in the Table Valley in early summer and it was expected that they would thrive on the drier island. Predators and stock theft were major problems at the Cape and neither occurred on the island. It is contended that it was unlikely that the settlement at the Cape would have occurred and succeeded without Robben Island.","307":"A preliminary serological study of 366 household dogs in Lagos and Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria, was carried out to determine antibodies due to exposure to Brucella abortus and B. canis, using the rose bengal test (RBT) and the rapid slide agglutination (RSA) test, respectively. Results showed that 5.46 % (20\/366) and 0.27 % (1\/366) of the dogs screened were seropositive to B. abortus and B. canis, respectively. Of all dogs, 36 had a history of being fed foetuses from cows and 11 (30.6 %) of these tested positive in the RBT. Our findings, although based on a limited sample size and a dearth of clinical details, revealed that dogs in Nigeria may be infected with Brucella spp. given the wide range of risk factors. Further studies are recommended to elucidate the epidemiology of brucellosis in dogs and its possible zoonotic consequences in the country.","308":"Hens involved in a Newcastle disease study were euthanased at regular intervals according to a designed protocol. Of these, 7.14 % (n = 42) of the 82-week-old specific pathogen-free breeder hens were found to have well-delineated firm white to yellowish nodules of varying sizes in the abdominal cavity. Histologically, the nodules were identified as an adenocarcinoma originating in the uterus. Transcoelomic spread was evidenced by the presence of similar neoplastic cells embedded in the serosa and outer longitudinal muscle layer of the intestines as well as the liver.","309":"This study was conducted to determine the effect of feeding high milk volumes on the growth rate, health and cross-sucking behaviour in group-fed Jersey calves. Three-day-old heifers (n = 120) in a seasonal calving dairy herd were randomly assigned to one of 6 treatment groups. Three groups received high milk volumes (HMV), consisting of ad libitum milk or milk replacer feeding twice a day, while 3 groups received restricted milk volumes (RMV), consisting of 2 l twice daily, during the pre-weaning period. After a pre-weaning period during which feeding was reduced to once daily, all calves were weaned at 42 days and monitored until 60 days of age. Adjusting for birth mass, birth date, dam parity and sire, average daily mass gain (ADG), both pre-weaning (days 0-42) and overall (days 0-60), was higher in HMV than in RMV calves (P &lt; 0.001). After weaning, growth rates showed no differences and at 60 days of age the HMV calves maintained a 6.74 kg advantage in mean body mass (P &lt; 0.001). The mean intake of dry starter feed was higher in RMV than in HMV calves. Overall feed conversion rate of HMV calves was 9.6 % better than RMV calves. However, the variable cost per kg mass gain was 12 % higher for HMV calves. In the RMV groups 75 % of calves showed cross-sucking behaviour pre-weaning and 18 % post-weaning, whereas in HMV calves the proportions were 2 % and 7 %, respectively. There was no significant effect of milk volume on the incidence of diarrhoea. We conclude that the feeding of high volumes of milk to Jersey calves has a positive effect on growth rate, without compromising health or reducing solid feed intake after weaning. However, the higher cost of such a feeding system may limit its implementation.","310":"The objective of this study was to describe the changes in plasma glucose concentration in 20 severely injured dogs suffering from dog bite wounds over a period of 72 hours from the initiation of trauma. Historical, signalment, clinical and haematological factors were investigated for their possible effect on plasma glucose concentration. Haematology was repeated every 24 hours and plasma glucose concentrations were measured at 8-hourly intervals post-trauma. On admission, 1 dog was hypoglycaemic, 8 were normoglycaemic and 11 were hyperglycaemic. No dogs showed hypoglycaemia at any other stage during the study period. The median blood glucose concentrations at each of the 10 collection points, excluding the 56-hour and 64-hour collection points, were in the hyperglycaemic range (5.8- 6.2 mmol\/l). Puppies and thin dogs had significantly higher median plasma glucose concentrations than adult and fat dogs respectively (P &lt; 0.05 for both). Fifteen dogs survived the 72-hour study period. Overall 13 dogs (81.3 %) made a full recovery after treatment. Three of 4 dogs that presented in a collapsed state died, whereas all dogs admitted as merely depressed or alert survived (P = 0.004). The high incidence of hyperglycaemia can possibly be explained by the \"diabetes of injury\" phenomenon. However, hyperglycaemia in this group of dogs was marginal and potential benefits of insulin therapy are unlikely to outweigh the risk of adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia.","311":"As part of a larger survey to map the geographical distribution of Babesia and Theileria parasites in the southern African rhinoceros population, white rhinoceroses were sampled during routine immobilisations in the Kruger National Park. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse line blot (RLB) hybridisation assays were used to screen for the presence of piroplasms and complete blood counts were used to assess associated changes in clinical parameters. Of the 195 rhinoceroses sampled, 71 (36.4 %) tested positive for the presence of Theileria bicornis, with no significant change in the haematological parameters measured, while 18 (9.2 %) tested positive for Theileria equi. None of the rhinoceroses sampled tested positive for Babesia bicornis, a parasite associated with mortalities in black rhinoceroses.","312":"A study of infectious bursal disease (IBD) or 'Gumboro disease' seroprevalence rates in healthy, non-vaccinated indigenous scavenging chickens in northern Tanzania was conducted in November and December 2009 on 362 chickens raised in a traditional management system. Individual bird and flock-level information was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and serum samples were screened for IBD virus (IBDV) antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study revealed high rates of IBDV antibodies, yielding an overall seropositive rate of 58.8 % and with at least one positive bird detected in 82.8 % (74\/90) of flocks. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that seropositivity to IBDV varied significantly (chi2 = 16.1, P &lt; 0.001) between the study sites. The flock seroprevalence was found to vary from 37.5 % to 91 % between districts and from 75 % to 90 % between regions. The results of this study showed that IBD is an endemic and widely distributed disease in northern Tanzania.","313":"South Africa is home to 9 vulture species, of which 7 are endangered. While the cause of the population declines remains largely speculative, a vast amount of effort has been dedicated towards the protection of populations by ensuring sustainable and safe food sources for the various colonies. Limited focus was placed in the past on efforts related to the rescue and\/or rehabilitation (R&amp;R) of injured birds and the release of these birds back into the wild. This paper provides an overview of the causes, the impact and success of 3 organisations involved in R&amp;R efforts of vultures in the Magaliesberg mountain range and surrounding areas over a period of 10 years. Study material included 162 Cape griffon (CGV) and 38 African white-backed (AWBV) vultures. Datasets include the number, sex and age of birds received, the reason the vultures were brought in for R&amp;R, surgical interventions performed and outcomes of rescue efforts. The CGV dominated the rehabilitation attempts. Results further show that a large number of apparently healthy birds were presented for veterinary treatment. The R&amp;R data clearly indicate that the major cause of injuries was birds colliding with overhead pylons, as a high number of soft tissue and skeletal injuries were observed. The study also shows that successful releases of rescued birds are possible. It is concluded that urbanisation has had a major negative impact on vultures around the Magaliesberg mountain range.","314":"Research aimed at optimising diagnostic laboratory procedures is central to the development of effective bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) control programmes. BVDV is a single-stranded RNA virus that crosses the placenta to infect foetuses, resulting in reproductive losses due to foetal death or persistently infected calves that die early in life. Persistently infected animals are widely accepted to be the primary reservoir of BVDV and the largest source of infection. This poses important challenges to overall animal\/herd health and can cause major losses to the cattle industry. Long-term storage of bovine ear notch samples from calves persistently infected with BVDV may adversely affect the ability of diagnostic assays to detect the virus efficiently. In order to test this hypothesis, ear notch samples from 7 animals were divided into 2 groups. One set was subjected to prompt formalin fixation and the other set stored either as fresh samples without preservatives at -2 degrees C, or soaked overnight in phosphate buffered saline followed by freezing of the supernatant fluid at -2 degrees C. Frozen ear notches and ear notch supernatant yielded positive results with an antigen-capture, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA) for the duration of the study (6 months) and optical density (OD) values remained significantly within range. There was no significant difference between storing fresh ear notch samples or PBS at -2 degrees C. However, positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on formalin fixed ear notches started to fade between Day 17 and Day 29 when stored at room temperature. It was concluded that fresh ear notches could safely be stored at -2 degrees C for a period of 6 months prior to testing for BVD viral antigens.","315":"Six clinically healthy male water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) 2-3 years of age and weighing 290-325 kg were used for 2 different treatments (H1 and H2). The animals of group H1 were premedicated with medetomidine (2.5 g\/kg,i.v.) and butorphanol (0.05 mg\/kg, i.v.), while in group H2 midazolam (0.25 mg\/kg) and butorphanol (0.05 mg\/kg) were used intravenously. Induction of anaesthesia was achieved by 5% thiopental sodium in H1 (3.85 +\/- 0.63 mg\/kg) and H2 (6.96 +\/- 0.45 mg\/kg) groups. The anaesthesia was maintained with halothane in 100 % oxygen through a large animal anaesthetic machine. Better analgesia and sedation with a significantly lower dose of thiopental for induction and significantly higher values of sternal recumbency time and standing time were recorded in group H1 than in group H2, whereas no significant (P &gt; 0.05) difference for the halothane concentration was observed between groups H1 and H2. Significant decrease in heart rate was observed in group H1 whereas it significantly increased in group H2. In both groups, RR decreased during the preanaesthetic period, which increased significantly (P &lt; 0.01) after halothane administration. In both groups a significant (P &lt; 0.01) fallin RT was recorded from 20 min to the end of observation period. A significant (P &lt; 0.05) fall in MAP was observed in group H1 from 15 min until the end, while in group H2 MAP increased nonsignificantly (P &gt; 0.05) after premedication and a significant (P &lt; 0.05) occurredafter thiopental administration. In both groups a significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in CVP and a significant (P &lt; 0.01) decrease in SpO2 were observed after premedication which persisted up to 120 min. ECG changes included significant (P &lt; 0.01) decrease and increase in QRS amplitudes in groups H1 and H2 respectively, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in PR interval was recorded at 15 min in group H1, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in PR interval in group H2, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in T wave amplitude in group H1, and a significant (P &lt; 0.01) increase in duration of T wave in group H1 . It is concluded that both combinations can be used safely in buffaloes for surgery of 2 h duration but better sedation, analgesia and muscular relaxation and more dose sparing effect on anaesthetics and shorter recovery times were observed in group H1.","316":"The origin of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) African Foundation is described. The 16th WAAVP Conference held in South Africa in 1997 generated a surplus of ZAR 430 460 (US$ 70 116). This was invested and a foundation established to manage the fund with the intention of using it to the mutual advantage of the WAAVP and African veterinary parasitologists. To date, more than 110 scholarship applications have been screened, and 51 full and partial scholarships awarded to young African veterinary parasitologists to attend subsequent biennial WAAVP Conferences. This investment has grown into a very successful endowment currently valued at US$ 206 553. This article is written in response to many queries across the globe about the origin of this fund and how it has been invested, managed, sustained and utilised.","317":"W H Andrews qualified as a veterinarian in London in 1908 and was recruited soon after, in 1909, by Sir Arnold Theiler to join the staff of the newly established veterinary laboratory at Onderstepoort. After initial studies on the treatment of trypanosomosis and on snake venoms he was deployed by Theiler in 1911 to start research on lamsiekte (botulism)at a field station on the farm Kaffraria near Christiana, where he met and married his wife Doris. After a stint as Captain in the SA Veterinary Corps during World War I he succeeded D T Mitchell as head of the Allerton Laboratory in 1918, where he excelled in research on toxic plants, inter alia identifying Matricaria nigellaefolia as the cause of staggers in cattle. When the Faculty of Veterinary Science was established in 1920 he was appointed as the first Professor of Physiology. After the graduation of the first class in 1924, and due to health problems, he returned to the UK, first to the Royal Veterinary College and then to the Weybridge Veterinary Laboratories of which he became Director in 1927. After his retirement in 1947 he returned to South Africa as a guest worker at Onderstepoort where he again became involved in teaching physiology when Prof. Quin unexpectedly died in 1950. Andrews died in Pretoria in 1953 and was buried in the Rebecca Street Cemetery.","318":"","319":"Solitary benign angiolipoma and infiltrative angiolipoma are rare tumours in dogs. Angiolipomata can be distinguished histologically from lipomata by the large number of tightly packed blood vessels seen between the adipocytes with multiple fibrin thrombi occupying some of the vessels' lumens. The dog presented with a solitary slow-growing mass in the cervical region. Histopathology revealed multifocal to coalescing single or clusters of blood-filled vessels lined by flattened endothelial cells with narrow, elongated, basophilic nuclei. These regions were embedded in adipose tissue with multifocal areas of intervascular remnants of differentiated serous salivary glandular tissue with multifocal small ducts. Fibrin thrombi occupied a few of the vessel lumens. A histological diagnosis of infiltrative angiolipoma was made. On computed tomography, the mass was bilobed with a suspected primary component involving the right parotid gland which was grossly enlarged. The mass had a slightly hypoattenuating mottled to lobulated appearance with a few hyperattenuating mineralised specks throughout. Hounsfield units of the mass ranged between 40 and 45, which was less than the 60-65 of the contralateral salivary glands and cranial musculature. Post contrast images showed no contrast enhancement of 90% of the mass with only a band of peripheral contrast uptake of the affected lateral lobe.","320":"A 7-year-old female Cocker spaniel-cross was referred with an 8-month history of mucocutaneous erosive dermatitis. On physical examination, skin lesions affected the eyelids and periocular area, lips and vulva. Lesions were symmetrical with small diffuse superficial ulcers, haemorrhagic crusts, adherent purulent exudation in haired skin, and alopecia with hyperpigmentation and scarring. Histopathologic evaluation showed multiple, non-intact dermoepidermal junction vesicles and ulceration associated with a dermal lichenoid infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry showed strong to moderate reactivity in the dermoepidermal junction for the antibodies directed against canine IgG, human IgG lambda light chains and C3, respectively. A diagnosis of autoimmune subepidermal blistering dermatosis was made. Treatment with oral prednisone at 2 mg\/kg and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at 20 mg\/kg twice daily was initiated and after 4 weeks the ulcers and erosions were cured. During the rest of treatment, MMF was maintained at 10 mg\/kg twice daily and prednisone could be tapered to 0.25 mg\/kg once every other day without recurrences. In conclusion, this case report shows that MMF was well tolerated and might be effective as steroid-sparing agent in the long-term treatment of this autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease.","321":"A total of 25 (13 male, 12 female) adult, healthy Swiss albino mice were used to investigate the origin, course and anastomoses of coronary arteries. Coloured latex was injected into the aortic arch to enable these arteries to be clearly discerned. A. coronaria sinistra was larger than A. coronaria dextra. It was divided into a Ramus interventricularis paraconalis and a Ramus circumflexus sinister. However, in 2 specimens, the septal ramus, was observed to stem directly from the left coronary artery, and only 1 ventricular branch arose from the left circumflex. The collateral branches of the paraconal interventricular ramus had a larger diameter and more extensive distribution was observed in these specimens. The A. coronaria dextra was divided into a Ramus septalis and Ramus circumflexus dexter. The Ramus interventricularis subsinuosis was not detected in this study. The ventricular branches of the left coronary artery run intramyocardially whereas the branches of the right coronary artery course subendocardially.","322":"A retrospective cross-sectional study of mortality was conducted on smallholder dairy farms in 2 separate regions (Iringa and Tanga) of Tanzania during the period of January to April 1999. A total of 1789 cattle from 400 randomly sampled smallholder dairy farms (200 each from Iringa and Tanga regions) were included in the study. These animals contributed a total risk period of 690.4 and 653.95 years for Tanga and Iringa, respectively. The overall mortality rates were estimated to be 8.5 and 14.2 per 100 cattle years risk for Tanga and Iringa regions, respectively; 57.7% of the reported deaths were of young stock less than 12 months old; 45% of reported young stock deaths (&lt; or = 12 months old) were due to tickborne diseases, mainly East Coast Fever (ECF) and anaplasmosis. Disease events including ECF were reported to occur in all months of the year. Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard models indicated that, in both regions, death rate and risk was higher in young stock less than 12 months than in older animals (relative risk RR = 4.92, P &lt; 0.001 for Iringa; RR = 5.03 P = 0.005 for Tanga). In the Tanga region reported mortality rates were significantly higher for male animals (RR = 3.66, P = 0.001) and F2 compared with F1 animals (RR = 3.04, P = 0.003). In the Iringa region, reported mortality rates were lower for cattle on farms where the owner had attended a dairy development project training course (RR = 0.47, P = 0.012). Farms located in Iringa urban district and Pangani were associated with higher risk (mortality risk 21% for Iringa urban and 34% for Pangani). Our findings suggest that timely health and management interventions on these factors are necessary to alleviate losses from disease and emphasise that understanding variation in mortality risk within a population can enhance early response to potential outbreaks, reducing losses.","323":"Corridor disease, transmitted by the brown ear tick (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus), is one of Africa's most pathogenic tick-borne diseases for cattle. With a focus on this species, we investigated the community parameters (richness, diversity and abundance) of ticks in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, and how this may be linked to the increasing wildlife\/cattle interface in the region. There were significantly more ticks of a greater diversity and richness at sites positioned at the wildlife\/cattle interface ('treatment sites') compared to sites where wildlife was absent (controls). Significantly, R. appendiculatus was only found at the treatment sites. Therefore, it is believed that the wildlife\/cattle interface may be playing a crucial role in increasing the occurrence, abundance and distribution of R. appendiculatus in the Eastern Cape. The implications of a Corridor disease outbreak in the region are discussed.","324":"Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading causes of sporadic food-borne bacterial disease in humans. In intensive poultry and pig rearing systems the use of oral antibiotics is essential to maintain health. Consequently, there is a high risk for the thermophilic Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli resident in the intestinal tract of food animals to develop resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Contamination of meat or eggs with pathogenic strains of resistant Campylobacter could, therefore, result in a form of campylobacteriosis in humans that is difficult to treat. The aim of this investigation was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. isolated from pigs and poultry by the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. A total of 482 samples from the Western Cape and Gauteng provinces was collected and analysed. Thirty-eight Campylobacter isolates were obtained. Analysis of data revealed that C. jejuni strains mainly of poultry origin were more resistant to the fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracyclines and the C. coli strains were more resistant to the macrolides and lincosamides. Multi-resistance was also detected in 4 Campylobacter strains from the Western Cape. With the exception of tetracyclines, strains from high health Gauteng broiler farms were susceptible to antibiotics used to treat Campylobacter infections.","325":"Information on the effect of road transportation conditions and lairage times on the meat quality of pork under South African conditions is very sparse. In this investigation, the effects of 2 road conditions (rough road with frequent stops - A; smooth road, few stops - B) and 2 lairage holding periods (2 h and 24 h) on the physical meat quality attributes of commercially produced pigs during summer (ambient temperatures &gt; 30 degrees C) in the Western Cape (South Africa) were investigated. Pig meat from pigs transported on a road that caused more stress (A), had lower pH 45 (measured 45 min post mortem) values after 2 h lairage than pigs transported over a smoother road. Pigs B had a lower muscle pH 24 (measured 24 h post mortem) than group A, indicating that they had more glycogen reserves available for post mortem glycolysis. Road conditions A were more stressful resulting in a higher incidence of PSE pork, as shown by the percentage drip loss and the L* values. When the lairage period was increased to 24 h prior to slaughter, pigs transported under road conditions A had time to replenish their energy reserves and the pH 45, drip loss and L* values were within an acceptable range. However, pigs transported under road conditions B had lower pH 45 and higher pH 24 values, indicating that the lairage period was too long and that energy reserves were depleted in order to adapt to the stressful conditions. Results from this investigation indicate that improvement of the transport\/road conditions will result in better pork quality.","326":"Trypanosoma congolense causes the most economically important animal trypanosomosis in Africa. In South Africa, a rinderpest pandemic of the 1890s removed many host animals, resulting in the near-eradication of most tsetse species. Further suppression was achieved through spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT); however, residual populations of Glossina austeni and G. brevipalpis remained in isolated pockets. A total of 506 of these tsetse flies were captured in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, the St Lucia Wetland Park and Boomerang commercial farm. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine the infection rate and frequency of mixed infections of these flies. Additionally, 473 blood samples were collected from cattle at communal diptanks and a commercial farm in the area and each one examined by the haematocrit centrifugation technique (HCT). Furthermore, buffy coats from these blood samples were spotted onto FTA Elute cards and the DNA extracted from each one tested using 3 separate PCRs. The HCT revealed the presence of trypanosomes in only 6.6% of the blood samples; by contrast, species-specific PCR detected trypanosome DNA in 50% of the samples. The species-specific PCR detected trypanosome DNA in 17% of the tsetse flies, compared with the nested PCR targeting rDNA which detected trypanosome DNA in only 14% of the samples. Over time, the transmission of Savannah-type T. congolense and Kilifi-type T. congolense as mixed infections could have an impact on disease manifestation in different hosts in the area.","327":"Clinical use of diagnostic ultrasound at point-of-care or emergency situations, although common, has not been well documented in veterinary medicine. Medical records of after-hour emergency equine admissions during a 10-year period were reviewed and horses that received ultrasound scans were identified. Data sheets for each ultrasound scan performed during emergency clinical evaluation were collected and reviewed. Data extracted included anatomical region imaged, body system affected, documented ultrasonographic diagnosis and final diagnosis. Six hundred and nine records were available of which 108 horses had an ultrasound diagnostic procedure performed. The most common reason for emergency ultrasonography was to investigate gastrointestinal abnormalities, the largest proportion of these being large intestinal disorders. A complete ultrasound report was documented in 57% of evaluations, of which 79% correlated with a final diagnosis. Incomplete reporting made accurate interpretation of records difficult. Results indicate that the use of ultrasound in the emergency setting may be of diagnostic benefit and impact on patient management. Ultrasound training should be provided to residents in order to gain proficiency, especially with regard to the gastrointestinal system.","328":"Rabies is a growing problem in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This study investigated dog ecology, vaccination coverage and rabies neutralising antibody levels in 203 randomly selected dogs within a local municipality in the former Transkei area. Responses to vaccination were also evaluated in 80 of these dogs. The population was remarkably uniform in size, breed and condition. Slightly over 1\/5th of the population was between 6 weeks and 1 year of age, while very few dogs reached 10 years or older. According to owner responses, the Animal Health Technicians achieved a total vaccination coverage of 65% of owned dogs over several years, but only 56% within the previous 12 months. Only 32% of dogs had adequate circulating rabies virus neutralisation antibodies (&gt; or = 0.5IU\/l). After vaccination, 83% had seroconverted to this level. The magnitude of seroconversion was independent of body condition or age. This study proposes a different approach to vaccination strategies than those currently employed in certain areas of the province.","329":"Information with regard to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks that occurred in the Kruger National Park (KNP) and adjacent areas of South Africa between 1970 and 2009 was collected from reports and files of various government departments and collated into one report. The collected data were summarised in a table and assessed for patterns. Fifty-one FMD outbreaks occurred during this period in the target area, of which 16 were SAT 1, 31 were SAT 2,4 were SAT 3 and 3 were not serotyped. No pattern could be discerned although SAT 1 outbreaks occurred more frequently in the summer months while more SAT 2 outbreaks occurred in winter.","330":"Horse breeding in South Africa started in 1652, shortly after the 1st European settlement in the Cape. African horsesickness posed a serious problem and after a devastating outbreak of the disease in 1719, horses were largely replaced by oxen for agricultural and transport purposes but remained important from a sporting and military point of view. Examples of the latter are the export of horses for military use to India in the mid-19th century and for use in the Crimean War in 1854, reaching a zenith in the Anglo-Boer war in which an estimated 450 000 horses succumbed. Research and disease control and initially also health services were the responsibility of state veterinary authorities. Private equine practice was pioneered by Jack Boswell in the late 1930s, mainly involving race horses and Thoroughbred studs as part of a general practice. Specialised equine private practices were only initiated 10 years later and developed further during the 2nd half of the 20th century. These developments are described in some detail, including resumes of the veterinarians involved, clinical challenges encountered, scientific advances as well as developments in the equine industry with the emphasis on Thoroughbreds and the racing community. The regulatory environment, especially regarding the import and export of horses, and the role of various organisations and associations are also briefly discussed.","331":"","332":"Pyometra is a common post-oestral syndrome in bitches. Classical treatment consists of either ovariohystorectomy or medical intervention. Surgical uterine drainage and lavage via direct trans-cervical catheterisation using a 5% povidone-iodine in saline solution was performed successfully in 8 bitches with pyometra. All bitches conceived and whelped without complications subsequent to this treatment. It is concluded that this method offers an effective alternative treatment for canine pyometra with shorter recovery times as well as good clinical recovery and pregnancy rates in bitches destined for further breeding.","333":"Three African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) that died after capture and translocation from Mutirikwe Recreational Park in southern Zimbabwe showed macroscopic and microscopic lesions of cardiomyopathy compatible with a diagnosis of gousiekte. The buffalo had had access to Pavetta schumanniana, a plant that is known to cause gousiekte. Death was attributed to cardiac failure as a result of previous consumption of the plant, exacerbated by the stress of translocation.","334":"The risk for humans to contract bovine tuberculosis through the consumption of undercooked game meat as well as biltong (traditionally dried game meat) is a concern. The survival potential of Mycobacterium bovis during the cooking and drying processes was researched in a preceding study on beef and the positive results compelled the authors to investigate the results with a similar preliminary study on game meat. Muscular, lymphatic and visceral tissues from skin test positive African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) with tuberculous lesions were collected from the Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park during the park's culling programme. The different tissues were exposed to cooking and the muscular tissue to the drying process prior to culture. All acid-fast isolates were analysed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of Mycobacterium bovis. All tissues were found negative for Mycobacterium bovis but non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated from kidney, liver, heart and lymph nodes. The results showed that these processes will kill Mycobacterium bovis but the unexpected recovery of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suggests possible survival and resistance characteristics of these strains which might be of veterinary public health interest.","335":"Heartwater, a tick-borne disease caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium, is considered to be a significant cause of mortality amongst domestic and wild ruminants in South Africa. The main vector is Amblyomma hebraeum and although previous epidemiological studies have outlined endemic areas based on mortalities, these have been limited by diagnostic methods which relied mainly on positive brain smears. The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) has a low specificity for heartwater organisms as it cross-reacts with some other species. Since the advent of biotechnology and genomics, molecular epidemiology has evolved using the methodology of traditional epidemiology coupled with the new molecular techniques. A new quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) test has been developed for rapid and accurate diagnosis of heartwater in the live animal. This method can also be used to survey populations of A. hebraeum ticks for heartwater. Sampling whole blood and ticks for this qPCR differs from routine serum sampling, which is used for many serological tests. Veterinary field staff, particularly animal health technicians, are involved in surveillance and monitoring of controlled and other diseases of animals in South Africa. However, it was found that the sampling of whole blood was not done correctly, probably because it is a new sampling technique specific for new technology, where the heartwater organism is much more labile than the serum antibodies required for other tests. This qPCR technique is highly sensitive and can diagnose heartwater in the living animal within 2 hours, in time to treat it. Poor sampling techniques that decrease the sensitivity of the test will, however, result in a false negative diagnosis. This paper describes the development of a skills training programme for para-veterinary field staff, to facilitate research into the molecular epidemiology of heartwater in ruminants and eliminate any sampling bias due to collection errors. Humane handling techniques were also included in the training, in line with the current focus on improved livestock welfare.","336":"Leptospirosis, a disease more common in the tropics, can cause a life-threatening multisystemic syndrome in humans and animals. Immunity, whether natural or vaccine-induced, is serogroup-specific with the infecting serovars varying according to geographical locality. In South Africa, in spite of the fact that the bacterin vaccine for some Leptospira serovars is often used, there is no recent information on the incidence of canine leptospirosis as well as the infecting serovar\/s. The aim of this study, which was undertaken on sera collected in 2008 and 2009 from both strays and owned dogs predominantly in the coastal regions of South Africa, was to determine the presence of leptospiral antibodies to 15 serovars known to infect dogs. Of the 530 samples tested, 25 tested positive to 7 different serovars with the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Nine of the 25 samples tested positive to more than one serovar. The 2 serovars most frequently represented were Canicola, which reacted to 17 sera, and Pyrogenes, which reacted to 10 sera. Currently the only vaccines available in South Africa in different combinations contain serovars Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona and Grippotyphosa. The results showed that the use of vaccines containing serovar Canicola is still justifiable in certain regions of the country. However, the presence of antibodies to serovar Pyrogenes in several dogs, pending a broader investigation, indicates that this serovar should also be included in the range of Leptospira vaccines for use in South Africa.","337":"The prevalent microbial growth on carcasses before and after overnight cooling in an ostrich abattoir and de-boning plant was investigated. The effect of warm or cold trimming of the carcasses was examined together with possible causes of contamination along the processing line. An attempt was made to link the prevalent microorganisms that were identified from carcasses to those from specific external contamination sources. Samples of carcasses and possible contaminants were collected in the plant, plated out and selected organisms were typed using a commercial rapid identification system. It was indicated that the cold trim (mainly of bruises) of carcasses was advantageous in terms of microbiological meat quality. Results indicated pooled water in the abattoir as the most hazardous vector for carcass contamination and that contaminants from this source are mostly Gram-negative pathogens. Pseudomonas and Shigella were frequently isolated from surface and air samples and indicated that the control of total plant hygiene is a requirement for producing ostrich meat that is safe to consume and has an acceptable shelf-life.","338":"Diversity and seasonal occurrence of coccidia in a communally reared mixed flock of sheep and goats at Mafikeng, North West Province, South Africa, was determined between March 2008 and February 2009. Faecal specimens were collected directly from the rectum of the animals and the number of oocysts per gram of faeces (opg) determined. The mean monthly opg for goats was significantly higher than that for sheep. Higher oocyst counts were observed during the hot, rainy season than during the cold, dry season. The highest mean values for both the sheep (862.5 opg) and goats (1200 opg) were recorded during March. Six species (Eimeria crandallis, E. bakuensis, E. weybridgensis, E. ahsata, E. intricata, and E. ovinoidalis) were recovered from sheep, with E. crandallis and E. bakuensis occurring most frequently. The last 2 species, together with E. ahsata, are considered among the most pathogenic species in sheep. In goats, 7 species (E. arloingi, E. jolchijevi, E. caprina, E. alijevi, E. caprovina, E. christenseni and E. hirci) were recovered, with E. arloingi and E. jolchijevi occurring most frequently. Up to 5 Eimeria species were recovered from individual specimens in goats while up to 4 were recovered in sheep. No cross-infections between goats and sheep were recorded and no clinical coccidiosis was noted during the study. It is increasingly becoming evident that the pathogenic E. arloingi is one of the most commonly occurring Eimeria species in goats in South Africa.","339":"The cardiovascular effects of non-abdominal and abdominal surgery during isoflurane anaesthesia (A-group) or isoflurane anaesthesia supplemented with either epidural ropivacaine (AR-group; 0.75 % solution, 0.2 ml\/kg) or morphine (AM-group; 0.1 mg\/kg diluted in saline to 0.2 ml\/kg) were evaluated in 28 healthy pigs with a mean body weight of 30.3 kg SD +\/- 4.1 during surgical devascularisation of the liver. Anaesthesia was induced with the intramuscular injection of midazolam (0.3 mg\/kg) and ketamine (10 mg\/kg). Anaesthesia was deepened with intravenous propofol to enable tracheal intubation and maintained with isoflurane on a circle rebreathing circuit. The vaporiser was set at 2.5% for the A-group and 1.5% for the AR- and AM-groups. Differences between treatment groups were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) for any of the variables. Differences between AM- and AR-groups were marginally significant heart rate (HR) (P = 0.06) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (P = 0.08). Within treatment groups, differences for the A-group were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) between non-abdominal and abdominal surgery for HR, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure (DIA) and MAP. Within the AM-group differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) for DIA and MAE and within the AR group differences for all variables were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). It was concluded that in isoflurane-anaesthetised pigs, the epidural administration of ropivacaine decreased heart rate and improved arterial blood pressure during surgery.","340":"Ram seminal plasma increases the fertility of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa deposited into the cervix. The aim of the current study was to compare the effect of ram seminal plasma to that of bull seminal plasma, dog prostatic fluid, protein-free TALP TrilEq (Triladyl with 0.5 mt of Equex STM paste added to each 100 mt) and heat-treated skim milk on longevity and percentages of progressively motile and aberrantly motile frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa. Three ejaculates from each of 6 rams were extended in TrilEq, pooled and frozen in straws as a single batch per ram. One hundred and eight straws (3 straws from each ram for each fluid) were thawed in random order. Once thawed, a straw was emptied into a tube with 0.85 ml of the appropriate fluid at 37 degrees C and kept at that temperature for 6 h. Motility was assessed at x200 magnification immediately (time zero) and 2, 4 and 6 h after thawing. Progressive motility decreased from each time to the next (P &lt; 0.05) and was 39.0 % (0 h), 26.0 % (2 h), 19.6 % (4 h) and 12.6 % (6 h); SEM 1.24, n = 108 for each group. Ram seminal plasma resulted in higher progressive motility than bull seminal plasma, lower than milk, and similar to the other fluids. Ram seminal plasma resulted in lower aberrant motility than protein-free TALP and similar aberrant motility to other fluids. The effect of ram seminal plasma and dog prostatic fluid was very similar. The effect of ram seminal plasma on the fertility of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa deposited into the cervix is not due an exceptionally beneficial effect on the motility of spermatozoa.","341":"The introduction and wide use of artificial insemination in cattle in the 1950s led to a need for accurate parentage identification. Blood group determination by means of the newly emerging scientific discipline called immunogenetics provided the answer. A blood group laboratory was consequently established at Onderstepoort in 1956, initially concentrating on the production of blood typing reagents. Once established the technology was also applied to studies on a variety of problems in various animals as summarised in this paper. Investigations include zygosity in cattle twins, blood transfusion in domestic animals, breed relationships, genetic polymorphisms and the identification of useful genetic markers for production and disease parameters in breeding programmes.","342":"The objective of this study was to determine the species composition of ixodid ticks infesting domestic dogs in the northwestern region of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa and in Namibia. Ticks were collected from February 2008 to January 2009 from dogs presented for a variety of reasons at a veterinary clinic in the Northern Cape Province and at 3 clinics in Namibia. The ticks collected at each place were pooled separately for each month at each locality. Eleven ixodid tick species were collected from dogs in the Northern Cape Province and new locality records for Haemaphysalis colesbergensis and Ixodes rubicundus, new locality and host records for Hyalomma glabrum, and a new host record for Rhipicephalus neumanni are reported. Six tick species were collected from dogs at the 3 clinics in Namibia. The most numerous species on dogs in both countries was R. sanguineus. The present results increase the total number of ixodid tick species collected from dogs in South Africa from 25 to 28.","343":"Coprological examination was used to determine the prevalence and intensity of gastrointestinal parasites of stray dogs impounded by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Durban and Coast, South Africa. Helminth and protozoan parasites were found in faeces of 240 dogs with an overall prevalence of 82.5% (helminth parasites 93.1% and protozoan parasites 6.9%). The following parasites and their prevalences were detected; Ancylostoma sp. (53.8%), Trichuris vulpis (7.9%), Spirocerca lupi (5.4%), Toxocara canis (7.9%), Toxascaris leonina (0.4%) Giardia intestinalis (5.6%) and Isospora sp. (1.3%). Dogs harbouring a single parasite species were more common (41.7%) than those harbouring 2 (15%) or multiple (2.1%) species. Ancylostoma sp., Toxocara canis and Giardia intestinalis have zoonotic potential and were detected in 66.7% of the samples.","344":"Yolk coelomitis as a result of pre-ovulatory follicular stasis is a common disorder in captive reptiles, especially in captive lizards of various genera. The clinical signs are generally fairly non-specific and diagnosis is based on clinical signs together with most of the common diagnostic modalities. The condition is most likely a husbandry and environment-related reproductive disorder. It has not been reported in wild free-living specimens. This report describes the clinical presentation and post mortem lesions in a white-throated monitor lizard that died during treatment for non-specific clinical signs related to a severe yolk coelomitis.","345":"Two adult Dorper ewes developed an oesophageal obstruction (choke) by consuming a pelleted ration. The history, clinical signs and method of treatment were recorded in each case. One case was treated surgically via rumenotomy and the other conservatively. Both ewes recovered uneventfully and no recurrence was observed. Reasons for the compaction of the pelleted ration in the oesophagus are discussed.","346":"This report describes clinical and pathological findings associated with closantel (a halogenated salicylanilide anthelmintic) overdosage in a 3-year-old goat. The clinical signs included blindness, incoordination, ataxia, depression of the palpebral and pupillary reflexes, and recumbency. No gross lesions were noted in tissue or organs at necropsy, but microscopic lesions were seen in nervous tissue and hepatic cells. Polioencephalomalacia was clearly evident. Bilaterally symmetrical status spongiosus of the white matter of the brain, bilateral laminar necrosis, microcavitations, ischaemic cell change and severe degeneration of the cerebellum were seen in nervous tissue. Fatty change and hydropic degeneration in the liver and hepato-cellular degeneration were observed histologically.","347":"Oligodendrogliomas occur most commonly in the dog, but have also been reported in cattle, horses and cats. A 1-year-old sheep with neurological disturbances, including blindness, ataxia, circling and incoordination was referred to the veterinary clinic of Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman. Following euthanasia and necropsy, a soft, relatively well-demarcated mass was observed in the white and grey matter of the right cerebral hemisphere, close to the sylvian fissure in the right cerebral hemisphere. Microscopic examination revealed a sheet of densely packed tumour cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, lightly staining cytoplasm and characteristic perinuclear halo effect which is consistent with a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. This is the 1st report of oligodendroglioma in sheep.","348":"An automated blood culture system (BACTEC 9240) was used for the isolation of aerobic bacteria from the blood of septicaemic neonatal calves. Blood samples were collected from 90 clinically septicaemic and 20 healthy neonatal calves and inoculated into blood culture bottles. There were 89 significant isolates from 90 positive blood cultures using the BACTEC system. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen detected accounting for 56 (63%) out of 89 isolates. The other pathogens were beta-haemolytic streptococci (15.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%), Klebsiella sp. (5.6%) and Corynebacterium sp. (5.6%). All isolates showed a susceptibility rate of 100% to enrofloxacin, cefepim, cefoperazone\/sulbactam, imipenem and meropenem while some of them were ranged from 75 to 91.7% susceptible to amoxicillin\/clavulanic acid, ampicillin\/sulbactam, gentamicin and cephalosporins.","349":"The study hypothesis was that pre-slaughter handling is not conducted in such a way that pigs can be considered humanely slaughtered, nor is it conducive to promoting those properties of fresh meat that could enhance pork quality. The 1st phase of the investigation was aimed at confirming the present compliance level within the prescribed norms. To this end the importance of stunning induction requirements for effective electrical stunning, the welfare implications relating to the pre-slaughter handling of pigs and the stunning and sticking techniques were investigated. Pre-slaughter welfare of the pigs at the abattoir was found to be influenced at the outset by the origin and type of pig slaughtered, the daily throughput range of pigs and the type of abattoir involved. A disappointing pre-arrival aspect was that deficiencies in road motor vehicles were observed while off-loading pigs. Through poor design or lack of maintenance, another factor that hampered free movement of pigs was the off-loading facilities. The nature of animal behaviour in the pens, in the passages and when going into the stunning area was directly related to the pig handling efficiency and to the nature and extent of design and maintenance problems with equipment. None of the abattoirs had a well designed in-feed to a well planned stunning area\/facility, and a very high level of pig pre-slaughter stress prevailed. The optimum position of the electrodes is virtually impossible to attain under practical conditions and the practice of repeat application of electrical stunning is common. Of the total sample size (n = 1175), 34% were difficult to shackle, 90% of these being from the abattoirs tending to slaughter more routinely a wide range of different sized pigs. In this survey 149 pigs (13%) required more than a single sticking attempt to bleed out properly, considerably higher than in other published reports.","350":"A total of 79 chickens were randomly collected from 4 rural localities and processed to detect the presence of helminth parasites and their prevalences. Sixteen helminth species comprising 12 nematode and 4 cestode species were recorded from the 4 localities. Syngamus trachea and Cyathostoma spp. were the only helminth species recovered from the respiratory tract and the rest of the helminth species were from the gastrointestinal tract. The most prevalent nematode species across the 4 localities were Heterakis gallinarum (prevalence range 80-94.4%), Gongylonema ingluvicola (43.3-867%), Tetrameres american (53.3-66.7%) and Ascaridia galli (22.2-43.8%) and for cestode species, Raillietina tetragona (16.7-40%) and Skrijabinia cesticillus (3.3-13.3%) were the most prevalent in that order. Heterakis gallinarum and T americana had the highest intensity of infection in chickens across all the rural areas compared with other helminth species. There was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) observed in the sex distribution for As. galli, Baruscapillaria obsignata (syn. Capillaria obsignata), Eucoleus annulatus (syn. Capillaria annulata), Eucoleus contortus (syn. Capillaria contorta) and Subulura suctoria among the 4 rural areas. However, a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) was observed in the intensity of infection of both males and females for H. gallinarum and T americana across the 4 localities studied. Tetrameres americana, A. galli, C. obsignata and C. annulata had prevalence and number of females higher than that of males, while H. gallinarum showed the opposite. Prevalence of H. gallinarum and T. americana as determined by faecal egg count were much lower compared with the prevalence as determined by post mortem examination, confirming the limitation of using faecal samples in determining the prevalence of gastrointestinal helminth parasites in chickens.","351":"About 90% of bovine malignant catarrhal fever (BMCF) PCR-positive cases in South Africa are caused by alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AlHV-1) and the other 10% by ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2). The prevalence of OvHV-2 in different sheep breeds in South Africa was determined in order to investigate whether the lower incidence of BMCF caused by OvHV-2 in comparison with AlHV-1 can be ascribed to a low incidence of the virus in sheep. A single-tube hemi-nested PCR was developed, evaluated and applied to detect OvHV-2 DNA. The prevalence of the virus in 4 sheep breeds from various regions in South Africa was shown to be 77%. No statistically significant difference was found amongst the sheep breeds tested.","352":"As a result of the high lability and slow growth of Campylobacter fetus subspecies, the laboratory diagnosis of bovine genital campylobacteriosis has always been difficult. This is especially true under South African conditions, where farms are far apart, laboratories are only present in major centres and there are high ambient temperatures. In order to overcome the shortcomings associated with traditional diagnostic methods, the implementation of a molecular assay was sought. This work describes how a previously published PCR assay (MG3F\/ MG4R primers) was adapted, optimised and applied in the diagnostic laboratory to test preputial samples directly for the presence of Campylobacter fetus. Field evaluation of the assay revealed an analytical sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 99%, respectively. Subsequent genotyping and phenotyping of a diverse collection of South African field isolates revealed that South Africa has an unexpected and previously unreported high incidence of Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis biovar intermedius strains. These strains were not identified correctly by the subspecies-specific primer set evaluated. Until such time that cost- effective genotyping methods are available to diagnostic laboratories in South Africa, and other countries with these atypical Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis strains, the need for bacterial culture will persist. Identification to subspecies level of isolates at present remains dependent upon a single phenotypic criterion, namely tolerance to 1% glycine.","353":"To characterise the urban livestock keeping practices and constraints in Kisumu municipality, Kenya, a questionnaire survey was carried out. Thirty-four contact farmers were interviewed on general farm characteristics and production constraints. The farming activities were categorised as either livestock only (41%), or mixed crops and livestock (59%). The surveyed farmers kept mainly cattle (100%), chickens (82%) and goats (74%). Most (94%) of the farmers had kept livestock for prolonged periods mainly for income generation (97%) and domestic consumption (59%). These data show that livestock keeping was popular and could be harnessed to increase food security, although the farmers kept mainly low-producing indigenous cattle (98%) which were grazed on unutilised land. The main production constraints mentioned by farmers included diseases (100%), poor fertility (68%) and lack of feed (56%). The diseases varied with species of ruminants and included lumpy skin disease (71%), diarrhoea (65%) and helminthosis (62%). The source of advice on management and treatment of the livestock was almost equally from private and government veterinary personnel. To improve livestock productivity, it is recommended that key stakeholders address the constraints mentioned in this study and in particular that the occurrence of diseases should be investigated with a view to developing sustainable control strategies.","354":"Genital organs of 10 healthy, adult Mithun bulls (6-8 years old) that were slaughtered at the dwellings of tribal people for meat were collected. Immediately after collection, spermatozoa from 3 different regions of the epididymis, i.e. the head, body and tail, were obtained to study morphological changes of the spermatozoa during passage through these regions. The prevalence of proximal cytoplasmic droplets significantly decreased from the head to the tail of the epididymis. Conversely, the percentage of distal cytoplasmic droplets increased significantly from the head to the tail region. The incidence of tailless heads rose significantly from head to body and then reduced significantly in the tail region. The percentage of total head abnormalities did, however, not change markedly, but total mid-piece and tail abnormalities differed significantly between the three epididymal regions.","355":"Cricopharyngeal achalasia is a rare cause of dysphagia in the dog. However it must be differentiated from other causes of dysphagia as it is treatable with surgery. It is a disruption of the cricopharyngeal phase of the oropharyngeal phase of deglutition. There appears to be an incoordination in the swallowing process between the relaxation of the rostral, middle pharyngeal muscles and the caudal pharyngeal muscles. It is seen as a primary condition in young animals presenting soon after weaning onto solid food. The dogs appear clinically healthy unless there is secondary aspiration pneumonia or emaciation. These dogs may present as respiratory emergencies and require intensive support and treatment prior to corrective surgery. The diagnosis is made on videofluoroscopy. The condition carries a good prognosis for cure with surgical myectomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle and the thyropharyngeal muscle, which make up the upper oesophageal sphincter. Temporary relief prior to surgery can be achieved by injection of the cricopharyngeal muscle with botulism toxin. Surgical treatment for dysphagia secondary to an underlying neurological, neuromuscular or pharyngeal weakness carries a guarded prognosis and will make aspiration pneumonia worse.","356":"The history of the university course in veterinary nursing in South Africa is reviewed from its inception in 1977 to 2000. The motivation for, and initial problems encountered in, its implementation are outlined. Selection criteria and course subjects, including clinical work, are supplied and the changes in these, following the introduction of a new curriculum in 1993\/94, are highlighted. Reference is made to the legal status of the nursing profession.","357":"","358":"A 12-year-old domestic short-haired cat was referred for evaluation of periocular masses. The tail had similar masses and was amputated previously by the referring veterinarian. On examination, multiple pigmented nodules, 3-15 mm in diameter, were found in the periocular skin, primarily involving the palpebral eyelid margin. A wedge excisional biopsy revealed small cuboidal cells forming multiple tubular and cystic structures indicative of apocrine cystadenomas, similar to apocrine hidrocystomas described in humans. The nodules were lanced followed by liquid nitrogen cryofreezing.","359":"Naturally occurring foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in wildlife is a relatively mild condition but occasionally it can be devastating as has been documented in impala in South Africa and in mountain gazelles in Israel. This report describes pathological changes in an adult male gazelle with FMD from an outbreak in the Nature Reserve of Ramot-Issachar region and the lower Galilee in Israel. The outbreak was characterised by the malignant form of the disease, which is uncommon among domestic animals. Lesions observed included, ulceration in the oral cavity, oesophagus and ruminal pillars, coronitis, multifocal cardiac necrosis and pancreatic necrosis and inflammation. Pneumonia, caused by Muellerius capillaries was an incidental finding.","360":"A 10-year-old greyhound-cross dog was presented with a large, chronic skin wound extending over the interscapular region. The substantial skin defect was closed by making use of bilateral axillary skin fold flaps. It was possible to elevate the 2 skin flaps sufficiently to allow them to meet at the dorsal midline and thus facilitate complete closure of a large and awkwardly positioned wound. Small dorsal areas of the skin flaps underwent necrosis, but the resulting defects were closed without difficulty in a subsequent procedure. To the author's knowledge, this is the 1st clinical report of the use of bilateral axillary skin fold flaps in this fashion and describes an additional use of a versatile skin flap procedure.","361":"The purpose of this study was to describe arteries supplying the ovaries and uterus in the chinchilla. Five healthy adult female chinchillas were used. In order to reveal the arterial network by dissecting under a stereoscopic microscope, latex coloured with red ink was injected through the common carotid artery. The ovaries of the chinchilla are supplied by the arteriae ovaricae which formed end-to-end anastomoses with the cranial termination of the arteria uterina. Soon after leaving the aorta abdominalis, the arteriae ovaricae extended 2-3 mm caudolaterally, then released 1 branch and extended caudally and bifurcated into 2 further branches. One of these supplied branches to fat tissue. The other branch coursed caudally and anastomosed with the arteria circumflexa ilium profunda and dispersed into fat tissue. The arteria ovarica further subdivided into 2 rami ovaricae. The origins of the uterine arteries were exclusively from the left arteria iliaca externa. The arteria uterina gave a branch to the arteria umbilicalis and consecutive branches which supplied to the ureter, urinary bladder and cranial aspects of the vagina. It also gave rise to 2-3 branches to the cervix and further supplied 10-12 meandering branches to the uterine horns. The arteria uterina gave rise to many tortuous arteries to the uterus and provided 2 further branches to the ovary.","362":"A seroprevalence study was carried out among trade cattle slaughtered at Bodija Municipal Abattoir, Ibadan (southwestern Nigeria) over a period of 3 consecutive years from 2004 to 2006 with a view to determining the breed, sex and age distribution in the seropositivity of bovine brucellosis. In total, 1642 animals were examined for antibodies to Brucella abortus using the Rose Bengal test. Seroprevalences of 6.00%, 6.17% and 5.31% were obtained in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively but a decrease in 2006 shows no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The role of the breed (P &gt; 0.05), sex (P &gt; 0.05) and age (P &gt; 0.05) in the occurrence of the infection was not statistically significant at 5%, although higher rates were obtained for females and older animals. The trend in the disease over the 3-year period showed that it is endemic in trade cattle slaughtered in Ibadan and the public health implications of this are discussed.","363":"Theileria parva, the most important bovine theilerial species in sub-Saharan Africa, causes widespread mortality and morbidity in endemic areas. A survey was conducted using buffy-coat specimens from 60 apparently healthy adult communally herded Nguni-type cattle at the northeastern edge of the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park to determine, by means of PCR and Reverse Line Blot (RLB) hybridisation, the occurrence of Theileria and Babesia species. The presence of Trypanosoma species was determined using PCR-RFLP. Results showed that 6.7 % of the specimens were positive for Theileria parva. This significant finding suggests that cattle in South Africa, and not only African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), may be subclinical carriers of T. parva. Other species identified were T. mutans (83.3%), T. velifera (70.0%), Theileria sp. (sable) (46.8%) and T taurotragi (1.7%). Two specimens (3.3%) were positive for Babesia bovis and single specimens (1.7%) positive for B. bigemina and B. rossi, respectively. Mixed infections, of up to 4 species, were common (65.0%). Only 1 specimen was found to be positive for Trypanosoma vivax, and 2 for T theileri, of which only the first species is pathogenic.","364":"A retrospective study that involves the analysis of laboratory diagnostic data collected during the period 1996-2006 was conducted. A total of 3417 Salmonella isolations involving 183 different serotypes was recorded from 1999-2006, inclusive, at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, Agricultural Research Council, South Africa. The most common serotypes were Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (917 incidents), Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Dublin (248 incidents), Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Enteritidis (232 incidents), Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Muenchen (164 incidents), Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Heidelberg (118 incidents) and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Chester (113 incidents). The number of recorded Salmonella isolations over the period 1996 to 2006 varies considerably from year to year The peak of 693 isolations was recorded in 1997, and the lowest, 108 incidents, in 2001. Of the total incidents recorded during the period of survey, 2410 (70.5%) occurred in poultry and other birds, 641 (18.75%) occurred in cattle, 255 (7.46) in pigs and 111 (3.24%) in sheep. Despite the large number of serotypes isolated (183), 52 % of incidents were due to only 6 serotypes in decreasing order of prevalence: S. Typhimurium, S. Dublin, S. Enteritidis, S. Muenchen, S. Heidelberg and S. Chester. Serovar Typhimurium was the most common serotype and was detected in all animal species sampled, with, 65% (598) of the incidents occurring in poultry and 20% (187) occurring in cattle. Of the total of 248 incidents of S. Dublin serotype, 95.6% (237) of incidents occurred in cattle and of the 232 isolates of S. Enteritidis, 223 (96%) originated from poultry. Serovar Choleraesuis was identified in 16 isolates from pigs. The following 4 serotypes were each recorded in more than 50 incidents: S. Hadar (102), S. Schwarzengrund (99), S. Mbandaka (94) and S. Sandiego (73). The trends of annual incidence of Salmonella infection in cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry and other birds during the 11-year period and the distribution of the main serotypes in individual species of animals from 1996-2006 are discussed.","365":"The objective of this study was to determine the therapeutic and residual efficacy of a topically applied combination of cyphenothrin (40%) and pyriproxyfen (2%) against the tick Haemaphysalis elliptica and the flea Ctenocephalides felis on dogs. Twelve dogs were infested with 50 ticks 2 days before they were treated and with approximately 100 fleas 6 days before treatment and again 2 days before treatment and with 50 ticks and approximately 100 fleas at weekly intervals thereafter. They were ranked according to their flea counts and sex 5 days before treatment and randomly allocated to an untreated control group of 6 dogs and a treated group of 6 dogs. Ticks and fleas were collected from the dogs 48 h after treatment and 48 h after each infestation and live and dead ticks and live fleas were counted. The counts of ticks and fleas were transformed to geometric means, and efficacy was calculated by comparing these means. The product had a therapeutic efficacy of 83.1% against H. elliptica and 97.5% against C. felis 2 days after treatment. The residual period of protection during which efficacy was &gt; or = 90% was 5 weeks for both H. elliptica and C. felis.","366":"The effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) upon the intestinal motility has not been entirely explored in ruminants. The aim of this study was to examine the precise effects of CCK amphibian analogue, cerulein, on small-intestinal myoelectric activity in rams in the course of chronic experiments. Five rams underwent implantation of bipolar platinum electrodes to the duodenal bulb, the distal duodenum and jejunum. During continuous myoelectrical and motor recordings, 0.15 M NaCl or the various doses of cerulein were administered intravenously. Short infusions of the smallest dose of cerulein exerted a slight and mostly insignificant effect on the duodenalbulb and the duodenal myoelectric activity index (MAI) values. In the duodenal bulb, the effects of cerulein on myoelectric activity were dose-dependent and closely related to the phase of the MMC. In the duodenum, the higher doses of the hormone evoked short stimulatory response followed by longer inhibitory biphasic effects on MAI. These effects were inversely related to the duration of hormone injection. Infusions of hormones at the higher doses caused a less pronounced biphasic effect. It is concluded that cerulein exerts an inhibitory effect upon the myoelectric activity of the duodenal bulb and a strong stimulatory and inhibitory (biphasic) effect on duodenal motility in sheep.","367":"The extent of trauma in a patient can be difficult for a clinician to quantify. A prospective study was performed on 2 groups of dogs undergoing either ovariohysterectomy or hemilaminectomy. The serum activity of creatine kinase and serum concentration of C-reactive protein were evaluated preoperatively and then at 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively in both groups. The results were compared statistically both within and between the 2 groups. A wide range of results was found at each time point for both analytes although there were no significant differences for either analyte between the 2 surgical groups preoperatively. Thereafter there were significant differences in creatine kinase activity levels between the 2 groups. C-reactive protein concentration results were very similar in the 2 groups with no statistical difference at any time point. The results of this study suggest that the evaluation of CK and CRP at any one time point in a traumatised animal is of limited value. However, the evaluation of the trend of these 2 analytes, even over a relatively short time period, may allow for useful prognostication in clinical cases.","368":"Epidemiological analyses in time and space were carried out on all animal rabies cases reported in South Africa for the period 1993-2005. Validation of state veterinary records was done by comparing these with data from the 2 diagnostic laboratories mandated to test for animal rabies. A discrepancy between state veterinary records and laboratory results was found and is discussed. The total number of positive rabies cases reported to veterinary services between 1993 and 2005 was 4767. During this period the proportion of domestic animal rabies had increased to 79% (19% more than for the period 1980-1994), with 59% of the total cases being domestic dogs. Of the domestic animal cases 74 % were canine and only 21% were bovine; when compared to the data from 1985-1994 there was an increase of 6% of rabies in canine and a 3% decrease in bovine cases. A disturbing trend is the increase in the incidence of rabies over the last 16 years in provinces neighbouring KwaZulu-Natal province, where rabies used to be concentrated, and in Limpopo province.","369":"Aggressive behaviour and musth are constant problems in captive and sometimes in free-ranging African elephant bulls. Aggressive bulls are difficult and musth bulls almost impossible to manage without severely restricting their movement either by leg-chaining or using tranquillisers. This study investigated the relationship between faecal androgen metabolites (FAM) and faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) concentrations and aggressive behaviour and tested a GnRH vaccine as a means of down-regulating aggressive behaviour and musth in 1 free-ranging and 5 captive elephant bulls. The bulls were non-aggressive (n=3), aggressive (n=2) or in musth (n=1) at the onset of the study. The bulls were injected with a GnRH vaccine-adjuvant combination 3 or 4 times at 3- to 7-week intervals. Behaviour, FAM and FCM concentrations were measured during every week prior to vaccination until 4 months after the last vaccination. FAM concentrations were positively correlated with aggressive behaviour before the 1st vaccination. Androgen production, as reflected by FAM concentrations, was down-regulated in 3 of the 6 immunised bulls. At least 2 bulls and possibly a 3rd showed behavioural improvement following GnRH vaccination and in all 3 temporal gland secretion ceased. No further aggressive behaviour was observed until the end of the study in any of the bulls. The results of this 1st GnRH immunisation study suggest that it could be a useful method to control aggressive behaviour and musth in African elephant bulls.","370":"Concise descriptions are given of the varied life histories of the students of the classes of 1936 and 1937. Consisting of 14 students, the class of 1936 was the largest of the pre-war classes of the Onderstepoort Faculty. Three of the 6 students in the 1937 class were actually repeating their final year, therefore the total number described below is 17 rather than 20. The detailed analysis of their careers reveals the presence of a remarkable degree of variation. Although all except Brookes, who apparently went directly into the newly established practice of Jack Boswell, initially joined the local government service, most of them became specialists in their disciplines. Four soon established very successful private practices. Five of the 6 who spent their entire careers in the South African Veterinary (Field) Services, finally occupied very senior positions in that division. One of them (Kluge) made a major contribution to the control of tsetse flies in this country and another (Belonje) became a specialist in equine infertility. Four of the graduates opted for a research career, 3 of them also teaching at the Faculty. Of all of these, only De Boom (Anatomy &amp; Embryology), who was a consummate teacher, took on a fulltime position as Professor and Head of the Department when the Faculty became independent from the Onderstepoort Research Institute in 1973. De Lange (Surgery &amp; Gynaecology), however, relinquished his professorship to become a deputy director of the Institute. Sutton became a household name to the many students who passed through his hands in Animal Management. Haig (Virology) became one of the most famous of the many researchers produced by Onderstepoort. Van der Walt showed much promise as a researcher but died at the age of only 45. Two more died before they were 35 years old. Two had sons who also became veterinarians while one's grandson followed in his grandfather's and father's footsteps.","371":"We report, for the first time, an incidental finding of Calodium hepaticum infestation in a sub-adult female Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inaurus). Post mortem examination of the squirrel revealed severe haemoperitoneum, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly with miliary white spots distributed diffusely throughout the hepatic parenchyma. Histologically the portal tracts in the liver showed granulomatous inflammation with fibrosis and numerous giant cells. Occasional adult worms were identified and there were multiple C. hepaticum eggs distributed diffusely throughout the portal tracts and the parenchyma. The spleen also contained C. hepaticum eggs. The genus Rattus is the primary host and reservoir of C. hepaticum, but C. hepaticum infections have been reported previously in other Sciuridae. Based on our findings, people should be cautious of the zoonotic potential of C. hepaticum, when they come into contact with the Cape ground squirrel.","372":"The efficacy of activated charcoal as a treatment for cattle (n = 57) poisoned by Yellow tulp (Moraea pallida) was investigated. Treatment with activated charcoal resulted in full recovery, irrespective of the degree of posterior paresis, provided that this clinical sign did not develop within the first 12 hours after initial exposure to Yellow tulp-infested grazing. For instance, despite treatment, 1 of 7 cattle succumbed after manifesting mild posterior paresis 6 to 8 h after initial exposure and 3 of 3 treated cattle died after developing severe posterior paresis within 6 to 12 h.","373":"The design of an oesophageal cannula for goats, sheep and cattle is described. The cannula consists of a base, threaded bar and stopper made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or wood. The surgical procedure in goats for inserting the cannula is described as well as how to keep the wound around the cannula clean.","374":"A 10-year-old Hanoverian mare was evaluated for a right buccal swelling that recurred 3 months following surgical resection. Ultrasonographic examination showed a broadly pedunculated subcutaneous mass at the level of 106-109 and 406-409 cheek teeth associated with an erosive mucosal lesion on the inside of the cheek. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen revealed a well-demarcated, malignant, dermal schwannoma. Following subcutaneous placement of platinum coated Ir192 wires under general anaesthesia, low-dose radiation of 5 gray per day was delivered for 14 days. Short-term complications included loss of patency of the right nasolacrimal duct, erythema, dermatitis, leukotrichia and left-sided deviation of the muzzle. Ten months later, there has been no tumour recurrence. Findings suggest that the use of interstitial brachytherapy should be considered for a malignant, dermal schwannoma that has recurred or is not amenable to surgery.","375":"A 10-year-old castrated male Golden retriever, weighing 36.3 kg was referred for evaluation owing to a decline in general condition. Findings from the complete blood count revealed a marked lymphocytosis (113000\/ml). Examination of Wright-Giemsa-stained films of peripheral blood revealed the presence of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Seventy-two per cent (81360\/ml) of the lymphocytes were found to be 12-17 microm in diameter, containing nuclei with mature clumped chromatin and abundant lightly basophilic cytoplasm with a variable number of fine azurophilic granules. Based on these findings this case was diagnosed as LGL leukaemia. As a result of multiple-agent chemotherapy, the markedly elevated levels of lymphocytes gradually decreased to 7500\/ml on day 122 and the patient maintained a good quality of life for the following 3 months. However, on around day 237, a soft, raised, bosselated mass on the labial region was noted. The dog was diagnosed as having histiocytic sarcoma based on cytological and histological examination of the mass. Shortly after diagnosis, the dog developed sudden onset of central nervous system signs and died on day 270. A common outcome of canine LGL is the development of acute blast crisis or lymphoma. However, this case was notable for complication with histiocytic sarcoma from another origin.","376":"A 10-year-old tame zebra gelding was presented after suffering from lethargy, nervousness, reported anaemia and icterus as well as a decreased appetite. These symptoms were seen over some months, with changing severity. The animal was immobilised, treated, and blood specimens were submitted for haematology and biochemistry. This report describes molecular characterisation of Theileria equi recovered from this animal, as well as the clinical findings, treatment and historical relevance of piroplasmosis in zebra in southern Africa.","377":"An 11-year-old male Rough collie was submitted with paraparesis, but did not respond to medical treatment. Clinical signs worsened and the dog displayed paralysis, inability to stand and loss of voluntary bladder control, whereupon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. No significant abnormalities were identified from MRI, blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid tests or radiography. After MRI, the dog developed dyspnoea and died. Autopsy and subsequent histopathological examination led to a diagnosis of degenerative myelopathy.","378":"The term 'thin soles' refers to the suboptimal thickness of the weight-bearing surface of claws in ruminants. These palmar\/plantar surfaces of the claws support the weight of the animal and consist of the distal wall horn, the sole proper, the heel and the minute white line area. The sole should normally only bear weight on uneven or undulating surfaces. A decrease in the thickness of the weight-bearing claw surface will decrease the protective function of this structure and may alter the proportion of weight-bearing by each section with possible detrimental effects on hoof function. Horn tissue readily absorbs water and becomes softer which can lead to increased wear rates. Growth rates normally match wear rates but, unlike the latter, time is needed for the growth rate response to adapt to changes in wear rate. Concrete surfaces can be abrasive and dairy cows that spend their lactation cycle on these floors should be let out to pasture in the dry period so that their claws can recoup lost horn. Frictional coefficient is a measure of the'slipperiness' of hooves on various surfaces. Newly laid or fresh concrete is not only abrasive but the thin surface suspension of calcium hydroxide that forms has a very alkaline pH which causes keratin degradation and is mostly responsible for the excessive claw wear that occurs. Four case studies are used to illustrate the importance of the distal wall horn, the dangers of over-trimming and the effects of disease and concrete on horn growth and wear rates.","379":"A mixture of 2% lignocaine (LIG) and 0.5% bupivacaine (BUP), at respective dose rates of 2 mg\/kg and 0.5 mg\/kg (LIG-BUP), was compared to LIG (4 mg\/kg) and BUP (1 mg\/kg) for lumbosacral epidural anaesthesia in 5 sedated cats. Each cat received all 3 treatment regimens at 1-week intervals. The cats were premedicated with an intramuscular injection of atropine sulphate (0.04 mg\/kg) and ketamine hydrochloride (10 mg\/kg). Onset and duration of analgesia, and time to walking were determined. Associated changes in heart rate (HR), respiratory frequency (fR) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded. Onset of analgesia with epidurally administered LIG-BUP (4.5 +\/- 0.7 min), LIG (3.9 +\/- 1.0 min) and BUP (5.0 +\/- 1.0 min) was similar. Duration of analgesia with LIG-BUP (49.4 +\/- 4.5 min) was significantly (P&lt;0.05) longer than with LIG (40.2 +\/- 1.0 min) but shorter than with BUP (79.4 +\/- 6.3 min). There were no significant differences in times to standing with LIG-BUP (26.3 +\/- 6.4 min), LIG (20.4 +\/- 4.7 min) and BUP (22.6 +\/- 10.3 min). Minimal changes were observed in HR, fR and RT. In conclusion, duration of analgesia produced by LIG-BUP was shorter compared with BUP but longer compared with LIG. Neither LIG nor LIG-BUP has any advantage over epidural BUP in terms of onset of analgesia, time to standing and physiological responses. Therefore, lumbosacral epidural administration of BUP appears to be the best choice for a long surgical procedure lasting more than 1 hour when compared with either LIG or LIG-BUP.","380":"Since the closure of the Lesotho abattoir in 2003, only imported meat can be legally sold. However, it was estimated in 2007 that 80% of the meat sold at butcheries comes from informal slaughter. The aim of this study was to investigate the situation. The number and location of informal butcheries in Lesotho (n = 143) were recorded and mapped using Geographical Information Systems. Observations (photographs) of informal slaughter indicated a lack of hygiene, unskilled slaughtermen and illegal disposal of offal with possible environmental pollution. In addition, a cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine the microbiological quality of meat from randomly selected carcasses (n = 237) of cattle, sheep and pigs from a sample of 44 butcheries, 4 of which were associated with registered supermarkets. As a control, samples for microbiological assay were taken from imported meat originating from carcasses (n = 20) slaughtered at a registered abattoir in South Africa. Of the 44 butcheries investigated only the 4 commercial butcheries associated with supermarkets sold imported meat only; 3 butcheries sold meat inspected at government slaughter slabs (n = 3), while the rest (n = 37) sold both imported and informally slaughtered meat. In terms of Lesotho legislation, informally slaughtered meat is only for home consumption. The bacteriological counts from all samples showed a total bacterial plate count exceeding 30 organisms per ml in contrast with the controls which all showed a count less than 5 colonies per ml. This was found for both imported and informally slaughtered meat sold in Lesotho. In addition, meat samples from butcheries showed the presence of the potential pathogens Salmonella (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 12) and Escherichia coli (n = 15). During the study, anthrax was confirmed in 9 human patients, 5 of whom died, after consumption of informally slaughtered livestock. Although no cases of animal abuse were detected, it was considered that informal slaughter can prejudice livestock welfare. It was concluded that the current situation is not acceptable in terms of meat safety. Thus, the Veterinary Public Health Directorate of the National Veterinary Services has prioritised the monitoring of butchers, registration of slaughter slabs and a general extension campaign to improve hygiene and animal welfare standards for slaughter in Lesotho. This paper highlights the major risks associated with meat consumption without Veterinary Public Health intervention in accordance with international standards.","381":"A partial intravenous protocol was used successfully to maintain anaesthesia in 5 healthy horses. Horses were premedicated with acepromazine, romifidine and butorphanol, induced with guaifenesin and ketamine and maintained on a constant rate infusion of lidocaine, ketamine and medetomidine together with halothane inhalation anaesthesia. Mean end-tidal halothane concentration to maintain a surgical plane of anaesthesia was 0.8 +\/- 0.2%. Mean dobutamine requirement to maintain mean arterial pressure above 9.31 kPa was 0.42 +\/- 0.3 microg\/kg\/min. The administration of relatively low doses of lidocaine, ketamine and medetomidine together with halothane resulted in haemodynamically stable anaesthesia, followed by smooth recovery.","382":"Various tissues from aborted ruminant foetuses were collected, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were made and exposed to a primary monoclonal antibody against the bovine viral diarrhoea\/mucosal disease (BVD\/MD) virus, and subsequently to a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP). Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was the substrate and it released a brown pigment in the tissues on reacting with the HRP in an immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedure. Of 27 aborted foetuses, an immunoperoxidase staining reaction was observed in 1 ovine and 5 bovine foetuses. The IHC procedure located BVD\/MD viral antigen in a wide variety of foetal tissues including cerebral cortical neurons, the pseudostratified columnar epithelial cells lining the bronchi, alveolar lining cells and alveolar macrophages, hepatocytes, renal tubular lining cells and the Purkinje fibres in the myocardium.","383":"Chronic nasal disease is a common problem in dogs. To determine the aetiology, a retrospective study in 75 dogs with persistent and chronic nasal disease was done. All dogs were evaluated by means of survey nasal radiographs, antegrade and retrograde rhinoscopy, bacterial and fungal cultures, and histopathology. A definitive diagnosis was made in 74\/75 cases (98.6%). Nasal neoplasia was the most common diagnosis (46.7%), median age 108 months, followed by lympho-plasmacytic rhinitis (20%), median age 112 months, and fungal rhinitis (10.7%), median age 53.5 months. Other diagnoses included nasal foreign body (5.3%), median age 51 months, and primary bacterial rhinitis (6.7%), median age 116.5 months. Rare aetiologies identified were nasal polyps, granulomatous rhinitis, oro-nasal fistula and naso-pharyngeal stenosis. This study showed that by using a structured combination of survey radiography, rhinoscopy, cultures and histopathology, a diagnosis could be made in dogs with chronic nasal disease.","384":"An outbreak of annual ryegrass toxicity occurred on a Thoroughbred stud in Ceres in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. This is the 1st report of annual ryegrass toxicity in horses in South Africa, although the condition has been reported in cattle and sheep populations in the past. Annual ryegrass toxicity is characterised by a variety of neurological signs including tremors, convulsions, recumbency and in many cases death. The description of the outbreak includes the history, clinical presentation and treatment protocol administered during the outbreak. Various epidemiological variables and their influence in the outbreak are also considered.","385":"Diminazene remains one of South Africa's most commonly used antiprotozoal agents for the management of babesiosis in dogs. Although the drug has been on the market for over 40 years, its intravenous pharmacokinetics are poorly known. To better understand the pharmacokinetics of the drug Berenil, it was reconstituted in sterile water and administered intravenously to 6 adult German shepherd dogs. All 6 dogs demonstrated the previously described secondary peak in the plasma concentration versus time profile. The plasma pharmacokinetics for diminazene are described by both non-compartmental and compartmental models. From non-compartmental analysis, the area under curve to the last sample point (AUClast), clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vz) were 4.65 +\/- 1.95 ng\/ml\/h, 0.77 +\/- 0.18 l\/kg\/h and 2.28 +\/- 0.60 l\/kg, respectively. For compartmental modelling, the plasma concentrations were fitted to both a 2-compartmental open model and a recirculatory enterohepatic model. From the recirculation model, the rate of release and re-entry into the central compartment varied markedly with the rate of release from the gall bladder (Ttom) being estimated at 27 +\/- 20.90 h. Once released, drug re-entry into the central compartment was variable at 9.70 +\/- 5.48 h. With normal biliary excretion time being about 2 h, this indicates that the redistribution cannot be occurring physiologically from the bile. Although it was not possible to identify the site from which sequestration and delayed release is occurring, it is believed that it is most likely from the liver. The study therefore showed that the secondary peak described for the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular administered diminazene in the dog is not related to biphasic absorption.","386":"Disease can be caused by various species of the genus Mycobacterium. A number of reports, both published and unpublished, of rarely reported mycobacteria have surfaced in South Africa in the last few years. Some unusual hosts have also been involved, causing concern in some quarters.These include reports on Mycobacterium goodii in a spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), M. xenopi in a ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), M. intracellulare in wild-caught chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), the 'dassie bacillus' in free ranging rock hyrax (dassies; Procavia capensis) the 'oryx bacillus' from free-ranging buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and M. tuberculosis in suricates (Suricata suricatta), a domestic dog and in baboons. In this article it has been attempted to put these in context and show how improved surveillance and technologies have allowed mycobacteria to be identified to species level more easily. Most of the unusual mycobacterial species have most likely been present in the region for many years and have probably caused disease episodes before, but have been misdiagnosed. Each case must be evaluated carefully with respect to the animal species involved, the environment in which the host is found and the mycobacterial species, and operational decisions made accordingly.","387":"Heartwater was first recognised and recorded in South Africa as early as 1838. Since then the disease has been described from almost all the countries in Africa south of the Sahara, from certain islands around Africa and from a number of islands in the Caribbean. Most of the research on the disease, at least until fairly recently, was conducted in South Africa. Progress in research on the disease has been slow but a few important findings are highlighted in this paper.","388":"","389":"An 8-month-old crossbred Labrador retriever was presented with a history and clinical signs suggestive of lower urinary tract obstruction. Laboratory results revealed azotaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the urinary tract showed a mass at the bladder trigone, hydronephrosis, hyrodureter, and suspected metastases to lymph nodes and the liver. Pulmonary metastasis was identified on thoracic radiographs. A post mortem confirmed metastases to the liver, lungs and regional lymph nodes, as well as to the mesenteric lymph nodes, mediastinum, heart, subcutaneous tissue and several muscle groups. A histopathological diagnosis of metastatic botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) was made. A review of the literature shows that, although the bladder trigone is a well documented location for this tumour, this case was unique with its widespread metastases to previously undocumented organs. The incidence, embryology, ultrasonographic appearance and treatment of this tumour are discussed.","390":"The most common causes of gastrointestinal colic at an equine referral hospital in South Africa were determined following retrieval of the medical records of horses admitted during a 10-year study period. The study included 935 horses of which 28% were admitted after hours. Most horses were Thoroughbreds (54%), male (57%), with a mean age of 8.2 years and originated from the Gauteng Province (81%). Heart rate (98%), mucous membrane colour (95%) and auscultation of the abdomen (91%) were the clinical data commonly obtained at admission. Packed cell volume, total serum protein and white cell count were recorded in 78%, 75% and 44% of horses respectively. Transrectal palpation (93%), nasogastric intubation (84%), intravenous catheterisation (74%) and abdominocentesis (53%) were the most frequently performed procedures. Medical intervention was performed in 558 horses (60%). The common causes of medical colic were impactions (39%), tympany (7%) and displacement of the large colon (6%). An exploratory laparotomy was performed in 331 horses (36%). The common causes of surgical colic were displacement (29%), impaction (22%) and small intestinal strangulating lesions (18%). Death occurred in 3% of horses, while euthanasia before medical intervention was performed in 4%. Overall, medical intervention was successful in 93% of horses and 67% in horses managed surgically. In conclusion, 55% of all the equine admissions responded to medical intervention and the recovery rate for horses receiving both medical and surgical intervention was comparable to that reported in other studies.","391":"A survey of ectoparasites, cestodes and husbandry aspects of indigenous free-range chickens was carried out in selected districts from the highveld and lowveld of rural Zimbabwe. The survey recorded infection with 4 species from the order Phthiraptera (lice), 1 species from the order Siphonaptera (fleas), 6 species from the order Acarina (ticks and mites) and 9 species of cestodes. Among the ectoparasites, the most prevalent was Menacanthus stramineus (87.7%) followed by Echidinophaga gallinacea (71.9%). Chickens in the Mazowe district had the highest number of ectoparasites species (10 of 11) followed by Goromonzi district (9 of 11) both these districts are situated in the highveld of Zimbabwe. The most prevalent cestode species was Raillietina tetragona (84.4%), followed by Raillietina echinobothrida (32.2%). Chickens in the Goromonzi district had the highest number of cestode species (7 of 9), followed by Mazowe district (one subgenus and 5 of 9). In all the districts sampled the main purpose of keeping free-range chickens was for meat for the household, with few households using the birds as a source of income. The majority of households kept their birds extensively with barely any appropriate housing, and supplementary feeding was only occasionally practised.","392":"The auditory evoked potential (AEP) is correlated to anaesthetic depth. The AEP has been used in rats, pigs, dogs and humans to assess anaesthetic depth. This study was undertaken to determine whether the AAI Index derived from the AEP correlated with changes in end tidal isoflurane concentration in dogs. The average AAI Index was 21.8 +\/- 10.5 and isoflurane concentration was 1.7 +\/- 0.4%. Data were divided into 0.5% intervals of end tidal anaesthetic agent concentration (ETAA). When ETAA values were higher than 2.5% the AAI values were 2.1-2.5%, 1.6-2.0% and 1.1-1.5% higher than AAI values although not statistically different. The 2.1-2.5 % interval was statistically different from the 1.1-1.5% and &lt;1.1% interval. The 1.6-2.0% interval was statistically different from the 1.1-1.5% and the &lt;1.1% intervals. The 1.1-1.5% interval was statistically different from the &lt;1.1% interval. The correlation between the AAI Index and isoflurane was -0.176 and was statistically significant (P = 0.0009). A linear regression between the AAI Index and isoflurane revealed the following relationship: AAI = 29.074 - (4.2755 x isoflurane) with a power of 0.913. The polynomial regression relationship was AAI = 53.334 - (35.715 x isoflurane) + (10.322 x isoflurane2) - (0.43646 x isoflurane3) with a power of 0.999. The AAI Index was found to correlate with changes in isoflurane concentration.","393":"The long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in geriatric dogs with osteoarthritis has not been well studied in veterinary medicine. This study evaluated the effects of firocoxib administered to dogs over 7 years of age for 90 days. Pain and lameness scores were evaluated by the owner weekly for the 1st month and then biweekly through to the end of the study, the veterinarian evaluated the dogs monthly. Serum chemistry, including urea, creatinine, alanine transferase, aspartate transaminase, bile acids and bilirubin, urine specific gravity and a urine dipstick, were performed at monthly intervals. Forty-five dogs were enrolled into the treatment group and 9 into the control group. A total of 33 dogs completed the trial in the treatment group and 8 in the control group. Lameness and pain scores were found to be significantly lower in the treated group from day 30 for most parameters evaluated. Bile acids (although not comparable to controls, with higher mean value and a high standard deviation in the control group; in addition the control group had increased bile acids at day 0) and urea (within normal reference range provided (WNL)) were significantly different in the treatment group between days 0 and 90. Urea (WNL) on days 30 and 90 and creatinine (WNL) on day 90 were significantly different between the control group and the treatment group. The most common adverse events reported were diarrhoea, vomition, dark faeces and anorexia. This study showed that firocoxib was effective in managing pain associated with osteoarthritis for 90 days. Despite the geriatric high-risk population used for this study, minimal biochemical changes were seen and adverse drug events seen were in agreement with those previously reported.","394":"Since 2002, following its introduction, the lineage 5d Newcastle disease virus (so-called Goose paramyxovirus - GPMV) strain has caused numerous disease outbreaks among commercial and backyard poultry in South Africa, raising questions about the ability of commercially available Newcastle disease vaccines to fully protect poultry against the strain. This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in the level of protection offered by Avinew Newcastle disease vaccine against GPMV virus as compared with a 3d Newcastle disease virus isolated in South Africa in 1993 (Rainbow challenge virus - RCV) strain. Six groups of 10-day-old, specific pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with doses of 10(3.0), 10(4.5) and 10(6.0) EID50 of Avinew vaccine and challenged at 4 weeks of age intramuscularly at a dose of 10(5.3) EID50\/0.2 ml\/bird of GPMV and RCV. No statistically significant difference could be found in the protection offered by Avinew vaccine against GPMV as compared to RCV challenge. The protection offered against the ND challenge was found to be dose dependent. At the recommended field dose of 10(6.0) EID50 the vaccine gave 100% protection from mortality against both the challenge viruses, but not against infection and replication of the viruses, as gross lesions were evident even in apparently healthy birds that survived the challenge. The protective dose (PD90) of the Avinew vaccine against GPMV challenge was calculated at 10(4.38) and against that of RCV at 10(4.43).","395":"Medical records of equine after-hours admissions from 1998 to 2007 are reviewed. Data extracted from the medical records included signalment, reason for admission, pre-admission treatment, clinical presentation, procedures performed, final diagnoses, complications occurring in hospital, length of stay and outcome. Eight hundred and twenty after-hours admissions were available of which 75% were classified as emergencies. Most horses originated from Gauteng province (82%), with Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Warmbloods representing 46%, 10% and 7% of horses. Horses had a median age of 7 years and were predominantly male (60%). Gastrointestinal (64%) and musculoskeletal (19%) disorders were the primary reasons for admission. Anti-inflammatories, sedation and antibiotics were given in 51%, 20% and 15% of cases respectively prior to referral. On admission, 23% of horses had surgical intervention. Intravenous catheterisation (64%), rectal examination (61%), nasogastric intubation (56%), abdominocentesis (33%) and ultrasonography (19%) were the procedures performed most frequently. Surgical and medical colics constituted 28% and 27% respectively of the overall diagnoses, while piroplasmosis was diagnosed in 5% of horses. Post-admission complications occurred in &lt;2% of horses. The median length of stay was 4 days (95% CI: 1 to 21 days). Overall survival to discharge was 74%. This study demonstrates that the majority of after-hours equine admissions to a university referral hospital required medical intervention and were mostly due to gastrointestinal disorders. Information obtained from this study can be used in emergency referral planning.","396":"A cross sectional study was conducted during October and November 2006 on 69 smallholder dairy farms with lactating cows in Mvomero and Njombe districts Tanzania, to determine the prevalence of mastitis and to assess the milk quality on the study farms. Clinical mastitis was investigated using clinical changes of udder and milk at animal level. Cow-side California Mastitis Test (CMT) and microbiological cultures were used to assess subclinical mastitis at quarter level. Milk quality was determined on bulk milk samples at herd level using alcohol and acidity tests, butter fat content, total solids, ash content as well as Delvotest for antimicrobial residues. Overall prevalence of clinical mastitis at herd level in both districts was 21.7% (n = 69). Based on CMT, prevalence of subclinical mastitis at animal level was 51.6% (n = 91). Prevalence of bacterial isolates at animal level was 35.2% (n = 91) while for fungal it was 16.7% (n = 90). Based on CMT results, prevalence of subclinical mastitis at quarter level was 30% (n = 353), while for bacteria and fungi it was 16% and 6% respectively. Contamination of milk with antimicrobial residues was 4.5% (n = 67). The milk quality parameters for most of the milk samples were within acceptable levels. Findings in this study have demonstrated high prevalence of subclinical mastitis that may contribute to low productivity of dairy cattle in both districts. About 20% of CMT subclinical cases had no involvement of microbial pathogens that suggested the need for minimal interventions with antimicrobial agents. These findings call for use of udder disinfectants and improved milking hygiene as intervention strategies to control mastitis on the smallholder dairy farms in Tanzania.","397":"Cattle are the major source of food security and income for pastoral farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. However, infectious and parasitic diseases remain a major constraint to improved cattle productivity in the region. The use of animal health economics to support decision-making on cost-effective disease control options is increasingly becoming important in the developing world. Trypanotolerant indigenous Orma\/zebu cattle in a trypanosomosis-endemic area of Kenya were evaluated for economic performance using gross-margin analysis and partial-farm budgeting. Orma\/zebu and Sahiwal\/zebu cross-bred cattle were exposed to similar husbandry practices and monitored for growth rate, incidence of common infections (trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, East Coast Fever and helminthosis) and the cost of treatment assessed. Interview questionnaires were also used to assess the preference rating of the 2 breeds. Results indicated that incidence of infection was trypanosomosis 3%, anaplasmosis 58%, babesiosis 11%, East Coast Fever 22% and helminthosis 28%, with no significant difference between breeds. The Orma\/zebu and Sahiwal\/zebu breeds had comparable economic benefits, hence a pastoralist in Magadi division is likely to get similar returns from both breeds. This study therefore recommends adoption of not only the Sahiwal\/zebu but also the Orma\/zebu breed for cattle improvement in trypanosomosis endemic areas and conservation of indigenous genetic resources.","398":"Feline immunodeficiency virus is a lentivirus of domestic cats that causes significant lifelong infection. Infection with this or similar lentiviruses has been detected in several nondomestic feline species, including African lions (Panthera leo). Although lion lentivirus (FIVple) infection is endemic in certain lion populations in eastern and southern Africa, little is known about its pathogenic effects or its epidemiological impact in free-ranging lions. This report describes the epidemiological investigation of lentivirus positivity of free-ranging lions in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. A nested polymerase chain reaction assay for virus detection was performed on all whole blood samples collected. In addition, serum samples were tested for cross-reactive antibodies to domestic feline lentivirus antigens and to puma lentivirus synthetic envelope peptide antigen. The results were analysed in conjunction with epidemiological data to provide a descriptive epidemiological study on lion lentivirus infection in a free-ranging population of lions. The overall prevalence of lentivirus infection was 69%, with a prevalence of 41% in the north of the park, and 80% in the south. Adult males had the highest prevalence when combining the factors of sex and age: 94%. The lowest prevalences were found among juveniles, with male juveniles at 29%. Adults were 5.58 times more likely to test positive for FIVple than juveniles, with adult males being 35 times more likely to be test positive for FIVple compared with juvenile males. This research represents the 1st epidemiological study of the lion lentivirus among free-ranging lions in the Kruger National Park.","399":"Knowledge about the acrosomal status of Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) sperm is extremely limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the viability and acrosomal status of Asian elephant sperm following induction by calcium ionophore and heparin using propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated peanut agglutinin (FITC-PNA). Semen samples were collected from elephant bulls by manual stimulation. Semen was diluted with extender, cooled to 4 degrees C and transported to a laboratory for the experiment. Sperm cells were incubated in modified Tyrode's medium containing either 1 mM calcium ionophore or 10 mg\/ml heparin for 5 h at 39 degrees C. Sperm recovered at the onset (0 h), 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h of incubation were simultaneously assessed for the viability and acrosomal status using dual staining of FITC-PNA and PI. Results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. A progressive increase in the proportion of live-acrosome reacted sperm was observed within 3 h of incubation in both treatment groups which slightly decreased at 4 to 5 h of incubation. At 1 to 3 h of incubation, the percentage of live-acrosome reacted sperm induced by calcium ionophore was higher (P &lt; 0.05) than those induced by heparin and the control. However, there were no statistical differences at 4 to 5 h of incubation. A progressive reduction of the percentage of motile sperm was observed in the control as well as both treatment groups. Sperm motility decreased sharply when they were incubated in calcium ionophore compared with incubation in heparin and control groups. These results indicate that the occurrence of live-acrosome reacted sperm in the Asian elephant was induced by calcium ionophore at a rate higher than that induced by heparin.","400":"For this study 48 non-infected muscle, lymphatic and visceral bovine tissue samples were collected from an approved red meat abattoir and spiked with 8 x 10(7) cfu\/ml of M. bovis. The different spiked samples were subjected to cooking and drying (drying through the process of biltong-making) processes in a controlled laboratory environment. Mycobacterial isolates confirmed as M. bovis by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were observed in 17 of a total of 576 samples that were exposed to the secondary processing method of cooking. The study showed that not only can M. bovis survive the cooking process but the survival of the bacterium will be determined by its unique adaptive changes to the surrounding composition of the environment. The results for the samples exposed to the drying process (n = 96) did not show any growth, suggesting that the process of biltong production as used in this study is likely to render infected meat safe for human consumption.","401":"The medical records of 2 Thoroughbred horses that developed headshaking after blunt trauma to the occipital region are reviewed. The history, signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic methods, diagnosis and treatment were recorded in each case. Both horses displayed headshaking, while one horse repeatedly lifted its upper lip and pawed excessively at the ground. In both horses, diagnostic imaging of the occipital region revealed avulsion fragments of the nuchal crest and a nuchal desmitis in association with hyperfibrinogenaemia. The presence of an avulsion fragment of the nuchal crest with associated nuchal desmitis should be considered in horses presenting with headshaking and may respond favourably to conservative therapy.","402":"A 9-year-old apparently healthy male African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) was found dead in its enclosure at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre. Necropsy revealed a pericardium distended by approximately 250 ml of thick blood. A soft, red, lobulated mass was attached to the periaortic fat between the level of the aortic valves and the pericardial reflection. Histologically, the mass was consistent with a haemangiosarcoma. Other findings in the heart included mild to moderate ventricular hypertrophy and moderate, acute perivascular myocardial necrosis. Sudden death was attributed to acute heart failure precipitated by cardiac tamponade.","403":"A 4-month-old male Jack Russell terrier was evaluated for non-painful muscle spasms and collapse associated with exercise and activity. Clinical examination revealed well-defined, non-painful hypertrophic muscles of the fore and hind limbs and exercise and excitement induced hindquarter bunny-hopping gait, which improved with activity but worsened with resting and with any sudden changes in direction of movement. Neurological examination and routine laboratory testing showed no abnormalities. DNA analysis for myotonia congenita showed the dog to have a gene mutation in the chloride ion channel, diagnostic for myotonia congenita, which has not been reported in the Jack Russell terrier breed.","404":"Over a period of approximately 1 year, 2 sibling Rottweilers and their dam in the same household developed stage IV and stage III lymphoma, respectively. All 3 initially responded to doxorubicin chemotherapy but relapsed after approximately 3 months and were subsequently euthanased. As no obvious environmental trigger could be identified in these dogs, it is speculated that an underlying genetic predisposition could have played a role in the development of lymphoma in these related dogs.","405":"An experiment was conducted to study the effect of a wild Ganoderma lucidum aqueous extract in coccidian-infected broilers. At 6 weeks of age the birds were randomly allocated to 6 treatment groups of 20 Ross broilers each in wire cages. Groups A, B and C were infected with Eimeria tenella Houghton strain at the rate of 36 250 sporulated oocysts\/ml per bird. The remaining 3 groups D, E and F were uninfected controls. At 7 weeks the birds in group A were treated with G. lucidum aqueous extract and those in B with amprolium in drinking water ad libitum at the rate of 200 mg\/ml each for 7 days consecutively. Body weight gain, feed intake, faecal oocyst output and some haematological parameters were monitored. The result showed that all the infected birds in groups A, B and C had clinical signs of weakness and reduced appetite on day 4 post-infection. By the 5th day post-infection their faeces became bloody and watery, and large numbers of E. tenella oocysts were present in the faeces. On day 3 after treatment the oocysts detected were considerably reduced in both treated groups A and B and slightly higher in the untreated group C. The faeces of the uninfected control groups were normal and free of coccidial oocysts. After treatment for 7 days no coccidial oocysts were found in faeces of the birds that had been treated. Infected, untreated birds showed a slight drop in feed intake and weight gain from 7 to 8 weeks of age. The final mean weight gain recorded in the treated groups A and B was comparable to that of the uninfected birds in the 3 control groups, while it was lower in the untreated group C. The feed to gain ratio was higher in C than in the other groups. A slight drop in packed cell volume was observed in groups A, B and C at 7 weeks of age, 1 week after infection. This study showed that treatment with G. lucidum results in a marked reduction in the number of E. tenella oocysts shed in the faeces, leading to improved weight gain and decreased weight loss. The results confirmed the virulence of the Houghton strain of E. tenella and the effectiveness of both amprolium and G. lucidum extract against E. tenella.","406":"Therapeutic efficacy and histological changes after bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), vincristine and BCG\/vincristine combination therapy of canine transmissible venereal tumours (CTVT) were studied. Twenty dogs with naturally occurring CTVT in the progression stage were divided into 4 groups and treated with intratumoral BCG, vincristine, BCG\/vincristine combination therapy or intratumoral buffered saline (control group). Tumour sizes were determined weekly and tumour response to therapy was assessed. Tumour biopsies were taken weekly to evaluate histological changes. Complete tumour regression was observed in all the dogs treated with BCG, vincristine and BCG\/vincristine combination therapy. BCG\/vincristine combination therapy had a statistically significantly shorter regression time than BCG or vincristine therapy. No tumour regression was observed in the control group. Intratumoral BCG treatment resulted in the appearance of macrophages and increased numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) followed by tumour cell apoptosis and necrosis. Treatment with vincristine resulted in increased tumour cell apoptosis, reduction in the mitotic index and a decrease in the number of TILs. Tumours from dogs on BCG\/vincristine combination were characterised by reduction in the mitotic index, and appearance of numerous TILs and macrophages followed by marked tumour cell apoptosis and necrosis. This study indicates that combined BCG and vincristine therapy is more effective than vincristine in treating CTVT, suggesting that the clinical course of this disease may be altered by immunochemotherapy.","407":"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a positive major acute-phase protein in dogs and can be used as a predictive marker for risk of disease and to monitor the response to treatment. Increased concentrations in certain diseases are associated with poor outcome. This cross-sectional, observational study of 75 dogs naturally infected with Babesia rossi was designed to examine the relationship between outcome and CRP concentration at admission and the magnitude of CRP change 24 hours after admission. Diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse line blot. CRP concentrations were determined by an automated human CRP Turbidometric Immunoassay, previously validated for use in dogs. There was no significant difference in mean CRP concentration between survivors (n = 57), 107.5 +\/- 49.5 mg\/l and non-survivors (n = 11), 122.1 +\/- 64.6 mg\/l at admission and using the exact logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex, there was no association with outcome (P = 0.53). Multiple regression analysis failed to show a significant relationship between admission CRP concentration and number of days of hospitalisation in the survivors, adjusting for age and sex (P = 0.65). Similarly, no significance was found in the relationship between the magnitude of change in CRP concentration 24 hours after admission, and the number of days of hospitalisation in survivors, (P = 0.34). It is concluded that CRP concentration, as a measure of the acute phase response, is not associated with outcome in canine babesiosis, and inflammation is unlikely to be the only cause of severity of disease.","408":null,"409":"In order to determine the analgesic and cardiovascular effects of the combination of epidural ketamine and lidocaine, 6 sedated cats were studied. Six healthy, young cats were used in a prospective randomised study. Each cat underwent 3 treatments, at least 1 week apart, via epidural injection: (1) ketamine (2.5 mg\/kg), (2) lidocaine (4.0 mg\/kg), and (3) ketamine (2.5 mg\/kg) plus lidocaine (4.0 mg\/kg). Epidural injections were administered through the lumbosacral space. Analgesia, motor block, sedation, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were measured. Rectal temperature was compared before and after sedation as well as after epidural administration of the drugs. Epidural administration of the ketamine\/lidocaine combination induced prolonged analgesia extending from the coccygeal to the T13-L1 dermatomes, leading to severe ataxia. Cardiovascular effects were significant in all treatments: heart rate decreased, but there was a minimal reduction in arterial pressure. It was concluded that adding a dose of ketamine to epidural lidocaine in cats is feasible and effective.","410":"Babesia canis and B. rossi are large Babesia species that infect dogs and cause clinical disease. The spectrum of disease is highly diverse with either parasite, but upon evaluation of field cases it has been suggested that in general B. rossi is more virulent than B. canis. This difference was also found in experimental infections using B. canis and B. rossi isolates and appeared to be related to a difference in parasitaemia. Whether this difference reflects the essential difference between B. canis and B. rossi species in general, or merely reflects the variability in virulence of individual isolates cannot be discerned. Comparative in vitro and in vivo studies revealed a number of qualitative differences between the B. canis and B. rossi isolates studied; however, more research is required to determine any causal relationship between in vitro and in vivo characteristics. Vaccination with a bivalent vaccine (containing soluble parasite antigen [SPA] from supernatants of in vitro cultures of B. canis and B. rossi) induced protection against clinical babesiosis upon challenge infection with either parasite. The dynamics of parasitaemia upon challenge infection of vaccinated animals indicated a biological difference between the B. canis and B. rossi isolates studied. Vaccinated dogs that were challenged with B. rossi parasites (2 isolates tested) effectively controlled parasitaemia. By contrast, in vaccinated dogs that were challenged with B. canis isolates (2 isolates tested) there was little or no effect on parasitaemia but levels of SPA in plasma were reduced. Apparently the nature of vaccine-induced immunity differs with respect to the challenge species.","411":"Plant poisoning occurs less commonly in dogs and cats than in herbivorous livestock, but numerous cases have been documented worldwide, most of them caused by common and internationally widely cultivated ornamental garden and house plants. Few cases of poisoning of cats and dogs have been reported in southern Africa, but many of the plants that have caused poisoning in these species elsewhere are widely available in the subregion and are briefly reviewed in terms of toxic principles, toxicity, species affected, clinical signs, and prognosis. The list includes Melia azedarach (syringa), Brunfelsia spp. (yesterday, today and tomorrow), Datura stramonium (jimsonweed, stinkblaar), a wide variety of lilies and lily-like plants, cycads, plants that contain soluble oxalates, plants containing cardiac glycosides and other cardiotoxins and euphorbias (Euphorbia pulcherrima, E. tirucalli). Poisoning by plant products such as macadamia nuts, onions and garlic, grapes and raisins, cannabis (marijuana, dagga) or hashish and castor oil seed or seedcake is also discussed. Many of the poisonings are not usually fatal, but others frequently result in death unless rapid action is taken by the owner and the veterinarian, underlining the importance of awareness of the poisonous potential of a number of familiar plants.","412":"African swine fever is one of the most important and serious diseases of domestic pigs. Its highly contagious nature and ability to spread over long distances make it one of the most feared diseases, since its devastating effects on pig production have been experienced not only in most of sub-Saharan Africa but also in western Europe, the Caribbean, Brazil and, most recently, the Caucasus. Unlike most diseases of livestock, there is no vaccine, and therefore prevention relies entirely upon preventing contact between the virus and the susceptible host. In order to do so it is necessary to understand the way in which the virus is transmitted and spreads. By implementing strict biosecurity measures that place barriers between the source of virus and the pigs it is possible to prevent infection. However, this has implications for free-ranging pig husbandry systems that are widespread in developing countries. Attempts to produce a vaccine are ongoing and new technology offers some hope for the future, but this will not remove the necessity for implementing adequate biosecurity on pig farms.","413":"Necropsy examination of a captive emaciated, dehydrated adult female Mole snake (Pseudaspis cana) in October 2007 revealed multiple cutaneous abscesses. Other findings included renal and hepatic atrophy, hepatic haemosiderosis, multifocal granulomatous hepatitis associated with acid-fast bacteria as well as pulmonary congestion and oedema. Large numbers of the nematode Kalicephalus colubri colubri were recovered from the oesophagus and stomach, representing the 1st reported case of K. colubri from a Mole snake in South Africa. The lesions caused by K. c. colubri were insignificant, but the presence of worms may have contributed to weight loss.","414":"A sheep farmer provided a maize-based brewer's grain (mieliemaroek) and bales of Eragrostis curvula hay to ewes and their lambs, kept on zero-grazing in pens. The 'mieliemaroek' was visibly mouldy. After 14 days in the feedlot, clinical signs, including generalised weakness, ataxia of the hind limbs, tremors and recumbency, were noticed. Six ewes died within a period of 7 days. A post mortem examination was performed on 1 ewe. The carcass appeared to be cachectic with mild effusions into the body cavities; mild lung congestion and pallor of the kidneys were observed. Microscopical evaluation revealed nephrosis and birefringent oxalate crystals in the renal tubules when viewed under polarised light. A provisional diagnosis of oxalate nephrosis with subsequent kidney failure was made. Amongst other fungi, Aspergillus niger was isolated from 'mieliemaroek' samples submitted for fungal culture and identification. As A. niger is known to synthesise oxalates, a qualitative screen to detect oxalic acid in the mieliemaroek and purified A. niger isolates was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Oxalic acid was detected, which supported a diagnosis of soluble oxalate-induced nephropathy.","415":"A serological survey of leptospirosis in cattle originating from rural communities of the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in South Africa was carried out between March 2001 and December 2003. The survey was designed as a 2-stage survey, using the local diptank as the primary sampling point. In total, 2021 animals from 379 diptanks in 33 magisterial districts were sampled and tested with the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The apparent prevalence at district level was adjusted for clustering and diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity and displayed in maps. The prevalence of leptospirosis in cattle originating from communal grazing areas of KZN was found to be 19.4% with a 95% confidence interval of 14.8-24.1%. At district level the prevalence of leptospirosis varied from 0 to 63% of cattle. Bovine leptospirosis was found to occur in communal grazing areas throughout the province with the exception of 2 districts. The southeastern regions showed a higher prevalence than other areas of the province; while in some of the northern and western districts a lower prevalence was noted. Several serovars were detected by the MAT and although Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona occurred most frequently, serovars tarrasovi, bratislava, hardjo, canicola and icterohaemorrhagica were also frequently identified. The findings of the survey are discussed.","416":"A newly formulated colistin sulphate solution was prepared in a previous study as a potential agent for intramuscular injection and its effectiveness, toxicity and pharmacokinetics were investigated. In order to provide more information to establish scientific guidance for safe use of this preparation, its residue depletion in swine tissues following intramuscular administration was investigated in this experiment. Fifty healthy cross-bred piglets (13.3 +\/- 0.9 kg) were used in this study. Five animals were kept as untreated controls and the other 45 animals were intramuscularly injected with the colistin preparation at a dose of 2.5 mg\/kg of body weight. From the treated piglets, 5 animals were randomly selected and sacrificed at different withdrawal times. Liver, kidney and muscle tissues were sampled to examine the colistin residue levels by microbiological assay. The results showed that the colistin residue in liver and muscle decreased quickly and could not be detected at 1 day after the final dosing. However, the residue depletion in the kidneys was much slower than that in other tissues and even a small quantity of drug could be detected at 14 days after withdrawal. Using the method recommended by the Committee for Veterinary Medical Products (CVMP), a withdrawal time of 10 days was established for the safe use of the newly formulated colistin sulphate solution.","417":"In humans the combined administration of epidural anaesthesia and inhalation anaesthesia may result in cardiovascular instability associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure. Anaesthesia was induced with a combination of midazolam\/ketamine in 18 female pigs with a mean body weight of 24.9 +\/- 5.9 kg scheduled for surgical removal of the liver. After tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained on a circle rebreathing circuit with isoflurane. Epidural anaesthesia was administered with ropivacaine (AL-group, n = 8) at 0.2 ml\/kg of a 7.5 mg\/ml solution to the anaesthetised animals. The A-group (n = 10) received isoflurane anaesthesia only. The vaporiser was set at 2.5% for the A-group and 1.5% for the AL-group. Heart rate, invasive systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure were monitored. Comparisons were made between treatments and within treatments comparing variables during surgical preparation and abdominal surgery. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) during surgical preparation or during abdominal surgery. For within treatment groups, the differences between surgical preparation and abdominal surgery were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) for heart rate in the A-group, but not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) for the other variables. It is concluded that abdominal surgery may be associated with statistically significant changes in heart rate in isoflurane-anaesthetised pigs and that the combined administration of epidural ropivacaine may prevent statistically significant changes in HR during abdominal surgery.","418":"In 1999 a dedicated problem-based learning course was introduced into the lecture-based preclinical veterinary curriculum of the University of Pretoria. The Introduction to Clinical Studies Course combines traditional lectures, practical sessions, student self-learning and guided tutorials. The self-directed component of the course utilises case-based, small-group cooperative learning as an educational vehicle to link basic science with clinical medicine. The aim of this article is to describe the objectives and structure of the course and to report the results of the assessment of the students' perceptions on some aspects of the course. Students reacted very positively to the ability of the course to equip them with problem-solving skills. Students indicated positive perceptions about the workload of the course. There were, however, significantly lower scores for the clarity of the course objectives. Although the study guide for the course is very comprehensive, the practice regarding the objectives is still uncertain. It is imperative to set clear objectives in non-traditional, student-centred courses. The objectives have to be explained at the outset and reiterated throughout the course. Tutors should also communicate the rationale behind problem-based learning as a pedagogical method to the students. Further research is needed to verify the effectiveness of this course in bridging the gap between basic science and clinical literacy in veterinary science. Ongoing feedback and assessment of the management and content are important to refine this model for integrating basic science with clinical literacy.","419":"The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of 6 different dry-cow intramammary antimicrobial products for the treatment and prevention of mastitis during the dry period in a well-managed high producing Friesland dairy herd, and the influence of treatment on the somatic cell count (SCC) of cows during early lactation. One of 6 dry-cow intramammary antimicrobial products was randomly allocated to 162 cows due for drying off over a period of 14 months. All cows were sampled twice prior to drying off, and twice after calving for the determination of SCC and presence of microorganisms. The quarter prevalence of pathogens at drying off and post-calving, the overall quarter cure rate and the rate of new intramammary infections occurring during the dry period were determined. The overall quarter prevalence of intramammary infections (IMIs) at drying off was 29.78% and after calving 22.22%. There was a statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) between the prevalence of major and minor pathogens at drying off (7.87% and 21.91%) and at calving (4.47% and 17.75%). The most prevalent pathogens isolated at drying off (21.14%) and at calving (16.98%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The quarter cure rate during the dry period was 83.94%. The cure rate for the major pathogens (98%) was significantly better (P &lt; 0.05) than that for minor pathogens (78.9%). The overall quarter cure rate varied from 72.3% to 93.9% for the various products. The rate of new quarter infections during the dry period was 17.44% with a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05), between the prevalence of new quarter infections with major (4.32%) and minor pathogens (13.12%). CNS was the most prevalent pathogen causing new quarter infections (12.34%) and the rate of new quarter infections varied from 13.4% to 24.1% for the various products. It is concluded that there is a difference in efficacy between antimicrobial intramammary dry-cow products in their ability to cure and prevent new IMIs during the dry period. Dry-cow products are mainly formulated for efficacy against Gram-positive cocci, while providing no or little protection against Gram-negative bacteria. Therapeutic levels may persist for only 14 to 28 days into the dry period and fail to protect the udder during the last trimester. Dry-cow therapy should, however, always form part of a holistic approach to the dry period which also considers cow factors, dry-cow management, microorganisms and the environment of the dry cow.","420":"The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples obtained from South African dairy herds during the period 1996 to April 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. Milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9 provinces in South Africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. Although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general udder health in South Africa. Cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. According to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease in South Africa over the test period. The prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. Mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. The percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. Previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta haemolytic Staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae. Although Staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in South Africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. This finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described as a minor pathogen) significantly. Isolations of Streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus canis were isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while Enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.","421":"The sedative, propofol-sparing and cardiopulmonary effects of acepromazine, midazolam, butorphanol and combinations of butorphanol with acepromazine or midazolam in goats were evaluated. Six healthy Boer - Indigenous African crossbreed goats were by randomised cross-over designated to 6 groups: Group SAL that received saline, Group ACE that received acepromazine, Group MID that received midazolam, Group BUT that received butorphanol, Group ACEBUT that received acepromazine and butorphanol and Group MIDBUT that received midazolam and butorphanol as premedication agents intramuscularly on different occasions at least 3 weeks apart. The degree of sedation was assessed 20 minutes after administration of the premedication agents. Thirty minutes after premedication, the dose of propofol required for induction of anaesthesia adequate to allow placement of an endotracheal tube was determined. Cardiovascular, respiratory and arterial blood-gas parameters were assessed up to 30 minutes after induction of general anaesthesia. Acepromazine and midazolam produced significant sedation when administered alone, but premedication regimens incorporating butorphanol produced inconsistent results. The dose of propofol required for induction of anaesthesia was significantly reduced in goats that received midazolam alone, or midazolam combined with either acepromazine or butorphanol. The quality of induction of anaesthesia was good in all groups, including the control group. Cardiovascular, respiratory and blood-gas parameters were within normal limits in all groups and not significantly different between or within all groups. sedation with midazolam alone, or midazolam combined with either acepromazine or butorphanol significantly reduces the induction dose of propofol with minimal cardiopulmonary effects in goats. ","422":"The volatile anaesthetic agents halothane, isoflurane and enflurane are all chlorofluorocarbons and according to international treaties, their emission into the atmosphere will be prohibited from the year 2030. The agents desflurane and sevoflurane are fluorinated hydrocarbons and act as greenhouse gases. The future of veterinary anaesthesia could be dependent on the development of total intravenous anaesthesia. Drugs utilised in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) should have a short duration of action and no tendency to accumulate in the body. Propofol has been the dominant agent used. Computer technology has enabled targeted plasma concentration controlled infusions to replace manual infusion regimens. This study simulated the pharmacokinetics of various infusion regimens similar to those used in clinical practice using previously published pharmocokinetic data. Bolus doses of 0, 4, 6 and 8 mg\/kg were simulated in combination with infusion rates of 0, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg\/kg\/min for either 240 or 1440 min. The computer was also programmed to maintain a steady state plasma concentration based on the previous simulated data. Generated data were then compared with published data. Changes in the context-sensitive half-life for propofol were also evaluated. Results showed that the generated data were similar to published data. A decrease in plasma concentration to levels associated with a light plane of anaesthesia was evident even when the highest bolus dose and infusion rate were used. There was a slow rise in plasma concentration when only an infusion was used. A lightening of anaesthetic plane may be evident early in the course of TIVA and careful monitoring of anaesthetic depth is required. As the duration of the infusion increased, plasma concentration steadily rose but achieved 95% of the steady state by 204 min. The most dramatic changes in plasma concentration occurred in the first hour of an infusion. Similarly, the infusion rates decreased most in the first 70 min. Most changes in anaesthetic depth are likely to occur early in the course of TIVA and careful observation of anaesthetic depth is required.","423":"The influence of increasing the dosage of ketamine on anaesthesia induced by a combination of ketamine, xylazine and midazolam in pigs was determined by assessing the onset of action (OAN), duration of analgesia (DAN), anaesthesia time (ANT), and recovery time (RCT) in 10 growing pigs (Mean weight: 18.2 +\/- 1.65 kg) receiving either 10 mg\/kg intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 10% ketamine, 2 mg\/kg i.m. injection of 2% xylazine and 0.25 mg\/kg i.m. injection of 0.1% midazolam (K10XM) or 20 mg\/kg i.m. injection of ketamine and 2 mg\/kg i.m. injection of xylazine and 0.25 mg\/kg i.m. injection of 0.1% midazolam (K20XM). In addition, the heart rates (HR), respiratory rates (RR) and rectal temperatures (RT) were determined immediately after drug administration and at 10 minute intervals over a period of 60 minutes. Analgesia was assessed by the response of the pigs to artery forceps applied at the interdigital space. Recovery was determined as pigs' ability to stand without ataxia. Data were expressed as mean +\/- SEM while anaesthetic indices were compared using Student's t-tests. A P value of 0.05 was accepted as significant in all cases. In this study, both the OAN and RCT were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) shorter in K10XM (1.4 +\/- 0.2 min; 7.8 +\/- 2.2 min) than in K20XM (2.2 +\/- 0.2; 18.6 +\/- 1.4 min) respectively. Similarly, the duration of anaesthesia was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) shorter in K10XM (55.4 +\/- 8.4 min) than in K20XM (92.0 +\/- 13.6 min). The pigs that received K20XM combination had analgesia of duration of 41.4 +\/- 12.6 min while those that received K10XM combination had no analgesia. However, the HR, RR, and RT were not significantly (P &gt; 0.05) different between K10XM and K20XM. It was therefore concluded that the lower dose ketamine combination is better for the induction of anaesthesia, while the higher dose ketamine combination is preferable for surgery of short duration in pigs.","424":"Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis (EME) has been described in various species of animals and in humans. In dogs it has been associated with protozoal infections, cuterebral myiasis and various other aetiologies. Ten cases of idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis have been reported in dogs and one in a cat where the origin was uncertain or unknown. The dogs were all males, of various breeds but with a predominance of Golden Retrievers and Rottweilers; they generally had a young age of onset. Two cases with no apparent underlying aetiology were diagnosed on post mortem examination. The 18-month-old, male Boerboel presented with sudden onset of cerebellar ataxia, as well as various asymmetrical cranial nerve deficits of 2 weeks' duration and without progression. Haematology revealed a peripheral eosinophilia. Necropsy showed extreme generalised congestion especially of the meninges and blood smear and histological sections of various tissues showed intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation with the formation of microcytes. Histopathology revealed severe diffuse cerebrocortical subarachnoidal meningitis and submeningeal encephalitis, the exudate containing variable numbers of eosinophils together with neutrophils and mononuclear cells. There was also deeper white matter and hippocampal multifocal perivascular mononuclear encephalitis and multifocal periventricular malacia, gliosis and phagocytosis of white matter. The cerebellum, brain stem and spinal c showed only mild multifocal oedema or scattered occasional axon and myelin degeneration respectively, with no inflammation. Immunohistochemical staining of central nervous tissue for Toxoplasma gondii failed to show any antigen in the central nervous tissue. Ultrastructure of a single submeningeal suspected parasitic cyst showed it to be chromatin clumping within a neuron nucleus indicating karyorrhexis. Gram stain provided no evidence of an aetiological agent. The 3-year-old Beagle bitch had a Caesarian section after developing a non-responsive inertia 8 days prior to presentation. This animal's clinical signs included status epilepticus seizures unrelated to hypocalcaemia and warranted induction of a barbiturate coma. She died 4 hours later. Post mortem and histopathological findings in the brain were almost identical to those of the Boerboel and she also showed histological evidence of recent active intravascular haemolysis with microcyte formation. Rabies, distemper and Neospora caninum immunohistochemical stains were negative in the brains of both dogs. Immunohistochemical staining of the cerebral and meningeal exudates of the Beagle for T- and B-lymphocyte (CD3 and CD79a) markers showed a predominance of T-lymphocytes with fewer scattered B lymphocytes. A possible allergic response to amoxicillin\/clavulanate is considered, as this appeared to be the only feature common to the recent history of both animals. An overview of EME in humans, dogs and cats is given and the previously published cases of idiopathic EME in dogs and the single published cat case are briefly reviewed.","425":"Four horses were presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital with histories of facial asymmetry, nasal discharge or obstruction of normal nasal passage airflow. Radiographic examination of the maxillary sinuses of 2 cases revealed well circumscribed, unilateral, mineralised masses; the other 2 cases showed less mineralisation. The masses were accessed for further investigation by surgically created frontonasal bone flaps or trephination of the maxillary sinuses. Diagnosis of osteoma was confirmed histopathologically in 3 of the cases and of ossifying fibroma in the 4th. Two horses were euthanased directly after surgical intervention due to poor prognosis. Osteomas are by nature expansile tumours and follow the complex communication of the sinuses, and therefore are not all amenable to surgical removal. Osseous fibromas are large, solitary, expansile lesions that are rare in all species but reported most frequently in horses. They have an apparent predilection for the rostral mandible of the horse.","426":"Changes in the oesophageal diameter and function together with changes in body weight, feed intake and the cardiac pulmonary flow index were investigated during experimentally induced poisoning with Geigeria ornativa and subsequent recovery. This was performed under varying conditions for individual sheep. Results showed an increase in the oesophageal diameter index (ODI) during vermeersiekte, accompanied with a decrease in oesophageal function (OF). Cessation of G. ornativa intake resulted in a considerable although incomplete recovery of the ODI. Recovery of the OF for the different sheep, however, varied between 0 and 100%. Detrimental changes in the oesophageal diameter and function were also measured in sheep receiving only subclinical doses of G. ornativa. Decreases in body weight and feed intake commenced 1 to 3 weeks before the onset of vermeersiekte, while indications of a decline in these 2 parameters were also noticed with ingestion of subclinical amounts of G. ornativa. An increase in the cardiac pulmonary flow index (CPFI) to a value indicating the onset of heart failure was found in 1 of the sheep showing clinical signs of vermeersiekte. The CPFI returned to normal after termination of G. ornativa intake.","427":"Assessment of canine gait is frequently used by veterinary clinicians to establish the presence of orthopaedic pain. As up to 30% of canine orthopaedic conditions affect the pelvic limb, knowledge of pelvic limb biomechanics during gait is very important. Previous studies have investigated the biomechanics at the tarsus and stifle, but little information is available regarding hip motion during gait. The aim of this study was to determine the maximum hip extension range achieved during the stance phase of gait in normal canines. In addition, this study aimed to determine the difference between maximum passive hip extension and maximum hip extension during gait. Using a sample of 30 morphologically similar normal dogs, mean maximum passive hip extension was measured using a goniometer and mean maximum hip extension range during gait was determined videographically. Inter- and intra-assessor reliability studies performed at the start of the study showed that the measurement tools and techniques used in this study were valid and reliable. The goniometric data showed that mean maximum passive hip extension range was 162.44 degrees (+\/-3.94) with no significant difference between the left and the right hind limbs. The videographic data showed that mean maximum hip extension range during gait was 119.9 degrees (+\/-9.26) with no significant difference between the left and right hind limbs. The results of this study provided reference values for active and passive hip extension range and showed that the degree of hip extension range required for normal gait is significantly less than maximum passive hip extension range.","428":"In the veterinary industry, short-acting or conventional oxytetracycline formulations are recommended for use once a day for 4 days, at a dose of 10 mg\/kg. With the large degree of antimicrobial resistance reported, the efficacy of this dose was assessed using pharmacodynamic modelling. The specific parameters evaluated were based on the time-dependent activity of the tetracycline class of antimicrobials according to the total time above minimal inhibitory concentration (T &gt; MIC) and the ratio of the total exposure in 24 hours, represented by area under the curve (AUC24), to the minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC24:MIC). The current pharmacokinetic study examined whether the prevailing antimicrobial resistance could be overcome by doubling the recommended conventional dose. Using reported MIC data for South Africa and elsewhere, modelling indicated the presence of a large degree of resistance. In general, doubling the dose only overcame resistance of 2 bacterial species in South Africa.","429":"Three hundred rectal faecal samples and 213 raw milk samples obtained from the tanks and containers were examined using standard cultural methods. Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 (3.7%) of 300 faecal samples and 3 (1.4%) of 213 raw milk samples. It was determined that 8 (73%) of E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from faecal samples originated from water buffaloes younger than 2 years of age and 3 (27%) from 2-year-old and older water buffaloes. This is the 1st isolation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from faecal and milk samples of water buffaloes in Turkey.","430":"Antimicrobial usage in food animals increases the prevalence of antimicrobial drug resistance among their enteric bacteria. It has been suggested that this resistance can in turn be transferred to people working with such animals, e.g., abattoir workers. Antimicrobial drug resistance was investigated for Escherichia coli from broilers raised on feed supplemented with antimicrobials, and the people who carry out evisceration, washing and packing of intestines in a high-throughput poultry abattoir in Gauteng, South Africa. Broiler carcasses were sampled from 6 farms, on each of which broilers are produced in a separate 'grow-out cycle'. Per farm, 100 caeca were randomly collected 5 minutes after slaughter and the contents of each were selectively cultured for E. coli. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each isolate was determined for the following antimicrobials: doxycycline, trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, enrofloxacin, fosfomycin, ceftriaxone and nalidixic acid. The same was determined for the faeces of 29 abattoir workers and 28 persons used as controls. The majority of isolates from broilers were resistant, especially to antimicrobials that were used on the farms in the study. Overall median MICs and the number of resistant isolates from abattoir workers (packers plus eviscerators) tended to be higher than for the control group. However, no statistically significant differences were observed when the median MICs of antimicrobials used regularly in poultry and percentage resistance were compared, nor could an association between resistance among the enteric E. coli from packers and those from broilers be demonstrated.","431":"Pollution affects aquatic systems worldwide and there is an urgent need for efficient monitoring. Fish are generally sensitive to their environment and are thus considered to be valuable bioindicator species. The African Sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) is particularly important in this respect because of its very wide distribution. In order to use C. gariepinus as a bioindicator species its baseline clinical chemistry must be defined. Existing data are scarce, and the objective of this work was therefore to establish clinical chemistry parameters for C. gariepinus. Blood was collected from male and female catfish and a number of clinical chemistry parameters were determined. Plasma protein values, but particularly those of plasma albumin, were found to be very low, approximately half the value for dogs, but similar to the values in Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Plasma urea values in Sharptooth catfish were found to be much lower than in dogs, but only marginally lower than in Channel catfish. Plasma creatinine in Sharptooth catfish, however, was only a quarter of that of dogs and one third of that found in Channel catfish. These findings may have implications for using urea and\/or creatinine as an index of renal glomerular filtration, as is done in mammals. Plasma enzyme activity ranges were much lower in Sharptooth catfish than in dogs, particularly for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). By comparison, Channel catfish have an even lower ALT activity range but an ALP range that is very similar to dogs. The implications for using these enzymes as markers for liver disease are not clear from these data, as factors such as plasma half-life and tissue distribution remain to be determined. The very low plasma thyroxine (T4) levels have important implications for laboratory personnel, who will have to set up calibration and standardisation adaptations for the methods that are generally designed for human samples. Although the sample size was too small for reliable comparisons, it appeared that there was little difference in the parameters measured between male and female fish. The values obtained are a useful starting point for using C. gariepinus as a bioindicator species.","432":"A study was conducted to investigate the possibility of measuring the electrical conductivity (EC) of cow's milk as a practical and cost-effective means of determining oestrus in cows. Prostaglandin injections were used to synchronise the oestrous cycle of 15 cows. From the onset of oestrus, milk and blood samples were collected from each cow every 2nd day over a period of 22 days. A portable, commercially available instrument was used to measure the EC of the milk. The blood progesterone levels were determined by means of an enzyme immuno-assay method. No correlation was found between the EC of milk and the blood progesterone levels of the cows tested. Electrical conductivity measurements of milk are of no value in determining the onset of oestrus in cows.","433":"Three out of 10 Nicobar pigeons (Caloenas nicobaria) in an aviary collection in South Africa were found dead with no presenting clinical symptoms. Histological examination of formalin-fixed tissues from all these birds revealed necrotic foci in various visceral organs (liver, spleen, heart, kidney and lungs), plus diffuse pulmonary congestion and oedema with vasculitis. Numerous protozoal tachyzoites were present in all organs and there was strong positive immunohistochemical (IHC) labelling of these organisms for Toxoplasma gondii. Pathology was consistent with acute systemic toxoplasmosis as a consequence of oocyst ingestion. Feral cats were known to be a problem at the facility. Clinical toxoplasmosis is rarely reported in pigeons and this is believed to be the 1st report of toxoplasmosis in Nicobar pigeons.","434":"A 10-year-old Thoroughbred mare was presented for lameness of the left hindlimb as a result of an apical fracture of the lateral proximal sesamoid bone. The mare was ultimately euthanased after suffering catastrophic fractures of the 3rd and 4th metatarsal bones of the contra-lateral hindlimb during an uncoordinated attempt to rise during recovery from general anaesthesia after undergoing arthroscopic surgery. The case report focuses mostly on horse anaesthesia-related mortality, anaesthetic procedure in the horse, possible causes of fractures in horses during recovery and ways in which rate of occurrence of these fractures can be minimised.","435":"The aim of this study was to propose equations to predict changes that occur over time in the angular position of the bones during motion and the angular velocity of the bones in forward motion as a consequence of tibiotarsal rotation (TTR) in ostriches aged 14 months. Twenty-four normal 14-month-old ostriches (12 cocks and 12 hens) and 20 birds with TTR (9 cocks and 11 hens) were used in the study. Daily readings of temperature, relative humidity and rainfall, the lengths of the different segments of the legs and wings, the perpendicular height from the top of the torso to ground level and the length of the erect neck were recorded. Measurements of the degree of valgus deformity in the left foot were made where applicable. TTR hens and cocks were smaller in stature than normal birds. Comparing TTR hens and cocks, the toe, claw, humerus, perpendicular height and angle of rotation were larger in cocks, indicating a larger body in cocks. Hens were more severely affected by TTR. We suggest that the equations used in this study will assist in measuring movement of ostriches and how movement is compromised by overcrowding and TTR. Birds suffering from TTR may experience an increased degree of stress due to movement restrictions in confinement.","436":"Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is an economically important disease primarily of domestic cattle with a high case fatality rate. It is caused by either alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1 (AlHV-1) or ovine herpesvirus type 2 (OvHV-2). The major reservoir host of AlHV-1 is the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), but it is generally accepted that the black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) is also a reservoir host. No viral studies in the black wildebeest have been reported and the carrier status of black wildebeest has not been documented. Specimens were collected from several game farms and conservation areas in central South Africa representing the geographical area historically linked to the natural habitat of the black wildebeest. Specimens were obtained from 304 black wildebeest of different ages and sex, as well as 51 black wildebeest foetuses at different stages of gestation. Virus was isolated from a black wildebeest calf. Morphological features and antigenic characteristics suggested it to be a gammaherpesvirus closely related to AlHV-1. All serum samples tested positive with a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CI-ELISA) for group-specific malignant catarrhal fever virus antibody. A SYBR Green real-time PCR assay was developed for the detection of gammaherpesviral DNA. Only 15.8 % of the animals tested positive with the real-time PCR assay whereas 90 % of the foetuses tested positive. This finding suggests that, unlike OvHV-2 infection in lambs in which the infection takes place after weaning, the virus in black wildebeest is mainly transmitted in utero or soon after birth. The results suggest that black wildebeest are latent carriers of a gammaherpesvirus similar or closely related to AlHV-1 present in blue wildebeest and that it is likely that all black wildebeest are persistently infected.","437":"In order to determine the extent of acaricide resistance in the eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province 1-, 2- and 3-host ticks were collected from cattle at 59 dip-tanks over a period of 2 years. These ticks were tested for resistance against 3 compounds, namely amitraz, cypermethrin and chlorfenvinphos. The Shaw Larval Immersion Test detected emerging resistance to amitraz in Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus at 2 dip-tanks and resistance at a 3rd. It also revealed resistance in this tick to cypermethrin at 1 dip-tank and emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos at 8 dip-tanks and resistance at 2. Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi was susceptible to amitraz and cypermethrin at all dip-tanks, but showed emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos at 7 dip-tanks and resistance at 4. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus was susceptible to amitraz and chlorfenvinphos at all dip-tanks and demonstrated emerging resistance to cypermethrin at 1. With the exception of R. (B.) microplus, in which emerging resistance to amitraz was detected at 1 dip-tank by the Reproductive Estimate Test, all 3 tick species at all dip-tanks at which sufficient numbers of ticks had been collected were susceptible to the 3 acaracides in both the Egg Laying Test and the Reproductive Estimate Test. The localities at which acaricide resistance was recorded were mapped.","438":"Thermometric data loggers were surgically implanted in 15 impala (Aepyceros melampus) to investigate the consequences of chemical capture. Impala were darted and chemically immobilised for 30 min with each of the following drug combinations: etorphine and azaperone; etorphine and medetomidine; thiafentanil and azaperone, and a thiafentanil medetomidine combination. During immobilisation, pulse oximeter readings, respiratory rhythm, the plane of immobilisation and plasma cortisol concentrations were measured and recorded. The impala developed an extremely high rise in body temperature, which peaked 20-30 min after reversal of the immobilisation. The magnitude of the rise in body temperature was similar for all the drug combinations (F = 0.8, P = 0.5), but the duration of the hyperthermia was shorter when the thiafentanil and azaperone combination was used (F = 3.35, P &lt; 0.05). Changes in body temperature were related to the time that it took for an animal to become recumbent after darting (r2 = 0.45, P = 0.006) and not to the effect of the drug combination on time to recumbency (r2 = 0.29, P = 0.46). The relationship between time to recumbency and body temperature change, and also to plasma cortisol concentration (r2 = 0.67, P = 0.008), indicated that physiological consequences of capture were related to the duration of exposure to a stressor, and not to the pharmacology of the capture drugs. Although shorter time to recumbency in individuals resulted in the benefit of smaller stress responses and body temperature changes, those individuals were predisposed to developing hypoxia and possibly induction apnoea. When animals are chemically immobilised, reducing the thermal consequences of capture requires limiting the exposure of the animal to a psychological 'fright stress'.","439":"The purpose of this study was to determine the species spectrum of ticks infesting goats owned by resource-limited farmers in the state-owned communal land areas of Zimbabwe. Ticks were collected from goats at a single locality within each of 5 communal land areas, and a total of 14 ixodid tick species was recovered. The most numerous tick was Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, which was present in all areas at each sampling, and a Rhipicephalus sp. (near R. punctatus), which was most abundant on goats in the central regions of Zimbabwe during the March rainy season. Amblyomma hebraeum was present on goats in all areas sampled. In the eastern central region its distribution overlapped that of Amblyomma variegatum, while in the northwest it overlapped those of both Amblyomma marmoreum and A. variegatum. Hyalomma truncatum was present at all localities, whereas only a single Hyalomma rufipes was recovered. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus was collected from goats in the moist, slightly cooler regions, while the few Rhipicephalus zambeziensis recovered were present in the hotter, drier regions. Species recorded in lower numbers were Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus, Rhipicephalus lunulatus, Rhipicephalus simus, Rhipicephalus tricuspis and Rhipicephalus turanicus. Attachment in the inter-digital space of adult A. hebreaum and H. truncatum was sometimes associated with lameness.","440":"In this study, milk and blood samples collected simultaneously from 532 trade cows to be slaughtered at Bodija abattoir, Ibadan (southwestern, Nigeria) were examined for antibodies to Brucella using the milk ring test (MRT) and the rose bengal test (RBT). Overall, 18.61% of the milk samples were positive according to the MRT, while 9.77% of the serum samples were positive according to the RBT. The difference was highly significant (Chi-square value 16.33; P &lt; 0.05); only 32 (6.02%) of the samples were positive for both tests. The Red Bororo breed of cattle and the White Fulani had the highest positive rates, namely 20.93% and 11.69% for the MRT and RBT respectively. No conclusion can be drawn about sensitivity because we do not know the true status of the animals tested. It is, however, obvious that although the MRT and RBT are 1st-line screening tests for brucellosis in cows in some countries, their lack of specificity is of concern. Therefore, the requirement for other confirmatory tests that are more specific should be considered for control and eradication of the disease, especially in Nigeria.","441":"Ruminants that for any reason are unable to eat enough to survive can be supported via rumen fistulation. To successfully accomplish this task, an understanding of rumen physiology is necessary. Some adaptation and modification of the normal physiological processes will be necessary because the extended time normally required to ingest food will, for obvious practical reasons, be reduced to a few minutes repeated once to three times a day. The physiology of significance to aphagic or dysphagic animals is discussed and relevant examples of clinical cases are used to illustrate practical applications.","442":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in dogs is rarely reported and has not previously been documented in South Africa. A case of a stray Maltese crossbreed dog with extensive multifocal pulmonary tuberculosis due to M. tuberculosis is described. Pulmonary granulomas in this case were poorly encapsulated and contained large numbers of acid-fast bacteria, highlighting the potential for infected companion animals to excrete the pathogen. Treatment of canine tuberculosis is generally not advised, and for this reason, euthanasia of diseased animals must be advocated in most instances. Physicians and veterinarians must be aware that companion animals with active disease caused by M. tuberculosis could act as a potential source of infection.","443":"Commercially reared ostriches at Msengi farm situated in the Chinhoyi area of Mashonaland West province in Zimbabwe were found to be infected with the 'oriental eye fluke', Philopthalmus gralli, in 2001. This was the ist record of the fluke in Zimbabwe. Trials were conducted to identify a suitable drug for the treatment of this fluke. A total of 12 ostriches confirmed to be infected with the fluke through clinical examination of the eyes and identification of the fluke were randomly divided into 3 equal groups, with each group receiving a different treatment protocol. The 3 drugs used were doramectin, levamisole and closantel. Each of the drugs was used in combination with chloramphenicol as an eye ointment. Levamisole was administered topically into the eye whereas doramectin and closantel were administered parenterally as an intramuscular injection. The results indicated a positive response in levamisole-treated birds but there were no noticeable responses to doramectin and closantel treatments.","444":"An outbreak of chlamydiosis was diagnosed in hatchling and juvenile Indopacific crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) on a crocodile farm in Papua New Guinea. The outbreak was characterised by high mortality with hepatitis and exudative conjunctivitis. The agent appears to have been introduced with live wild-caught crocodiles, which are purchased routinely by the farm. Improved quarantine procedures and treatment with tetracycline led to a rapid reduction of losses on the farm.","445":"A case-control study was carried out to investigate a syndrome in smallholder dairy cattle in East Usambara Mountains characterised by urination of clotted blood. Smallholder dairy farms with the problem (cases) were matched with nearest farms without the problem (controls). In total, 30 farmers from Mbomole (19), Shebomeza (9) and Mlesa (2) villages in Amani division participated in the study. Using a structured questionnaire, information on risk factors associated with conditions characterised by passage of red urine in cattle was collected. In addition, serum samples from 80 smallholder dairy animals were collected and submitted for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis and babesiosis by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Laboratory analysis showed that the seroprevalence of leptospirosis and babesiosis was 21.3% and 46.3%, respectively and there was no significant difference between'case' and 'control' farms (P &gt; 0.05), hence the occurrence of urination of clotted blood syndrome in Amani was not explained. However, bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) was found to be ubiquitous in the area, and also found to be widespread in all areas used as sources of animal fodder Given the presence and distribution of bracken ferns and clinical signs and post-mortem lesions described by informants, chronic bracken-fern poisoning is more likely to be associated with the syndrome affecting animals in the study area. However, further investigation is required to confirm this observation so that appropriate control strategies can be devised.","446":"A study to detect human taeniasis and cysticercosis was conducted in 4 village communities served by the Bethanie clinic in the North West Province, based on reports of people being diagnosed there with epileptiform episodes. Many home owners in the villages rear pigs in small numbers for both meat availability and an immediate income from live pig or pig meat sales. The primary aim of the work was to conduct in the study area a census of all small scale pig producers and a survey of rural village consumers, both by means of a structured questionnaire. The former reviewed pig husbandry practices, slaughter and marketing of pigs and the latter provided information on pork consumption, sanitation as well as people's basic knowledge of Taenia solium. Stool samples from consenting participants were screened by a contracted approved laboratory for IR solium. A descriptive analysis of retrospective data was conducted at the Bethanie clinic to determine the proportional morbidity of neurocysticercosis from the medical records of patients diagnosed with seizures in an attempt to establish possible sources of infection and routes of transmission. In addition, the total pig population in the study area was determined more accurately and the prevalence of cysticercosis investigated in pigs subjected to meat inspection at an approved abattoir. The questionnaires revealed a poor understanding of the disease, poor sanitation and hygiene, poor methods of pig husbandry and poor meat inspection and control in rural smallholder communities. There was no significant statistical difference in the proportion of households reporting evidence of epilepsy and owning pigs and those that did not. There is a strong evidence of a tendency towards an association between epilepsy, consumption habits and some identified epidemiological risk factors.","447":"The possibility of coagulopathy in Babesia canis rossi infections in the canine patient has been suggested in the literature, but minimal work has been done to evaluate the clinicopathological nature of it in further detail. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) has not yet been implicated in canine babesiosis (CB), but may also be one of the causes of the sudden dyspnoea and tachypnoea that are frequently seen in complicated CB patients. The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the scintigraphic pulmonary perfusion pattern in hospitalised dogs with babesiosis in an attempt to ascertain whether a scintigraphic pattern consistent with clinically relevant PTE does indeed occur in these patients. The study consisted of a normal control group of 9 mature healthy Beagle dogs (group 1) and a Babesia group with 14 dogs of a variety of breeds that were naturally infected with Babesia (group 2). Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy was performed after making thoracic radiographs and performing a blood gas analysis in both groups. The scintigraphic images were visually inspected for changes suggestive of PTE, but not a single dog in group 2 had pleural-based, wedge-shaped perfusion defects which would have resulted in a high probability for clinically relevant PTE. The scintigraphic pulmonary perfusion pattern demonstrated was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = 1.00).","448":"Serum samples collected in a cross-sectional survey of grazing cattle on Manyara Ranch, Monduli district, Tanzania, were tested by indirect major antigenic protein 1 fragment B (MAP 1-B) ELISA to determine the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia ruminantium and to assess ranch-level risk factors for heartwater. Heartwater-exposed cattle were widespread on the ranch and overall seroprevalence was 50.3% (95% CI, 44.9-55.6), enough to indicate an endemically unstable situation. Multivariate logistic regression modelling was used to identify risk factors associated with seropositivity. Two factors appeared to increase the herd's risk for contracting heartwater. Seroprevalence increased significantly with age (beta = 0.19 per year of age, P &lt; 0.001) and animals carrying ticks of any species were associated with an increased risk of infection with E. ruminantium (Odds ratio, OR = 3.3, P &lt; 0.001). The force of infection based on the age seroprevalence profile was estimated at 18 per 100 cattle year-risk. The current tick control measures on the ranch were associated with a decreased risk of infection with E. ruminantium (OR = 0.25 for no dipping and OR = 0.31 for low dipping, P &lt; 0.001). Six tick species were identified; in order of frequency these were: Ambylomma variegatum 59.9%, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi 13.9%, Rhipicephalus pulchellus 12.5%, Hyalomma truncatum 7.03% and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus 6.07%. The least encountered tick was Rhipicephalus simus, which accounted for 0.38%. The cattle seemed well adapted to their environment and capable of resisting the tick burden under this extensive wildlife\/livestock grazing and interaction system.","449":"Bacterial and fungal cultures were performed from cloacal swabs collected from 29 wild Nile crocodiles, captured in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Sixteen species of bacteria and 6 fungal species were cultured. Individual crocodiles yielded 1-4 bacterial species, and 0-2 fungal species. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Microbacterium, Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Escherichia coli. No salmonellae were cultured. The most commonly occurring fungus was Cladosporium. Several of the bacterial and fungal species isolated have been implicated in cases of septicaemia in crocodilians. Knowledge of the normal intestinal flora will contribute towards the development of a crocodile-specific probiotic for use in farmed crocodiles.","450":"The African giant rat lives up to 14 years in captivity, reaching maximum body weights of approximately 2.80 kg in bucks and 1.39 kg in does. In Britain, the African giant rat is increasingly becoming a popular exotic pet. A survey was conducted on 41 licensed pet shops in the UK. The range of ages of giant rat presented for sale, single price per rat, paired prices (buck and doe) and transport costs were 4-12 weeks, pounds sterling 320-pounds sterling 370, pounds sterling 352.50-400.00 including VAT, and pounds sterling 10-37.50, respectively Ivermectin injected at 200-400 microg\/kg subcutaneously once a week for 3 weeks will eliminate ectoparasites (and many endoparasites). Nematode infections can also be treated with fenbendazole or piperazine. Bladder threadworms can be treated with fenbendazole, protozoa with metronidazole (not in gravid does) and cestodes with praziquantel. Treatment of leptospirosis with doxycycline administered 4.29-5.36 mg once a week is useful prophylactically, although for insurance of effectiveness, 10 mg\/kg for 5 days is recommended. An identical dosage is recommended for the treatment of rickettsia. African trypanosomosis infection, following diagnosis of parasites in a blood smear, can be treated with a variety of antiprotozoal drugs like diminazene diaceturate at 3.5 mg\/kg for 5 days. Leishmaniasis is treated at the same dose. Staphylococcosis is treated with amoxycillian trihydrate at 5 mg\/kg 3 times a day for 7 days. Helminthosis is treated with broad-spectrum deworming solution. Coccidiosis is treated with cotrimoxazole at 100 mg\/kg daily for 3 days. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are administered to combat secondary bacterial infection after viral invasion.","451":"The one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) was first introduced to German South West Africa (Namibia) for military purposes in 1889. Introductions to the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) in 1897 and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1903 were initially with a view to replacing oxen that died of rinderpest. Disease risks attendant on these introductions were recognised and to some extent guarded against. There were, however, relatively few problems. One camel was diagnosed as having foot-and-mouth disease. Mange in camels from India caused some concern as did trypanosomosis from Sudan. Trypanosomosis was introduced into both the Cape of Good Hope and Transvaal. Antibodies to some common livestock disease were found in later years.","452":"A survey was conducted on the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance of nematodes in communally grazed sheep in a semi-arid area near Mafikeng, South Africa, from January to March 2006. In the herds belonging to twelve smallholder sheep farmers, the efficacies of albendazole, levamisole and closantel were tested by faecal egg count reduction tests where 80 % efficacy was considered the cut off for anthelmintic resistance. The results of the faecal egg count reduction tests showed more than 80% efficacy with all the drugs used in most cases, but there were notable exceptions. In 1 case, closantel had an efficacy of 72%, albendazole had an efficacy of 68% and levamisole showed efficacies of 58%, 60% and 75% respectively on 4 farms. The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in this farming sector is of concern and steps should be taken to prevent its further spread and development to avoid a situation developing as on numerous commercial sheep farms in South Africa where resistance is common.","453":"Lead (Pb) intoxication in horses is usually a chronic phenomenon with clinical signs associated with central nervous dysfunction. This report gives details of a case of acute Pb intoxication in a 9-year-old American Saddlebred mare with severe, progressive and ultimately fatal neurological deterioration. During the 4 days of hospitalisation, clinical signs progressed from intermittent headshaking and depression to severe, continuous, uncontrollable manic behaviour. At autopsy, three grey-coloured, hard metal particles were present in the gastrointestinal tract and subsequently found to contain 2614 ppm Pb. Lead concentrations in the brain, liver, stomach and kidney were 29, 4, 6 and 2 ppm wet weight, respectively.","454":"Acute normovolaemic haemodilution (ANH) is a technique used to preserve a patient's owns red blood cells and reduce the incidence of heterogeneous blood transfusion. This paper describes the use of the technique in a dog and a kitten. A significant benefit of ANH can be shown in the canine case presented. The dog lost 1800 ml of blood during surgery but the haematocrit was only reduced to 33% 6 hours after the end of surgery. The kitten, however, did not benefit from ANH. It lost a small volume of blood during surgery and developed complications. This paper also describes some of the potential complications that may occur. To the best of my knowledge, this is the 1st clinical description of ANH in a dog and a cat.","455":"A retrospective serological survey of African horse sickness (AHS) in Botswana covering a 10-year period (1995-2004) is reported. The survey involved horses showing clinical symptoms of the disease; the horses had not been vaccinated against AHS. Over the period surveyed, serological evidence suggestive of infection with AHS virus (AHSV) was found in 99 clinical cases out of which 41.4% (41\/99) cases were found during the 1st half (1995-1999) and 58.6 % (58\/99) cases were found in the 2nd half of the survey period (2000-2004). These serological findings are discussed in relation to AHSV serotypes isolated from diseased horses in Botswana before and during the period of this serological survey.","456":"This study was undertaken to establish whether the Onderstepoort Biological Products Fowl Typhoid (OBPft) vaccine registered as an injectable vaccine was effective and safe when administered orally to commercial layers. Its efficacy and duration of protection were compared with application by intramuscular injection. Commercial brown layer hens were used as they were found to be highly susceptible to Salmonella gallinarum infections. In the vaccine safety trial birds were euthanased at timed intervals spanning 4 weeks postvaccination. Necropsies were performed and samples were taken and tested. No clinical signs or mortalities could be attributed to the OBPft vaccine nor could active shedding of the vaccine strain be detected. Slight pathological changes were noted with both routes of vaccination; however, these changes were transient, returning to normal within the observation period. The injected groups showed a better serological response with the rapid serum plate agglutination (RSPA) test than the orally vaccinated groups. In the duration of protection trial, birds were challenged at 3-8-week intervals post-vaccination. All unvaccinated birds died. Protection 8 and 16 weeks after vaccination was above 60 %,by 24 weeks after challenge, the vaccine protection was below 30 %. It was found that there was no significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in the protection offered by either the oral or injected route of vaccination with the OBPft vaccine.","457":"Twelve pony mares were randomly assigned to either a control or a treatment group and inseminated with fresh, raw semen from a single stallion of known fertility in a cross-over trial design. Pregnancy was diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound 12-14 days post-ovulation and then terminated by administration of a luteolytic dose of cloprostenol. Treatment mares received a uterine instillation of 100 ml of electrochemically activated (ECA) saline 4-12 hours post-insemination. Control mares received no treatment post-insemination. Per cycle pregnancy rate was 58.3 % in the control group and 50 % in the treatment group. There was no statistical difference (P = 1.000) in pregnancy rate between the 2 groups. The principles of ECA and applications of ECA saline are discussed.","458":"Theileria parva causes widespread morbidity and mortality in cattle in endemic regions. An outbreak of theileriosis occurred on a farm near Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, which is not a declared Corridor disease-infected area. A survey of Red Brangus cattle from all age groups and areas of the farm was performed. Transmission of the parasite from infected animals on the farm to susceptible animals by tick transmission and tick-stabilate injection, was attempted. The survey indicated high numbers of animals with antibody titres to T. parva but only 6 infected animals, based on real-time PCR and RLB analysis. The transmission experiments failed to transmit the parasite. The study shows the difficulty in elucidating a source of infection and determining the dynamics of new infections in a herd where multiple possible sources are present and treatment with tetracyclines has taken place.","459":"Captive and wild African elephants frequently suffer tusk fractures. Several institutions shorten the tusks of captive elephants to reduce fractures and injury as a result of behaviour within enclosures. Fracturing or coronal amputations that expose pulp lead to pain for the elephant. Estimating coronal pulp lengths may thus help to minimise the risk of pulp exposure during amputations. We aimed to determine the length of the pulp beyond the lip margin from an external tusk characteristic. Tusks collected from elephants in Namibia and the Kruger National Park had similar morphological relationships. This statistical property allowed us to correct for missing data in our data sets. Pulp volume and pulp length correlated with tusk circumference at the lip. Even so, the circumference at the lip could not predict the length of the pulp in the crown external to the lip. Our findings suggest that tusks, irrespective of sex or age, amputated further than 300 mm from the lip should not expose pulp.","460":"Dermatosparaxis is a heritable collagen dysplasia causing skin extensibility and fragility. In Belgian Blue cattle this mutation has been described as a 3 base pair (bp) change followed by a 17bp deletion in the gene coding for procollagen 1 N-Proteinase (pNPI). An outbreak in a commercial Drakensberger herd in South Africa followed the introduction in late 2000 of a 3-year-old bull that developed skin lesions in 2001 and was culled in 2002. Some of his offspring were similarly affected, 1 of which was kept as a breeding bull after his sire's death. Two affected calves were referred to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital in October 2005. Detailed examination revealed only skin abnormalities limited to the lateral extremities of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis, viz. either acute lacerations of varying sizes, slow healing defects or thin scars in chronic cases. During a subsequent farm visit, 13 animals with similar wounds were seen in the herd of 146 animals. Electron microscopic examination of skin biopsies revealed haphazard arrangement and loose packing of dermal collagen fibrils within collagen fibres. The fibrils showed size variation and slightly irregular outlines on cross-section, consistent with mild dermatosparaxis. DNA samples of affected calves were analysed using primers designed to amplify the region of the pNPI gene that contained the mutation described in Belgian Blue cattle, but this mutation could not be demonstrated in any of the animals tested. It is concluded that a form of dermatosparaxis with a different gene mutation from that described in Belgian Blue cattle exists in Drakensberger cattle in South Africa. This possibly also explains the milder and more delayed clinical signs and the milder dermal collagen ultrastructural abnormalities.","461":"A serological survey of Brucella abortus in cattle originating from communal grazing areas of Kwa Zulu Natal was carried out between March 2001 and December 2003. The survey was designed as a 2-stage survey, considering the diptank as the primary sampling unit. In total 46 025 animals from 446 diptanks of 33 magisterial districts were sampled and tested using the Rose Bengal test and Complement Fixation Test. The apparent prevalence at district level was adjusted for clustering, diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity, and mapped using ArcView version 3.3. The prevalence of brucellosis in communal grazing areas of Kwa-Zulu Natal was found to be 1.45 % (0.84-2.21%) and varied from 0 to 15.6 % between magisterial districts. In 19 of the 33 magisterial districts no serological reactors were observed. A large variation in prevalence was found within diptank areas. Brucellosis was found to be most prevalent in the northeastern area of the province. The findings of the survey are discussed.","462":"There are at least 16 recognised herpesviruses that naturally infect cattle, sheep, goats and various species of deer and antelopes. Six of the viruses are recognised as distinct alphaherpesviruses and 9 as gammaherpesviruses. Buffalo herpesvirus (BflHV) and ovine herpesvirus-1 (OvHV-1) remain officially unclassified. The prevalence of ruminant herpesviruses varies from worldwide to geographically restricted in distribution. Viruses in both subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae cause mild to moderate and severe disease in respective natural or secondary ruminant hosts. Accordingly, the economic and ecological impact of the viruses is also variable. The molecular characteristics of some members have been investigated in detail. This has led to the identification of virulence-associated genes and construction of deletion mutants and recombinant viruses. Some of the latter have been developed as commercial vaccines. This paper aims to give an overview of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infection by these viruses, immuno-prophylaxis and mechanisms of recovery from infection. Since there are 128 ruminant species in the family Bovidae, it is likely that some herpesviruses remain undiscovered. We conclude that currently known ruminant alphaherpesviruses occur only in their natural hosts and do not cross stably into other ruminant species. By contrast, gammaherpesviruses have a much broader host range as evidenced by the fact that antibodies reactive to alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1 have been detected in 4 subfamilies in the family Bovidae, namely Alcelaphinae, Hippotraginae, Ovibovinae and Caprinae. New gammaherpesviruses within these subfamilies are likely to be discovered in the future.","463":"The Class of 1934 included 2 graduates who created milestones for the veterinary profession in South Africa. Jack Boswell was the first Onderstepoort graduate to start his own private practice without ever joining the government service. George van der Wath has the distinction of being the only South African veterinarian to become Chairman of the prestigious South African Wool Board. Ashton Tarr was President of the South African Veterinary Medical Association from 1966-1969. Concise descriptions are given of the varied life histories of the 14 members of the Classes of 1934 and 1935. All except Boswell initially joined government service, one serving mainly in the Colonial Service before eventually returning to South Africa. Three spent their entire careers in the South African Veterinary (Field) Services, finally occupying very senior positions in that division. One ended his career lecturing at a university. Lambrechts was the first veterinarian to occupy the 'resurrected' post of Director of Veterinary Services reserved for field veterinarians. Only one of the graduates opted for research, but went farming after obtaining a DVSc degree. Three spent the greater part of their careers in private practice, Thiel from as early as 1937. Two went into municipal (public health) service, one becoming director of an abattoir. Only one saw military service in World War II. Two died before they were 50 years old. Unfortunately, virtually nothing is known about Erasmus' career. At 97 Thiel holds the distinction of being the oldest Onderstepoort graduate.","464":"","465":"Cutaneous inverted papillomas are described in an 8-month-old mixed breed domestic dog from Windhoek, Namibia. Multiple firm, rapidly growing, doughnut-shaped masses formed on the ventral abdomen, which histologically consisted of a cup-shaped rim of marked epithelial hyperplasia, giant keratohyaline granules and prominent koilocytes and marked hyperkeratosis filling the centre of the mass. Current literature on canine papillomas is briefly reviewed.","466":"This prospective, cross-sectional, interventional study was designed to determine the association between the hormones of the pituitary-adrenal and pituitary-thyroid axes and other clinical parameters with the blood glucose perturbations in dogs with naturally occurring Babesia canis rossi babesiosis. Thirty-six dogs with canine babesiosis were studied. Blood samples were obtained from the jugular vein in each dog prior to treatment at admission to hospital and serum endogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), pre-ACTH cortisol, thyroxine, free thyroxine and TSH concentrations were measured. Immediately thereafter each dog was injected intravenously with 5 microg\/kg of ACTH (tetracosactrin). A 2nd blood sample was taken 1 hour later for serum post-ACTH cortisol measurement. Three patient groups were recruited: hypoglycaemic dogs (glucose &lt; 3.3 mmol\/l, n = 12); normoglycaemic dogs (glucose 3.3-5.5 mmol\/l, n = 12); hyperglycaemic dogs (glucose &gt; 5.5 mmol\/l, n = 12). Basal and post-ACTH serum cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in hypoglycaemic dogs, whereas body temperature, serum thyroxine and free thyroxine were significantly lower in hypoglycaemic dogs. Haematocrit was significantly lower in both hypo-and hyperglycaemic dogs compared with normoglycaemic dogs. Low blood glucose concentrations were significantly associated with high basal and post-ACTH cortisol concentrations and with low serum thyroxine and free thyroxine concentrations in dogs suffering from B. canis rossi babesiosis.","467":"Cholecystokinin exerts a composite influence on gastrointestinal motility but little is known about its effect on small-intestinal slow waves. Thus, six rams were implanted with four bipolar serosal electrodes onto the duodeno-jejunal wall. In the course of chronic experiments the myoelectric activity was continuously recorded in the non-fasted animals. After recording of the full normal migrating myoelectric complex (MMC), 0.15 M NaCl or CCK peptides were injected intravenously during various phases of the next MMC cycle. Five ml of saline was injected over 30 s during phases 1, 2a, or 2b of the MMC. Cerulein was administered at doses of 1 (over 30 s), 10 (over 30 or 60 s), or 100 ng\/kg (over 30, 60, 120 or 300 s) and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP) at doses 20 times higher. CCK peptides were applied during early or late phase 1 of the MMC and during phases 2a and 2b of the MMC. In the course of additional experiments, saline and hormone administration was directly preceded by infusion of proglumide, an unspecific CCK receptor antagonist, at a dose of 10 mg\/kg. The myoelectric recordings were continued until the arrival of a subsequent regular phase 3 of the MMC. In the duodenal bulb, slow waves were occasionally observed. In the duodenum the slow-wave frequency oscillated between 20 and 24 cpm and in the jejunum between 19 and 22 cpm before or after CCK peptides and proglumide. In the duodenum the slow-wave amplitude increased significantly after all doses of cerulein injected during phase 2b of the MMC. After administration of CCK-OP changes in duodenal slow-wave amplitude were not significant but exhibited a tendency similar to those after cerulein. In the jejunum, injection of cerulein and CCK-OP during phase 2 of the MMC increased the slow-wave amplitude significantly and the duration of these changes was longer than in the duodenum. After infusion of proglumide, administration of cerulein at the low dose over 30 s and at the high dose over 300 s in the course of late phase 1 and phases 2a and 2b of the MMC, significantly increased the duodenal slow-wave amplitude. Cerulein injection during phase 2b of the MMC at the high dose over 30 and 60 s, preceded by proglumide infusion, significantly inhibited the duodenal slow-wave amplitude. In the jejunum these changes were even more pronounced and their duration was much longer. It is concluded that CCK peptides affect slow-wave amplitude in the duodeno-jejunum in non-fasted sheep. This effect is stronger in the jejunum and is altered but not abolished by pretreatment with proglumide. Cerulein evokes more pronounced alterations in the slow-wave amplitude than CCK-OP in conscious sheep.","468":"A questionnaire survey of 315 cattle owners from the rural districts of KwaZulu-Natal was carried out. The aim of the survey was to improve our understanding of local farmers' perceptions and practices of animal disease prevention and control and to establish the extent of their relationship with veterinary services. The survey showed that many owners practice preventive measures such as deworming, tick control and vaccination. Traditional medicines were in use by over half the respondents (58.9 %). Diseases are regarded as an important management problem (56.1 %); ticks, worms and diarrhoea dominated the mentioned health problems in cattle. Veterinary services still play an important role and are a frequent source of advice to owners. The findings of the survey and their context are discussed.","469":"The quality of induction of general anesthesia produced by ketamine and propofol, 2 of the most commonly used anaesthetic agents in cats, was assessed. Eighteen cats admitted for elective procedures were randomly assigned to 3 groups and then premedicated with xylazine 0.75 mg\/kg intramuscularly before anaesthesia was induced with ketamine 15 mg\/kg intramuscularly (KetIM group), ketamine 10 mg\/kg intravenously (KetIV group) or propofol 4 mg\/kg intravenously (PropIV group). Quality of induction of general anaesthesia was determined by scoring ease of intubation, degree of struggling, and vocalisation during the induction period. The quality of induction of anaesthesia of intramuscularly administered ketamine was inferior to that of intravenously administered ketamine, while intravenously administered propofol showed little difference in quality of induction from ketamine administered by both the intramuscular and intravenous routes. There were no significant differences between groups in the ease of intubation scores, while vocalisation and struggling were more common in cats that received ketamine intramuscularly than in those that received intravenously administered ketamine or propofol for induction of anaesthesia. Laryngospasms occurred in 2 cats that received propofol. The heart rates and respiratory rates decreased after xylazine premedication and either remained the same or decreased further after induction for all 3 groups, but remained within normal acceptable limits. This study indicates that the 3 regimens are associated with acceptable induction characteristics, but administration of ketamine intravenously is superior to its administration intramuscularly and laryngeal desensitisation is recommended to avoid laryngospasms.","470":"The ostrich industry experiences a high rate of embryonic mortalities during artificial incubation of eggs. Embryonic deaths were studied from data recorded on 37,740 fertile eggs incubated artificially during the 1998-2005 breeding seasons. Roughly 10,000 eggs that sustained embryonic mortalities were classified according to the stage and nature of death, i.e. before 21 days of incubation, after 21 days of incubation, deaths after pipping and rotten eggs. Although infection may have played a role in approximately 1300 rotten eggs, no detailed knowledge of the pathogens involved was available. The remainder of deaths could not be related to pathogens and the deaths were thus generally referred to as non-infectious. The overall level of embryonic mortality in all the eggs studied was 28.5 %. Overall embryonic mortality was affected by incubator, with higher levels (57.0 %) found in eggs incubated in an African Incubator and also in eggs that were transferred between incubators during incubation (38.1%). Overall embryonic mortality also increased in eggs produced by older females. Eggs produced in the autumn had the highest level of embryonic mortality at 53.6 %, whereas eggs produced in the winter had a marginally higher level of embryonic mortalities of 29.2 % compared with eggs produced during summer (27.4 %). Eggs produced by South African (SA) Black males crossed to Zimbabwean Blue females had high levels of embryonic losses of 45.7 %. The embryonic mortality of eggs produced by SA Blacks or Zimbabwean Blue breeding birds subjected to pure breeding was similar at approximately 33-34 %, but embryonic mortality was improved in eggs produced by Zimbabwean Blue males crossed to SA Black females (27 %). Embryonic mortality was increased in eggs that were set directly (32.0 %) or subjected to longer than 6 days of storage (43.5 %). Embryonic mortality was affected by year. The results that were obtained will assist in determining non-infectious factors that have a negative effect on hatching success. Steps can thus be taken to eliminate such factors that may compromise hatching success.","471":"Haemodilution is a technique used to reduce perioperative homologous blood transfusions. Haemodilution is a poorly investigated technique in veterinary medicine. This article reviews haemodilution as a potential technique to reduce perioperative homologous blood transfusions. The history of haemodilution is briefly reviewed followed by the mathematical basis to haemodilution. The issue of critical oxygen delivery and its implications for haemodilution are discussed. The effects of haemodilution on the patient, including the effects on oxygen transport, blood flow and coagulation are discussed as well as the use of colloids, fluids and blood components in haemodilution. The success and failure of haemodilution in human clinical trials and experimental evidence is discussed. Some guidelines are given for the use of haemodilution in small animal patients in the perioperative setting. It appears in all likelihood that haemodilution has a limited application in cats and other small patients. Haemodilution is most beneficial when the initial haematocrit is high, a low haemodiluted haematocrit is achieved, the patients circulating volume is large and a large amount of blood was lost. It is important to avoid haemoconcentration during surgery as this increases red blood cell loss. Haemodilution is not a substitute for poor surgical technique and inadequate haemostasis intra-operatively. Intravascular volume should be maintained throughout the procedure.","472":"The Class of 1933 of the Onderstepoort Faculty was the smallest in its history, having only 1 student for much of the BVSc course. The photographs of the Classes of 1932 and 1933 are both of the customary composite type. Not only the graduates, but also the Dean, Prof. Dr P J du Toit, as well as the presumed Acting Dean, Prof. Dr G de Kock, and the head of the students' hostel, Mr W O Neitz, feature. Concise descriptions are given of the life histories of the 7 graduates. Once again their careers show considerable variation. Although they all initially joined Field Services as state veterinarians, none spent their entire careers in that division. Three spent virtually their entire careers at Onderstepoort, also teaching (part-time) at the Faculty. After a most impressive start to his career, a 4th graduate died at the age of only 30 shortly after leaving Onderstepoort for municipal (public health) service. A 5th spent most of his career in private practice while also serving the veterinary profession for 8 years in the high office of president of its association. One spent the greater part of his career in municipal (public health) service and another went into private practice, eventually also farming with citrus.","473":"","474":"An outbreak of an atypical form of ovine dermatophilosis affecting the lips and muzzle with a very high morbidity in weaners and hoggets in Kenya is reported. Clinical diagnosis of ovine dermatophilosis was made and confirmed by direct microscopic examination as well as isolation and identification of Dermatophilus congolensis from scab material from the affected sheep. The morbidity rate within the flock was 31.8% (237\/745) with 98.3% (233\/237) of the affected sheep being weaners and hoggets. No fatalities were recorded. The lesions, confined in the lips and the muzzle, were swelling of both the upper and lower lips, circumscribed lumps in the skin of both the upper and lower lips, oedema of the head and the submandibular area and scabs and crusts on the lips and muzzle. Within 1 week following treatment with long acting oxytetracycline (20%) at a rate of 20 mg\/kg body weight, intramuscularly and a topical application of oxytetracycline spray, lumps regressed in size and were covered by dark-brown scabs. Removal of the dark-brown scabs revealed erythematous areas covered with purulent material and horny erythematous projections (papillae) projecting from the surfaces. Within the 2nd week, the horny erythematous projections formed greyish scabs, which later peeled off leaving alopaecic areas around the lips. The paper highlights atypical dermatophilosis of sheep and we believe that this is the first published report of an outbreak of ovine dermatophilosis in Kenya.","475":"A 9-year-old male cat was presented for evaluation of chronic weight loss and was subsequently diagnosed with pericardial effusion. The effusion was quantified as a septic exudate caused by the anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus. Antibiotic therapy resulted in complete resolution of the pericardial effusion. As Peptostreptococcus is a common oral bacterium and the cat had a previous dental procedure, it is speculated that the pericardial effusion was secondary to bacteraemia from the dental procedure.","476":"Forty seven of 150, 15-month-old long weaners died of an acute renal disease syndrome following introduction into an old maize field with a heavy stand of Amaranthus spp. The clinical syndrome was characterised by sudden onset neurological disease with ataxia and recumbency. Subcutaneous oedema, ascites and perirenal oedema with urine odour were the major gross necropsy findings. Renal histopathology revealed marked coagulative renal tubular necrosis of the proximal and distal straight tubules with intertubular haemorrhage. Acute renal failure and perirenal oedema has been described in cattle, pigs, horses and sheep associated with the ingestion of A. hybridus L. and A. retroflexus L. This perirenal oedema syndrome has been widely reported in the Americas, while in South Africa intoxication with the amaranths has only previously been associated with nitrate and possibly oxalate poisoning in cattle.","477":"A 12-year-old, grey, crossbred pony mare was presented with a swelling in the neck over the area of the 2nd cervical vertebra (C2), which was found to be painful on palpation. The neck was held stiffly. Radiography of the cervical region showed a focal area of increased radio-opacity over the dorsal, caudal and lateral aspect of the dorsal spinous process of C2. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of a hypoechoic area approximately 15 cm in diameter superimposed over the dorsal spinous process of C2. An aspirate was taken of the mass, which revealed purulent exudate confirming the diagnosis of an abscess. The abscess was lanced with a scalpel blade and samples of the purulent material revealed a pure culture of Streptococcus equi subsp. equi. The guttural pouches (Eustachian tube diverticulae (ETD)) were then evaluated endoscopically and multiple chondroids were seen filling most of the right ETD. Surgery was subsequently performed and 189 chondroids were removed via a right-sided hyovertebrotomy. The ETDs were flushed and penicillin installed into both ETDs on 3 different occasions via a catheter introduced using a fibre optic scope. This procedure was repeated until a negative culture status was achieved in order to eliminate the carrier status.","478":"Presented is an African giant rat (Cricetomys gambianus) following zinc ingestion. The sick rat was lethargic, withdrawn, had soft, mucus-impregnated faeces and diahorrea, foot twitching and icterus. Comparative age, sex and body weight (b.wt.)-matched analyses were made with a healthy giant rat. Twelve-hourly Urine volume (UV), Haematocrit (Hct), urinary glucose, plasma zinc and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) were performed over an 8-week period. Full blood counts were performed and differential WBC counts and microscopic observations were made on blood smears obtained from both healthy and sick rats. Consecutive blood samples were drawn at the end of each week (Weeks &lt;2-6 treatment; Weeks 7-8 post-treatment). Treatment involved oral vitamin B12 supplement at 4 microg\/day and 2 ml diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) intramuscular injections at 1 ml\/450g b.wt.\/5 wks (Week 2 - 6). Day 1 showed neutropaenia, Heinz bodies on RBCs (reticulocytes and immature forms). Zinc (Day 1 - end Week 7), glucose (Day 1 - end Week 4), ALP (Day 1 -Week 4) and UV were elevated (Day 1 - end Week 6). Indications of moderate zinc toxicosis following ingestion and stress-associated glucosuria were concluded.","479":"Participatory research on vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle disease (ND) was carried out in the village of Disaneng, in the North West Province of South Africa. Three application methods for ND Inkukhu vaccine were shown to induce sufficient levels of immunity in back-yard poultry when correctly administered. These are eye-droplet administration to individual fowls, in-feed and in-water administration to small flocks. After a community meeting and group discussion to select methods of vaccination, only 2 of the 3 methods were chosen; the individual administration of droplets into the eyes was considered to be too impractical because back-yard fowls are difficult to catch. Visual and practical training material was prepared and presented to volunteer vaccinators (n = 23). Vaccinators were then required to register all the poultry owners in their ward who wished to have poultry vaccinated. Once an indication of the number of chickens to be vaccinated had been made available, ND Nobilis Inkukhu vaccine was supplied to vaccinators free of charge. Community vaccinators were responsible for the organisation of the vaccination campaign, including storage and preparation of vaccine for application. All 9 wards in the village were initially involved with a total of 482 households, owning 6141 chickens, participating. This represented slightly in excess of 60 % of the fowls in the area. Involvement in a 2nd round of vaccinations, 1 month later, was far poorer with only 211 households owning a total of 1636 chickens participating. Serum samples were collected from vaccinated fowls using systematic random sampling and tested for circulating antibodies. The levels of protection varied, with no significant difference found between in-feed and in-water vaccine administration. Volunteer vaccinators were found to be unreliable, easily demotivated, did not keep good records and left the project when offered permanent employment. Contacting them to make arrangements for delivering vaccine was difficult and time consuming. Structured interviews indicated that deaths in poultry and the attitude of the owners probably contributed to the demotivation of the volunteers used as community vaccinators. It was concluded that volunteers are not the ideal choice for vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle disease.","480":"Veterinary internists need to prognosticate patients quickly and accurately in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This may depend on laboratory data collected on admission, the cost of hospitalisation, length of stay (LOS) and mortality rate experienced in the NICU. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study of 62 equine neonates admitted to a NICU of a private equine referral hospital to determine the prognostic value of venous clinicopathological data collected on admission before therapy, the cost of hospitalisation, LOS and mortality rate. The WBC count, total CO2 (TCO2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher (P &lt; or = 0.05) and anion gap lower in survivors compared with nonsurvivors. A logistic regression model that included WBC count, hematocrit, albumin\/globulin ratio, ALP, TCO2, potassium, sodium and lactate, was able to correctly predict mortality in 84% of cases. Only anion gap proved to be an independent predictor of neonatal mortality in this study. In the study population, the overall mortality rate was 34% with greatest mortality rates reported in the first 48 hours and again on day 6 of hospitalisation. Amongst the various clinical diagnoses, mortality was highest in foals after forced extraction during correction of dystocia. Median cost per day was higher for nonsurvivors while total cost was higher in survivors.","481":"The repellent effects of the essential oil of Lavendula angustifolia on adults of Hyalomma marginatum rufipes was studied at concentrations of 5, 10 and 20% v\/v. A suitable tick climbing bioassay based on the questing behaviour of ticks was used to test for repellency. High percentage repellency (range 70-100) was shown at all concentrations of the essential oil of L. angustifolia, although at 5% v\/v it only persisted for the first 40 minutes compared with 120 minutes at other concentrations (10 and 20% v\/v). The repellent strength of L. angustifolia compared well (P &gt; 0.05) with that of DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a commercial reference repellent, for the 2-hour period of the study.","482":"There are no reports in the literature describing any tumours, and specifically sarcoids, in zebras. The equine sarcoid, a locally aggressive, fibroblastic skin tumour, is the most common dermatological neoplasm reported in horses. The Cape mountain zebra (CMZ) has been described as one of the most vulnerable mammals in South Africa with current populations existing in isolated units. All South African CMZ are descendants from no more than 30 individual animals originating from 3 populations, namely the Mountain Zebra National Park, and Kammanassie and Gamka Mountain Nature Reserves near Cradock. The possibility therefore exists that the existing populations arose from a very small gene pool and that they are considerably inbred. A reduction in major histocompatibility complex diversity due to genetic bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding probably contributed to uniform population sensitivity and the subsequent development of sarcoid in two CMZ populations, namely in the Bontebok National Park and Gariep Nature Reserve. The entire population of CMZ in the Bontebok National Park was observed and sampled during 2002 to document the prevalence and body distribution of sarcoids. During the same year, a comparative study was carried out on an outbred population of Burchell's zebra in the Kruger National Park. The prevalence in CMZ in the Bontebok National Park was 53 %, while the Burchell's zebra in Kruger National Park had a prevalence of 1.9 %. The most common sites for sarcoid in CMZ were the ventral abdomen and limbs. Prevalence of sarcoids in horses recorded in the literature varies between 0.5 % and 2 %. The Gariep Nature Reserve recently reported a prevalence of almost 25 % in CMZ in the reserve.","483":"Wild Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) of various size classes were captured in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Blood was collected from the post occipital sinus and used for the determination of a wide range of haematological and biochemical parameters. These values were compared between the sexes and between 3 size classes. The values were also compared with the limited data available from farmed Nile crocodiles, as well as from other wild Nile crocodiles. The Okavango crocodiles were comparatively anaemic, and had comparatively low total protein and blood glucose levels. There was a high prevalence of Hepatozoon pettiti infection, however, there was no significant difference in haematological values between the infected and uninfected crocodiles. The values reported here will be useful in diagnostic investigations in both zoo and farmed Nile crocodiles.","484":"Serum cortisol response was assessed in 8 captive cheetahs, of varying ages, after the intravenous administration of 500 microg of tetracosactide (Synacthen Depot, Novartis, Kempton Park) while maintained under general anaesthesia. In addition, 8 cheetahs were anaesthetised and given an equal volume of saline in order to establish baseline cortisol concentrations at similar stages of anaesthesia. A significant difference in the median cortisol concentration measured over time was found following ACTH administration in the ACTH group (P &lt; 0.001). There was no difference between the median cortisol concentrations in the ACTH group at time-points 120, 150 and 180 min after ACTH stimulation (P = 0.867). Thus it appears appropriate to collect serum 120 to 180 min after tetracosactide administration to assess maximal stimulation of the adrenal in the cheetah. No statistically significant rise was seen in the anaesthetised control group following the injection of saline (P = 0.238).","485":"Some production parameters of seropositive cows (age, first calving age, 305 day mature equivalent last milk yield production, lifetime mature equivalent milk yield production, lifetime total milk production, lifetime total milking period, lifetime monthly milk production, lifetime daily milk production, lifetime total days of milking, number of inseminations per pregnancy (for last pregnancy), number of calves and calving interval (for last pregnancy)) were analysed in the current study. The study population was clinically healthy Holstein cows from a commercial dairy herd in southern Turkey. Of 109 animals, 65 cows were seropositive by ELISA and the prevalence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection was 59.6%. The prevalence of seropositive cows in 2nd (62.8%), 3rd (64.7%), 4th (61.5%), and 5th (66.6 %) lactations was slightly higher than that of cows in 1st (52.6%) lactations. No statistical differences were observed between BLV seronegative and seropositive cows for production and reproduction parameters analysed in this study (P &gt; 0.05).","486":"This study was designed to confirm the toxicity of a plant implicated in an outbreak of poisoning of stock in Frankfort, Free State Province, South Africa. Cows died acutely after being introduced into a camp, where an abundant, green shrublet was noted to be heavily grazed. This plant was subsequently identified as Senecio inaequidens DC. (Asteraceae) by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). Extraction and chemical analyses for pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in Senecio inaequidens revealed the presence of 4 different compounds, namely retrorsine and senecionine (known to be hepatotoxic) and 2 unidentified compounds. The average total PA (free base plus N-oxide) concentration in plant parts of S. inaequidens collected at Frankfort during the outbreak was 0.81%, compared with the total alkaloid content in the dried, milled S. inaequidens plant material, collected 7 weeks after the outbreak, of only 0.18%. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4), aged 8-9 weeks, were dosed per os. Each rat received a different dose of the crude Senecio inaequidens extract, ranging from 0.049 mg\/g body weight (b.w.) to 0.25 mg\/g b.w. No clinical signs were observed in the rat receiving the lowest dose. Rats receiving higher doses showed depression, an unsteady gait, pilo-erection and jaundice, which was particularly noticeable in the ears. Clinical chemistry evaluation revealed an increase in the activities of ALP (except Rat 4), AST and GGT in all animals. Total serum bilirubin, creatinine and urea concentrations were also elevated. All rats had low serum globulin concentrations with an A\/G ratio above 1.2. Post mortem examination of the rats revealed marked hepatic lesions. Histopathologically, these changes were characterised by necrosis (variable in extent) of the centrilobular and midzonal hepatocytes (but sparing the portal hepatocytes), with extensive haemorrhage and congestion. Proliferation of the bile ducts, fibrosis and oedema were also present. Ultrastructural changes in affected rats were characterised by margination of chromatin, the presence of numerous autolysosomes in necrotic hepatocytes, intramitochondrial woolly inclusions and changes in the endoplasmic reticulum. A sheep, also dosed with the crude extract, failed to exhibit clinical signs, clinical chemistry aberrations or macroscopic lesions; however, examination of the liver of this sheep revealed histopathological and ultrastructural changes similar, though milder, to those displayed by the rats. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were extracted from the liver and kidneys of the rats and the sheep. In the case of the sheep, retrorsine was also detected in the lungs, urine and bile.","487":"Serum samples from 600 sheep were collected from 5 different provinces randomly chosen in South Africa. Two sheep abattoirs (representing formal slaughter of sheep) and 1 rural location (representing informal slaughter of sheep) per province were also selected randomly. The serum samples were tested for anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies using 2 different serological tests: an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test available as a commercial kit. This study provides the first published data on seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in sheep in South Africa, although positive titres have been found previously in wild felids, ferrets, chinchillas and a dog. Data on seroprevalence in sheep is considered important because consumption of mutton is universally considered to be a source of zoonotic transfer to humans. Seroprevalence in humans in South Africa was previously found to be 20 % and it is postulated that this may be linked to the informal slaughter and consumption of mutton. During this study, the overall national seroprevalence per province in sheep was found to be 5.6 % (IFA) and 4.3 % (ELISA), respectively. This is lower than in other countries, possibly because South Africa has an arid climate. Differences in seroprevalence in different areas studied suggested an association with the climate and a significant correlation (P &gt; 0.05) was detected between the prevalence of T. gondii and the minimum average temperature. The seroprevalence was found to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) in sheep originating from commercial farms (7.9 %) than in rural sheep in the informal sector (3.4 %). Also, sheep managed extensively had a seroprevalence of 1.8 %, which was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) than the seroprevalence in sheep under semi-intensive or intensive management systems (5.3%). An incidental finding of interest was the considerable movement of sheep to abattoirs and mutton after slaughter. The highest consumption of mutton was in the Western Cape Province (29.9%) while the highest concentration of sheep is found in the Eastern Cape Province (30.1%).","488":"A workshop to produce recommendations on training requirements for improved epidemiosurveillance of livestock diseases in southern Africa was organised at the Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases in the Veterinary Faculty of the University of Pretoria. It was attended by 23 persons representing 10 different southern African countries. The majority of the participants were actively involved in veterinary epidemiosurveillance and many of them were members of the SADC Epidemiology and Informatics Subcommittee. Discussions focused on (i) epidemiosurveillance networks and their 2 main components, i.e. (ii) diagnosis and (iii) information flow. The debates were guided by 3 questions; (i) what are the requirements for an effective network, (ii) what cannot be achieved with existing capacity and (iii) how can the current capacity be improved. Workshop participants developed lists of realistic capacity building needs, which were divided into structural needs and training requirements. Structural needs mainly concerned communication means and quality assurance. With regard to training, the need for appropriate continuing education of all actors at the various disease management levels (non-professional, para-professional, professional) was expressed. Special emphasis was put on capacity building at the lowest level, i.e. the livestock owner and the para-professionals at the community level. At the international level, it was felt that special emphasis should be put on building capacity to improve the understanding of international agreements on trade in animals and animal products and to improve the capacity of negotiating such agreements.","489":"From May to July 2005 a study was conducted on the prevalence and effects of haemonchosis in goats farmed on communal grazing belonging to resource-poor farmers at two study sites, namely Mlungisi (26 degrees 53'E, 31 degrees 53'S) and Ezibeleni (26 degrees 58'E, 31 degrees 53'S), situated within the Chris Hani District Municipality in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The usefulness of the FAMACHA system for identifying goats needing treatment was confirmed. It allowed stock owners to identify badly affected goats accurately, as borne out by the agreement between FAMACHA scores and corresponding haematocrits.","490":"This study was carried out with the cooperation of farmers owning communally grazed indigenous goats in southwestern KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, where farmers had identified poor reproductive performance in their herds as one of their major problems. The aim was to quantify the effects of 3 interventions and the interaction between these interventions on goat productivity and gastrointestinal nematode infection. The interventions were: urea-molasses block supplementation during the dry winter seasons of 2004 and 2005, tactical anthelmintic treatment with ivermectin (400 microg\/kg) during the wet summer period (on 3 January 2005) and symptomatic treatment with ivermectin (400 microg\/kg) of all goats judged anaemic throughout the entire study period. The FAMACHA system was used as a gauge of anaemia. It was noted that goats considered anaemic tended to remain so throughout the study period. The tactical anthelmintic treatment was effective as it markedly reduced (P = 0.066) the summer peak in faecal egg counts and is therefore recommended. By contrast, while the urea-molasses block supplementation appeared to reduce the faecal egg counts immediately following the 2004 supplementation (P &lt; 0.05), this did not hold true in 2005. Interestingly, in the tactically treated anaemic goats, the improvement in the number of kids suckled per doe year-on-year tended to be greater than in the non-anaemic goats. It is considered that the routine symptomatic treatment of anaemic goats may have been a key factor. More detailed investigations into the routine symptomatic treatment of anaemic goats are therefore recommended.","491":"The incidence of tusklessness varies between free-ranging African elephant populations. Sex-linked genetic drift predicts 2 outcomes--the condition becomes fixed and sex-specific incidences diverge when populations are small and\/or heavily poached. By contrast, for large and intact populations, tusklessness diminishes and there is no variation between sexes. We tested these predictions by comparing sex-specific incidences between 15 populations: a small one with a skewed founder effect towards tusklessness; 5 that had experienced intense levels of poaching; 2 that had been subjected to non-selective culling and 7 that are relatively pristine. Patterns of rainfall were studied of tusk fractures amongst these populations to correct for any effect that acquired tusklessness may have on our predictions. The incidence of tusk fractures was related to annual rainfall, but the mechanism that leads to an increase of the condition in drier areas was not clear Incidences of tusk fractures in free-ranging populations implied that the frequency of acquired bilateral tusklessness is low and should not affect our results. All males had tusks. Tusklessness in females was high in the small skewed founder population and some of those where there was a history of poaching. The incidence is expected to decline if the residual population is large.","492":"Mycotoxins may be present in feeds without any visible signs of mould contamination. There is a need for rapid and accurate measurement of mycotoxins for purposes of continual monitoring and identification of high risk commodities. Samples from commercial chicken feed (maize kernels), cattle feed (lucerne, grass and hay) and milk were analysed for the presence of certain mycotoxins and cultured for fungi. Results of fungal profiles showed that most samples were contaminated by moulds belonging to the genera, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Mucor, Phoma and Rhizopus. All the chicken feed samples tested contained mycotoxins either below the recommended safe levels for poultry or below the detection limits of the ELISA tests. However, samples of grass contained levels of zearalenone greater than the allowable concentration for dairy and beef cattle (250 ppm), which may be linked to the presence of Fusarium scirpi identified in the fungal profiles. The levels of AFMI were below the detection limits of the ELISA tests, which may be attributed to the low levels of aflatoxins found in the feed (grass) samples. The presence of the fungus in samples analysed is not evidence for the presence of mycotoxins.","493":"The present study investigated the histological prevalence of subclinical prostatic disease in a canine mixed-breed population. The reliability of digital rectal examination (DRE) as a screening test for subclinical prostatic disease was also evaluated. DRE was performed on 500 male dogs (age range 1 to 21 years) before the dogs died of diseases not related to the prostate. Necropsies of these dogs were performed and prostates were collected for histological evaluation. The overall prevalence of subclinical prostatic disease was 75.6%. The most prevalent subclinical prostatic diseases were benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (44.8%), prostatitis (23.6%) and prostatic neoplasia (3.6%). The prevalence of subclinical BPH and prostatic neoplasia increased with age but that of prostatitis was not influenced by age. The prevalence of subclinical BPH and prostatitis were higher in intact than castrated dogs. DRE had a high specificity (75%) and positive predictive value (87%), but a low sensitivity (53%) and negative predictive value (34%).","494":"South African canine babesiosis caused by Babesia canis rossi is a common clinical disease in dogs in South Africa and remains a significant cause of domestic dog mortality. To determine whether tick-repellent, 9% amitraz-impregnated tick collars (Preventic-Virbac) could prevent tick-borne exposure to B. canis rossi, 50 dogs were assigned to two groups. Group 1 (20 dogs), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)--and reverse line blot (RLB)-negative for B. canis rossi, were fitted with amitraz collars and blood samples collected monthly, over a 6-month period, and analysed for B. canis rossi. Group 2 (30 dogs) included 5 dogs selected on a month-by-month basis from a population of dogs from the same geographical area as the group 1 dogs, but with no history of previous tick control, which were blood-sampled together with the treatment group and analysed for B. canis rossi by PCR and RLB, to serve as the control group. Eight of the 30 control dogs (26.6%) were PCR\/RLB positive for B. canis rossi, indicating high pathogen exposure during the trial period. All twenty of the treatment group dogs remained negative for B. canis rossi throughout the 6 months of the trial. These results suggest that the use of amitraz-impregnated collars had a significant effect on reducing infection with B. canis rossi.","495":"In South Africa, 1919 canine elbow dysplasia grading evaluations were performed from 1999-2006. Of these 1827 were evaluated by the senior author and form the basis of this article. Each report recorded the breed, age, sex, side affected and elbow dysplasia grading. The relationship between breed, age, sex, side affected, origin of radiographs and elbow dysplasia incidence was then analysed. Statistical evaluations were performed including means and standard deviations. The Rottweiler had the highest incidence of elbow dysplasia at 55 % followed by the Bullmastiff, Chow chow, Boerboel and Golden retriever, all of which had elbow dysplasia incidences of &gt;38%. Males were significantly more affected than females. The incidence of elbow dysplasia in the various breeds was compared with those of the Orthopaedic Foundation for Animals in the United States and was found to be much higher in South Africa.","496":"With only two students in the final year, the class of 1930 was the 2nd smallest in the history of the Onderstepoort Faculty. Noteworthy is that the class photograph is composed of individual shots of the graduates and that 1 photograph was taken several years after qualification. The photograph of the Class of 1931 is the more customary composite one. The Dean, Prof. PJ du Toit, does not feature in either. Concise descriptions are given of the life histories of the 8 graduates. Again their careers show considerable variation. Two devoted their entire pre-retirement careers to South Africa's Division of Veterinary Services as state veterinarians, both reaching very senior positions. A third died shortly after leaving government service for private practice. None made a career out of research at Onderstepoort, although 2 had short stints at the Institute. One, said to have been the youngest veterinarian in the British Empire, spent the latter part of his relatively short life in a large Johannesburg practice as a specialist surgeon. Another was in military service for virtually his entire career. One had a very varied career, which included government service, private practice, research, public health and the pharmaceutical industry. One spent most of his impressive career in the Colonial Service in Swaziland and Tanganyika (now Tanzania) but eventually returned to private practice in South Africa, whereas another was similarly, but less conscientiously, involved in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Swaziland. Two saw military service during World War II, one as Commanding Officer of a Regiment in the South African Artillery and the other in the South African Veterinary Corps.","497":"Twenty healthy ostriches (ten cocks and ten hens), and twenty birds with tibiotarsal rotation (nine cocks and 11 hens) (14 months old) were isolated, hooded and weighed. A run (50 m x 2.5 m) was divided into sections marked 5 m, 10 m, 15 m and 20 m. Time taken for each bird to pass these points was recorded and speed computed. The degree of tibiotarsal rotation in the right foot was mean +\/- SEM, 156 +\/- 2.69 degrees. Comparisons between left and right foot length in healthy birds showed no significant differences. Foot length was significantly lower in tibiotarsal rotation (P = 0.03). The right foot in tibiotarsal rotation was significantly shorter than the left foot. The number of strides per each 5 m division were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater in tibiotarsal rotation by comparison with healthy birds. At 20 m, healthy cocks had more strides than hens. The stride length in hens was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater than cocks at 5, 10 and 15 m, respectively, but lower throughout in tibiotarsal rotation (P = 0.001). The speed of hens was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater than cocks. Tibiotarsal rotation resulted in significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced speeds. Hens may be able to escape danger faster than cocks. The occurrence of tibiotarsal rotation necessitates consideration of genetics, management, sex, nutrition and growth rates.","498":"Although snakebites are frequently seen in small animal practice in South Africa, boomslang (Dispholidus typus) bites are infrequent due to their shy habits. Boomslang venom is a potent procoagulent, causing a consumption coagulopathy and profuse haemorrhage. Boomslang monovalent antivenom is the most effective treatment. This case report describes and discusses 2 small dogs that were presented to a private practice after being bitten by the same boomslang. Boomslang monovalent antivenom administration to both resulted in cessation of bleeding within 45 minutes. One of the dogs developed severe adverse reactions to the antivenom, including vomiting, dyspnoea and nystagmus, which responded well to intravenous cortisone and symptomatic treatment.","499":"Electrocardiograms were taken from 100 normal healthy male and female ostriches which were 1 to 15 months old using a base apex lead. The heart rate of those less than 3 months old ranged from 107 to 250 beats per minute with a mean of 171.47 +\/- 9.03 and that of ostriches of more than 3 months old ranged from 43 to 167 with a mean of 90.52 +\/- 2.64 beats\/minute. The P-waves were positive in all cases except in 1 ostrich which it was isoelectric. The ORS complexes were mainly negative and either monophasic (QS) or biphasic (rS or RS). The T-wave showed more variation than other waves. The durations of P P-R, QRS, Q-T and T-waves of chicks and of those more than 3 months of age (4-15-month-old) were 0.04 +\/- 0.00, 0.06 +\/- 0.00; 0.14 +\/- 0.04, 0.16 +\/- 0.00; 0.04 +\/- 0.00, 0.06 +\/- 0.00; 0.18 +\/- 0.00, 0.27 +\/- 0.00 and 0.06 +\/- 0.00, 0.09 +\/- 0.01 s, respectively, and amplitudes of the main direction of P-, QRS and T- waves of 2 groups were 0.29 +\/- 0.02, 0.26 +\/- 0.01; 1.87 +\/- 0.17, 2.21 +\/- 0.08; and 0.34 +\/- 0.06, 0.37 +\/- 0.02 mV, respectively. Ten cases showed cardiac dysrhythmias of which 9 showed sinus arrhythmia and 1 showed premature atrial contractions (PAC). This study showed that the base apex lead can be a suitable monitoring lead for electrocardiographic examination of ostriches.","500":"Domestic environmental pollution resulting from urban livestock farming was investigated in Makurdi using parasitological techniques. The test tube flotation technique was used for the parasitological analysis of animal faecal matter and soil samples collected from residential premises. Ectoparasitic fauna of dogs, goats, sheep and cattle cohabiting with humans within the same residential compound were also collected and identified. The hand-picking and body brushing methods were employed to search for ticks, fleas, lice and mites. Of the 150 soil samples examined, 55 (36.7 %) were positive for 1 or more eggs of helminth parasites. There was no significant difference in the distribution of eggs in the soil samples from the 3 areas sampled (Chi2 = 0.046, df = 2, P &gt; 0.05). Ascaris species were the dominant parasite eggs found. Of the 180 faecal samples examined, 107 (59.4 %) were positive for 1 or more eggs of helminth parasites. Chi-square analysis showed no significant difference in the level of infection of different animal faeces sampled (Chi2 = 5.74, df = 4, P &gt; 0.05). Ascaris species were again the dominating helminth parasite eggs found. There was also no significant difference in the prevalence of helminth eggs in the animal faecal samples from the 3 areas sampled (Chi2 = 5.99, df = 4, P &gt; 0.05). A total of 1908 ectoparasites was recovered (ticks: 32.80 %; lice: 22.43 %; fleas: 22.06 % and mite: 22.69 %). There was no significant difference in infestation animals between sexes (Chi2 = 0.10, df = 4, P &gt; 0.05). The predominant genus encountered for ticks were Amblyomma, while Linognathus (43.90 %), Ctenocephalides (97.38 %) and Sarcoptes (58.89 %) were most predominant for lice, fleas and mites respectively. The public health implications of the findings, especially as these relate to the increasing incidence and prevalence of zoonotic infections, are discussed.","501":"Since 2002 the Denver Zoological Foundation has produced 28 African hunting dog (Lycaon pictus) puppies in 3 litters (7, 14 and 7 pups) from the same dam and sire. Wellness examinations were performed on each puppy. The wellness examinations spanned the range of 6-14 weeks of age. During the wellness examinations, in addition to physical examinations and vaccinations, blood samples for complete blood counts and sera biochemistry were obtained. Weights, morphometric measurements, rectal cultures for enteric pathogens and dental eruption patterns were recorded. Blood samples from each age group were compared with adult values from the Denver Zoo. It was noted that animals from the 14-pup litter were 63.6% of the mean weight of the two 7-pup litters, but size differences (in, for example, total body length) were less apparent. Two organisms were recovered from rectal cultures, namely Yersinia enterocolitica (n = 2) and Plesiomonas shigelloides (n = 3). The following deciduous eruption patterns were also noted; at 6 weeks, 11-3, i1-3, C1, c1, P1-2 and p1-2 (n = 7) were present, at 9-10 weeks, P3 and p3 (n = 21), and finally at 12-14 weeks, P4 (n = 28).","502":"Pre-anaesthetic screening has been advocated as a valuable tool for improving anaesthetic safety and determining anaesthetic risk. This study was done determine whether pre-anaesthetic screening result in cancellation of anaesthesia and the diagnosis of new clinical conditions in geriatric dogs. One hundred and one dogs older than 7 years of age provided informed owner consent were included in the study. Each dog was weighed, and its temperature, pulse and respiration recorded. An abdominal palpation, examination of the mouth, including capillary refill time and mucous membranes, auscultation, body condition and habitus was performed and assessed. A cephalic catheter was placed and blood drawn for pre-anaesthetic testing. A micro-haematocrit tube was filled and the packed cell volume determined. The blood placed was in a test tube, centrifuged and then analysed on an in-house blood analyser. Alkaline phosphatase, alanine transferase, urea, creatinine, glucose and total protein were determined. A urine sample was then obtained by cystocentesis, catheterisation or free-flow for analysis. The urine specific gravity was determined with a refractometer. A small quantity of urine was then placed on a dip stick. Any new diagnoses made during the pre-anaesthetic screening were recorded. The average age of the dogs was 10.99 +\/- 2.44 years and the weight was 19.64 +\/- 15.78 kg. There were 13 dogs with pre-existing medical conditions. A total of 30 new diagnoses were made on the basis of the pre-anaesthetic screening. The most common conditions were neoplasia, chronic kidney disease and Cushing's disease. Of the 30 patients with a new diagnosis, 13 did not undergo anaesthesia as result of the new diagnosis. From this study it can be concluded that screening of geriatric patients is important and that sub-clinical disease could be present in nearly 30 % of these patients. The value of screening before anaesthesia is perhaps more questionable in terms of anaesthetic practice but it is an appropriate time to perform such an evaluation. The value of pre-anaesthetic screening in veterinary anaesthesia still needs to be evaluated in terms of appropriate outcome variables.","503":"The goal of programmes to provide contraception for elephants should be to formulate an approach that does not require the relocation or immobilisation of the same individual year after year, which would be long-lasting and cause minimal disruption to social and reproductive behaviour. The programmes should be simple to administer, safe and cost-effective, and must meet the objectives defined by managers in the field. An immunocontraceptive programme was initiated in a small free-roaming population of elephants at the Greater Makalali Private Game Reserve in Limpopo Province in 2000 to determine whether the porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccine can successfully control population sizes. Further objectives were to determine implementation costs and efficiency through a multi-faceted approach. We have demonstrated that immunocontraception meets the objectives set by managers in the field. Minimal social disruption was observed over the course of treatment, with the mode of delivery (ground or aerial vaccinations) determining the degree of stress within herds and speed of resumption of normal movement patterns. Aerial vaccinations resulted in the least disturbance, with target herds being approachable within a day. In 2005, implementation costs were R880-R1000\/elephant\/year, inclusive of darts, vaccine, helicopter and veterinary assistance. Irrespective of the source or method of vaccine delivery, a non-pregnant elephant is rendered infertile from 1st vaccine administration. The sooner immunocontraception is implemented, the sooner population growth rates can be controlled. pZP contraception is a realistic alternative management tool, particularly if used as part of a long-term management strategy. Mass-darting from the air eliminates the need for detailed individual histories of each elephant or for employing a person to monitor elephants. Thus, implementation of immunocontraception in larger populations is feasible and practical.","504":"This study documents the detailed features of the morphological structure and the innervation areas of the plexus brachialis in the chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera). The animals (5 female and 5 male) were euthanased with ketamine hydrocloride and xylazine hydrocloride combination, 60 mg\/kg and 6 mg\/kg, respectively. Skin, muscles and nerves were dissected under a stereo-microscope. The brachial plexus of the chinchilla is formed by rami ventrales of C5-C8, T1 and T2, and possesses a single truncus. The subscapular nerve is formed by the rami of the spinal nerves originating from C6 (one thin ramus) and C7 (one thick and 2 thin rami). These nerves innervate the subscapular and teres minor muscles. The long thoracic nerve, before joining with the brachial plexus, obtains branches from C6 and C7 in 5 cadavers (3 male, 2 female), from C7 in 4 cadavers (2 male, 2 female) and from C6-C8 in only 1 female cadaver. These nerves disperse in variable combinations to form the extrinsic and intrinstic named, nerves of the thoracic limb. An undefined nerve branch originates from the rami ventrales of C7, C8 and T1 spinal nerves enter the coracobrachial muscle.","505":"Variations in the seroprevalence of antibody to Babesia bigemina infection by farm and animal level risk factors were investigated for 2 contrasting regions of Tanga and Iringa in Tanzania. Tanga is situated in the eastern part of the country and has typical tropical coast climate while Iringa is situated in the Southern Highlands and has a tropical highland climate. Two hundred farms from each region were selected using simple random sampling procedure and visited once between January 1999 and April 1999. Blood samples were collected from 1329 smallholder dairy animals on selected farms for harvesting serum which was subsequently used for serodiagnosis of B. bigemina using an indirect enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Of the 1329 sera samples screened, 34.9 % were positive for B. bigemina. The prevalence was higher in Iringa Region [43%, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 39.5-47.3] than in Tanga Region (27%, CI = 23.6-30.5). Using a logistic binomial regression model as an analytical method for predicting the likelihood of animal seropositivity, we found (in both regions) that the risk of positive reaction varied with the animal's age, history of grazing and geographical location. Seroprevalence increased with age (beta = 0.01 and 0.01 per year of age, P &lt; 0.005 in Tanga and Iringa, respectively). Animals located in Lushoto and Iringa urban district were associated with increased risk of seropositivity [Odds ratio (OR) = 4.24, P = 0.001, for Lushoto, and OR = 1.81, P = 0.040, for Iringa Urban, respectively). Animals grazed 3 months prior to sampling had higher odds for seropositivity than zero\/semi-grazed, despite farmer-reported high frequency of tick control (OR = 2.71, P = 0.0087, for Tanga, and OR = 4.53, P = 0.001, for Iringa). Our study suggests that even though herd sizes are small, B. bigemina infection is widespread in many smallholder dairy farms and endemic stability with respect to this disease has not yet been attained, but the observed levels are sufficiently high to ensure that clinical disease would be a risk.","506":"In this study, 162 horses, 80 donkeys and 51 mule serum samples were collected in Konya city. Additionally, 64 horse serum samples from Ankara and 49 samples from Kayseri city were included in the study. A total of 406 serum samples were examined by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibody to equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and no positive result was detected.","507":"This experiment compared the reproductive performance of synchronised anoestrous dairy cows that were treated initially with a combination of progesterone and oestradiol benzoate and then with either gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or oestradiol benzoate to resynchronise returns to service. It was hypothesised that injecting anoestrous dairy cows with GnRH 12-15 days after insemination and coinciding with the time of insertion of a controlled intravaginal progesterone-releasing (CIDR) device would increase conception rates to the preceding 1st insemination compared with oestradiol benzoate treated cows; both GnRH and oestradiol benzoate would resynchronising the returns to service of those cows that did not conceive to the preceding insemination. Groups of cows in 11 herds were presented for a veterinary examination after they had not been seen in oestrus postpartum. Those cows diagnosed with anovulatory anoestrus (n = 1112) by manual rectal palpation and\/or ultrasonography were enrolled in the trial. Each enrolled cow was injected with 2 mg oestradiol benzoate i.m. on Day -10, (where Day 0 was the 1st day of the planned insemination) concurrently with vaginal insertion of a CIDR device. The device inserted was withdrawn on Day -2 and then each cow injected i.m. with 1 mg of oestradiol benzoate on Day -1 unless it was in oestrus. Observation for oestrus preceded each insemination. Every cow that had been inseminated on Days -1,0,1 or 2 was presented for treatment for resynchrony on Day 14 (n = 891). They were divided into 2 groups; those with an even number were each injected i.m. with 250 microg of a GnRH agonist (Treatment group n = 477); each of the cows with an odd number injected i.m. with 1 mg of oestradiol benzoate (control group, n = 414). Each GnRH or oestradiol benzoate injection preceded reinsertion of a CIDR device previously inserted from Days -10 to -2. It was withdrawn on Day 22, 24 hours before injecting 1 mg oestradiol benzoate. Cows observed in oestrus were submitted for a 2nd insemination. Every enrolled cow still present in the herd was pregnancy tested by palpation of uterine contents per rectum about 6 weeks later and again at the end of a herd's seasonal breeding programme. The alternative use of GnRH instead of oestradiol benzoate did not affect the percentage of cows conceiving within 3 days of the mating start date (MSD) (35.6 % vs 35.3 %, P = 0.90), resubmission rates for a 2nd insemination among cows not pregnant to the 1st insemination (81.6 % vs 83.5 %, P = 0.41), 6-week pregnancy rate (59.3 % vs 60.6 %, P = 0.65), 21-weekpregnancy rate (86.6 vs 85.0, P = 0.36), mean interval from MSD to conception (32.5 +\/- 1.8 days vs 29.9 +\/- 1.8 days, P = 0.26) or conception rate of cows reinseminated by Day 28 (43.3 % vs 38.8 %, P = 0.39). When GnRH was compared with oestradiol benzoate, it did not increase conception rates to the 1st service; it was as effective as oestradiol benzoate in synchronising returns to service in previously treated anoestrous cows that did not conceive to the 1st service. Its use affected neither conception rates to the preceding 1st inseminations nor to the following 2nd inseminations.","508":"Canine babesiosis caused by Babesia gibsoni was diagnosed in a 3-month-old Pit-bull pup during a routine clinical examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by way of smear examination, PCR, Reverse Line Blot (RLB) and sequence analysis which showed 100% homology with B. gibsoni (Japan AB118032) and Babesia sp. (Oklahoma) (AF205636). Haematology showed moderate anaemia and severe thrombocytopenia. Treatment was initiated with diminazene aceturate (Berenil RTU) followed by 2 doses of imidocarb diproprionate (Forray-65) 3 days and 14 days later, respectively. Babesia gibsoni DNA was still detectable 2 weeks post-treatment on the PCR\/RLB test. A 10-day course of combination drug therapy using atovaquone and azithromycin was initiated. Blood samples taken on Day 1 and Day 40 after completion of treatment were negative for B. gibsoni DNA on PCR\/RLB test. The implications of a possible introduction of B. gibsoni into South Africa are discussed.","509":"A survey was conducted in 2000 into the use of analgesic drugs by veterinarians in South Africa. This survey was repeated in 2005 to establish whether the use of analgesic drugs has increased and which analgesic drugs are being used for acute pain and osteoarthritis. The number of sterilisations performed and the number of new cases of osteoarthritis in dogs and cats was estimated. It is estimated that approximately 260000 cats are operated on each year in South Africa and that 150000 cats are sterilised. Five hundred thousand dogs undergo surgery, of which 242000 are sterilised. It appears that the number of surgical procedures performed in South Africa has decreased. The estimated death rate following anaesthesia has remained unchanged at 1:1004. Overall, the use of analgesics by South African veterinarians has increased significantly. Fifty-six per cent of cats and 74% of dogs were given peri-operative analgesics but this increased to 94% and 84% after including pre-anaesthetic medications with analgesic properties. The use of opioids (morphine and buprenorphine) and propofol has increased significantly. Approximately 253000 dogs and 33000 cats with osteoarthritis are seen by veterinarians in South Africa annually. The recognition by veterinarians of osteoarthritis in cats appears to be poor and is in need of attention. Carprofen and glucosamine\/chondroitin are the most commonly used agents for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Details of the drugs used by veterinarians are given. Knowledge of analgesic drugs has increased significantly over the last 5 years. Continuing education is thought to have played an important role in the changes reported in this study.","510":"Mycoplasmas are an important and economically significant cause of mastitis in dairy cows in various parts of the world. The organisms are highly contagious, with the main reservoir of infection originating from cows with subclinical mastitis. In 1998 the 1st cases of bovine mastitis due to Mycoplasma bovis were diagnosed in Ardabil State, Iran. An investigation was carried out with the aim of establishing the extent of mycoplasma infections in dairy cows in Ardabil State. Milk samples obtained from 80 cows with clinical mastitis were cultured in the laboratory for the presence of mycoplasmas. Similarly, 48 bulk-tank milk samples were examined for the presence of mycoplasmas. A modified Hayflick broth was used to isolate the mycoplasmas and an immunoperoxidase test used for the species identification of the isolates. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated from 39 (48.75%) of the clinical mastitis samples and from 48 of the bulk-tank milk samples tested. This indicated that mycoplasma udder infections were more prevalent in dairy cows in Ardabil State than previously thought.","511":"Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides was diagnosed in 2 dogs from Windhoek, Namibia, by acid phosphatase staining of microfilariae. This is the 1st record of A. dracunculoides in Namibia.","512":"Spontaneous intoxication in 34 horses after ingesting freshly harvested maize that was to be used for ensiling and heavily contaminated with young Datura stramonium plants, is described. The clinical status of all horses was monitored for 7 days, and included body (rectal) temperature, respiratory and heart rates, colour and moistness of visible mucosae, changes in pupil size, appetite, thirst, general behaviour, locomotion, sensory perceptions, urination and defaecation. The intoxication was accompanied by altered clinical status, namely mild hyperthermia, tachycardia, polypnoea, dyspnoea and shallow breathing, mydriasis, dry oral, rectal, vaginal and nasal mucosae, acute gastric dilatation and severe intestinal gas accumulation, anorexia to complete refusal of feed, decreased or absent thirst, absence of defaecation and urination. As a result of the treatment, the clinical parameters normalised between days 2 and 5. Necropsies and pathological studies were performed on two horses that died, revealing toxic liver dystrophy, cardiac lesions and substantial dystrophic and necrotic processes in the kidneys. The observed clinical signs, the pathomorphological changes and the applied therapy could be used in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of Jimson weed intoxication.","513":"Two, sibling, male Golden retriever puppies, 13 weeks of age, were presented with congenital biliary cysts of the liver involving both hepatic and segmental bile ducts, as well as bilateral polycystic kidney disease. Ultrasonography of the livers of both pups demonstrated segmental cystic lesions that were contiguous with the bile ducts. Histopathology revealed cystic ectatic bile duct hyperplasia and dysplasia with variable portal fibrosis in the liver, while in the kidneys there were radially arranged, cylindrically dilated cysts of the collecting ducts, which extended through the medulla and cortex. This pathology was compatible with that of congenital dilatation of the large and segmental bile ducts (Caroli's disease) described in humans, dogs and rats. In humans Caroli's disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, while in rats activation of the MEK5\/ERK cascade initiates the biliary dysgenesis of Caroli's disease in this species. However, the exact mode of inheritance and pathogenesis of Caroli's disease in dogs is as yet unknown. Previous reports on congenital hepatic cystic diseases of the dog have described Caroli's disease like lesions in various breeds, but these are believed to be the 1st reported cases in the Golden retriever breed.","514":"Captive cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) scheduled for either general health examination or dental surgery were immobilised with combinations of medetomidine-ketamine (K\/DET, n = 19), midazolam-ketamine (K\/MID, n = 4) or medetomidine-tiletamine-zolazepam (Z\/DET, n = 5). Induction time and arterial blood pressure was not statistically significantly (P &gt; 0.05) different between treatment groups. Transient seizures were observed in the K\/DET treated animals during induction. Hypertension was present in all groups during anaesthesia with mean (+\/- SD) systolic pressure of 30.7 +\/- 5.0 kPa for the K\/DET group, 27.7 +\/- 2.7 kPa for the K\/MID group, and 33.1 +\/- 4.6 kPa for the Z\/DET group. Heart rate was statistically significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the K\/DET group (69 +\/- 13.2 beats\/min) compared to the K\/MID group (97 +\/- 22.6 beats\/min), and ventilation rate was statistically significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the K\/MID group (15 +\/- 0.0 breaths\/min) compared with the K\/DET group (21 +\/- 4.6). A metabolic acidosis and hypoxia were observed during anaesthesia when breathing air. Oxygen (O2) administration resulted in a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (hypercapnoea), arterial partial pressure of O2, and % oxyhaemoglobin saturation.","515":"Three series of trials involving 10 domestic short-haired cats were carried out to determine the influence of dosage of contrast media or type of chemical restraint on feline excretory urography. The 1st series (group A) involved 5 cats sedated with 2.0 mg\/kg intramuscular (i.m) injection of 2% xylazine and receiving 800 mg\/kg of 76 % meglumine diatrizoate (urografin). The 2nd series (group B) involved another 5 cats sedated with 2.0 mg\/kg (i.m) injection of 2% xylazine and receiving 1200 mg\/kg of 76% urografin. The 3rd series (group C) involved the repeat urography of the group B cats but sedated with 15 mg\/kg (i.m) injection of 5% ketamine hydrochloride. Ventrodorsal radiographs were obtained immediately, 5, 15 and 40 minutes after the injection of 76% urografin. Scores were assigned to nephrographic opacification as described in the literature. The heart rates, respiratory rates and rectal temperatures of the cats were also determined before sedation, after sedation, immediately after the injection of 76% urografin and at 15-minute intervals over a period of 60 minutes. In this study, there were significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in the nephrographic opacification scores between the group A and group B cats at times 0 and 40 minutes post-administration of urografin. Group A cats had good initial nephrographic opacification which faded later while the nephrographic opacification of group B cats progressively increased. Similarly, nephrographic opacification was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the xylazine-sedated cats (groups A and B) than the ketamine-sedated cats (group C). However, there were no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in heart rates, respiratory rates and rectal temperatures between the 3 groups of cats. It was therefore concluded that increasing the dosage of urografin above 800 mg\/kg in cats does not provide additional beneficial effects on the nephrograms produced. Xylazine sedation was observed to produce better nephrographic opacification, however, with delayed nephrographic fading compared to ketamine sedation.","516":"Dichapetalum cymosum (Hook.) Engl. (Poison leaf; gifblaar) is a major cause of acute livestock plant poisoning in southern Africa. Microscopic identification of leaf fragments found in the digestive tract of poisoned animals can assist in the diagnosis of poisoning when D. cymosum poisoning is suspected. The microscopic morphology of D. cymosum leaves are described using standard staining and microscopy methods for histopathology samples at many regional diagnostic laboratories. Morphological descriptions included structures in the epidermis and mesophyll that were discernible using H &amp; E staining. The microscopic morphology of D. cymosum was used to differentiate between leaf fragments of D. cymosum and other species from the same habitat with macroscopic features that resemble those of D. cymosum, including Euclea crispa, Combretum zeyheri, Burkea afrikana and Lannea discolor.","517":"African Horsesickness (AHS) is a controlled disease in South Africa. The country is divided into an infected area and a control area. An outbreak of AHS in the control area can result in a ban of exports for at least 2 years. A retrospective epidemiological study was carried out on data collected during the 2004 AHS outbreak in the surveillance zone of the AHS control area in the Western Cape Province. The objective of this study was to describe the 2004 outbreak and compare it with the 1999 AHS outbreak in the same area. As part of the investigation, a questionnaire survey was conducted in the 30 km radius surrounding the index case. Spatial, temporal and population patterns for the outbreak are described. The investigation found that the outbreak occurred before any significant rainfall and that the main AHS vector (Culicoides imicola) was present in abundance during the outbreak. Furthermore, 63% of cases occurred at temperatures &lt; or = 15 degrees C, the Eerste River Valley was a high risk area, only 17% of owners used vector protection as a control measure and 70% of horses in the outbreak area were protected by means of vaccination at the start of the outbreak. The study revealed that the current AHS control measures do not function optimally because of the high percentage of vaccinated horses in the surveillance zone, which results in insufficient sentinel animals and the consequent failure of the early warning system. Alternative options for control that allow continued export are discussed in the paper.","518":"An outbreak of equine sarcoid occurred in a population of Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) at the Gariep Nature Reserve located in the southern Free State Province of South Africa in 1996. The course of the outbreak during 1996 to 2003 is described. During this period the average population size was 69 animals. Initially (1996) all affected animals were removed from the population. New cases continued to manifest and the incidence varied between 4.6% and 17.6%. Prevalence reached 24.7% in 2002. No sexual predilection was noticed in the 39 recorded cases. Of the affected individuals, 64% had a single lesion and no animal had more than 4 lesions. In males, the majority of lesions occurred in the inguinal area (55.17%), whereas in females they mostly occurred on the head and neck (41.38%). Lesions can increase 260% in size annually and may impede movement.","519":"Twenty five cattle were randomly selected from a herd of animals grazing communally around Mogosane village in the North West Province to evaluate their mineral status based on blood and faecal analysis. Mean faecal phosphorus (P) concentration was curvilinear, increasing from July (0.99 mg\/g) to December (3.63 mg\/g) and decreasing to 1.29 mg\/g in June. Mean P concentration in grass was also curvilinear, increasing from July (0.87 mg\/g) to January (1.8 mg\/g) and decreasing to 0.9 mg\/g in June. There was a high correlation (r2 = 0.89) between faecal and grass P concentrations. Faecal:grass P ratios suggest that the animals were conserving P by reducing faecal P excretion during times of low dietary P. Animals maintained consistent but very low serum inorganic P (SiP) throughout the year (range 1.33-1.95 mg%) and SiP was not correlated with either faecal or grass P. Mean faecal and grass calcium (Ca) concentrations followed a similar pattern to P. There was also a positive correlation (r2 = 0.95) between grass and faecal Ca concentrations. Faecal:grass Ca ratios indicated a conservation of Ca by reducing faecal Ca when dietary Ca was low. Animals were better able to conserve dietary Ca by reducing losses in the faeces than they were P, based on a higher faecal:grass P ratio (1.56) compared with Ca (1.18). Magnesium (Mg) was lost through the faeces during times of high dietary Mg concentrations but was conserved when grass Mg was low.","520":"Pigmented serum, usually due to free haemoglobin and\/or bilirubin, is a common finding in dogs with babesiosis, resulting in interference with all biochemical tests that rely on photochemistry. This is particularly true of urea and creatinine determinations, complicating the diagnosis of acute renal failure, which is a serious complication of babesiosis. A disproportionately raised serum urea concentration of unknown origin occurs in severely anaemic canine babesiosis patients and gives rise to an increased serum urea:creatinine ratio. The assay for cystatin-C, an excellent measure of glomerular filtration rate, is unaffected by free serum haemoglobin, and due to its different intrinsic origins, is free of influence by the metabolic derangements and organ pathology, other than renal disease, encountered in canine babesiosis. Serum cystatin-C was used to compare the concentrations of serum urea and serum creatinine in dogs with the severely anaemic form of canine babesiosis as well as a canine babesiosis-free reference group. Mean serum urea and mean serum urea:creatinine ratio were significantly elevated in the babesia-infected group relative to the reference population in this study. Mean serum creatinine and mean serum cystatin-C were within the reference ranges. Therefore an elevated urea:creatinine ratio in canine babesiosis in the presence of a normal serum creatinine concentration is considered to be caused by an elevated serum urea concentration and is most likely of non-renal origin. Serum creatinine was therefore as specific a measure of renal function as serum cystatin-C in canine babesiosis in this study. The sensitivity of serum creatinine as a measure of renal function was not established by this study. Serum urea, however, proved to be of little use compared to serum cystatin-C and serum creatinine. Serum urea should therefore not be used to diagnose renal failure in canine babesiosis.","521":"The available photographs of the Classes of 1928 and 1929 are confusing because they not only bear the same date (1929) but are also composed of individual shots of the graduates rather than the customary group photograph. An answer to the riddle was provided by the presence of J A Thorburn (a member of the Class of 1927) who was a 'super' and qualified in 1928, in the one photograph, together with M C Robinson who also graduated in 1928. The photograph dated 1929 on which 4 graduates and the Dean, Prof. Dr P J du Toit, appear is that of the Class of 1928. The other photograph dated 1929 in which the Dean is absent is therefore dated correctly. Concise descriptions are given of the life histories of the nine graduates. Their careers show considerable variation. Only one of them spent his entire career at the Onderstepoort Research Institute as a very eminent research scientist and professor, and two became well-known professors at the Onderstepoort Faculty. Two were in municipal service for most of their careers and a third ended up working for a municipal authority after spending some time in England and at the Onderstepoort Research Institute. Two spent virtually their entire careers in the field as state veterinarians and a third farmed for most of his career, although he also dabbled in private practice and managed one of the provincial game parks in Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal) for some time. Four served in the South African Veterinary Corps during World War II.","522":"","523":"The Veterinary Pharmacovigilance and Medicines Information Centre is responsible for the monitoring of veterinary adverse drug reactions in South Africa. An overview of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions received by the centre during the period March 2004 to February 2006 is presented. A total of 21 reports was received in the 2-year period, continuing the decline in the number of reports to a lower figure than in any previous year. This is surprising considering the legal obligation of the veterinary professionals to report all adverse drug reactions. Once again the majority of reports involved suspected adverse reactions that occurred in dogs and cats. Most of the products implicated were stock remedies. Veterinarians predominantly administered these products.","524":"Amitraz is a formamidine compound used in veterinary medicine as a topical dip to control ticks and mites on dogs and livestock. A 10-year-old female Scottish terrier was presented following the accidental oral administration of a dip containing amitraz. This case report describes the clinical signs, treatment and pathology of this dog. Clinical signs of toxicity from amitraz result from stimulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors. Amitraz is seldom fatal because the effects can be reversed by alpha2-adrenergic antagonists. The dog recovered from the amitraz toxicity but died 5 days later from acute renal failure.","525":"A 6-year-old, male, Collie-cross was presented with a non-weight bearing right thoracic limb lameness, right m. deltoideus, m. infraspinatus and m. supraspinatus atrophy, and severe neck pain with spasm of the cervical epaxial muscles. MRI revealed complete destruction of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebral bodies with lateral extradural spinal cord compression at the level of the 4th and 5th cervical vertebrae. These lesions were very clearly demonstrated on magnetic resonance images, while only subtle changes were seen on survey radiographs. Post mortem investigation revealed a large heart base chemodectoma with multiple smaller tumours in the cranial mediastinum and a single tumour nodule on the thoracic aorta. The 5th cervical vertebral body had necrotic, haemorrhagic and lytic changes. Histopathology of the heart base tumour, the nodules in the cranial mediastinum and on the thoracic aorta and samples from the 5th cervical vertebra confirmed the presence of a malignant aortic or carotid body tumour originating from the chemoreceptor organs. Diagnostic imaging features and post mortem findings are described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the magnetic resonance features of a metastatic chemodectoma in a dog.","526":"Canine osteosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed primary bone tumour in the dog, affecting mainly large and giant breed dogs with the predilection site being the metaphysis of long bones, specifically the distal radius, proximal humerus, distal femur and proximal tibia and fibula. Treatment options are either palliative or curative intent therapy, the latter limb amputation or limb-sparing surgery together with chemotherapy. This article describes the use of an ipsilateral vascularised ulnar transposition autograft as well as chemotherapy in 2 dogs with osteosarcoma of the distal radius. Both dogs showed minimal complications with the technique and both survived over 381 days following the surgery. Complications seen were loosening of the screws and osteomyelitis. The procedure was well tolerated with excellent limb use. This technique is indicated for use in cases with small tumour size that have not broken through the bone cortex.","527":"Monitoring of changes in some blood laboratory parameters in 34 horses after ingesting freshly harvested maize that was to be used for ensiling, heavily contaminated with young Datura stramonium plants, is described. For a 7-day period the following parameters were monitored: haemoglobin content (HGB), red blood cell counts (RBC), white blood cell counts (WBC), haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), differential white cell counts (DWC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), protein fractions, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), blood glucose (Glu), total protein (TP), globulin (Glob) and albumin (Alb). The intoxication was accompanied by erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, regenerative left shift neutrophilia, lymphopaenia, eosinopaenia, increased haematocrit values, low erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hyperglycaemia, bilirubinaemia, hypoproteinaemia and increased activity of AST and LDH. No changes occurred in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), albumin, globulin and globulin fractions (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2 and gamma). The blood parameters returned to normal between post-intoxication days 2 and 5. The observed changes in clinical chemistry indices could be used in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and prognosis of Jimson weed intoxication.","528":"Free-living stages of ticks on a commercial game farm in the Thabazimbi District, Limpopo Province, South Africa, were collected by drag-sampling with flannel strips during the period September 2003 to August 2004. A total of 5 tick species was collected from 4 sites. Boophilus decoloratus was the most abundant species, followed by Amblyomma hebraeum. Seasonal abundance of the ticks was quantified and an optimum time to implement control measures against the ticks is proposed.","529":"Histological examination of burn injuries in elephants revealed that the depth was not as severe as expected from clinical observation. Although the actual burn depth was deep, the thickness of elephant skin, especially the dermis, resulted in the lesions being classified as less severe than expected. Examination of skin samples from selected areas showed that most lesions were either superficial (1st degree) or superficial partial-thickness (superficial 2nd degree) burns with the occasional deep partial thickness (deep 2nd degree) wound. These lesions however, resulted in severe complications that eventually led to the death of a number of the elephants.","530":"This study examined flock size and management, level of internal and external parasite burden and seroprevalence of antibodies to poultry pathogens in indigenous chickens in Bokaa village, Kgatleng district, Botswana. The mean flock size was 22.6 +\/- 6.85 with a range of 11-34. The mean body weights of cocks and hens were 2.28 +\/- 0.56 kg and 1.70 +\/- 0.38 kg, respectively. Housing and commercial poultry feed were not provided. Ascaridia galli, Heterakis gallinarum and Syngamus trachea were found in some birds. Although the chickens were not vaccinated against any poultry diseases, serum antibodies to Newcastle disease, infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis were detected.","531":"Juvenile captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) often present with diarrhoea that is commonly associated with bacterial infections. A species-specific probiotic containing Lactobacillus Group 2 and Enterococcus faecium was prepared from healthy adult cheetahs. Juvenile cheetahs (n = 27) between 8 and 13 months of age were included in the probiotic trial. The animals were observed prior to and after feeding of the probiotic which was made available for 28 days. Feeding of the probiotic resulted in a significantly increased body weight in the treatment group (P = 0.026), while there was no increase in the control group. A relative improvement in the faecal quality in the probiotic group during the treatment period compared with the pre-treatment (P = 0.0363) and post-treatment (P = 0.004) period was observed. This was accompanied by an absence of blood and mucus in the faeces during the treatment period in the probiotic group.","532":"In this study the analgesic efficacy of the pure agonistic opioid morphine and the cyclo-oxygenase type-2-selective carprofen were compared since there is no previous specific comparative study for these two common analgesics. Forty-five bitches undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy were randomly assigned to one of three groups; receiving morphine 0.4 mg\/kg bodyweight pre-operatively and 0.2 mg\/kg every 4-6 hours thereafter (Morphine group), receiving a once-off carprofen 4 mg\/kg injection (Carprofen group) or receiving both morphine and carprofen (MorphCarp group). The dogs were premedicated with acepromazine 0.01 mg\/kg and induced with either thiopentone 5-10 mg\/kg or propofol 4-6 mg\/kg. General anaesthesia was maintained with halothane in oxygen. The degree of pain was assessed over a 24-hour period under blinded conditions using a pain scale modified from the University of Melbourne pain scale and the Glasgow composite pain tool. Physiological parameters such as respiratory rate, pulse rate and body temperature were also assessed over the same time period. There was no significant difference in pain-scores and thus analgesia offered by the three analgesia protocols at any assessment point across the three groups, but there were differences within groups across time points. Baseline total pain-scores were lower than scores at all post-operative points within all three groups. Both morphine and carprofen provided good analgesia without any obvious adverse effects. This study indicates that at the dosages indicated above, carprofen administered on its own produces analgesia equal to that produced by morphine and that the two drugs administered together do not produce better analgesia than either drug administered on its own.","533":"To assess post-evisceration contamination of broiler carcasses, 300 samples were randomly selected during routine slaughter in the winter of 2004. The samples originated from 50 chicken carcasses, taken directly after evisceration, as well as 25 samples from ready-to-sell packages of fresh intestines (mala) and livers. The samples were taken in batches over a period of 4 weeks to allow randomised sampling from different farms of origin. Conventional culture-based detection methods of Campylobacter spp. usually need 4-6 days to produce a result. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used for this study took less than 32 hours. The average contamination rates with Campylobacter in both the skin and liver samples were 24%, and 28% for intestines. Chicken and chicken products, especially livers and intestines, form an integral part of the traditional diet of many Black South Africans, as they are cheap and readily available in bulk and un-chilled for direct distribution, mainly through street vending and other informal retail outlets. This sudy showed that Campylobacter spp. are prevalent in poultry in South Africa. The handling of poultry meat and products contaminated with this organism in households and the potential for cross-contamination of other foods presents a high risk of infection to consumers in South Africa. The study also emphasised the need for further research in this field.","534":"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a lentivirus, is an important pathogen of domestic cats around the world and has many similarities to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A characteristic of these lentiviruses is their extensive genetic diversity, which has been an obstacle in the development of successful vaccines. Of the FIV genes, the envelope gene is the most variable and sequence differences in a portion of this gene have been used to define 5 FIV subtypes (A, B, C, D and E). In this study, the proviral DNA sequence of the V3-V5 region of the envelope gene was determined in blood samples from 31 FIV positive cats from 4 different regions of South Africa. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the presence of both subtypes A and C, with subtype A predominating. These findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic diversity of FIV.","535":"","536":"","537":"We describe a rare case of a concurrent demodectic and sarcoptic mange in a 2-year-old heifer in Khartoum, Sudan. The lesions were massive lumps of granulomatous tumour-like dermatitis with thick, nodular folds mainly covering the head, neck and shoulders. Histopathological examination of the lesions revealed the presence of both Demodex bovis and Sarcoptes scabiei. The animal died regardless of the anti-parasitic treatment it received.","538":"Two out of a group of 23 mares exposed to tef hay contaminated with Datura ferox (and possibly D. stramonium) developed colic. The 1st animal was unresponsive to conservative treatment, underwent surgery for severe intestinal atony and had to be euthanased. The 2nd was less seriously affected, responded well to analgesics and made an uneventful recovery. This horse exhibited marked mydriasis on the first 2 days of being poisoned and showed protracted, milder mydriasis for a further 7 days. Scopolamine was chemically confirmed in urine from this horse for 3 days following the colic attack, while atropine could just be detected for 2 days. Scopolamine was also the main tropane alkaloid found in the contaminating plant material, confirming that this had most probably been a case of D. ferox poisoning. Although Datura intoxication of horses from contaminated hay was suspected previously, this is the 1st case where the intoxication could be confirmed by urine analysis for tropane alkaloids. Extraction and detection methods for atropine and scopolamine in urine are described employing enzymatic hydrolysis followed by liquid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/MS\/MS).","539":"Sixteen clinically healthy New Zealand white rabbits of either sex were divided into 2 equal groups (I and II) of 8 animals each. Under thiopental sodium (2.5%) anaesthesia a 2 x 3 cm full-thickness abdominal wall defect in the mid-ventral abdominal wall was created and repaired with an acellular dermal graft (ADG) in all the animals of group I (test group). In animals of group II (control group) a full-thickness linear midline abdominal muscular wall incision was made and repaired with a continuous suture pattern using 2-0 nylon.","540":"Veterinary surgeons have a long tradition of consulting one another about problem cases and many have unwittingly practised telemedicine when discussing cases by telephone or by sending laboratory reports by telefax. Specific veterinary telemedicine applications have been in use since the early 1980s, but little research has been undertaken in this field. The Pubmed and CAB International databases were searched for the following Boolean logic-linked keywords; veterinary and telemedicine, veterinary and telecare, animal and telemedicine, animal and telecare and veterinary and e-mail and an additional search was made of the worldwide web, using Google Scholar. This returned 25 papers which were reviewed. Of these only 2 report research. Sixteen papers had no references and 1 author was associated with 13 papers. Several themes emerge in the papers reviewed. These include remarks about the use of telemedicine, the benefits that can and are derived from the use of telemedicine, areas of practice in which telemedicine is being used, ethical and legal issues around the practice of telemedicine, image standards required for telemedicine, the equipment that is required for the practice of telemedicine, advice on ways in which digital images can be obtained and educational aspects of telemedicine. These are discussed. Veterinary practice has lagged behind its human counterpart in producing research on the validity and efficacy of telemedicine. This is an important field which requires further research.","541":"A practical method was developed to assess the extent of burns suffered by elephants caught in bush fires. In developing this method, the surface areas of the different body parts of juvenile, subadult and adult elephants were first determined using standard equations, and then expressed as a percentage of the total body surface area. When viewed from a distance, the burnt proportion of all body segments is estimated, converted to percentages of total body surface area, and then summed to determine the extent of burns suffered.","542":"Knockdown and persistence efficacies of a pour-on containing Amitraz 1% and Cypermethrin 1% and a spray dip containing 12.5% Amitraz were compared. Knock-down and persistence efficacies of the Amitraz spray dip against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus and Amblyomma hebraeum were significantly higher for the duration of the trial than those of the pour-on. In the case of Rhipicephalus appediculatus and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, efficacy was significantly higher on Days 2 and 5. Resistance testing prior to the start of the trial indicated that R. (B.) decoloratus was resistant to both Cypermethrin and Amitraz, yet in the case of the spray dip excellent efficacy results were obtained. It is thought that the cattle's scruffy winter coat may have hindered the spread of the pour-on, but that the thorough wetting and especially the higher concentration of active ingredient applied via the spray dip allowed this formulation to be effective. These results show that under certain conditions a spray dip containing 12.5% Amitraz may be more effective than a pour-on containing 1% Amitraz and 1% Cypermethrin, despite apparent in vitro resistance.","543":"A survey was conducted at 30 communal dip tanks and on 5 commercial farms in Limpopo Province, South Africa, during 1999 and 2000 to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina. Cattle seropositive for B. bovis were found in 97% of the herds on communal land; the overall seroprevalence changed little between 1999 (63.3%) and 2000 (62.4%). All herds surveyed were infected with B. bigemina, and overall seroprevalence decreased significantly from 56.1% in 1999 to 49.3% in 2000. In herds on communal land in Sour Lowveld Bushveld, overall seroprevalence of B. bovis increased from 70% in 1999 to 80% in 2000, while seroprevalence of B. bigemina decreased from 70% in 1999 to 30% in 2000. This was possibly due to an influx of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus that occurred at the time. In commercially farmed herds the seroprevalence to B. bovis increased significantly from 19% in 1999 to 57.5% in 2000. All commercial herds in the survey tested positive to B. bigemina, with a seroprevalence of 48.3% in 1999 and 47.5% in 2000. During 1999, cattle in 60% of the dip tank\/farm herds with only R. (B.) microplus present were approaching endemic stability to both B. bovis and B. bigemina. In 2000, 60% of the herds with only R. (B.) microplus present were approaching endemic stability for B. bovis, while only 45% were approaching endemic stability for B. bigemina. Those dip tanks\/farms where only R. (B.) microplus was recorded had a significantly higher seroprevalence of B. bovis than those where both tick species were present.","544":"Mastitis is one of the most prevalent production diseases affecting the dairy cattle industry worldwide. Its occurrence is associated with direct and indirect losses and expenditures. When estimating the cost of mastitis to the dairy industry the cost of the control programmes must be added. The direct losses of mastitis are the only costs obvious to the farmer. The difference between the costs of mastitis on one side and the benefits of mastitis control on the other side will give us a picture of the economic efficacy of the mastitis control programme. Continuing education of the farmer is needed for better mastitis control programmes. This article is an attempt to review briefly all relevant factors included in the economics of bovine mastitis and to illustrate the authors' view of some of the costs.","545":"A 6-year-old entire male cat was presented with a 1-week history of severe dyspnoea without coughing. Upon auscultation, an inspiratory and particularly pronounced expiratory wheeze was noted, with severe dyspnoea. The minimum database was normal. Plain thoracic radiographs showed signs of a mural or intraluminal intrathoracic (T1-T4) tracheal narrowing. A dynamic collapsing trachea was ruled out using fluoroscopy. Bronchoscopy was performed and a dark green and brown spiculated foreign object was found just cranial to the carina. Following removal, the cat rapidly developed extensive truncal subcutaneous emphysema and oxygen-responsive dyspnoea and cyanosis. Follow-up radiographs demonstrated unilateral pneumothorax and lung collapse, marked pneumomediastinum and dissection of air through the tracheal wall. A thoracic drain was placed and the pneumothorax resolved rapidly. Follow-up radiographs demonstrated resolution of pneumothorax and development of extensive retroperitoneal air. The cat made an uneventful recovery. The foreign object was the calyx and stem of a flower. This article emphasises the importance of diagnostic imaging in the dyspnoeic patient, both for confirming initial suspicions of respiratory tract disease, and in managing and charting post-therapy resolution or complications.","546":"The anatomical and clinical features of a live-born diprosopic goat kid are described. The kid had two faces with two eyes each, two complete oral cavities and nostrils and two ears. Caudal to the neck, the kid grossly appeared normal. Both mouths of the kid showed synchronous suckling motions. Elevated respiratory and heart rates were recorded and the temperature was subnormal. Radiological examination showed a single trunk and vertebral column, normal limbs, two sets of jaws, three orbits, and contrast radiography revealed a single patent oesophagus. There was maxillary and mandibular duplication resulting in two faces. There was a cleft palate. The oropharyngeal regions of each face merged to form a single laryngopharynx and oesophagus. There was a single brain with hypoplasia of the cerebellum. The left and right cerebral hemispheres were fused rostrally, and there was duplication of the optic chiasma and the pituitary gland. The olfactory tract was absent and the superficial origins of most of the cranial nerves were not discernible.","547":"Nephro-cutaneous fistula, although reported in humans, has not been reported in the dog. In humans the majority of cases develop in patients with a history of previous renal surgery, renal trauma, renal tumours, or chronic urinary tract infection with abscess formation. The dog in this report developed a nephro-cutaneous fistula secondary to a traumatic induced renal abscess with formation of a draining sinus tract to the exterior of the body. The animal underwent simple nephrectomy, which resulted in complete resolution of the fistula.","548":"The objective of this study was to compare the reproductive performance of anoestrous dairy cows treated just prior to the mating start date (MSD) with a Controlled Internal Drug Releasing Device (CIDR) which was placed intravaginaly for either 6 or 8 days, and a combination of oestradiol benzoate. Lactating dairy cows (n = 926) that had been diagnosed with anovulatory anoestrus were divided into two sub-groups. A hormonal treatment protocol that involved the use of a CIDR device containing 1.9 g of progesterone was inserted into the vagina of each cow and left intravaginally for either 6 (6-day group, n = 441) or 8 days (8-day group, n = 485). Every cow in the trial was inseminated after being detected in oestrus from Day -2 onwards (where Day 0, was a herd's MSD), using an appropriate detection aid according to the herds' preference. Cows that had been seen in oestrus and were inseminated by Day 2 were selected for re-synchrony. The standardised re-synchrony involved the re-insertion of a previously used CIDR device into the vagina of each cow on Day 14, together with an injection of 1.0 mg oestradiolbenzoate i.m. This CIDR device was removed on Day 22 and each of these cows injected with 1.0 mg oestradiol benzoate i.m. on Day 23. Each re-synchronised cow that was detected in oestrus was re-inseminated. Treatment with an 8-day CIDR increased the proportion of cows submitted for insemination within the first 3 days of the MSD, compared with the 6-day group (83.7 % vs 71.2%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001), as well as the proportion of cows conceiving within the first 3 days of MSD (36.2% vs 27.7%, P = 0.02), but reduced both the interval from MSD to the first service (4.5 +\/- 0.5 vs 6.8 +\/- 0.7, P = 0.01), and the interval from MSD to conception (28.1 +\/- 1.5 vs 34.0 +\/- 1.8, P = 0.009). A greater percentage of the cows in the 6-day group that were not pregnant to the first insemination were submitted for a second insemination by Day 28 compared with the 8-day group (81.1% vs 68.3%, P &lt; 0.001). Conception rates for cows submitted for this second insemination by Day 28 of the MSD were also higher in the 6-day than in the 8-day group (48.4% vs 33.9%, P = 0.009). The percentage of cows pregnant at the end of a herd's AI period of 6 weeks did not differ (57.1% vs 54.8% for 8-day and 6-day groups, respectively, P = 0.42); neither did the proportion of cows pregnant at the end of the a herd's combined AI and natural mating period of 21 weeks (81.4% vs 79.2%, for 8-day and 6-day groups respectively P = 0.36). Treatment of anovulatory anoestrous dairy cows with a combination of an 8-day CIDR and oestradiol benzoate before the MSD improved their reproductive performance by increasing the portion of cows submitted for insemination within the first 3-days of the MSD by reducing the interval from MSD to first service and by increasing the conception rate to the first insemination to collectively reduce the average interval from MSD to conception.","549":"From a total of 32 717 cattle slaughtered, 183 whole carcass condemnations were attributable to 9 diseases and conditions, namely, tuberculosis (TB), cysticercosis, emaciation, generalised lymphadenitis, jaundice, abscesses, moribund, sarcosporidiosis and odour. Bovine TB was the most important cause of condemnations (152\/183, 83.1%). Bovine cysticercosis and sarcosporidiosis accounted for 5\/183 (2.7%) and 8\/183 (4.4%), respectively, while each of the remaining conditions contributed less. Among the many conditions responsible for offal\/organ condemnations were fascioliasis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, hydatidosis and TB. In terms of number and weight, Fasciola gigantica infections made livers and lungs the most condemned offals (20.1% and 0.7%, respectively). Hydatidosis was the cause of 0.9% lung and 0.1% liver losses. Cysticercus bovis contributed to only 0.05% of all inspected tongues, hearts, and heads. TB was very rare in heads (0.01%). The financial impact of whole carcasses and offals condemned during the study period was enormous and deprived livestock farmers of the much needed revenue and consumers of protein sources. Much or all of the condemned material that could have been useful was wasted by not being retrieved for conversion to processed meat, bone meal or pet food. Failure to detect lesions of potential zoonotic diseases at slaughter poses a health risk to consumers especially when meat is eaten undercooked.","550":"Placental microvesicles were prepared from ovine placentae and immunoglobulins eluted with 0.5 M glycine buffer pH 2.5. The ability of eluate immunoglobulins to re-associate with isologous (self) and third party acidified microvesicles was tested by ELISA. Ovine placental immunoglobulins re-associated with isologous and third party acidified microvesicles suggesting that at least 2 types of antigenic epitopes I and II maybe expressed on the ovine placentae. Type I antigens may be present on placentae of all ovines while type II epitopes may be paternally derived, hence unique to each pregnancy. Analysis by SDS PAGE revealed the heavy and light chains of IgG at 57 and 27 kDa, respectively, together giving a relative molecular weight of 158 kDa. Results suggest that immunoglobulins produced to placental microvesicle antigens may be directed to some but not all antigenic epitopes expressed on the trophoblast, possibly defining a mechanism by which the foetus evades maternal immunological rejection.","551":"Sixteen Bonsmara calves (4 males, 12 females) between 10 and 18 months of age were blocked according to age and sex and randomly assigned to 2 groups. They were offered licks containing bone meal and salt (50:50 ratio) (control) and bone meal and ammonium sulphate (NH4SO4) at 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 18% (treatment) to evaluate the effects of dietary anions on bone phosphate (P) concentration. Bone P concentration was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the NH4SO4 group compared with the control group, indicating that NH4SO4 was able to increase the P content of bone at each of the 6 concentrations used in the lick relative to the control animals, thereby improving the P status of the animals. Ammonium sulphate at 15% and 18 % in the lick also significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased bone P compared with the lower concentrations of NH4SO4. Bone calcium (Ca) fluctuated as a result of the acidogenic lick. There was absorption of Ca when P was being resorbed and resorption of Ca when P was being absorbed into and out of bone. Bone Ca:P ratio ranged from 3.2 to 6.4 among the control group and 1.6 to 4.3 among the treatment group. Animals receiving the acidogenic lick had a higher percentage ash compared to the control group for most of the experimental period. Bone magnesium (Mg) fluctuated in response to the acidogenic lick, and it was difficult to show a relationship between bone Mg and Ca or P. The overall mean cortical bone thickness was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater in treatment (1.60 mm) compared with control (1.43 mm) calves and this was also true at sampling periods 2, 4, 5 and 6. Bone thickness followed bone P and not bone Ca. Results from this research indicate that the addition of ammonium sulphate to a lick had a beneficial effect in improving the P status by increasing bone P and improving the mineral status of bone by increasing the thickness of cortical bone and percentage ash.","552":"Thee different combinations of ketamine hydrochloride were used to induce general anaesthesia for surgical operations (typhlectomy) in 30 adult, single-comb White Leghorn cockerels. They were randomly divided into three groups, each comprising 10 birds. Birds in Group I received xylazine-ketamine combinations at the dose rate of 2 mg xylazine and 10 mg ketamine per kg i.v., whereas birds of Group II received diazepam (2.5 mg\/kg i.v.) and 5 min later ketamine (75 mg\/kg i.m.). In the Group III, midazolam (2 mg\/kg i.m.) and 5 min later ketamine (50 mg\/kg i.v.) was administered. The onset of sedation\/anaesthesia was shortest (1.60 +\/- 0.27 min) in Group I, followed by Group II (8.40 +\/- 0.83 min) and Group III (17.10 +\/- 1.71 min). Recovery period was shortest in the Group I (65-75 min) followed by Group II (80-85 min) and Group III (92-105 min). Sedation, muscle relaxation and surgical anaesthesia was optimal and excellent in Group I compared with the other two groups. Torticollis, salivation and dyspnoea were observed in Group III. Short-term limb contractions were present in all birds in Groups II and III, up to 20 min of observation. Recovery from anaesthesia was smooth in all three groups. A Surgical procedure (typhlectomy) was performed on all birds. Hypothermia was observed in Group II, whereas heart and respiratory depression was recorded in Group I. Blood sugar level did not vary significantly in any anaesthetic regime. The reduction of haemoglobin was maximum in Group II compared with Groups I and III. Hypoxaemia and hypercapnaea were elevated in all birds in Groups II and III. Blood electrolytes did not vary significantly from the baseline values among the three groups of birds during the period of observation (120 min). The xylazineketamine combination was found to be the best anaesthesia for surgical intervention in chickens.","553":"Quill mites (Gabucinia bicaudata) and lice (Struthiolipeurus struthionis) may infest ostrich feathers, resulting in skin damage, pruritus and excessive feather preening and loss. Four different feather types (prime white, femina extra wide, femina class 1, and femina short; n = 10) were collected. The quill mites and lice were removed with fine forceps, studied using a photographic optical microscope and counted microscopically at x 100 magnification following collection by sedimentation. They were placed in separate Petri dishes containing lactophenol solution and examined (x40 magnification). Anatomical features are described. The density of quill mites in all feather types of both wings was higher than that of the lice. There was no significant difference between the counts of both arthropods on the left wing and the right wing, respectively, except for the femina class 1 quill mites (P = 0.01). The femina extra wide feathers were a preferred habitat in both wings. Large standard deviations (quill mites left wing: 73 +\/- 8; quill mites right wing: 69 +\/- 7) suggested variations in the degree of migration between feather shafts or as a response to escape preening. It is recommended that ostriches be treated with an oral preparation of Ivermectin administered per os at a dosage rate of 0.2 mg\/kg at 30-day intervals for quill mites, and with a 1-5 % Malathion dust at 14-day intervals for lice.","554":"Gastrointestinal parasitism is one of the most important disease complexes of sheep and goats impacting on the resource-poor livestock farmer. Of the responsible nematodes, Haemonchus contortus, a blood-sucking worm of the abomasum, poses possibly the greatest threat. Over the past several decades, the worm has been controlled through the use of anthelmintics, but the emergence of anthelmintic resistance has threatened this chemotherapeutic approach. In Africa, the overall prevalence of anthelmintic resistance has not been extensively investigated, particularly within the resource-poor farming sector, but resistance has been reported from at least 14 countries with most of the reports emanating from Kenya and South Africa and the majority concerning H. contortus. While levels of resistance under commercial sheep farming systems in South Africa is considered to be amongst the worst in the world, resistance has also been reported from the resource-poor farming sector. Increases in productivity and reproduction of livestock and the development of markets for sale of animals are seen by international funding bodies as a way out of poverty for communities that keep livestock. This must lead to the greater need for parasite control. At such times, the risk of levels of anthelmintic resistance escalating is much greater and there is therefore a need to look at alternatives to their use. Proposed strategies include the appropriate, but judicious use of anthelmintics by application of the FAMACHA system and the use of alternatives to anthelmintics such as strategic nutrient supplementation. It is also very clear that there is a strong demand for knowledge about animal diseases, including helminthosis, and their effective management in the resource-poor livestock farming communities. This is an important challenge to meet.","555":"This study was done to compare the collection of cat urine, for phosphate concentration determination, by catheterisation with that via a proprietary cat litter (Katkor). The passage of urine through the litter or its retention in the litter for a period of 2 hours did not affect the concentration of phosphates compared with that of the original sample. Apart from a small volume of urine trapped in the litter by capillary action, and some urine adhering to the funnel in which the litter was placed, the litter proved to be an excellent medium for routine urine collection from cats, and more especially as an alternative to catheterisation when regular collection from a particular cat is required.","556":"A 6-year-old, male, wild-born, free-ranging cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) was evaluated for acute onset of progressive lameness in the right hind limb. Survey radiographs were unrewarding and myelography indicated an intramedullary compressive mass at the L3-L4 region. A fine needle aspirate of the lesion indicated the presence of Cryptococcus organisms. Necropsy confirmed the presence of granulomas (cryptococcoma) in the lung and the spinal cord (meningomyelitis) caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii. Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast-like organism that is a potential pathogen to many species. Initial infection is thought to be of respiratory origin and then it commonly disseminates systemically from the nasal cavity or lungs to the skin, eyes and central nervous system in particular. The cheetah tested negative for both feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), as have all the previously reported cheetah cases. C. neoformans is a non-contagious, opportunistic organism and is the most common systemic mycoses in domestic cats and the cheetah.","557":"A survey to demonstrate the presence or absence of genital campylobacteriosis and trichomonosis in cross-bred breeding bulls kept under smallholding dairy farms in the Tanga region of Tanzania was carried out during the period of January-June 1996. Sheath washings, swabs and preputial scrapings were collected from 58 randomly selected bulls. Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis was demonstrated in 3\/58 (5.1%) and Tritrichomonas foetus in 0\/58 (0%) of all bulls tested. Bull-level variables of level of taurine genes (62.5% taurine genes, F2; 75% taurine genes, F3) and age were not significantly associated with campylobacteriosis (P &gt; 0.05). The result of the study identifies Campylobacterfetus subsp. venerelias as the agent of enzootic infertility in smallholder herds and suggests that may be a significant problem.","558":"A 12-month study was conducted in 4 communal grazing areas in the Bushbuckridge region, Limpopo Province, South Africa. The main objective was to investigate the impact of reduced acaricide application on endemic stability to bovine babesiosis (Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis) and anaplasmosis (Anaplasma marginale) in the local cattle population. To this end 60 cattle in each communal grazing area were bled at the beginning and the conclusion of the experimental period and their sera were assayed for B. bovis, B. bigemina and Anaplasma antibodies. Cattle in the intensively dipped group were dipped 26 times and maintained on a 14-day dipping interval throughout the study, whereas cattle in the strategically dipped group were dipped only 13 times. Three cattle, from which adult ticks were collected, were selected from each village, while immature ticks were collected by drag-sampling the surrounding vegetation. During the dipping process, a questionnaire aimed at assessing the prevalence of clinical cases of tick-borne disease, abscesses and mortalities was completed by an Animal Health Technician at each diptank. An increase in seroprevalence to B. bovis and B. bigemina and a decrease in seroprevalence to Anaplasma was detected in the strategically dipped group while in the intensively dipped group the converse was true. Amblyomma hebraeum was the most numerous tick species on the cattle, and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus was more plentiful than Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus. Drag samples yielded more immature stages of A. hebraeum than of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. The incidence of clinical cases of tick-borne disease and of abscesses increased in the strategically dipped group at the start of the survey.","559":"Investigations into the efficacy of parenteral ivermectin (Pandex) administration for strongylidosis control in donkeys were carried out. The preparation was applied subcutaneously at a dose of 0.2 mg\/kg (1 ml\/50 kg body weight). One day prior to the treatment and 14 days post-treatment, individual coprological samples were obtained for faecal nematode egg counts and larval culture. The study was performed on 263 donkeys originating from different regions of Bulgaria. Prior to the treatment and 20 days after that, blood samples were obtained from 64 previously infected animals for monitoring of changes in eosinophil leukocyte counts. The subcutaneous application of ivermectin had an efficacy of 96% in terms of reduction of faecal egg counts. In 92.2% of infected donkeys, a complete reduction of faecal eggs count occurred (0 eggs per gram of faeces epg), whereas in the remaining 7.8% of the infected donkeys, the egg counts were reduced by 72%. The reduction in faecal egg counts did not result in changes in eosinophil counts. The results obtained as well as the lack of local changes after the subcutaneous application of ivermectin in donkeys allow us to recommend its use for control of strongyles in donkeys.","560":"Mortalities in cattle can have severe financial implications for small scale and communal farmers in South Africa. They could also be a measurable indicator for surveillance of animal diseases, such as those listed by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), or diseases included in the regulations of the South African Animal Diseases Act, 1984 (Act 35 of 1984). In order to prevent further mortalities and for accurate surveillance and monitoring of diseases, it is important that farmers participate in the determination of causes of mortality in their cattle. This paper reports on constraints of the reporting diseases to the state veterinary services, the study area being Odi district, in the North West Province. The method that was followed was based on participatory rural appraisal. The selected cattle owners participated in every phase. They were the ones who first spoke to veterinary services about ways to decrease the diseases and mortalities of their cattle. A questionnaire to verify the facts complemented the survey. A total number of 60 farmers were randomly selected from 12 villages. One farmer withdrew, leaving 59 farmers. Most of the farmers in the study were men ( n = 55). The area of study was communal and the farming system traditional and extensive. It was suspected that there was a communication problem and this was proven by the results of the research, as 23 farmers were not even aware that mortalities have to be reported by law. The real problem was that causes of death were not being diagnosed because farmers were not aware that a necropsy could give information on the causes of death. Farmers were keen to receive training in elementary necropsy techniques so as to be able to discuss the cause of death of cattle with the state veterinarian.","561":"The in vitro activities of enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and spiramycin were determined against field isolates of Mycoplasma mycoides mycoides large colony (MmmLC) by means of the broth microdilution technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these antimicrobial drugs were determined for a representative number of 10 isolates and 1 type strain. The susceptibility of Arcanobacterium pyogenes to enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline and tilmicosin was determined by means of an agar disk diffusion test. The MICs of enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and spiramycin were within the ranges of 0.125-0.5, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-4.0 and 4.0-8.0 microg\/ml, respectively. This study has shown that resistance of MmmLC against enrofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and spiramycin was negligible. All the field strains of A. pyogenes that were tested were susceptible to enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline and tilmicosin with mean inhibition zones of 30.6, 42.3 and 35.8 mm, respectively. Although there is lack of data on in vivo efficacy and in vitro MIC or inhibition zone diameter breakpoints of these antimicrobial drugs for MmmLC, the MIC results indicate that these 4 classes of antimicrobial drugs should be effective in the treatment of ulcerative balanitis and vulvitis in sheep in South Africa.","562":"Ovine ulcerative balanitis and vulvitis in sheep of the Dorper breed has been observed in South Africa since 1979. Its aetiology has not been conclusively resolved, and there is some discrepancy in descriptions of its clinical features. In order to identify the pathogenic micro-organism\/s that contribute to the occurrence of the disease, the microflora in the genital tracts of both clinically healthy and affected sheep were isolated and compared. Bacteriological examination of materials from affected and unaffected sheep resulted in the isolation of Arcanobacterium pyogenes from 44.2% and 17.2% of them respectively. This difference is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). Seventy-four per cent of the isolates originated from severe clinical cases. Mycoplasmas were isolated from 49.3% of 116 clinically normal sheep and 78.2% of 104 affected sheep. There were significant differences in their rates of isolation in clinical groups (P &lt; 0.05). Of all the mycoplasma isolates, Mycoplasma mycoides mycoides large colony variant (MmmLC) was isolated from 61.5% of clinically diseased sheep while 6.0% of the isolates were from apparently healthy animals (P &lt; 0.05). The study threw light on the prevalence of mycoplasmas in the genital tract of apparently healthy sheep and, at the same time the identity of the mycoplasma pathogen associated with ulcerative balanitis and vulvitis was revealed. The findings of this investigation therefore confirmed the involvement of mycoplasma, particularly that of MmmLC large colony, in the disease in Dorper sheep in South Africa, and it was concluded that this microorganism is an important pathogen of balanitis and vulvitis in them. The study furthermore demonstrated a probable synergism between A. pyogenes and MmmLC. Finding these 2 organisms together occurred 53.4 times more frequently in the affected sheep than in the unaffected, which emphasises the probable multifactorial nature of the disease. The association between age and the presence of clinical signs was statistically significant. It was found that young sheep were more likely to have lesions than adult sheep. Clinical observations showed that the typical ulceration appears to be confined to the glans penis and lips of the vulva; no ulceration was observed on the shaft of the penis and prepuce or vaginal vestibule. In uncomplicated cases inflammation of the prepuce and vaginal vestibule is not a regular feature of the disease. Therefore the names ulcerative balanitis and vulvitis most accurately describe the nature of the disease in South Africa.","563":"The efficacy of orally administered powdered aloe juice (Aloe ferox) was evaluated against ticks on cattle and against ticks and fleas on dogs. Twelve calves were each infested over a 25-day period with approximately 4000 larvae of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus and allocated to 3 groups of 4 calves each. Three days after the last larval infestation and daily for 22 days thereafter, the calves in 1 group were fed 5 mg\/kg body weight and those in another 25 mg\/kg body weight of powdered aloe juice incorporated in game maintenance pellets, while the animals in the 3rd group received only pellets. Detached female ticks were collected daily and counted and the weights and the fertility of groups of 50 engorged female ticks collected from the animals were ascertained. The powdered aloe juice in the game maintenance pellets had no effect on the tick burdens of the calves or on the fertility of the ticks. Six dogs, in each of 2 groups, were treated daily for 15 consecutive days, commencing on Day -5 before the 1st tick infestation, with either 0.39 g or 0.74 g of powdered aloe juice, administered orally in gelatin capsules, while a 3rd group of 6 dogs served as untreated controls. All the dogs were challenged with Haemaphysalis leachi on Days 0 and + 7, and with Ctenocephalides felis on Days + 1 and + 8, and efficacy assessments were made 1 day after flea and 2 days after tick challenge, respectively. Treatment was not effective against ticks or fleas on the dogs.","564":"The combination of medetomidine-zolazepam-tiletamine with subsequent antagonism by atipamezole was evaluated for reversible anaesthesia of free-ranging lions (Panthera leo). Twenty-one anaesthetic events of 17 free-ranging lions (5 males and 12 females, body weight 105-211 kg) were studied in Zimbabwe. Medetomidine at 0.027-0.055 mg\/kg (total dose 4-11 mg) and zolazepam-tiletamine at 0.38-1.32 mg\/kg (total dose 50-275 mg) were administered i.m. by dart injection. The doses were gradually decreased to improve recovery. Respiratory and heart rates, rectal temperature and relative haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded every 15 min. Arterial blood samples were collected from 5 lions for analysis of blood gases and acid-base status. For anaesthetic reversal, atipamezole was administered i.m. at 2.5 or 5 times the medetomidine dose. Induction was smooth and all lions were anaesthetised with good muscle relaxation within 3.4-9.5 min after darting. The predictable working time was a minimum of 1 h and no additional drug doses were needed. Respiratory and heart rates and SpO2 were stable throughout anaesthesia, whereas rectal temperature changed significantly over time. Atipamezole at 2.5 times the medetomidine dose was sufficient for reversal and recoveries were smooth and calm in all lions independent of the atipamezole dose. First sign of recovery was observed 3-27 min after reversal. The animals were up walking 8-26 min after reversal when zolazepam-tiletamine doses &lt; 1 mg\/kg were used. In practice, a total dose of 6 mg medetomidine and 80 mg zolazepam-tiletamine and reversal with 15 mg atipamezole can be used for either sex of an adult or subadult lion. The drugs and doses used in this study provided a reliable, safe and reversible anaesthesia protocol for free-ranging lions.","565":"Lymphangiosarcoma is an extremely rare tumour in dogs with only 16 cases reported in the literature. Lymphoedema, which may be primary due to defects in the lymphatic system, or secondary to various other pathologies, often precedes malignancy. Of the 16 canine reports, only 1 dog was confirmed as having had prior primary lymphoedema due to aplasia of the popliteal lymph nodes. A case of lymphangiosarcoma is described in a 3.5-year-old purebred, Bullmastiff bitch which presented with vaginal blood 'spotting' for 3 weeks after cessation of oestrus, during which intromission by the male had been unsuccessful. During ovariohysterectomy a large multicystic, proliferative, spongy, fluid-filled, brownish-red mass surrounding the cervix and projecting into the abdominal space was removed with the cervix, and a diagnosis of lymphangiosarcoma made on histological and electron microscopic examination of the tissue. Ultrastructurally, no basement membrane or pericytes were found, only some of the neoplastic endothelial cells were linked by tight junctions while there were gaps between others, and neither micropinocytotic vesicles nor Weibel-Palade bodies occurred in the cells examined. Very few of the endothelial cells lining the many interlinking, tortuous maze of channels, stained slightly positive immunohistochemically for factor VIII-related antigen. The channels were filled mostly with serous fluid, and occasionally mixed leucocytes and some erythrocytes. The endothelium was often associated with underlying blocks of collagenous material, as well as loosely-arranged aggregates of lymphocytes, other mononuclear cells and occasional neutrophils in the connective tissue septae and more prominently perivascularly. The bitch was discharged on antibiotic treatment but returned 2 weeks later with apparent prolapsed vagina which failed to reduce over the next week. Laparotomy revealed the tumour to have spread extensively in the caudal abdomen to involve the broad ligament and the ventral rectal serosa, and the 'prolapsed' tissue was found to be expanded vaginal wall. The bitch was euthanased and necropsied, Histological examination confirmed lymphangiosarcomatous invasion of the submucosal and muscular layers of the retroperitoneal, traumatised, prolapsed part of the vagina, the urethra and the ventral rectal wall. The broad ligament was diffusely invaded with tumour which had proliferated into the caudal abdominal space, and 3 small intra-trabecular foci of tumour were found in the right popliteal lymph node near the hilus. Mitotic figures were generally scarce. There was mild subcutaneous oedema of the ventral trunk extending from the axillae to the inner proximal thighs, which had not been evident clinically, and the lymph nodes (peripheral more so than internal) microscopically showed marked trabecular and perivascular fibrosis especially in hilar regions. Other congenital defects were hepatic capsular and central venous fibrosis with lymphatic duplication and dilatation in all areas of connective tissue, ventrally-incongruous half-circular tracheal rings, and multifocal renal dysplasia affecting the right kidney. There was locally-extensive subacute pyelonephritis of the left kidney.","566":"There have been reports of Rhodococcus equi infections in goats in Australia, America and India. In this study, R. equi was isolated from an inflamed vertebra in a Boer goat in South Africa. At autopsy, there was a purulent inflammatory reaction in the 1st cervical vertebra. Histopathologically, a neutrophilic infiltration was encountered in the bone. Aerobic culture of swabs collected from the abscesses yielded R. equi in pure culture that was identified on biochemical tests. R. equi has become important as the cause of an opportunistic infection in people suffering from HIV.","567":"Spirocercosis is an emerging disease in veterinary medicine. A strong suspicion of spirocercosis is usually evident after a thorough clinical examination and radiography of the chest has been performed. Lesions seen on radiography include an oesophageal mass, spondylitis and oesophageal air. Unfortunately, radiography is not diagnostic and additional diagnostic procedures are required to confirm the diagnosis. Endoscopy is commonly performed to diagnose the condition. The dog presented in this study had radiographic and clinical signs consistent with spirocercosis and definitive diagnosis was required. Shortly after sedation with medetomidine, the dog went into cardiac arrest and failed to respond to resuscitative measures. On post mortem, the diagnosis of spirocercosis was confirmed and the cause of death was identified as acute aortic rupture. Aortic aneurysms are not an uncommon finding and cause of acute death in dogs with spirocercosis. The acute rupture of the aorta in this case is most probably the result of cardiovascular changes associated with the administration of medetomidine. Medetomidine causes an acute rise in systemic vascular resistance with hypertension. The increase in shear stress across the weakened aortic wall resulted in rupture. Caution with the use of medetomidine in patients with spirocercosis is advised.","568":"The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of xylazine alone (0.05 mg\/kg), lignocaine alone (2.0 mg\/kg) and a combination of xylazine and lignocaine (0.05 mg\/kg and 2.0 mg\/kg, respectively) after lumbar epidural administration in water buffalo calves. Fifteen nondescript, male water buffalo calves of 6-8 months of age and weighing between 55 and 75 kg were randomly placed in 3 groups (A, B and C). The agents were administered at the 1st lumbar epidural space. Clinico-physiological parameters such as analgesia, ataxia, sedation, salivation, heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature were studied. Other haematological and biochemical parameters monitored were haemoglobin, packed cell volume, total leukocyte count, plasma glucose, cortisol, protein albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ALT, sodium, potassium and chloride. The onset of analgesia was faster in group C (3.0 +\/- 0.44 min) compared with that of group B (4.4 +\/- 0.40 min) and group A (34.0 +\/- 1.86 min). Analgesia of the thorax, flank, inguinal region, hind limbs, perineum and tail was complete in group C, but mild to moderate in groups A and B. Ataxia was severe in groups B and C and mild in group A. Mild to deep sedation were produced by groups A and C animals. Longer duration and greater depth of analgesia was produced in animals in group C. Heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature decreased in groups A and C. The haematological parameters decreased in all the groups. The biochemical parameters like glucose, cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ALT increased in all the animals. However, total proteins and albumin decreased in the 3 groups. The plasma electrolytes sodium, potassium and chloride did not show any significant change. The results of this study indicated a possible additive analgesic interaction between epidurally administered xylazine and lignocaine, without causing any marked systemic effects in water buffalo calves.","569":"The pharmacokinetics of diminazene aceturate following intramuscular (i.m.) administration at 4.2 mg\/kg was evaluated in 8 healthy German Shepherd dogs. Blood samples were collected at 19 intervals over a period of 21 days. Diminazene plasma concentrations were measured using a validated HPLC method with UV detection and a sensitivity of 25 ng\/ml. The in vitro and in vivo binding of diminazene to blood elements was additionally determined. Diminazene pharmacokinetics showed a large inter-individual variation after i.m. administration. It had a short absorption half-life (K01-HL of 0.11 +\/- 0.18 h), resulting in a C(max) of 1849 +\/- 268.7 ng\/ml at T(max) of 0.37 h and a mean overall elimination half-life (T1\/2beta) of 5.31 +\/- 3.89 h. A terminal half-life of 27.5 +\/- 25.0 h was measured. At 1 h after i.m. injection, 75% of the diminazene in whole blood was in the plasma fraction. The results of this study indicate that diminazene is rapidly distributed and sequestered into the liver, followed by a slower terminal phase during which diminazene is both redistributed to the peripheral tissues and\/or renally excreted. It is recommended that diminazene administered i.m. at 4.2 mg\/kg should not be repeated within a 21-day period.","570":"A preliminary study was conducted to compare uncomplicated canine babesiosis (CB) and experimentally induced normovolaemic anaemia (EA) using Doppler ultrasonography of abdominal splanchnic vessels. Fourteen dogs with uncomplicated CB were investigated together with 11 healthy Beagles during severe EA, moderate EA and the physiological state as a control group. Canine babesiosis was compared with severe EA, moderate EA and the physiological state using Doppler variables of the abdominal aorta, cranial mesenteric artery (CMA), coeliac, left renal and interlobar, and hilar splenic arteries, and the main portal vein. Patterns of haemodynamic changes during CB and EA were broadly similar and were characterised by elevations in velocities and reductions in resistance indices in all vessels except the renal arteries when compared with the physiological state. Aortic and CMA peak systolic velocities and CMA end diastolic and time-averaged mean velocities in CB were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.023) than those in severe EA. Patterns of renal haemodynamic changes during CB and EA were similar. However, the renal patterns differed from those of aortic and gastrointestinal arteries, having elevations in vascular resistance indices, a reduction in end diastolic velocity and unchanged time-averaged mean velocity. The left renal artery resistive index in CB was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.025) than those in EA and the physiological state. Renal interlobar artery resistive and pulsatility indices in CB were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.016) than those of moderate EA and the physiological state. The similar haemodynamic patterns in CB and EA are attributable to anaemia, while significant differences may additionally be attributed to pathophysiological factors peculiar to CB.","571":"Vitamin A deficiency is described in captive lions. Ante mortem diagnosis can either be made by serum analysis or liver biopsy, both of which may be problematic. This study utilised magnetic resonance imaging to identify vitamin A deficiency in lions with relatively mild clinical signs, which could otherwise be attributed to numerous other neurological conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive, reliable diagnostic tool to demonstrate pathology typically associated with this condition. To accommodate varying lion ages and sizes, a number of cranium and brain measurements were compared with that of the maximum diameter of the occular vitreous humor. Occular ratios of the tentorium cerebelli osseum and occipital bone were most reliable in diagnosing the thickened osseous structures characteristic of hypovitaminosis A. The ratio of maximum:minimum dorsoventral diameter of the C1 spinal cord was also of value.","572":"Lymphangiosarcoma in dogs, an extremely rare tumour with only 16 cases reported in the literature, is reviewed. Lymphangiosarcoma in humans, also very rare, and known in post-mastectomy, chronically-lymphoedematous patients as 'Stewart-Treves' syndrome, is briefly outlined, as well as the various other causes of lymphoedema, both primary and secondary, which usually precede malignancy. Comparisons between human and canine lymphoedema are made when such references were found. The genetic links to primary lymphoedema and the manifestation thereof in humans are mentioned. Lymphangiosarcoma in the majority of human and canine patients is an aggressively malignant tumour with few patients surviving despite various attempted treatments. The tumour most commonly arises in the subcutaneous tissues and rapidly invades underlying tissues and may spread widely internally via haematogenous and lymphatic routes, with frequent pleural and chest involvement. The tumour has been reported mostly in medium- to large-breed dogs, in slightly more males than females, and in an age-range of 8 weeks to 13 years, with more cases aged 5 years and older. Methods of diagnosis, with the variations encountered, including routine histopathology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, tissue culture characteristics and endothelial expression of glycocongugates, are discussed.","573":"Joan Morice, a member of the class of 1927, broke the tradition of male student domination at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Faculty, but it took almost 20 years before other young ladies started following her courageous example. The accompanying photograph is unusual in the sense that the students appear in their then customary white coats instead of graduation regalia and that their dean is absent. Concise descriptions are given of the life histories of the 8 graduates. Their careers show more variation than in previous years. Only 1 of them spent his entire career at the Onderstepoort Research Institute and its Faculty, whereas another left the Institute after several years for a well-known pharmaceutical company in the United Kingdom. Although 1 entered private practice shortly after qualifying, she did not make it her permanent career and sadly died at the early age of 44. Another made the move from the field into private practice fairly late in his productive life. One left South Africa to spend most of his career in the Colonial Service in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and later even joined the FAO in Rome. Two spent their entire careers in the field as state veterinarians--1 died at the age of only 43--and a third moved from the field to a locally-based pharmaceutical company.","574":"A 22-year-old male European brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) was presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital after an acute onset of hind limb paralysis 4 days earlier. Previous radiographs revealed marked degenerative joint disease of the stifles, tarsi and digits. The clinical findings were consistent with acute disc prolapse. Lateral radiographs of the entire vertebral column were made as well as ventrodorsal pelvic radiographs. The latter were within normal limits. The vertebral column revealed multiple lesions consistent with chronic and acute disc herniations. Lateral compression of the caudal lumbar nerve roots could not be ruled out. Owing to multiple significant findings of the vertebral column and the poor prognosis for full recovery after surgery, the bear was euthanased. The diagnosis of an acute disc prolapse and multiple chronic disc herniations was confirmed on necropsy.","575":"Ethylene glycol (anti-freeze) toxicity is a serious emergency in both veterinary and human medicine. Ethylene glycol (E\/G) is the active anti-freeze principle in radiator water additives. It is odourless, colourless and has a sweet taste. As little as 5 ml or 20 ml is sufficient to kill a cat or a dog, respectively. Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed and metabolised in the liver to oxalate, which is deposited as calcium oxalate in the kidneys causing irreversible damage. This report describes 2 dogs that were suspected to have ingested ethylene glycol. The report contains a description of the 3 stages of ethylene glycol toxicity as well as a short discussion of the treatment. Public awareness about the dangers of anti-freeze will help in limiting exposure of pets and humans to this potentially fatal toxin. Veterinarians need to be aware of anti-freeze toxicity as delayed recognition and treatment will lead to the death of the patient.","576":"Tracheal trauma with resultant rupture is uncommonly reported in veterinary literature. We report the case of a 16-year-old Thoroughbred gelding that sustained a 1 cm longitudinal perforation of the dorsal tracheal membrane in the proximal cervical region. The horse subsequently developed dyspnoea due to acute upper respiratory obstruction secondary to severe emphysema of the guttural pouches. A temporary tracheostomy caudal to the site of tracheal perforation was performed under local anaesthesia. This procedure helped relieve the upper airway obstruction and aided resolution of the injury by diverting air away from the site of tracheal perforation. After conservative management, the gelding recovered completely.","577":"Datura poisoning of horses is extensively reviewed. An outbreak of intractable impaction colic affecting 18 of 83 horses was stopped by withdrawing dried tef hay contaminated with young Datura plants. The dried, botanically identified Datura stramonium and D. ferox contained respectively 0.15% mass\/mass (m\/m) hyoscyamine as well as 0.16% m\/m hyoscine (scopolamine) and only hyoscine at a concentration of 0.11% m\/m. Immature, unidentifiable plants resembling D. stramonium, contained 0.14% m\/m and 0.12% m\/m of the 2 respective tropane alkaloids. The outbreak was characterised by protracted and repeated colic attacks due to impaction of the large colon and\/or caecum without any other anti-muscarinic signs. Comparative analyses of single specimens of dried seed of the 2 species collected from both fertilised and waste areas revealed that young South African Datura spp. had levels of tropane alkaloids comparable to those in the well-known toxic seed and were, consequently, equally toxic. The inherent danger of tef hay being contaminated with Datura is emphasised. To our knowledge this is the 1st field case of poisoning in horses ascribed to the vegetative parts of Datura spp.","578":"Sera from 173 apparently healthy, unvaccinated dogs from 4 widely separated communal lands in Zimbabwe were tested by ELISA for antibodies against canine distemper virus. Overall, 82% were positive with high prevalences found in each communal land. The highest seroprevalence was in dogs between 1 and 2 years of age (91%; 49\/54). These results show dogs in the communal lands of Zimbabwe are commonly exposed to canine distemper virus and that a substantial number survive infection. The role that the virus might play in the high mortality rate of the dog population on communal land warrants further investigation.","579":"The toxic effects of the extracts of Allium sativum (Garlic) were evaluated against adults of Hyalomma marginatum rufipes and Rhipicephalus pulchellus using three types (Types A, B and C) of contact toxicity bioassays. A. sativum bulbs were extracted with acetone, ethanol and dichloromethane (DCM) solvents. Among these three solvents, it is the DCM extract of A. sativum that appears to have anti-tick activity. In the Type A contact toxicity bioassay, DCM extracts of A. sativum demonstrated a high acaricidal bioactivity against H. m. rufipes with 100% of ticks killed in less than an hour, and toxicity persisted to the second day. A weak acaricidal activity of aqueous extracts of A. sativum was observed in the Type B contact toxicity bioassay. In the Type C contact toxicity bioassay, a concentration of 24% w\/v of DCM extracts of garlic in sunflower oil (Helianthus annuus) had killed 100% of H. m. rufipes (LC50 = 5.9% w\/v) and R. pulchellus (LC50 = 10.3% w\/v) by 24 hours post-treatment of ticks. The results obtained from this study suggest that DCM extract of A. sativum is a potential source of novel acaricidal agents.","580":"A 14-year-old lioness, originating from Etosha in Namibia, and a member of a pride in Pilanesberg National Park since translocation in 1994, was euthanased due to fight-related vertebral fracture and spinal injury, incurred approximately 6-8 weeks previously. Blood specimens collected at the time of death showed mild anaemia and a leukogram reflecting stress and chronic infection. Necropsy conducted within 2 hours of death was on a dehydrated, emaciated animal with hindquarter wasting and chronic traumatic friction injuries from dragging her hindlegs. There was cellulitis in the region of bite-wounds adjacent to the thoraco-lumbar vertebral fracture, at which site there was spinal cord compression, and there was marked intestinal helminthiasis. The outer renal medullae appeared pale and waxy and the liver was macroscopically unremarkable. Histopathology and electron microscopy of the kidneys revealed multifocal to coalescing deposits of proximal medullary interstitial amyloid, which fluoresced strongly with thioflavine T, and was sensitive to potassium permanganate treatment prior to Congo Red staining, thus indicating inflammatory (AA) origin. There was diffuse hepatocyte dissociation, as well as numerous binucleated and scattered multinucleated (up to 8 nuclei\/cell) hepatocytes, with swollen hepatocyte mitochondria, in liver examined light microscopically. Ultrastructurally, the mono-, bi- and multinucleated hepatocytes contained multifocal irregular membrane-bound accumulations of finely-granular, amorphous material both intra-cytoplasmically and intra-nuclearly, as well as evidence of irreversible mitochondrial injury. The incidence and relevance in cats and other species of amyloidosis, particularly with renal medullary distribution, as well as of hepatocyte dissociation and multinucleation, as reported in selected literature, is briefly overviewed and their occurrence in this lioness is discussed.","581":"Propofol is, as a result of its formulation, an ideal bacterial and yeast culture medium. An outbreak of sepsis in humans and an increase in wound infections in dogs has been ascribed to the use of propofol. It has been previously reported that a 1:1 mixture of propofol and thiopentone has bactericidal properties. This study was undertaken to determine if further serial mixtures of propofol and thiopentone maintained the bactericidal properties. Mixtures of 1:1 (solution A), 5:1 (solution B), 10:1 (solution C), 50:1 (solution D) and 100:1 (solution E) of 1% propofol to 2.5 % thiopentone, 2.5% thiopentone (solution T), 1% propofol (solution P) and saline (solution S) were prepared and inoculated with between 10(5) and 10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. A sample was withdrawn from each solution at 0, 1, 6, 12, 48 and 120 hours after inoculation and a bacterial count was performed. This study showed that thiopentone and solution A behaved in similar fashion by inhibiting bacterial growth and was bactericidal after 48 hours. Solution B was not bactericidal against S. aureus and C. albicans. Propofol and solutions D and E all supported growth of all the organisms tested. These data indicate that mixtures of propofol and thiopentone at a ratio less than 1:1 do not maintain the bactericidal properties.","582":"The objective of the study was to determine the analgesic and systemic effects of subarachnoid administration of xylazine hydrochloride (XY), lidocaine hydrochloride (LI) and their combination (XYLI) in goats. Six healthy goats were used in a prospective randomised study. Three treatments were administered to each goat, with 1-week intervals between each treatment. Treatments consisted of 0.1 mg\/kg xylazine, 2.5 mg\/kg lidocaine and a combination of xylazine 0.05 (mg\/kg) and lidocaine (1.25 mg\/kg). Analgesia, ataxic, sedative, cardiovascular and respiratory effects, and rectal temperature were evaluated before (baseline) and at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after subarachnoid injection, and then at 30-min intervals until loss of analgesia occurred. Lidocaine induced analgesia in 3.1 +\/- 1 min (mean +\/- SD), which lasted for 66 +\/- 31 min. Heart and respiratory rates and blood pressure remained unchanged after lidocaine-induced analgesia. Xylazine induced analgesia in 9.5 +\/- 2.6 min and xylazine-lidocaine in 3.2 +\/- 1.2 min. Xylazine-lidocaine-induced analgesia lasted longer (178.3 +\/- 37 min) than that induced by xylazine (88.3 +\/- 15 min). The XYLI treatment induced prolonged motor blocking (115 min), more than the XY (80 min) and LI (90 min) treatments. Both xylazine and xylazine-lidocaine caused significant decreases in the heart and respiratory rates, but not in blood pressure. The combination of xylazine (0.05 mg\/kg) and lidocaine (1.25 mg\/kg) can be administered subarachnoidally (between last lumbar vertebra and 1st sacral vertebra) to produce prolonged (&gt; 2.5 h) analgesia of the tail, perineum, hind limbs, flanks and caudodorsal rib areas in goats. Despite the prolonged analgesia, using this combination is desirable for relieving postoperative pain, but it may be a disadvantage due to a motor block when dealing with goats.","583":"Adult biting lice Damalinia limbata (Gervais 1844) were most numerous on Angora goats in southwestern Free State Province from November to May with the smallest numbers present during August. Nymphs were most numerous from January to March with the smallest numbers present during July. The largest proportion of adult lice was present on the ventral surface of goats during winter, when population numbers were lowest, and the largest proportion of nymphs during summer, when population numbers were highest. Infestation did not affect the body weight of goats, but adversely affected both the quantity and quality of mohair produced. A single treatment with deltamethrin, applied as a pour-on along the mid-line of the backs of the goats, effectively controlled infestation and resulted in a significant increase in mohair production compared with untreated goats. Deltamethrin sprayed along the sides of the animals was equally effective in controlling infestation.","584":"In order to determine the safety of milk produced by smallholder dairy goat farms, a farm-based research study was conducted on commercial dairy goat farms to compare the microbiological quality of milk produced using 3 different types of dairy goat production systems (intensive, semi-intensive and extensive). A survey of dairy goat farms in and around Pretoria carried out by means of a questionnaire revealed that most of the smallholder dairy goat farms surveyed used an extensive type of production system. The method of milking varied with the type of production system, i.e. machine milking; bucket system machine milking and hand-milking, respectively. Udder half milk samples (n=270) were analysed, of which 31.1% were infected with bacteria. The lowest intra-mammary infection was found amongst goats in the herd under the extensive system (13.3%), compared with 43.3% and 36.7% infection rates under the intensive and semi-intensive production systems, respectively. Staphylococcus intermedius (coagulase positive), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus simulans (both coagulase negative), were the most common cause of intramammary infection with a prevalence of 85.7% of the infected udder halves. The remaining 14.3% of the infection was due to Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteriology of bulk milk samples on the other hand, showed that raw milk obtained by the bucket system milking machine had the lowest total bacterial count (16,450 colony forming units (CFU)\/ml) compared to that by pipeline milking machine (36,300 CFU\/ml) or hand-milking (48,000 CFU\/ml). No significant relationship was found between the somatic cell counts (SCC) and presence of bacterial infection in goat milk In comparison with the herds under the other 2 production systems, it was shown that dairy goat farming under the extensive production system, where hand-milking was used, can be adequate for the production of safe raw goat milk.","585":"A trial was carried out to investigate the possible role of Ostertagia circumcincta, coccidiosis and level of protein in the diet in the development of swelling disease in Angora goat kids. Eighty Angora goat kids were bought from 5 producers whose flocks had a history of swelling disease. These kids were kept in enclosures at Grootfontein Agricultural Development Institute near Middelburg (Eastern Cape) for the duration of the experiment. The animals received a combination of the following treatments: (a) high protein vs normal protein diet; (b) Ostertagia circumcincta infection or no O. circumcincta infection; (c) coccidial infection or no coccidial infection. Data recorded included weekly body weight, weekly total plasma protein levels (TPP), weekly faecal egg counts, weekly coccidial oocyst counts and haematology at Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13 and 16. The goats were also monitored daily for any clinical symptoms. There was no specific trend in any of the parameters measured among the different treatment groups at any stage during the experimental period. The goats were shorn during Week 10 of the experiment. On Monday 6 September 2004 (Week 12 of the study), 19 of the goats developed some subcutaneous oedema. The Saturday (4 September 2004) was rather hot (30 degrees C), followed by very cold rainy conditions (11 degrees C) on Sunday (5 September 2004). Twelve of the goats developed what can be described as little oedema, while 7 developed moderate oedema. The number of goats that developed oedema was fairly evenly distributed among the various treatment groups. As far as the specific treatments are concerned, more goats on the normal protein diet developed moderate oedema than the goats on the high protein diet. Body weights of goats that developed moderate oedema were lower throughout the experimental period than body weights of goats that developed little or no oedema, while TPP of goats that developed moderate oedema were lower from Week 5 of the study onwards. There were also no significant differences at any stage throughout the experimental period in faecal egg counts, faecal coccidial oocyst counts or any of the blood parameters between goats that developed moderate oedema, little oedema and those that did not develop any oedema. No goats developed full-blown swelling disease during the course of the experiment. It is possible that the treatments applied in this study are not inductive of the disease, or the effects of the treatments were not severe enough to induce swelling disease.","586":"Histopathological examination was performed on cutaneous biopsies from 900 dogs with skin lesions from Zimbabwe, collected from 1996 to 2000. Clinical data were collected from medical records. Sixty per cent (540\/900) of the cases were tumours and 40% (360\/900) were non-neoplastic inflammatory or degenerative diseases. Thirty different histological types of tumour were diagnosed. The prevalence of epithelial, mesenchymal, lymphohistiocytic and melanocytic tumours was 39.4%, 44.4%, 7.4% and 8.7%, respectively. The 10 most common tumours, comprising 73.7% of all cutaneous neoplasms, were mast cell tumours, squamous cell carcinomas, perianal gland adenomas, lymphomas, benign melanomas, haemangiosarcomas, sebaceous gland adenomas, fibrosarcomas, lipomas and malignant melanomas. The prevalence of various neoplasms, age of affected dogs and sites of occurrence were similar to surveys in other countries, except that in Zimbabwe there was a greater prevalence of lymphomas and of tumours associated with increased exposure to ultraviolet light (squamous cell carcinomas, haemangiosarcomas and melanomas). For all classes of tumours the sex of the dog did not have any significant influence on the likelihood of developing a tumour. For a dog diagnosed with a tumour located on the trunk, the tumour was significantly more likely to be an epithelial tumour than a non-epithelial tumour The occurrence of melanocytic tumours on the trunk was significantly lower than at other sites. Lymphohistiocytic tumours were 10 times more likely to occur at multiple locations as opposed to single locations.","587":"Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae) is a deciduous tree widespread in southern Africa. The plant has many ethnomedical and ethnoveterinary uses. Root and bark decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat, wounds, back and joint pains, HIV-AIDS, venereal diseases and infertility. Pastoralists and rural farmers use the root and bark extracts to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, infertility, and to promote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle. To evaluate these ethnobotanical leads, dried leaves, stem bark and root bark were extracted with ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane. Polyphenols in the extract were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method with gallic acid as standard. Qualitative antioxidant activity was screened by spraying thin layer chromatograms (TLC) of the extracts with 0.2% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH), and quantified with Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and total antibacterial activity (TAA) were determined by serial microplate dilution for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, with gentamicin as standard and tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. Acetone and ethanol extracted the largest quantity of material. Polyphenols concentration was 49.2% in acetone extract of the root and 3.8% in dichloromethane extract of the leaf. Antioxidant activity of at least 5 antioxidant compounds as measured by TEAC ranged from 1.34 (ethanol extract of the root) to 0.01 (hexane extract of the leaf). The total antibacterial activity (volume to which active compounds present in 1 g plant material can be diluted and still inhibit bacterial growth) was 1263 ml\/g for ethanol extract of the root against S. aureus, and 800 ml\/g for acetone extract of the root against P. aeruginosa. There was substantial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with MIC values of 0.08 mg\/ml for S. aureus and 0.16 mg\/ml for P. aeruginosa. There is therefore a rationale for the traditional use of root and bark of P. africanum in treating bacterial infection related diseases.","588":"The Veterinary Pharmacovigilance and Medicines Information Centre is responsible for the monitoring of veterinary adverse drug reactions in South Africa. An overview of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions received by the centre during the period March 2003 to February 2004 is given. A total of 20 reports was received. This had declined from the previous year. The general apathy with regards to the reporting of adverse drug reaction has prompted the Medicines Control Council to make reporting a legal obligation on all members of the veterinary and medical profession as from August 2004. The majority of reports involved suspected adverse reactions that occurred in dogs and cats. Most of the products implicated were Stock Remedies. Veterinarians predominantly administered these products. Only two reports were received from a veterinary pharmaceutical company.","589":"A 14-month-old female Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) was presented with a 4-week history of bloody diarrhea and depression. No additional information could be gained from physical examination. Only selected diagnostic tests (faecal examination, haematocrit, aspartate aminotransferase, and uric acid) could be performed due to financial constraints, but all where within reference range. Unspecific antibiotic treatment was started and the bird responded well initially, but had to be readmitted 2.5 weeks after initial presentation. Four weeks after initial presentation the owner finally consented to taking whole body radiographs and a diagnosis of an intestinal foreign body could be made. The foreign body was surgically removed 2 days later. The bird recovered uneventfully after surgery and was still in good health 1 year after surgery. This article emphasises the importance of diagnostic imaging in the avian patient. A brief review of avian gastrointestinal foreign bodies is given (concentrating on the psittacine patient) and the importance of distinguishing metallic from non-metallic gastrointestinal foreign bodies are discussed.","590":"An 11-year-old female German Shepherd dog was presented for investigation of progressive enlargement of the abdomen, periodic bloody discharge from the vulva and rapid exhaustion. Transabdominal ultrasonography and lateral abdominal radiography demonstrated an echogenic formation with anechogenic cavities located cranial to the urinary bladder and a homogeneous shadow with an elliptical shape was located caudal to the rib arc. Both showed indistinct borders. Exploratory laparotomy identified bilateral ovarian masses and ovariohysterectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. The dog remained clinically normal without evidence of metastatic disease 4 months after surgery. Papillary cystadenocarcinoma in the bitch could affect both ovaries and manifests with a rapid growth rate and clinical signs such as rapid exhaustion, abdominal enlargement and vulval discharge. Ovariohysterectomy is the treatment option.","591":"Aeromonas hydrophila is one of the most common bacteria associated with the aquatic environment. There are, however, limited data on A. hydrophila infection in crocodilians. The aim of this report is to describe a case of skin lesions and septicaemia associated with A. hydrophila in a Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). A captive male crocodile in the Zoological Park of Antalya (Turkey) was found dead without showing signs of any disease. Gross examination showed brown or red-spotted skin lesions of varying size. These lesions were mostly scattered over the abdomen and occasionally on the tail and feet. At necropsy, numerous white, multifocal and randomly distributed areas were seen on the liver. Gram-stained smears from skin and liver lesions showed Gram-negative bacilli arranged in clusters. Pure cultures of A. hydrophila were recovered from skin, internal organs and blood. Isolates were found to be susceptible to ceftiofur, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, oxytetracycline, enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, neomycin, gentamicin, and lincomycin + neomycin. A pathogenicity test was performed using this isolate on 4 male 2-year-old New Zealand white rabbits. Local abscesses formed in 2 rabbits injected subcutaneously and the 2 that were injected intraperitoneally died as a result of septicaemia. In conclusion, this report has shown that A. hydrophila may cause skin lesions and even death due to septicaemia in crocodiles.","592":"This article describes a rare neurological complication of anaesthesia in a 2 year-old Clydesdale colt undergoing castration. Anaesthesia was induced with glyceryl guaiacol ether and ketamine and maintained with halothane. Following an uneventful anaesthetic of 40 minutes, the horse recovered from anaesthesia in a padded recovery stall. After approximately 70 minutes in the recovery stall, the horse attempted to stand and adopted a dog sitting position. One hundred and fifty minutes later, the horse became distressed and was sedated with xylazine. Clinical examination of the horse did not reveal any evidence of myositis or fractures. A neurological examination revealed an intact anal reflex, deep pain response in the hind legs, tail tone and voluntary movement of the hind legs was possible. The horse deteriorated neurologically over the next 24 hours and was euthanased on humane grounds. The horse was submitted for necropsy. Gross pathology was unremarkable except for a small amount of haemorrhage around the right kidney. Histopathology revealed no abnormalities in any muscle groups or peripheral nerves. Congestion and axonal swelling of the spinal cord was evident from T16 to S1. Ischaemic neurons were evident from L 1 to L 6. The most prominent lesions were at L4 and L5. A diagnosis of myelomalacia was made. This is a rare complication of anaesthesia in horses with 9 case studies appearing in the literature since 1979. This is the 1st case to be reported in South Africa. The speculated pathophysiology and risk factors for this complication are discussed.","593":"The effect of water intake prior to blood sampling on subsequent packed cell volume (PCV) was investigated in ewe lambs (8 months of age) of the Dohne Merino, Merino and Letelle flocks at Grootfontein Agricultural Development Institute. On the afternoon of the day before the experiment was conducted, a blood sample for a baseline PCV value (R) was taken from each animal. The following day, 15 ewes of each breed (n = 45) were dosed with 1 litre of water and another 15 of each (n = 45) were used as a control. Blood samples for PCV were taken concurrently for both the control and water treatment groups before the dose (0), and at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after dosing. PCV were subsequently determined with the microcapillary centrifuge technique. Baseline PCV of Letelle ewes was higher (32.4 +\/- 0.6) than that of the Dohne Merino (29.7 +\/- 0.6) and Merino (28.7 +\/- 0.6) ewes. Furthermore, recovery rate at 30 minutes after treatment also differed among breeds. Although there were significant differences between the control and water treatment groups at R and 0 minutes, which were probably due to inherent animal differences, there were no significant differences between PCV of the 2 groups during the remainder of the experimental period. Overall it can be concluded that water intake before blood sampling for the determination of PCV has no significant effect on haematocrit. Differences among breeds were more pronounced than those between treatment groups.","594":"Haematological variables and selected serum indices, particularly those affected by changes in renal and hepatic function, were examined in 6 healthy ponies following 4 intramuscular doses of 4 mg\/kg imidocarb dipropionate administered every 72 hours. This treatment regime has been reported to sterilise experimental Babesia equi infections in horses and may have value in preventing the spread of this disease during exportation of possible carrier horses to non-endemic countries. Serum bile acids and serum gamma glutamyltransferase activity were measured to evaluate the effect of this treatment regime on hepatic function. Owing to the absence of any increase in these variables it was concluded that this treatment regime had no clinically detectable deleterious effect on hepatic function in healthy ponies. Urinary gamma glutamyltransferase : creatinine ratios (IU\/g), serum creatinine and fractional clearance of sodium, potassium and phosphate (%) were calculated as a measure of renal function. Urinary GGT and urinary GGT : creatinine ratios were significantly elevated on Day 5 of the trial, with 2 of the trial animals also exhibiting mild azotaemia indicative of changes in renal function. The changes in urine GGT : urine creatinine ratios observed in this study also provides evidence of the value of this ratio for the early detection of renal toxicity, following exposure to nephrotoxic agents.","595":"Milk and blood serum from clinically mastitis infected, subclinically mastitis infected and healthy Friesian cows (15 samples from each of 3 groups) were evaluated for macrominerals (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus). The milk from cows infected with subclinical mastitis revealed a significant decrease in potassium (P &lt; 0.001) and a significant increase in sodium and phosphorus content (P &lt; 0.01). Similarly, the milk from cows with the clinical form of the disease showed a significant increase in sodium (P &lt; 0.001) and a significant decrease in potassium, magnesium (P &lt; 0.001) and calcium (P &lt; 0.01). Comparison of healthy cow's milk with that from cows with subclinical mastitis revealed a highly significant increase in sodium (P &lt; 0.001). Comparison of healthy cow's milk with that of clinically mastitic milk showed a highly significant decrease in levels of calcium, magnesium (P &lt; 0.001) and potassium (P &lt; 0.01). However, sodium increased highly significantly (P &lt; 0.001). Comparison of macro-minerals in milk from cows with subclinical and clinical mastitis revealed a significant decrease in potassium contents (P &lt; 0.05) compared with that of healthy cows. Potassium levels were found to decrease significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in subclinically infected cow's blood serum. However, calcium and phosphorus showed a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.01) in blood serum samples from the clinically infected cows.","596":"A combination of thiafentanil (A3080), medetomidine hydrochloride (MED) and ketamine hydrochloride (KET) was evaluated in 19 boma-habituated (12 female and 7 males) and 9 free-ranging nyala (7 male and 2 females) (Tragelaphus angasi) to develop a safe and reliable anaesthesia protocol. Wide dosages were used safely during this study with ranges for A3080 of 45 +\/- 8 microg\/kg with MED of 69 +\/- 19 microg\/kg and KET of 3.7 +\/- 1.0 mg\/kg (200 mg\/ animal). The dosages developed on boma-habituated nyala proved to be equally effective in 9 adult free-ranging nyala (7 males and 2 females). The optimum dosage for nyala was a combination of A3080 (40-50 microg\/kg), MED (60-80 microg\/kg) plus 200 mg of KET\/animal. The anaesthesia was characterised by a short induction, good muscle relaxation and mild hypoxaemia during monitoring the anaesthesia was rapidly and completely reversed by naltrexone hydrochloride (30 mg\/mg of A3080) and atipamezole hydrochloride (5 mg\/mg of MED) given intramuscularly. There was no mortality or morbidity associated with this protocol.","597":"In this paper the main epidemiological aspects of the major domestic ruminant trematode infections in Zimbabwe are reviewed and discussed with regard to the available options for control. Seasonal occurrence of amphistomes, Fasciola gigantica and Schistosoma mattheei are considered both in the definitive and intermediate hosts. The regional distribution of the trematodes is reviewed in relation to the distribution patterns of their snail intermediate hosts. Based on the epidemiological features of the trematodes, practical control measures are suggested.","598":"Cardiac dysfunction in canine babesiosis has traditionally been regarded as a rare complication, with the majority of lesions reported as incidental findings at post-mortem examination. Recent studies have, however, demonstrated cardiac lesions in canine babesiosis. Cardiac troponins, especially troponin I, are sensitive markers of myocardial injury in canine babesiosis, and the magnitude of elevation of plasma troponin I concentrations appears to be proportional to the severity of the disease. ECG changes in babesiosis are similar to the pattern described for myocarditis and myocardial ischaemia and together with histopathological findings indicate that the heart suffers from the same pathological processes described in other organs in canine babesiosis, namely inflammation and hypoxia. The clinical application of the ECG appears to be limited and thus cardiovascular assessment should be based on functional monitoring rather than an ECG tracing. On cardiac histopathology from dogs that succumbed to babesiosis, haemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation and fibrin microthrombi in the myocardium were documented, all of which would have resulted in ECG changes and elevations in cardiac troponin. Myocardial damage causes left ventricular failure, which will result in hypotension and an expansion of the plasma volume due to homeostatic mechanisms.","599":"","600":"Strategic application of moxidectin pour-on (Cydectin) was evaluated in Uganda for its effect on pasture larval counts and gastrointestinal nematode faecal egg counts in village cattle kept under tethering (semi-intensive) grazing management. The strategic deworming schedule involved treating cattle twice at an interval of 2 months, at the end of the 1st wet season and during the 2nd wet season. Two groups of 30 cattle, each consisting of a treated and a control group, were examined for nematode infections every 4 weeks from June 1999 to January 2000. The treated group had significantly lower mean faecal egg counts than the untreated groups (t-value = 2.47, P &lt; 0.05). Generally, the pasture larval counts on treated farms were lower than on untreated ones, but not significantly so (t-value = 2.22, P = 0.068). Pasture larval counts with different nematode species on treated farms were lower than on untreated ones, but the differences were not significant for Haemonchus spp. (t-value = 1.68, P = 0.145), Oesophagostomum spp. (t-value = 1.87, P = 0.111), Trichostrongylus spp. (t-value = 1.93, P = 0.102), Dictyocaulus spp. (t-value = -0.74, P = 0.485) and Cooperia spp. (t-value = -1.00, P = 0.356). Treated farms did, however, have significantly lower pasture larval counts of Bunostomum spp. (t-value = 4.64, P &lt; 0.05). This study has revealed that the application of moxidectin pour-on on cattle has an effect on faecal egg count and pasture contamination under the tethering grazing system. Moxidectin pour-on and the strategic deworming schedule evaluated here could be used for the control of gastrointestinal nematode infections in cattle by small-scale farmers who practise tethering or semi-intensive grazing management in Uganda and other tropical countries, especially where there is a bimodal rainfall pattern.","601":"Gastrodiscosis outbreaks due to Gastrodiscus aegyptiacus were recorded in horses in the vicinity of Harare, Zimbabwe, in the absence of Bulinus forskalii, B. senegalensis and Cleopatra sp. which are considered to be the only intermediate host snails. This suggested the possibility of other snail species acting as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of the trematode. A study was carried out to determine the susceptibility of 7 freshwater snail species to infection with G. aegyptiacus. First generation (F-1) of 5 freshwater pulmonate snail species, Bulinus tropicus, Bulinus globosus, Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Helisoma dyuri and Physa acuta that were bred in the laboratory, and 2 prosobranch snail species, Melanoides tuberculata and Cleopatra sp. that were collected from the field were used in this study. Data pertaining to mortalities and cercariae shedding were recorded throughout the experimental period. The prosobranch snails, M. tuberculata and Cleopatra sp. were susceptible to G. aegyptiacus with a minimum prepatent period of 45 days and 54 days, respectively. Bulinus tropicus, P. acuta and H. duryi were susceptible as evidenced by the presence of different generations of rediae and mature cercariae on dissection at 59 days post-infection although attempts to induce the snails to shed from 28 days post-infection did not produce cercariae. Bulinus globosus and Bio. pfeifferi were refractory to infection. The results revealed the ability of G. aegyptiacus to infect M. tuberculata, Cleopatara sp., B. tropicus, P. acuta and H. duryi under experimental conditions and this may explain the recorded outbreaks of gastrodiscosis in equine populations in Zimbabwe in the absence of the known intermediate hosts. Bulinus tropicus is considered as the most likely major intermediate host of G. aegyptiacus because of its wide distribution in Zimbabwe and is well adapted to a wide variety of environments.","602":"Cyclodextrins are ring-shaped oligosaccharides with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior. The interior cavity is capable of complexing fat-soluble molecules small enough to fit inside. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as treatment of aldicarb poisoning in rats. Survival times in the majority of rats dosed with aldicarb and receiving intravenous cyclodextrin were longer compared with the control rats only dosed with aldicarb per os.","603":"A survey of aldicarb poisoning in companion animals was conducted by posting questionnaires to all private practitioners in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The survey was designed to determine the percentage of aldicarb cases seen, treatment regimen, clinical signs observed, proposals for preventative actions and more effective treatments. Other questions included duration of treatment, survival rate, cost to clients, post mortem findings and reasons for poisonings.","604":"A pilot survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted in Tororo and Busia districts of Uganda on the knowledge and attitudes of cattle owners regarding tsetse fly and trypanosomosis control, in order to understand factors that hindered their full participation. A total of 81 cattle owners was randomly selected and interviewed, of which 92.5% were aware of tsetse flies and trypanosomosis and 87.6% recognised animal trypanosomosis as a problem in the area. Most cattle owners were aware of tsetse fly trapping (76.5%), isometamidium chloride use (55.5%), diminazene aceturate use (48%) and pour-on applications (18.5%). However, knowledge did not coincide with the application of control measures. Despite the widespread awareness, tsetse fly trapping and pour-on applications were used by only a small percentage of cattle owners (7.5% applied tsetse fly trapping while 76.5% were aware of it; 1.2% applied pour-on insecticides while 18.5% were aware of them). Differences between awareness and application were highly significant for tsetse fly trapping (chi2 = 67.8, d.f. = 1, P &lt; 0.001) and pour-on applications (chi2 = 10.8, d.f. = 1, P &lt; 0.05), but not for isometamidium chloride use (chi2 = 0.08, d.f. = 1, P = 0.77) and diminazene aceturate use (chi2 = 0.00, d.f. = 1, P = 1.00). Most cattle owners (97.5%) were willing to participate in future control programmes, but preferred participating on a group basis (85.2%) rather than individually (14.8%). The 4 most favoured control options in order of importance were: fly traps supplied by the government and maintained by cattle owners; contribution of labour by cattle owners for trap deployment; self-financing of trypanocidal drugs and self-financing of pour-on insecticide. The control options that should be selected in order to elicit full participation by cattle owners are discussed.","605":"A retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence, signalment, haematological and biochemical changes, therapy, and outcome of dogs presented to the Outpatients section of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital for confirmed snake envenomation. Three hundred and seventy-six records of dogs presented for snake envenomation from 1998 to 2002 were reviewed and 155 were selected on the basis of there being a positively identified snake. The 2 most commonly encountered snake envenomations in dogs were puff-adders (Bitis arietans) and snouted cobras (Naja annulifera annulifera). The majority of cases (56%) occurred in the autumn (March to May), with most being bitten by puff-adders. Dogs were 3 to 168 months old with a median of 36 months. No sex predilection was identified. Ten per cent of cases died because of the snake envenomation. Fifty-seven per cent and 43% of snakebites were puff-adders and cobras, respectively. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups of snakes. Of the cobras 60% were the snouted cobra, 14% Mozambique spitting cobra, and 24% rhinkals. Swelling in the area of the bite, usually the face and forequarters, was the primary clinical abnormality. Significant haematological findings were leukocytosis (median 17.3 x 10(9)\/l; range 0.4-44), neutrophilia (median 13.6 x 10(9)\/l; range 0.3-39.9), band neutrophilia (median 0.4 x 10(9)\/l; range 0-5.32), and thrombocytopaenia (median 124 x 10(9)\/l; range 3-555). Dogs envenomated by a puff-adder and Mozambique spitting cobra had a greater degree of thrombocytopaenia: median of 68 and 66, respectively, versus 243 for the cobra group. The most commonly used treatments were intravenous fluids, antibiotics and glucocorticoids. Thirty-eight dogs were treated with polyvalent antiserum: 9 for puff-adder envenomation and 29 for cobra envenomation. Only 2 of the dogs that received antisera died, both of them of cobra envenomation. The study concluded that snake envenomation in dogs is associated with high morbidity but moderate mortality rate and that the most significant haematological abnormality is thrombocytopaenia.","606":"The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in oral masses of dogs. Nineteen dogs underwent clinical, MR and CT examinations. Eleven malignant and ten non-malignant masses were evaluated. Osteosarcoma was the most commonly found malignant oral mass and gingival hyperplasia was the most commonly found benign mass. The results showed that MRI provided more accurate information regarding the size of the masses and invasion of adjacent structures although MRI and CT show similar accuracy in assessment of bone invasion. Calcification and cortical bone erosion was better seen on CT images. Whereas contrast-MRI provided useful additional information, contrast-CT had no added benefit. In general, oral masses located in the caudal mandible, oropharynx and maxilla are better evaluated using MRI, once the histological type has been verified.","607":"This study was carried out to estimate the heritability of liability to epistaxis in the southern African Thoroughbred population. Data of all horses that suffered epistaxis while racing in southern Africa and Mauritius from 1986 to 2002 and involving 1252 bleeders were analysed. Pedigree data covering the period 1960-1986 was used as required to calculate the incidence of bleeding amongst ancestors of the post-1986 era. Only pedigrees of horses that raced were included in this study as it was not possible to predict whether non-runners would have bled had they raced. Consequently all non-runners and also those that raced overseas in countries where bleeding occurrence was not recorded, were excluded. The heritability of liability method as described by Falconer (1989) was used to estimate the relative importance of heredity and environment. For the period investigated, the population incidence for epistaxis in southern African horses was 2.1%. The estimation of heritability of liability showed that 1st-degree relatives had a figure of 55.4%. Second-degree relatives had a heritability of 41.3% and 3rd-degree relatives came in at 30.4%. The heritability of liability shown in this study could be regarded as being at the lower end of the range but could be appreciably higher. The data depict horses that bled almost exclusively on race days, as only a small percentage (approximately 5%) was reported as having bled during exercise. Accordingly, the full extent of epistaxis amongst racing Thoroughbreds in southern Africa is difficult to gauge. It is clear that epistaxis in the racing Thoroughbred has a strong genetic basis. It is suggested that horses showing frankbleeding from the nostrils after racing or exercise be suspended, and not used for breeding purposes. This should result in relatively fast progress being made towards eradicating this costly scourge of the modern Thoroughbred racehorse.","608":"Both Sir Arnold Theiler, appointed as Dean in 1920 when the Onderstepoort Veterinary Faculty was established, and Dr P J du Toit, who succeeded him in 1927, appear in the compound photograph of the class of 1926, constituting the 3rd group of graduates. The probable reason for having 2 deans on the photograph, which was obviously composed from shots taken individually of the outgoing and incoming deans of the faculty as well as of each of the 7 graduates, is initially analysed in this paper. This is followed by short descriptions of the life histories of the graduates. The class of 1926 was probably unique in that 2 of its members, who were employees of the Onderstepoort Research Institute, were granted special permission to study veterinary science at the Faculty. After graduating, most of the class members spent the greater part of their careers as civil servants at Onderstepoort as researchers and part-time teachers in the Faculty, as was customary for many years, or as state veterinarians in the field. Private practice did not feature strongly with them. Noteworthy is that the class produced 3 outstanding scientists, i.e. a world class parasitologist, a very eminent pathologist and Onderstepoort's 1st poultry specialist.","609":"","610":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a diverse group of inherited structural and functional abnormalities of the respiratory and other cilia, which results in recurrent respiratory tract infections. Primary ciliary dyskinesia was diagnosed in a 14-week old Staffordshire bull terrier that had a history of respiratory disease from 7 weeks of age. Pneumonia was diagnosed on thoracic radiographs and transtracheal aspirate. Transmission electron microscopy of the bronchi and trachea indicated the presence of both primary and secondary ciliary dyskinesia. The most prominent primary defects consisted of absent inner dyneim arms, absent radial spokes and absence of the central microtubules. These defects accounted for 62% of the total number of cross-sections screened. Non-specific ciliary abnormalities encountered most often were compound cilia, swollen cilia, addition\/deletion of peripheral doublets and disorganised axonemes (26%). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of PCD described in the Staffordshire bull terrier and the first report of PCD in South Africa.","611":"Fifteen of 100 mastitic milk samples from goats suffering from mastitis were tentatively identified as members of the genus Nocardia on the basis of selected phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Six of the 155 strains were confirmed as Nocardia farcinica by 16S rDNA gene sequencing and subsequent aligning with relevant actinomycetes found in electronic databases and 2 by other identification criteria. N. farcinica is a serious cause of mastitis with a significant prevalence (15%) among the examined goats. Efforts are needed to optimise and simplify isolation and identification methods.","612":"Efficacy of an inactivated quadrivalent vaccine containing infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus, parainfluenza type 3 (PI3) virus, bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was assessed in naive bovine calves to evaluate short-term (4-18 weeks) and long-term (24-38 weeks) protection following the basic intramuscular vaccination regime of 2 inoculations a month apart. Vaccination was staggered between the long-term and the short-term groups by about 5 months so that both groups, along with a matched group of 6 unvaccinated (control) calves, could be challenged at the same time. Sequential challenges at intervals of 3-8 weeks were done in the order: IBR virus (intranasally, IN), PI3 virus (IN and intratracheally, IT), pestiviruses (IN) and BRSV (IN and IT). The IBR virus challenge produced febrile rhinotracheitis (FRT) in control calves but both the severity and the duration of FRT was significantly reduced in both vaccinated groups. The amount and the duration of IBR virus shed by the vaccinated groups was significantly reduced compared to the control group. Although PI3 virus, pooled pestivirus and BRSV challenges did not result in a noteworthy disease, challenge virus shedding (amount and duration) from the upper (all 3 viruses) and the lower (BRSV) respiratory tracts was significantly reduced in vaccinated groups. After pestivirus challenge, sera and leukocytes from all control calves were infectious for 6-9 days whereas virus was recovered only from leukocytes in vaccinated calves and only for 1.6-2.7 days. Thus a standard course of the quadrivalent vaccine afforded a significant protection against IBR virus, PI3 virus, BVDV and BRSV for at least 6 months.","613":"The current level of anthelmintic resistance in the horse-breeding industry is extremely high and therefore more emphasis is being placed on studies that focus on the judicious use of anthelmintic products. The aims of the study were to: 1) establish if there is variation in the egg excretion pattern of strongyles between the different age classes of Thoroughbred horses in the Western Cape Province (WCP), 2) test if a selective treatment approach successfully reduces the number of anthelmintic treatments and maintains acceptably low helminth burdens in adult Thoroughbred horses, and 3) evaluate the efficacy of subsampling large horse herds for faecal egg counts (FECs) to monitor the strongyle burden. In 2001 the FECs of 4 adult mare, 5 yearling and 3 weanling herds from 8 different farms were compared in the WCP Within the mare herds there were generally fewer egg-excreting individuals with lower mean FECs compared with the younger age classes. Individual faecal samples were collected every 3-4 weeks from 52 adult Thoroughbred mares from 1 farm in the WCP during a 12-month period (2002\/2003). Animals with strongyle FECs &gt; or =100 eggs per gram (epg ) were treated with an ivermectin-praziquantel combination drug (Equimax oral paste, Virbac). The mean monthly strongyle FEC for the entire group was &lt;300 epg throughout the study and the number of treatments was reduced by 50 %. Resampling methods showed that an asymptote to mean FEC was reached at 55 animals for each of the pooled weanling, yearling and mare egg counts. Resampling within 4 different mare herds recorded asymptotes of between 24 and 28 animals. Subsampling entire herds for FECs therefore provided an effective approach to treatment management. This study demonstrates that selective treatment is both a practical and an effective approach to the management of anthelmintic resistance.","614":"Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is a recently identified bacterial pathogen of poultry, linked to the respiratory disease complex of broilers and the economic losses associated with that disease complex. Present control measures applied for the disease include the continuous use of in-feed antibiotics. A recently developed bacterin vaccine that is applied to broiler-breeder hens to pass on protective immunity to their broiler progeny was tested under large-scale commercial conditions in South Africa. An indirect ELISA test for antibodies to ORT, optimised for use in South Africa, was used to determine antibody levels in breeders and broilers. ELISA test results showed that the vaccine stimulated the development of high antibody titre levels in broiler breeders. The efficacy of the vaccine in protecting the progeny of these birds from ORT challenge could not be determined during the trial, although the progeny of vaccinated hens appeared to perform slightly better under commercial conditions than the progeny of unvaccinated hens.","615":"Serum urea and creatinine are extensively used as parameters to screen for azotaemia. Their reciprocal plots roughly correlate with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). They are, however, subject to influence by non-renal factors and to increase their specificity they are often tested concurrently. In renal disease they are expected to behave similarly, with both parameters increasing as GFR decreases. Haemolysis, as it occurs in canine babesiosis, may cause non-renal elevations in serum urea, possibly due to ammonia loading. Furthermore, haemolysis with its related elevations in serum bilirubin and serum haemoglobin, may negatively bias the measurement of serum creatinine due to interference of these substances with the chemical analysis of serum creatinine. This negative bias occurs when the alkaline picrate method, or when direct enzymatic methods based on the measurement of hydrogen peroxide, are used. In order to investigate the significance of these perturbations in canine babesiosis, paired values of serum urea and serum creatinine from Babesia canis-negative, non-haemolysis dogs (Group 1), were used to establish a relationship between urea and creatinine over a range of azotaemia by linear regression analysis. This relationship was then used to predict serum creatinine values from actual serum urea values in B. canis-positive dogs (Group 2). The mean of the predicted serum creatinine values for Group 2 (237.03 micromol\/l) was then compared with the mean of the actual serum creatinine values for Group 2 (131.31 micromol\/l). For Group 2, the mean actual serum creatinine demonstrated a significant negative bias relative to the mean predicted creatinine value. There was also a higher correlation between serum urea and serum creatinine in Group 1 than in Group 2. These findings may have been caused by either nonrenal elevations of serum urea values or by interference with the measurement of serum creatinine. Therefore, although it is possible that some Group 2 dogs with B. canis with high serum urea and normal, low, or zero values for serum creatinine were not azotaemic, it is also possible that other Group 2 dogs with these biochemical findings did in fact have azotaemia. This study concluded that urea and creatinine do not behave in a similar and predictable manner over a range of azotaemia in canine babesiosis and are therefore not ideally suited for the detection of renal disease in this clinical setting.","616":"The prevalences of antibodies against Bartonella henselae and Ehrlichia canis were determined in sera from 228 dogs in 5 communal lands of Zimbabwe, areas where traditional subsistence agro-pastoralism is practised. The sera were collected from apparently healthy dogs during routine rabies vaccination programmes and tested with indirect fluorescent antibody assays using B. henselae (Houston-I) and E. canis (Oklahoma) as antigens. We found reactive antibodies (&gt; or =1:80) against B. henselae in 14% of the dogs tested. Seropositive animals were found in Bikita (41%; 17\/42), Omay (13%; 6\/48), Chinamora (5%; 2\/38) and Matusadona (15%; 7\/48). No seropositive dogs were found in Chiredzi (0%; 0\/52). Antibodies reactive with E. canis (&gt; or =1:80) were found in 34% of the dogs tested, from Bikita (88%; 37\/42), Chiredzi (31%; 16\/52), Omay (17%; 8\/48), Chinamora (26%; 10\/38) and Matusadona (15%; 7\/48). Our survey shows dogs in the communal lands of Zimbabwe are frequently exposed to E. canis and B. henselae or closely related species. Further studies are indicated to determine the pathogenicity of the organisms infecting these dogs and their clinical significance.","617":"The monitoring of anaesthetic depth is usually based on the subjective assessment of the patient. An objective assessment of anaesthesia has only recently become possible. The auditory-evoked response has predictable changes in response to increasing doses of anaesthetic agents. Recent advances have brought about a regression model with exogenous input of the auditory-evoked response, the A-line ARX-Index (AAI Index). The AAI Index is a dimensionless number between 0 and 100. This technology has been incorporated into the AEP (auditory-evoked potential) monitor that is utilised to assess anaesthetic depth in humans. This study was undertaken to determine if the AEP monitor was useful in dogs. Ten dogs were enrolled in the study. After a full clinical and otoscopic examination, dogs were premedicated with acetylpromazine and morphine. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with halothane. End-tidal carbon dioxide, temperature, pulse oximetry, blood pressure and the electrocardiogram were monitored and recorded every 5 minutes. Anaesthetic depth was assessed as either being adequate or inadequate by the anaesthetist during surgery. An AEP monitor was attached to the patient and automatically collected AAI Index data. The anaesthetist was blinded to the AEP monitor. Following the completion of the surgical procedure, the patient was allowed to wake up with the AEP monitor attached. The AAI Index was analysed to compare adequate with inadequate anaesthesia during the period of surgery and awake with sleep data during recovery. All AAI Index values associated with inadequate anaesthesia were greater than 31 while adequate values were less than 35. The difference between the groups was statistically significant and the power was 0.97. Statistically, the awake and sleep values were significantly different with a power of 0.99. From this study it can be concluded that the AAI Index shows good prospect for the evaluation of anaesthetic depth in dogs undergoing surgery. A larger study is needed to confirm these results.","618":"A young cat with signs of chronic rhinitis was evaluated for underlying anatomical, inflammatory, or infectious disease. Initial diagnostics were significant for the isolation of an unusual pathogen, Haemophilus species. Isolation using a human RapID NH system erroneously identified the isolate as H. segnis, a human pathogen. No database of veterinary pathogens (Haemophilus) are included in the system and animal pathogens will either be erroneously identified or yield a unique biocode not listed. Because of the unique nature of the pathogen we explored the possibility of immunosuppression as a contributory factor to infection. A variety of laboratory tests were employed to evaluate immune function. The clinical indications and utility of immune function testing are discussed. No immune dysfunction was identified.","619":"A 4-year-old Thoroughbred gelding racehorse was referred to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital (OVAH) with a history of post-race distress and collapse. In the absence of any obvious abnormalities in the preceding diagnostic work-up, a standard exercise test was performed to determine an underlying cause for the post-race distress reported. In this particular case oxygen desaturation became evident at speeds as slow as 6 m\/s, where PO2 was measured at 82.3 mm Hg. Similarly at a blood pH of 7.28, PCO2 had dropped to 30.0 mm Hg indicating a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. The cause of the distress was attributed to a severe hypoxia, with an associated hypocapnoea, confirmed on blood gas analyses, where PO2 levels obtained were as low as 56.6 mm Hg with a mean PCO2 level of 25.4 mm Hg during strenuous exercise. Arterial oxygenation returned to normal immediately after cessation of exercise to 106.44 mm Hg, while the hypocapnoeic alkalosis, PCO2 25.67 mm Hg, persisted until the animal's breathing normalized. The results obtained were indicative of a dynamic cardiac insufficiency present during exercise. The combination of an aortic stenosis and a mitral valve insufficiency may have resulted in a condition similar to that described as high-altitude pulmonary oedema, with respiratory changes and compensation as for acute altitude disease. The results obtained were indicative of a dynamic cardiac insufficiency present during exercise and substantiate the fact that an extensive diagnostic regime may be required to establish a cause for poor performance and that the standard exercise test remains an integral part of this work-up.","620":"Haemobartonella felis has been reclassified within the genus Mycoplasma as Mycoplasma haemofelis and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', collectively referred to as the feline haemoplasmas. A total of 78 cats from the Johannesburg area that had blood samples submitted to a private veterinary laboratory were tested using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay able to detect and distinguish the two feline haemoplasma (basonym Haemobartonella) species. All samples had been diagnosed with haemoplasma infection by cytological examination of blood smears. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between haemoplasma status, age, and haematological and biochemical parameters. On PCR assay 43 cats (55%) were haemoplasma negative, 25 (32.1%) positive for 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', 5 (6.4%) positive for Mycoplasma haemofelis and 5 (6.4%) positive for both species. Significant inverse correlation was found between the amount of M. haemofelis DNA present in the blood and the haematocrit value. Cats that were positive for M. haemofelis showed macrocytic regenerative anaemia, monocytosis and thrombocytopaenia. This report documents the existence of both haemoplasma species in cats in South Africa.","621":"Studies covering all aspects of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) have been conducted in several countries in Europe, Asia and America. In southern Africa, more information is required about the nature of BVDV infection, the prevalence of different strains and the economic importance of the disease. The presence of BVDV in southern Africa has been known since the early 1970s through serological surveys but few reports confirming its presence by virus isolation and correlation with clinical disease are available. Specimens (n = 312) collected in 1998\/99, from live and dead cattle from different farming systems, were obtained from private practitioners, feedlot consultants and abattoirs throughout the country. Specimens (n = 37) from African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park were also included. All specimens were processed for virus isolation in cell culture with confirmation by means of immunofluorescent antibody tests and some also by means of an antigen capture ELISA. BVDV was isolated from 15 (4.7%) cattle and were all noncytopathic biotypes. BVDV was not detected in 37 lymph nodes obtained from buffaloes in the Kruger National Park. Of the clinical signs in cattle from which virus were isolated, respiratory signs was the most frequent (10\/15), followed by diarrhoea (5\/15). Abortion, congenital malformations, haemorrhagic diarrhoea and poor growth were also included as criteria for selection of animals for specimen collection, but no BVD viruses were isolated from cattle manifesting these clinical signs.","622":"This article describes the anaesthetic management and use of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for neurosurgery in 4 dogs. Propofol in conjunction with morphine was used for the maintenance of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with either thiopentone or propofol. The program Stelpump (a target-controlled infusion program) was run on a laptop and connected to a syringe driver via an RS 232 cable. The program was found to be reliable and safe for the administration of TIVA in dogs. Invasive monitoring was required in order to monitor cardiovascular changes during surgery. Ventilation was controlled to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide below 40 mm Hg. The anaesthesia was characterised by haemodynamic stability. The haemodynamic stability was probably the result of the choice of TIVA and balanced anaesthesia. Intracranial pressure and oedema was controlled with dexamethasone, mannitol and ventilatory management either in combination or alone. Three dogs survived to hospital discharge and 1 dog was euthanased 2 weeks later due to tumour metastasis. The development and characterisation of the anaesthetic effects of TIVA needs to be elucidated in order to provide clinicians with rational guidelines for the appropriate use of TIVA in veterinary medicine.","623":"White rhinoceros anaesthetised with etorphine and azaperone combination develop adverse physiological changes including hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, tachycardia and hypertension. These changes are more marked in field-anaesthetised rhinoceros. This study was designed to develop a technique to improve safety for field-anaesthetised white rhinoceros by tracheal intubation and oxygen insufflation. Twenty-five free-ranging white rhinoceros were anaesthetised with an etorphine and azaperone combination for translocation or placing microchips in their horns. Once anaesthetised the rhinoceros were monitored prior to crating for transportation or during microchip placement. Physiological measurements included heart and respiratory rate, blood pressure and arterial blood gas samples. Eighteen rhinoceros were intubated using an equine nasogastric tube passed nasally into the trachea and monitored before and after tracheal insufflation with oxygen. Seven rhinoceros were not intubated or insufflated with oxygen and served as controls. All anaesthetised rhinoceros were initially hypoxaemic (percentage arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation (%O2Sa) = 49% +\/- 16 (mean +\/- SD) and PaO2 = 4.666 +\/- 1.200 kPa (35 +\/- 9 mm Hg)), hypercapnic (PaCO2 = 8.265 +\/- 1.600 kPa (62 +\/- 12 mm Hg)) and acidaemic (pHa = 7.171 +\/- 0.073 ). Base excess was -6.7 +\/- 3.9 mmol\/l, indicating a mild to moderate metabolic acidosis. The rhinoceros were also hypertensive (systolic blood pressure = 21.861 +\/- 5.465 kPa (164 +\/- 41 mm Hg)) and tachycardic (HR = 107 +\/- 31\/min). Following nasal tracheal intubation and insufflation, the %O2Sa and PaO2 increased while blood pHa and PaCO2 remained unchanged. Tracheal intubation via the nose is not difficult, and when oxygen is insufflated, the PaO2 and the %O2Sa increases, markedly improving the safety of anaesthesia, but this technique does not correct the hypercapnoea or acidosis. After regaining their feet following reversal of the anaesthesia, the animals' blood gas values return towards normality.","624":"Endoparasites of fish-eating birds, Phalacrocorax africanus, P. carbo, Anhinga melanogaster and Ardea cinerea collected from Lake Chivero near Harare, Zimbabwe, were investigated. Adult Contracaecum spp. were found in the gastrointestinal tract (prevalence 100 % in P. africanus, P. carbo and A. melanogaster; 25 % in A. cinerea). Parasite intensity was 11-24 (mean 19) in P. africanus, 4-10 (mean 7) in P. carbo, 4-56 (mean 30) in A. melanogaster and 2 (mean 0.5) in A. cinerea. The cormorants fed mainly on cichlid fishes and carp; the darters and the grey herons on cichlids. All these fishes are intermediate hosts of Contracaecum spp. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that Contracaecum rudolphii infected both cormorant species and darters; C. carlislei infected only the cormorants while C. tricuspis and C. microcephalum infected only the darters. Parasites from the grey heron were not identified to species because they were still developing larvae. These parasites are recorded in Zimbabwe for the first time.","625":"A study was carried out on 456 indigenous poultry intestinal specimens from various towns in Kenya to determine the occurrence and distribution of helminth parasites in the intestinal tract of the birds. Of the specimens examined, 414 had parasites whereas the remaining 42 had none, which is an infection rate of 90.78%. The main species of helminths found in the intestines were Raillietina sp. (47.53%), Heterakis gallinarum (21.33%), Ascaridia galli (10.03%), Strongyloides avium (9.96%), Choanotaenia infundibulum (4.61%), Cotugnia digonopora (3.6%), Capillaria sp. (1.5%), Trichostrongylus tenius (1.04%) and Syngamus trachea (0.40%). Most helminths were present in both the mid- and hindguts. Syngamus trachea and C. digonopora were only found in the foregut and midgut, respectively. Although chickens from which the specimens were collected appeard healthy, the high prevalence of helminthiasis observed shows the poor level of helminth infection control practiced by the indigenous poultry keepers in the country, which might affect the health status of the birds and their growth rates. Poultry keepers should be encouraged to prevent, control and treat such cases.","626":"Rickettsial organisms resembling Ehrlichia ruminantium (the causative organism of heartwater) were demonstrated in brain smears and formalin-fixed brain sections derived from a buffalo calf that died on a private game reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The possibility that the tick-free environment of a quarantine boma may have affected the calf's immunity, is discussed. These findings suggest that monitoring heartwater in wild ruminants and making brain smears as a routine during post mortem evaluations of wild ruminants, should be encouraged.","627":"A captive-bred white lion cub was presented with hindquarter pain, lameness and reluctance to move. Radiographs revealed generalised osteoapenia, multiple fractures, a severely collapsed pelvic girdle, bilateral lateral bowing of the scapulae and mild kyphosis of the caudal vertebrae. A double cortical line, a distinct sign of osteopaenia, was repeatedly seen on the pelvic limbs, most strikingly along both femurs. Based on radiographic findings and a history of an exclusive meat diet since weaning, a diagnosis of nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism was made. The diet was changed to a commercial kitten food and the cub was given cage rest for 6 weeks. Signs of pain abated and the cub became more active. A guarded prognosis was given for full recovery, as changes to the pelvis were considered potentially irreversible.","628":"The 1st outbreak of fescue toxicosis in South Africa was recently confirmed in a Brahman herd at Perdekop, near Standerton, in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Within 3 weeks of being placed on a fescue pasture in mid-winter, 50 of 385 cattle developed lameness and\/or necrosis of the tail. The farmer had established Festuca elatior L. (tall fescue, Iewag variety) on c. 140 ha for winter grazing. Fescue may be infected by an endophyte, Neotyphodium coenophialum, which produces ergot alkaloids, in particular ergovaline. Ergovaline concentrations in basal leaf sheaths and grass stems collected during the outbreak ranged from 1720-8170 ppb on a dry-matter basis.","629":"The use of a midazolam\/ketamine combination for induction of anaesthesia in a 2-month-old, hand-raised buffalo calf (Syncerus caffer) is described to allow endotracheal intubation for the maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane and oxygen. Intraoperative complications were hypotension and hypothermia. For postoperative analgesia meloxicam and butorphanol was administered intramuscularly.","630":"Laboratory animals exposed to feeding ticks develop resistance which is reflected by a decline in tick engorgement weight, egg-laying by adults and reduced egg viability. Serum antibodies from these hosts and their reaction with tick antigens have been detected by different methods, including precipitation techniques, immunofluorescent techniques, ELISA and Western blots. However, little is known about the effects of antibodies on ticks that engorge on resistant hosts, or which tissues of the tick body are possibly immunogenic. Some researchers, using immunohistochemistry, have detected host antibodies in the gut, salivary glands and haemolymph of ticks engorged on resistant animals. The same technique has helped considerably in determining antigenic sites or antibody targets in other arthropods. Consequently, immunohistochemistry techniques were used in this study to detect cross-reactivity between sera raised against Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) with Amblyomma hebraeum (Koch, 1844), and vice versa. The results show the existence of shared antigens between the 2 tick species. In general, our results point more to a 1-way cross-reactivity of A. hebraeum with A. cajennense than a reciprocal cross-reactivity, suggesting that A. hebraeum is more immunogenic than A. cajennense.","631":"The cutaneous hypersensitivity test was used to correlate host resistance to ticks and type of reactions elicited by Aomblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) tick extract in rabbits. Rabbits were divided into 3 groups of 2 animals each: naive, pre-infested and control. Cutaneous hypersensitivity was induced by intradermal inoculation of 25 microg extract in 0.03 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in rabbit ears. Control rabbits were inoculated with PBS only. The ear thickness was measured with a Mitutoyo device before and 10 min, 1, 2, 4, 18, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-inoculation (PI). Pre-infested rabbits showed an immediate type reaction within the 1st 10 min PI (60% increase in ear thickness) and a delayed reaction (18 h) (85% increase), whereas the naive rabbits showed only the immediate reaction within the 1st 4 h (60% increase). PBS induced only mild reactions. These results point out the crucial role of the cellular immune response of rabbits in the expression of resistance to A. cajennense.","632":"The communal grazing system is generally understood to have a low input, low output type of management. However, the actual inputs and outputs of the farmers are not well known and the farmers are often unaware of their problems. Although the causes of low calving percentage are well understood in commercial beef farming enterprises in South Africa, the same is not true for communal farming systems. The aim of this study was to determine the reproductive performance of beef cattle on a communal farming system in Jericho, North West Province. Ten farmers from five villages with a total of 265 cows and 13 bulls were purposively selected. The selection criteria were that each farmer had to have a minimum of 10 breeding cows and a bull and be willing to participate in the study. This was followed by a 12-month longitudinal study with monthly herd visits where cows were examined rectally and bulls (n = 13) were subjected to a single breeding soundness evaluation. The calving percentage was found to be 37.7%. This is lower than the recorded percentages for commercial beef cattle on extensive grazing. The factors playing a role in low calving percentage were ranked using field data. From this it appeared that failure of cows to become pregnant was the main cause of poor calving percentage as opposed of loss of calves through abortion or resorption. Sub-fertility of the bulls was found to be of great significance and it is proposed that this be included in extension messages and that bulls be fertility tested routinely. Poor body condition score of cows, mainly caused by poor management, was also considered to play a major role in reducing pregnancy rates. Infectious diseases like trichomonosis, campylobacteriosis and brucellosis played a much leser role than anticipated.","633":"The changing role of veterinarians in the global market is a current topic of debate and discussion. Few countries including South Africa have formally examined the changing dynamics of this profession. Therefore, the present study addressed 2 objectives. The 1st was to examine basic information about veterinarians in South Africa including their age, gender and distribution across provinces, the percentage whose practice was urban, rural or periurban, the numbers working with specific animal species, and the extent of business management and skills previously gained. The 2nd objective was to obtain opinions and insights from veterinarians in South Africa about the challenges and opportunities facing their business practices to better understand what they considered important dynamics to their businesses today. Several areas of business on which they were questioned and which were included in this study were: marketing, vision, human resources, leadership, financial management, ethics, competition, day-to-day operations, interpersonal skills and information management. This is the 1st known survey to employ a questionnaire to gain insights and opinions from veterinarians about business management skills.","634":"The economic impact of different extension messages used was calculated using enterprise budgeting (gross margin analysis). Input data were gleaned from the literature, from participatory appraisals, as well as a field study, spanning 12 months, of small-scale communal goat farming systems in Jericho in the Odi District of North West Province. The number of offspring weaned per annum, as a proportion of does owned, was selected as the desired output for analysis. This study has shown that small-scale communal goat farmers are not adopting or implementing extension messages to improve production capacity. In South Africa the majority of goats are slaughtered in the informal sector. If the informal sector is to be persuaded to market goats commercially through formal channels, then knowledge of the economics of goat farming on communal lands should be provided. The economic aspects of extension messages are probably an important factor in determining acceptance and sustainability yet appear to be seldom investigated. The probable reason for lack of adoption of standard extension messages, which promote improved nutrition, parasite control, vaccination and treatment of goats, was economic. In other words, the so-called 'poor management practices' used by communal farmers appeared to be economically more profitable than the 'good management practices' suggested to increase production. The price of communal goats was not related to their mass. A higher level of inputs would probably have resulted in a heavier kid, however it was established that this would not have influenced the price received as a majority of the goats were slaughtered for ritual purposes where age, colour and sex were more important to the purchaser than body mass. It is standard practice in commercial farming systems to evaluate the economic benefits of all management practices before they are implemented. Production animal veterinarians use veterinary economics to compare different scenarios to control diseases or select management practices in commercial herds. It is suggested that the inputs and outputs of small-scale farming systems should be carefully analysed and that veterinary economics should also be used to evaluate the probable impact of extension messages formulated by veterinarians and animal health technicians.","635":"A combination of medetomidine hydrochloride (medetomidine) and ketamine hydrochloride (ketamine) was evaluated in 16 boma-confined and 19 free-ranging impalas (Aepyceros melampus) to develop a non-opiate immobilisation protocol. In free-ranging impala a dose of 220 +\/- 34 microg\/kg medetomidine and 4.4 +\/- 0.7 mg\/kg ketamine combined with 7500 IU of hyaluronidase induced recumbency within 4.5 +\/- 1.5 min, with good muscle relaxation, a stable heart rate and blood pH. PaCO2 was maintained within acceptable ranges. The animals were hypoxic with reduced oxygen saturation and low PaO2 in the presence of an elevated respiration rate, therefore methods for respiratory support are indicated. The depth of sedation was adequate for minor manipulations but additional anaesthesia is indicated for painful manipulations. Immobilisation was reversed by 467 +\/- 108 microg\/kg atipamezole hydrochloride (atipamezole) intramuscularly, but re-sedation was observed several hours later, possibly due to a low atipamezole:medetomidine ratio of 2:1. Therefore, this immobilisation and reversal protocol would subject impalas to possible predation or conspecific aggression following reversal if they were released into the wild. If the protocol is used on free-ranging impala, an atipamezole:medetomidine ratio of 5:1 should probably be used to prevent re-sedation.","636":"Cases of snakebite envenomation are frequently presented to veterinary practitioners in southern Africa. Despite this, no published guidelines exist on how this medical emergency should be managed. Southern African snake venoms can be classified into 3 main types based on the main mechanism of venom action and clinical presentation. A polyvalent antivenom is manufactured in South Africa and contains antibodies against the most important southern African snake venoms. The cytotoxic venoms are represented mainly by the puff-adder (Bitis arietans), Mozambique spitting cobra (Naja mossabica), black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis) (in the Western Cape and Namibia) and the stiletto snake (Atractaspis bibronii). These venoms may cause dramatic local swelling, high morbidity and low mortality and infrequently require the use of antivenom for survival (the only cytotoxic venoms used to prepare the antivenom are the puff-adder and Mozambique spitting cobra). The neurotoxic venoms (represented chiefly by the non-spitting cobras and mambas) cause high mortality due to rapid onset of paresis and require antivenom and mechanical ventilatory support which is life-saving. The boomslang (Dispholidus typus) and the vine snake (coagulopathic venom) rarely bite humans but dogs may be bitten more frequently. These venoms cause a consumption coagulopathy and successful treatment of boomslang bites requires the use of snake species-specific monovalent antivenom. There is no antivenom available for treating vine snake (Thelotornis capensis), berg adder (Bitis atropos), night adder (Causus spp.), stiletto snake and other lesser adder bites. There are some important differences between the way snakebites are managed in humans and dogs.","637":"Veterinary education in South Africa started in 1920 when the Onderstepoort Veterinary Faculty was created. Sir Arnold Theiler was close to retirement when he finally officiated as Dean at the graduation ceremony in 1926 for the class of 1925, constituting the 2nd group of graduates. In this article the fateful circumstances that dictated the final years of Theiler's brilliant career and their effect on his participation in student matters are initially dealt with. This is followed by concise descriptions of the life histories of the ten veterinarians who graduated from the Faculty in 1925. Particularly noteworthy is that although they all started off their careers as civil servants, 4 ended up in private practice. One of them in fact spent by far the greatest part of his career, namely 35 years, as a private practitioner. An unusual incident was the almost fatal shooting of another one, while he was executing his duties as a veterinary field officer, by the son of a farmer.","638":"Veterinary education in South Africa is now more than 80 years old. It started in 1920 when the Onderstepoort Veterinary Faculty was created as an integral part of the Veterinary Research Institute at Onderstepoort. Sir Arnold Theiler, the founder of Onderstepoort, was its first Dean. This article concerns itself with some of the known and lesser known developments and actions associated with the creation of the faculty and how it was possible to provide suitable lecturing staff. This is followed by concise descriptions of the life histories of the first 8 veterinarians who graduated from the new faculty in 1924 and subsequently spent their entire working life in government service.","639":"The Veterinary Pharmacovigilance and Medicines Information Centre is responsible for the monitoring of veterinary adverse drug reactions in South Africa. An overview of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions received by the centre during the period March 2002 to February 2003 is given. In total, 40 reports were received. This had declined from the previous year. Most reports involved suspected adverse reactions that occurred in dogs and cats. Most of the products implicated were Stock Remedies. The animal owner predominantly administered these products. Only 1 report was received from a veterinary pharmaceutical company. Increasing numbers of reports are being received from veterinarians.","640":"The first recorded isolates of Pasteurella testudinis from South African tortoises kept in captivity is presented. P. testudinis was found in association with respiratory disease in affected animals.","641":"Mathematics at matriculation level (Grade 12) is one of the subjects required for admission to the Veterinary Nursing Diploma in the Faculty at Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria. The present study shows that there is no statistically significant relationship between the grade of mathematics at matriculation level and the success or failure in the 1st year of study. There is, however, a statistical difference in the adjusted mark obtained for mathematics at matriculation level between the groups that passed and failed the 1st year of the veterinary nursing course. The results of this research are not consistent with other research which showed that secondary school mathematics results are not a significant factor in tertiary education. It is recommended that selection criteria for veterinary nurses should in future still include mathematics, but that cognisance should be taken of the mark obtained and students with higher marks (above 57%) given preference.","642":"This study investigated if environmental factors had an effect on the incidence of epistaxis related to exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) among racehorses in southern Africa. Data covering the period 1986-2001 and involving 778 532 race runs were analysed. This included the following information: date of race, age, sex, name of breeder, trainer, distance, jockey, state of going, weight carried, racing centre and altitude. Veterinarians employed by the Jockey Club suspended officially entered horses that presented with epistaxis (frank bleeding from the nostrils) after racing. On-course endoscopy is not performed as a standard practice at any southern African racetrack. Epistaxis was identified in 1287 horses (0.165%). More horses presented with EIPH-related epistaxis (a) at sea level, (b) from May to October, (c) when older (&gt; 3 years), (d) after 1995, (e) on Fridays and Sundays, and (f) more in geldings than in mares or entire males. No association could be established between epistaxis and breeder, trainer, distance run, jockey, state of going and weight carried. It is concluded that the frequency of EIPH-related epistaxis is associated with altitude, winter and spring, sex and age. It is suggested that racing at lower altitudes may increase the probability of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage.","643":"The efficacy of 2 sets of collars (Kiltix Collar, Bayer AG), containing different plasticisers and impregnated with the acaricides flumethrin (2.25%) and propoxur (10%), was compared against adult Rhipicephalus sanguineus on experimentally infested, kennelled dogs. Thirty individually penned dogs were infested with 25 male and 25 female, unfed R. sanguineus. On the following day they were allocated to 3 groups of 10 dogs each on the magnitude of their tick burdens. Two days after infestation, medicated collars containing 1 of the plasticisers were fitted to 10 of the dogs and similar collars containing the other plasticiser were fitted to 10 others. The remaining 10 dogs were the untreated controls. Seven and 28 days after having fitted the collars, all dogs were re-infested with 50 unfed adult ticks of both sexes, and again at approximately 28-day intervals up to the 5th month, and then at approximately 14-day intervals during the 6th month. Efficacy was determined by comparing the mean number of live, attached ticks on the untreated control group with those on the collared dogs 2 days after each re-infestation. Immediate efficacy of the collars (Day +2) was &gt; 95%, and residual efficacy was &gt; 98% up to and including Day +114, and &gt; 93% up to Day +170 on both groups of collared dogs. The mean tick counts on the 2 groups of collared dogs did not differ significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) for any of the assessment days.","644":"This paper focuses on the geographical distribution and habitats of Lymnaea truncatula, the intermediate, snail host of the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, as reflected by the 723 samples in the database of the National Freshwater Snail Collection, Potchefstroom, South Africa. The 221 different loci (1\/16-degree squares) on record reflect an extensive but discontinuous distribution, except in Lesotho and in parts of the Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West provinces of South Africa. Although recorded from 12 different types of waterbody, it was mostly (42.0%) recovered from swamps. Most samples (45.8%) were collected in habitats with slow-flowing water. A muddy substratum was recorded for 62.5% of the samples. Most samples (86.3%) were collected in habitats with a mean annual air temperature of 10-20 degrees C, and more than 69% came from localities with a mean annual rainfall of 600-900 mm. An integrated decision tree constructed from the data indicated that temperature and types of waterbody play a decisive role in determining the presence of L. truncatula in a given area. A temperature index calculated for all mollusc species ranked L. truncatula second in a total of 53 species according to its association with low temperatures. It remains to be established whether its distribution is indeed discontinuous, and whether its preference for a particular habitat, amphibious habits and ability to aestivate could have resulted in some populations having been overlooked during surveys.","645":"Waste material from bakeries is an unconventional energy feed source which is available in sufficient quantities for use in small-scale broiler production in South Africa. Small-scale broiler producers do not have access to the computer programs required to balance home-mixed rations. This investigation confirms that the use of dried bakery products (DBP) in a 2-stage, free-choice method can be used to compensate for this lack. A total of 570 day-old male broiler chickens was assigned to 3 feeding treatments: the control group was fed a 2-stage feeding programme using standard commercial starter and grower rations. The 2nd group received a commercial starter ration up to Day 7 and was thereafter given a choice of a commercial starter ration with normal salt content (0.35%) and DBP. The 3rd group was fed a commercial starter ration up to Day 7, then offered a choice of commercial starter ration with a lower salt content (0.1%) and DBP. The low salt alternative was used to test whether the higher salt percentage in DBP influenced the choice of feed by the birds. It was found that the control group consumed significantly more feed (P &lt; 0.05) and was significantly heavier (P &lt; 0.05) than the experimental groups. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 experimental groups, which indicated that salt content did not play a role in the choice of ration. Feed consumption by both experimental groups was about one-third less than the control group, but the profit margin, as calculated using gross margin analysis, was approximately 15 % higher. It was therefore concluded that dried bakery products can be profitably incorporated as an energy feed source, using the free-choice feeding method, in small-scale broiler enterprises.","646":"The Boerboel is a South African large-breed dog resembling a Bullmastiff. The records of Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital were searched for dogs that had presented, between 1998 and 2003, with symptoms indicative of wobbler syndrome and had undergone survey radiographic and myelographic studies. Ten cases fitted the inclusion criteria. Dogs presented within the first 2 years of life, often with acute onset of symptoms. All presented with pelvic limb and 6 with concomitant thoracic limb ataxia or paresis. Treatment varied and included none (4), prednisolone (2), and dorsal laminectomy (2). Two dogs were euthanased at the time of diagnosis. The breed appears to be affected with a form of spondylomyelopathy that comprises bony malformation of cervical and\/or thoracic vertebrae. In 8 dogs, malformations were evident on survey radiographs and were characterised by enlarged, irregular articular facets and associated medial deviation of the pedicles. These changes resulted in axial compression of the spinal cord best seen on ventrodorsal or dorsoventral myelographic studies. Multiple vertebrae were affected in some dogs and lesions were not confined to the caudal area of the cervical spine. Three dogs were alive and without symptoms at follow-up. Four were euthanased as a result of the disease and 1 died as a result of post-operative complications. Two additional dogs presenting with wobbler clinical signs are also described. One had medial deviation of the T5 and T6 caudal pedicles and 1 dog suffered from multiple cervical articular facet synovial cysts.","647":"A 3-month-old, Labrador bitch presented with urinary incontinence. A unilateral, ectopic ureter was diagnosed with ultrasound without the aid of additional contrast radiographic techniques. Ipsilateral hydroureter and mild hydronephrosis were also present. At the level of the bladder trigone the ectopic ureter became intramural and this was clearly demonstrable with ultrasound. The opening of the ectopic ureter into the proximal urethra was, however, not visualised owing to its intrapelvic location.","648":"A survey was conducted on the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance of nematodes in communally grazed goats in a semi-arid area in South Africa. In herds belonging to 10 small-holder goat farmers, the efficacies of fenbendazole, levamisole and rafoxanide were tested by faecal egg count reduction (FECR) tests. Efficacies of 80% were considered a threshold for anthelmintic resistance. The FECR tests showed that all drugs tested more than 80% effective in most instances, but there were notable exceptions. In 1 case, rafoxanide was only 31% effective and in another case fenbendazole was only 47% effective. The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in this farming sector is of concern. Steps should be taken to prevent its further spread and to avoid the development of a situation as on numerous commercial sheep farms in South Africa where resistance is very common.","649":"Endoscopy was used to determine the prevalence of subclinical gastroduodenal ulceration in 30 Dachshunds undergoing decompressive surgery for acute intervertebral disc prolapse. The endoscopy was performed on the day of admission and on the 3rd or 4th day after surgery. Three regions of the stomach (cardia, corpus and pylorus) and the proximal duodenum were visually inspected and biopsy samples were taken for histopathology. The combination of visual and microscopic changes were then used to determine the prevalence of subclinical gastroduodenal ulceration in this population. An overall prevalence of 76% was calculated from these findings. Ulcerogenic medication administered prior to admission did not appear to influence the prevalence. This result identifies a need for veterinarians to be aware of this potentially severe complication and warrants the use of prophylactic anti-ulcer medication in spinal surgery patients.","650":"A survey of 88 veterinarians employed at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa, was carried out to investigate the occurrence of zoonotic diseases among South African veterinarians. The survey found that 63.6% of veterinarians interviewed had suffered from a zoonotic disease. Veterinarians predominantly involved in farm animal practice were 3 times more likely to have contracted a zoonotic disease than those working in other veterinary fields. Fifty-six percent of disease incidents were initially diagnosed by the veterinarians themselves. Fifty-three percent of incidents required treatment by a medical practitioner, but the majority (61%) of incidents did not require absence from work. The incidence density rate for contracting a zoonotic disease was 0.06 per person year of exposure. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated that the probability of having contracted a zoonotic disease was 50% after 11 years in practice. The risk of contracting a zoonotic disease appeared to be higher early in practice. The most common mode of transmission was by direct contact. Approximately 46% of South Africans still live in rural areas and regularly come into close contact with farm animals. The implications of this in the light of this survey's results are discussed.","651":"Diminazene aceturate is a commonly used antibabesial agent. It has been postulated that diminazine may induce a decrease in blood pressure and exacerbate the hypotension presented in dogs with babesiosis. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of diminazine aceturate on the blood pressure of healthy dogs. Six healthy German shepherd dogs between 18 and 24 months of age with a mean weight of 30.4 +\/- 2.75 kg were used. Blood pressure was directly measured at the following time intervals: -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after treatment with diminazine aceturate (4.2 mg\/kg) intramuscularly. No statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05) was found in blood pressure between any of the time intervals. An increase in heart rate was seen 5 minutes after the administration of diminazine aceturate but no change in blood pressure was evident. This study concluded that diminazene aceturate in its current formulation with antipyrine does not alter blood pressure in healthy adult dogs.","652":"Canine babesiosis is a common cause of thrombocytopaenia but there are few formal studies that have investigated this haematological finding in dogs. Thrombocyte counts from full blood counts were retrospectively analysed for the years 1996-2002. Thrombocyte counts and mean platelet volumes of dogs with babesiosis were compared with those of dogs, seen over the same period of time, that did not have babesiosis. There were 1162 cases in the Babesiosis group and 10 808 in the Non-babesiosis group. A frequency distribution of the thrombocyte counts showed a trimodal distribution in the Non-babesiosis group compared to a bimodal distribution in the Babesiosis group, with a strong positive skewness. The modes for the frequency distributions were 10, 40, 300 and 10, 35 x 10(9)\/l thrombocytes, respectively. The median thrombocyte count in the Babesiosis group was 14 x 10(9)\/l and 282 x 10(9)\/l in the Non-babesiosis group. There was a statistically significant difference in the median thrombocyte count between the Babesiosis group and the Non-babesiosis group. In the Babesiosis group, 99% of the thrombocyte counts were below the lower reference range value (250 x 10(9)\/l) and 62% of thrombocyte counts were below 25 x 10(9)\/l. The mean platelet volume (11.1 fl) for the Babesiosis group was greater than the reference range (6-10 fl) and significantly larger than in the Non-babesiosis group (median 9.7 fl). Thrombocyte counts greater than 110 and 250 x 10(9)\/l had a predictive value that the dog was not suffering from babesiosis of 99.3% and 99.8%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the thrombocyte counts of dogs with babesiosis when grouped by parasitaemia scores. The mechanisms of the thrombocytopaenia are not fully understood, and multiple mechanisms, including concomitant thrombocytopaenia-inducing diseases such as ehrlichiosis, probably result in this haematological finding. Babesiosis in the South African canine population is associated with thrombocytopaenia in nearly all patients and is severe in the majority of them. In the absence of thrombocytopaenia, babesiosis is an unlikely diagnosis.","653":"","654":"Data were obtained from a population consisting of 160 Merino ewes, as well as 64 male and 75 female progeny of these ewes at the 2-tooth age. The age and sex groups were maintained in separate flocks. The population has been divergently selected from the same base since 1986, either for (high or H line) or against (low or L line) maternal multiple rearing ability. All animals were inspected for sheep lice (Bovicola ovis) during September\/October 2002 after a wool growth period of at least 4 months. When expressed relative to mean L-line performance, the advantage in lambs weaned per ewe during the lambing season amounted to approximately 110% in the H line (1.01 vs 0.48; P &lt; 0.01). The proportion of animals on which 1 or more lice were observed were markedly lower in 2-tooth replacement ewes than in replacement rams and mature breeding ewes (0.053 vs 0.625 and 0.531, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). One or more lice were observed on a lower proportion of H-line ewes than on those of the L line (0.413 vs 0.571, respectively; P &lt; 0.10), while a similar tendency was observed in 2-tooth ewe hoggets (0.033 vs 0.143, respectively; P = 0.16). When the mean number of lice on individuals on which 1 or more lice were observed was compared between lines, the average number of lice observed on H-line young rams was lower than in the L line (4.36 +\/- 0.85 vs 9.71 +\/- 1.84 lice, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). A similar tendency was observed in mature breeding ewes (2.15 +\/- 0.38 vs 3.22 +\/- 0.42 lice, respectively; P &lt; 0.20). The more highly reproductive H-line ewes were not more susceptible to infestation with B. ovis than ewes of the L line. In fact, available evidence suggest that H-line animals could be more tolerant of B. ovis than those of the L line.","655":"Anthelmintic products form the basis of helminth control practices on horse stud farms at present. Regular evaluation of the efficacy of these products is advisable, as it will provide information on the worm egg reappearance period and the resistance status in the worm population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of doramectin, pyrantel pamoate, ivermectin and moxidectin on a Thoroughbred stud farm in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. The study also compared the anthelmintic efficacy of two moxidectin formulations administered at their recommended dosages (an injectable, at 0.2 mg\/kg, not registered for horses, and an oral gel at 0.4 mg\/kg, registered for horses). Two mixed-sex groups of 30 yearlings and 40 weaners were tested in 2001 and 2002, respectively, divided into 3 and 4 groups of equal size. In 2001, moxidectin was one of 3 drugs administered orally and at a dose rate of 0.4 mg\/kg. In 2002, pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin were orally administered at 19 and 0.2 mg\/kg. Moxidectin and doramectin (the latter not registered for horses) were administered by intramuscular injection at a dose of 0.2 mg\/kg, the dosage registered for other host species. The faecal egg count reduction test was used to determine the anthelmintic efficacies in both years. Each animal acted as its own control and the arithmetic mean faecal egg count and lower 95% confidence limit was calculated for each of the groups. A 100% reduction in the faecal egg counts and a 100% lower 95% confidence limit was recorded for moxidectin (0.4 mg\/kg) in 2001. In 2002, a 99% and 96% reduction was recorded for pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin, respectively. In the same year doramectin and moxidectin (both injectable and given at 0.2 mg\/kg) did not have any effect on worm egg counts. Of the 4 drugs tested in 2002, only pyrantel pamoate recorded lower 95% confidence limits above 90%.","656":"Between June 1999 and August 2000, the effects of feeding medicated urea-molasses supplement blocks on the growth of dairy heifers in a marginal area of central Kenya were assessed by comparing the live-weight gain of supplemented and unsupplemented heifers grazing the same pasture. Thirty-nine heifers with an average age of 9.6 months were initially treated orally with albendazole (10 mg\/kg body weight) and assigned to 3 groups: group I was fed urea-molasses blocks with incorporated fenbendazole (MUMB), group II was fed urea-molasses blocks (UMB) and group III heifers (control) received no block supplementation (NBS). Body weights of the heifers and faecal egg counts (FECs) were measured monthly and larval cultures were made of positive faecal samples of each group. The mean cumulative live-weight responses of the MUMB and UMB groups were significantly greater than the NBS group (P &lt; 0.05). However, at the end of the experimental period, the mean weight gain of the MUMB group did not differ from that of the UMB group (P &gt; 0.05). The FECs were moderate to low in all groups and decreased progressively with increasing age of the animals; FECs for the urea-molasses-supplemented groups remained significantly lower than those of the NBS group throughout the experimental period (P &lt; 0.05). Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus were the predominant nematode genera found in the heifers, but Cooperia, Bunostomum and Oesophagostomum were also present. These results indicate that feeding of urea-molasses blocks substantially reduced production losses attributable to nematode infection of young grazing cattle, and confirms previous observations that well-fed animals are better able to overcome the effects of helminth infections.","657":"The purpose of the study was to record and determine intensities, seasonal incidence and distribution of helminth parasites of veterinary importance that occur in cattle, sheep and goats in the northeastern Free State. The study was conducted at Harrismith and Kestell and in Qwa-Qwa from March 2000 to May 2001. Cattle of various breeds (including Bonsmara, Simmentaler and Friesian), Merino sheep and Angora goats were sampled. Faecal samples were analysed using the McMaster and Visser sieve techniques for egg counts and faecal cultures for 3rd-stage nematode larvae identification. Haemonchus and Oesophagostomum were the dominant nematode genera found to be infecting the animals. The socioeconomic status of the farmers in the study area was determined through a questionnaire survey aimed at recording their management strategies. It indicated that 81% of farmers take care of their livestock by feeding them with supplements. The low to moderate faecal egg counts from cattle showed that helminth infections in this region are still under control even though helminthosis seems to be a problem in small-stock, since EPG counts of more than &gt; 1000 were found. Cattle farmers in this region are encouraged to continue with good animal husbandry practices that have ensured that helminth infections rates are kept low. Small-stock farmers are, however, encouraged to control helminth infections in their sheep and goats by anthelmintic treatment.","658":"The susceptibility of the larval offspring of engorged female Boophilus decoloratus, and of the engorged females, collected from cattle on the dairy farms Brycedale, Sunny Grove and Welgevind in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, was tested against the acaricides amitraz, chlorfenvinphos and cypermethrin. Resistance was determined by means of the Shaw Larval Immersion Test (SLIT) for larvae and the Reproductive Estimate Test (RET) and Egg Laying Test (ELT) for adults. At Brycedale the tests all indicated resistance to chlorfenvinphos, and RET and ELT indicated resistance to amitraz and emerging resistance to cypermethrin. At Sunny Grove, B. decoloratus was resistant to cypermethrin using SLIT and exhibited emerging resistance to chlorfenvinphos with SLIT and to cypermethrin with both RET and ELT At Welgevind, resistance was recorded against chlorfenvinphos (SLIT) and against cypermethrin (ELT), and emerging resistance against permethrin (RET). The results obtained with RET and ELT were generally comparable, but often differed from those obtained with SLIT. Resistance could be detected within 7 days with ELT compared to 42 days with RET and 60 days with SLIT.","659":"Selected public health criteria of pasteurised milk available to the consumer from milk-shops in a pre-defined area of Pretoria compared with a national distributor's milk was evaluated. Of the 135 milk samples purchased from milk-shops, 87% were not fit for human consumption on the basis of the minimum standards prescribed in the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act, 1972 (Act 54 of1972). The national distributor's milk (n = 79) did not contain any pathogens, toxins nor inhibitory substances and passed all the criteria laid down in the Act. Even though milk-shop milk was sold as having been pasteurised, 38.5% of samples were alkaline phosphatase positive, indicating probable inadequate pasteurisation. Milk-shop milk quality varied between milk-shops and between sampling days and differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from the national distributor's milk. Total aerobic plate and coliform counts were generally high for all milk-shop milk samples. Somatic cell counts of milk-shop milk differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from the national distributor's milk. Escherichia coli was detected in 1 ml of 17% of milk-shop milk, 95% of which originated from milk which was alkaline phosphatase positive. Salmonella spp. could not be detected in 1 ml in any of the E. coli-positive milk tested. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 40% of milk-shop milk samples, and S. aureus enterotoxins from 7.8% of 51 cultures. Inhibitory substances were detected in 54.1% of milk-shop milk. The presence of inhibitory substances and the isolation of E. coli and S. aureus (some of which were able to produce enterotoxins) indicated potentially unsafe milk and poses a serious public health risk to consumers.","660":"","661":"A 2-year-old male German shepherd dog in poor bodily condition was evaluated for thoracic limb lameness due to a large, firm mass medial to the left cranial scapula. Radiography revealed several large cauliflower-like mineralized masses in the craniomedial left scapula musculature, pectoral region and bilaterally in the biceps tendon sheaths. Urinalysis, haematology and serum biochemistry showed that the dog was severely anaemic, hyperphosphataemic and in chronic renal failure. The dog was euthanased and a full post mortem performed. A diagnosis of chronic renal failure with secondary hyperparathyroidism was confirmed. The mineralised masses were grossly and histopathologically consistent with a diagnosis of tumoral calcinosis. Tumoral calcinosis associated with chronic renal failure that does not involve the foot pads is rarely seen.","662":"A vine snake bite in a dog is reported. There was continued minor bleeding from the assumed nose bite site for 4 days. Currently manufactured snakebite antivenom is not effective against vine snake bites and treatment is supportive.","663":"During the period March to September 2000, a study was conducted in Oodi village, Kgatleng District, Botswana, to investigate the seasonal fluctuation of internal, external and blood parasites of donkeys. Twelve adult donkeys were randomly selected from a farmer with a herd of 15 donkeys. Monthly visits were made to the farmer when the donkeys were examined for parasites. The only ectoparasites recovered from the donkeys were instars of various tick species. The most prevalent tick was Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (98.4%), followed by Amblyomma hebraeum and Hyalomma species. The only haemoparasite seen on microscopy was Babesia equi at low parasitaemia in 26.8% of the donkeys. However, no clinical babesiosis was evident. Coprological examination showed the presence of strongyle eggs in moderate numbers. Very low numbers of coccidia oocysts were found in the faecal samples. High tick numbers and worm egg counts coincided with the warm, wet months in contrast to the low numbers recovered during the cold, dry months. An interview conducted by the authors indicated that donkeys were nutritionally marginalised by owners. Supplementary feeding was therefore recommended, especially during the winter months when grazing is poor.","664":"A study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of endoparasites of wild ostriches at Mokolodi Nature Reserve, Gaborone, over a 7-month period. Large numbers of strongyle eggs were recovered from faecal material in April and September and a decline in the strongyle egg counts was evident during June and July. Noteworthy was the absence of helminth eggs in faecal samples collected from chicks and coccidia oocysts from any of the ostriches.","665":"The 1st recorded histological evidence of chytridiomycete fungal infection in a free-ranging ranid amphibian in South Africa is presented. Literature on causes of a worldwide decline in amphibian populations is briefly reviewed.","666":"The data and an analysis of the statistical summaries from the 'Return of Mares' of the General Stud Book of The Jockey Club of Southern Africa from 1975-1999 are presented. The total number of mares covered per season ranged from 7393 (1992) to 5180 (1995). The total living produce in the period surveyed was 95 317 foals. The categories of data examined include: the total number of mares covered per season; the total numbers and percentage of their living produce; the total numbers and percentage dead produce, 'slips' and foals born dead, barren and 'no return' mares; and the total number of live twins reported. The percentage live foals per season increased from 52 to 62% and the percentage barren and 'no return' mares declined from 35.50 to 28.40% over the period surveyed. The number of live twins reported showed a dramatic reduction from 156 to 5. These apparent improvements are ascribed to a combination of factors including advances in veterinary knowledge and technology. The findings are similar to those reported by similar surveys of national Thoroughbred populations from North America and Germany. There is an indication to broaden this annual survey by recording additional parameters more accurately reflecting reproductive efficiency rather than a cumulative annual total of live foals.","667":"A total of 177 free-ranging chickens from 19 Qwa-Qwa villages were bled from wing veins over a period of 6 months (June-November 2000). Serological tests indicated that 5% of chickens tested had been exposed to Newcastle disease, 43% to infectious bronchitis and 63% to Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection. McMaster and Visser sieve techniques were used to determine helminth and coccidia from pooled fresh faecal samples. Helminths isolated in 37% of the villages investigated were Heterakis, Ascaridia and Capillaria species. Eimeria species were also isolated in 32% of the villages investigated. The red fowl mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) was isolated from some of the birds and their nests. Data from a questionnaire survey indicated that all farmers interviewed had never received any technical support and that their chickens had never been vaccinated against any avian diseases. Only 10.5% of the owners interviewed had scientific knowledge on poultry diseases. There is an urgent need for the government to support free-ranging poultry farmers by providing subsidised vaccinations and technical support in order to develop and stimulate economic development in impoverished rural areas of South Africa.","668":"Ventrodorsal pelvic radiographs were made of 32 adult dogs under general anaesthesia. The hip joints were evaluated according to the severity of osteoarthritic changes graded as 0, 1, 2 or 3. The dogs were euthanased, the hip joints opened and the ligamentum capitis femoris dissected out in toto. The volume of each ligament was determined using a water displacement technique and the mean volume compared to the four radiographic grades of osteoarthritis. There was an inverse correlation (r = -0.75) between the mean volume of the ligamentum capitis femoris and the increasing severity of osteoarthritis as assessed by radiography. The results confirmed the crucial role of radiography in the clinical evaluation of hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis in the adult dog. Assessment of the volume of the ligamentum capitis femoris revealed that it is an important tool for research in canine hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.","669":"Cotyledoside, a bufadienolide cardiac glycoside, was administered intravenously to sheep in 2 studies. In experiment 1, sheep (n = 4) received 0.0135 mg\/kg daily on 5 consecutive days and in the 2nd experiment, sheep (n = 4) received 0.027 mg\/kg as a single dose. Jugular blood was collected at different time intervals and kinetic parameters were determined. The data fitted a 1-compartmental model. In both experiments a short half-life (t1\/2) and mean residence time (MRT), a relative small volume of distribution (Vd(ss)) and rapid clearance were calculated. In the 1st experiment, t1\/2 and MRT increased significantly (P &lt; 0.007) from Day (D) 0 to D4. It is suggested that the rapid decline in plasma cotyledoside concentrations in sheep denotes rapid distribution of cotyledoside to the tissues or extracellular spaces and possible accumulation at the biophase.","670":"As part of a trial to test the profitability of finishing weaner lambs over winter and spring on the Highveld of Gauteng province, an investigation was carried out over 4 consecutive years as to whether or not worm control was necessary while the lambs were on irrigated, improved pastures. Pastures that had not been grazed by sheep or other livestock for at least 5 years were planted to annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflora) that was ploughed under and replanted annually. Weaner lambs were randomly divided into either 2 (A and B) or 3 (A, B and C) groups and finished from April\/May to November\/December on a separate pasture per group. While Group A lambs were dewormed before being placed on pasture, those in Groups B and C were not. Faecal egg counts were performed at irregular intervals, and when the lambs were sold at the conclusion of each year's trial, the gastrointestinal tracts of 4-5 lambs per trial group were processed for worm recovery. Haemonchus contortus was the dominant worm species, while Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Ostertagia circumcincta and Trichuris spp. were encountered sporadically. From the results obtained it seems unlikely that there is appreciable 'carry-over' of the various worm species from year to year on pastures that are ploughed and replanted annually; thus it is improbable that there will be a build-up of anthelmintic-resistant worms. While on pasture, no drenching was required for the Group A lambs (dewormed before placing on the pasture), nor in 2 of the 4 years in Groups B or B+C that were not drenched and were lightly infected at the start. In the remaining 2 years Groups B or B+C were drenched once only during the course of each trial. Thus, under the conditions as in this study, little worm control is necessary, provided faecal worm egg counts are done to gauge the levels of infection before the lambs are placed on pasture, and to guard against the possibility of an increase in worm burdens thereafter in some years. Also, because of the apparent lack of carry-over between years, anthelmintic treatment at the time of introduction of the lambs or during the period of finishing should be safe as regards progressive selection for anthelmintic resistance. It is also likely to be cost-effective, considering the low cost of anthelmintics in relation to the price of lambs, to counter the possibility of a loss in production if lambs were to harbour relatively heavy worm burdens when introduced.","671":"","672":"An overview of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions received by the Veterinary Pharmacovigilance and Medicines Information Centre during the period March 2001 to February 2002 is given. A total of 77 reports were received. The majority of reports involved suspected adverse reactions that occurred in dogs and cats. Most products implicated in the reports were Stock Remedies. The products were predominantly administered either by veterinarians or trained paraveterinary professionals. Although the majority of reports were received from veterinary pharmaceutical companies, the proportion of reports received directly from veterinarians increased compared with previous years.","673":"The incidence of trypanosomosis was determined using the haematocrit centrifuge technique (HCT) as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 120 goat blood spots on filter paper. Both techniques failed to detect a positive reaction, implying that factors such as age, healthy appearance and small sample size notwithstanding, trypanosomosis does not seem to pose a serious threat to goat health in the districts from where the animals originated.","674":"The aim of this study was to establish and validate a method to permit microsatellite analysis of DNA profiles obtained from frozen-thawed stallion sperm cells. This would provide reliable and accurate verification of the identification of a semen donor. Ejaculates from 5 pony stallions were collected, processed and frozen in 0.5 ml plastic straws. Aliquots of 100 microl of the frozen-thawed semen thus obtained were either placed directly, or diluted (1:10; 1:100; and 1:1000) and placed on slides of FTA paper. Similarly, blood samples obtained from each of the stallions were placed onto slides of FTA paper. A punch was removed from each sample after drying Each sample was mixed with FTA purification reagent, Dithiothreitol and Proteinase K before incubation and processing. All samples were processed with a set of 13 microsatellite markers. Further analysis permitted a comparison of the DNA profiles of the frozen-thawed semen and the blood samples. A full profile of markers was obtained from the 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of the frozen-thawed semen samples as well as from the blood samples. The DNA profiles from the frozen-thawed semen and blood samples obtained from the stallions matched in all cases.","675":"The metacestode of Taenia solium, Cysticercus cellulosae, was recovered from the brain of a cat showing central nervous clinical signs ante mortem. This is the first record of cerebral cysticercosis in a cat in South Africa.","676":"Most local anaesthetic blocks are placed blindly, based on a sound knowledge of anatomy. Very often the relationship between the site of deposition of local anaesthetic and the nerve to be blocked is unknown. Large motor neurons may be stimulated with the aid of an electrical current. By observing for muscle twitches, through electrical stimulation of the nerve, a needle can be positioned extremely close to the nerve. The accuracy of local anaesthetic blocks can be improved by this technique. By using the lowest possible current a needle could be positioned with in 2-5 mm of a nerve. The correct duration of stimulation ensures that stimulation of sensory nerves does not occur The use of electrical nerve stimulation in veterinary medicine is a novel technique that requires further evaluation.","677":"Two dogs developed alarming tremorgenic nervous stimulation shortly after ingesting discarded rice that had been forgotten in a refrigerator for an undetermined period and that was covered with a grey-green mould. Both dogs exhibited vomition followed by slight salivation, tremors and ataxia and 1 showed such severe agitation and seizures that it necessitated anaesthesia with thiopentone followed, on recovery, by xylazine. The other dog was only sedated with xylazine. They made an uneventful recovery. The rice vomitus yielded a pure culture of Penicillium crustosum. On chemical analysis it was negative for organochlorine, organophosphor and carbamate insecticides, as well as for strychnine, but contained 2.6 microg\/g of the mycotoxins penitrem A as well as 34 microg\/g of roquefortine as determined by LC-MS and confirmed by MS-MS. This is the 1st South African case of naturally occurring penitrem A toxicosis and also the 1st case where quantification of the levels of mycotoxins in dog vomitus is reported. The tremorgenicity of roquefortine and its contribution towards this syndrome, is questioned.","678":"A 13-month-old, neutered, male Golden retriever presented with seizures and progressive depression. Clinical and neurological assessment was consistent with severe intracranial disease. The neurological condition progressively deteriorated and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the presence of a large, contrast-enhancing, space-occupyingmass in the right cerebral hemisphere. Therapy with corticosteroids, mannitol and furosemide ameliorated the signs of depression and ataxia, but the owner elected euthanasia after 1 week. Post mortem examination of the brain confirmed the presence of a large haemorrhagic lesion in the right olfactory lobe, the histopathological appearance of which was consistent with cerebral cavernous haemangioma. This is the 1st case describing the MRI appearance of a cavernous haemangioma of the cerebrum in the veterinary literature.","679":"An ante mortem antigen-ELISA-based diagnosis of Taenia saginata cysticercosis was studied in artificially (n = 24) and naturally (n = 25) infected cattle with the objective of further validating the assay as a field diagnostic test. Based on total dissection as the definitive method of validity, the assay minimally detected 14 live cysticerci in artificially infected calves and 2 in naturally infected steers. In natural infections, the minimum number of live cysticerci consistently detected by Ag-ELISA was 5 while in artificial infections it was above 14. However, other animals with 12 and 17 live cysticerci in artificially infected calves, and 1 and 2 live cysticerci in naturally infected steers, escaped detection for unknown reasons. Animals harbouring dead cysticerci gave negative reactions in the assay as was the case in non-infected experimental control calves. There was a statistically significant positive linear correlation between Ag-ELISA optical density values and burdens of live cysticerci as obtained by total dissection of both artificially infected calves (r = 0.798, n = 24; P &lt; 0.05) and naturally infected steers (r = 0.631, n = 25; P &lt; 0.05). These results clearly show the potential effectiveness of ante mortem monoclonal antibody-based antigen detection ELISA in the diagnosis of bovine cysticercosis in cattle. Its value lies in the diagnosis of infection in cattle as a screening test in a herd, rather than as a diagnostic test at the individual level, due to false positive and negative reactions. In a herd of heavily infected cattle, the assay may, however, provide for individual diagnosis. Nevertheless, more work is recommended to increase its sensitivity so as to be able to diagnose light infections consistently in the field.","680":"Fifty-one per cent of 110 questionnaires, designed for obtaining information on helminth control practices and management on Thoroughbred stud farms in South Africa, were completed by farmers during 2000. The number of horses per farm included in the questionnaire survey ranged from 15 to 410. Foals, yearlings and adult horses were treated with anthelmintics at a mean of 7.3 +\/- 3.0, 6.6 +\/- 2.7 and 5.3 +\/- 2.3 times per year, respectively. An average of 3.4 different drugs were used annually, with ivermectin being used bymost farmers during 1997-2000. On 43% of farms the weights of horses were estimated by weigh band and 45% of farmers estimated visually, while both were used on 7% of farms and scales on the remaining 5%. Doses were based on average group weight on 50% ofthe farms and on individual weights on 46%. Forty-three per cent of farmers performed faecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT). Most farmers rotated horses between pastures and treated new horses at introduction. Faecal removal was practiced on 61% of farms and less than 50% of farmers used alternate grazing with ruminants. Faecal egg count reduction tests were done on 283 horses, using oxibendazole, ivermectin and moxidectin on 10,9 and 5 farms, respectively, in the Western Cape Province during 2001. While the efficacy of oxibendazole was estimated by FECRT to range from 0-88% and moxidectin from 99-100%, ivermectin resulted in a 100% reduction in egg counts. Only cyathostome larvae were recovered from post-treatment faecal cultures.","681":"A 2-sample regime was used to measure whole milk progesterone concentration on the day of oestrus and insemination (Day 0) and 6 days later (Day 6) in a sample of 50 primiparous and 100 multiparous suckling beef cows. Exposure to teaser bulls and observation by cattlemen identified the occurrence of oestrus. Three sets of criteria used to define ovulatory oestrus were compared: a) milk progesterone concentration less than 6 nmol\/l on Day 0; b) milk progesterone less than 6 nmol\/l on Day 0 and rising to greater than 6 nmol\/l on Day 6; c) milk progesterone less than 6 nmol\/l on Day 0 and rising to greater than 6 nmol\/l on Day 6, or cow diagnosed pregnant to 1st insemination. Using only a single milk sample on Day 0 (criterion a) would have resulted in the positive predictive value of heat detection being estimated at 98.7%. Using a pair ed measurement (criterion b) resulted in a significantly lower estimate of 84.7%. The inclusion of cows that conceived despite not showing a marked rise in milk progesterone concentration (criterion c) resulted in a more accurate estimate of 89.3 %. Use of a 2-sample regime also allowed calculation of conception rates while eliminating the effect of heat detection errors. In the cows sampled, of those in ovulatory oestrus that were inseminated, 73.1% conceived to the 1st insemination. These results demonstrate that artificial insemination within a limited breeding season can be successful if nutrition is optimal and management is intensive. The use of a 2-sample milk progesterone test may be a valuable tool in investigating heat detection and conception problems in beef herds in which artificial insemination is used.","682":"A study was conducted in the Madikwe District of the North West Province to investigate the supply of veterinary medicinal products to small-scale, subsistence and emerging farmers. A combination of individual interviews, focus groups and direct observation was used to collect data. Stock remedies were made available to farmers within the district at Field Service Units that were managed by administrative staff of the Directorate of Field Services. The state veterinarian and animal health technicians were not directly involved with the sale of products. Most farmers still travelled to farmers' cooperatives in the larger centres outside the district to purchase the veterinary medicinal products they needed. Factors such as the quality of service provided, affordability and availability of required products as well as inaccessibility of outlets to all farmers contributed to the poor support of these outlets by the farmers of the district.","683":"A participatory research model was used in six village communities in the Central Region of the North West Province of South Africa in order to achieve the following broad objectives: to obtain information on the challenges owners face in raising livestock in these areas and to evaluate the livestock owners' level of knowledge of internal parasites in their animals. Information obtained at participatory workshops clearly indicated a need for improvements in water supply, schools, job creation, and health services. Lack of pasture for grazing livestock was also cited as being important. Other most frequently mentioned livestock problems included 'gall sickness' (a vaguely defined condition not necessarily referring to anaplasmosis), parasites (both external and internal), chicken diseases and ingestion of plastic bags discarded in the environment. When livestock owners were questioned during individual interviews, most were able to identify the presence of parasites in either the live or dead animal. However, it seems likely that this is limited to the identification of tapeworms. It was found that most livestock owners use a combination of treatments, ranging from traditional to folklore to commercial. There were some difficulties in using the participatory methods since it was the first time that the facilitators and the communities had been exposed to them. Many communities had difficulty in dealing with the concept of finding solutions within the community, which is such an integral part of participatory methods.","684":"A rostrocaudal (RCd) nasal view was developed in large breed mesaticephalic dogs using a complete, subsequently sectioned, skull and cadaver specimens to optimise the radiographic technique and evaluate normal anatomic features. Gelatin was placed in one nasal passage of the cadaver specimens to mimic the effects of nasal pathology. The latter specimens and 18 clinical cases with suspected nasal disease were evaluated to determine the usefulness of the RCd view compared to standard nasal views. An optimal RCd view was obtained with the dog in dorsal recumbency and the head symmetrically positioned with the hard palate perpendicular to the table using a table top technique with 8:1 grid, collimating to the nasal region and centring the primary beam on the philtrum. The dorsolateral aspects of the maxillary bone, the nasal bones, septal sulcus of the vomer, mucosa lined nasal septum and conchae could be seen. A centrodorsal more radiolucent area representing the ethmoid bone region was also visible. Gelatin soft tissue opacification of the nasal passage could be seen more clearly in RCd nasal view than in occlusal dorsoventral view. In clinical cases the RCd view was useful to build up a 3-dimensional image of nasal passage pathology as well as to detect nasal septum and osseous nasal border pathology not visible in other views. This view is particularly useful in cases where cross-sectional imaging modalities are not available or where the nasal investigation is limited by cost considerations.","685":"Otitis externa is no longer viewed as an isolated disease of the ear canal, but is a syndrome that is often a reflection of underlying dermatological disease. Causes are classified as predisposing (increase the risk of otitis); primary (directly induce otitis), secondary (contribute to otitis only in an abnormal ear or in conjunction with predisposing factors) and perpetuating (result from inflammation and pathology in ear, prevent resolution of otitis). Common primary causes include foreign bodies, hypersensitivity (particularly atopy and food allergy), keratinisation disorders (most commonly primary idiopathic seborrhoea and hypothyroidism) and earmites, particularly in cats. A systematic diagnostic procedure is required to identify causes and contributing factors. This should include history, clinical examination, otoscopy and cytology in all cases and culture and sensitivity as well as otitis media assessment and biopsy in severe and recurrent cases. Ancillary tests may be required depending on the underlying cause. Treatment consists of identifying and addressing predisposing and primary factors; cleaning the ear canal; topical therapy; systemic therapy where necessary; client education; follow-up; and preventive and maintenance therapy as required.","686":"A 38-day-old male warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) with marked anaemia (haematocrit = 14 %) presented to the Denver Zoological Gardens hospital with ataxia, tachypnoea, suspected stunted growth and cardiomegaly. The piglet demonstrated some features consistent with both iron deficiency anaemia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Serum-soluble iron was below the level of detection (&lt; 8.96 micromol\/l). Iron deficiency anaemia is a well recognised entity in domestic swine reared on concrete and denied access to soil. Fifteen captive warthogs were subsequently evaluated for serum soluble iron content (mean = 21.62 +\/- 4.36 micromol\/l as well as 5 neonatal warthog piglets that required hand-rearing. Only 1 of 5 neonatal warthog piglets had measurable serum soluble iron (9.50 micromol\/l). These data suggest that warthogs are similar to domestic swine and are born with low iron stores. Some form of iron supplementation should be considered for captive neonatal warthog piglets, especially if they are reared on concrete.","687":"A single Merino sheep, artificially infested with the sheep scab mite, Psoroptes ovis, and a similarly infested Dorper sheep were placed with 9 uninfested Merino or 9 uninfested Dorper sheep respectively during winter and the rate of spread of infestation on the uninfested sheep observed. The same procedure was repeated in summer. It took 14 and 8 weeks respectively in winter before all sheep in the 2 groups displayed lesions of sheep scab, whereas in summer it took 10 and 12 weeks before all sheep had lesions.","688":"Sheep scab mites, Psoroptes ovis, collected from a Merino donor sheep, were used to infest Merino and Dorper sheep, and Angora and Boer goats. Mites were placed on the sheep on 1 or 2 occasions and on 5 occasions on the goats. All the animals were examined at regular intervals for the presence of scab lesions and living mites. Both sheep breeds developed lesions, but those on the Merino sheep were always larger than those on the Dorper sheep at the same intervals after infestation. None of the goats developed lesions or showed signs of irritation, or harboured any mites.","689":"A young Donge de Bordeaux dog was presented with chronic intermittent antibiotic responsive gastrointestinal and respiratory disease. Further evaluation showed bacterial lymphadenitis, bacterial tracheitis, normal white cell and differential cell counts, hypogammaglobulinaemia, and the absence of B-lymphocytes but the presence of T-lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue stained with lymphocyte markers. As the dog came from a narrow genetic base, with related dogs showing similar clinical signs, possible B-cell congenital immune deficiency was suspected.","690":"In order to detect the prevalence of Cowdria ruminantium in the vector tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, free-living, unfed adult ticks were collected with the aid of pheromone\/CO2 traps. Ticks were collected at the Rietgat communal grazing area, as well as in the southwestern Kruger National Park and in the Songimvelo Game Reserve, all located in heartwater-endemic areas of South Africa. The presence of C. ruminantium in these ticks was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Ticks from the Rietgat communal grazing area were assayed in 2 batches and 4.7% of the one and 11.3% of the other were positive for infection, while 5.7% of the ticks collected in the Kruger National Park and 25% in the Songimvelo Game Reserve were positive. These results support the contention that a vector-wildlife cycle of transmission of C. ruminantium, the cause of heartwater in domestic ruminants, can be maintained in the absence of the latter animals.","691":"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the beta2-adrenoceptor clenbuterol on food-restricted sheep. Clenbuterol was administered as a dietary admixture (4 mg\/ kg diet) to a group of male Serra da Estrela sheep (n = 6). The animals were housed individually in metabolic cages and fed for 45 days at 65% of estimated requirement for energy maintenance. An untreated group with the same energy intake level was included as a control. Changes in body mass, nitrogen and energy balances and insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and triiodothyronine (T3 ) levels in the experimental animals were monitored. During the 4th week of the trial, clenbuterol-treated sheep showed increased mass gains, greater energy retention and serum IGF-1 levels and decreased T3 serum concentrations. This study showed that clenbuterol may induce a protective effect in sheep subjected to periods of food deprivation, based on the body mass and digestible energy effects manifested by treated animals.","692":null,"693":"A longitudinal study was conducted on the differential faecal egg counts, haematocrits and body condition scores of sheep belonging to resource-poor farmers at Rust de Winter, Gauteng province, and Kraaipan, North West Province, South Africa. The animals were scored for level of anaemia using the FAMACHA method, an assay for the clinical evaluation of anaemia caused by Haemonchus spp. Periods of higher Haemonchus egg counts occurred from October to March for sheep at Rust de Winter and from September\/October to February or April for sheep at Kraaipan. Lower haematocrit values were registered during these periods as was a higher incidence of anaemic conjunctival mucous membrane colour scores compared to the period April to September. No clear relationship between the faecal egg counts and the body condition scores was evident. Although wider application of the FAMACHA system in sheep raised by resource-poor farmers should be investigated, the present study indicates that this method may certainly prove to be a valuable worm control strategy for such livestock owners.","694":"Educational institutions should be aware of the frequency of surgical procedures in private practice, to assist both the student and the lecturer in evaluating the relative importance of procedures and to structure training programmes accordingly. The surgical caseload for 1 year at a veterinary academic hospital and 13 private companion animal hospitals registered with the South African Veterinary Council were compared. Surgical records were entered into a spreadsheet and sorted according to 96 selected surgical procedures to facilitate comparisons. Surgical procedures were in turn grouped according to date, species, degree of difficulty and frequency of occurrence. Feline procedures were more commonly performed in private hospitals. The academic hospital's caseload was dominated by major and advanced procedures while the private hospitals carried out more minor procedures. At the private hospitals more general surgery, and ear, nose and throat surgery as well as dental procedures were performed, while at the academic hospital more ophthalmic, orthopaedic, thoracic and neurosurgical procedures were carried out. The most commonly performed procedures at the academic hospital differed from those at the private hospitals. No seasonal trends were evident.","695":"Investigaltions to determine the effect of sample storage on the concentration of copper in liver tissue and on the activity of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase were undertaken in preparation for a study of blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) that were suspected to be suffering from copper deficiency. Two liver samples were collected from each of 20 culled blesbok in a manner that simulated the collection of biopsies from the live animal. These samples were stored either in 10% formalin or frozen at -20 degrees C until analysed 4 1\/2 months later. The effect of different methods of sample storage on superoxide dismutase activity was determined. Erythrocytes collected from 3 Jersey cows and 5 culled blesbok were washed and divided into 0.5 ml portions, stored at room temperature (approximately 20 degrees C), in a refrigerator (4 degrees C), frozen at -20 degrees C in a freezer, and in liquid nitrogen (-200 degrees C). An analysis of superoxide dismutase activity was undertaken using a commercial assay kit at intervals of 2-4 days until the levels of activity had fallen significantly. The copper concentration in formalin-preserved liver samples was significantly lower than that measured in frozen liver tissue apparently as a result of leaching. The activity of superoxide dismutase in cattle blood was unchanged for 4 days at room temperature but fell appreciably after 2 days at 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C. Enzyme activity remained unchanged for 200 days in erythrocytes stored in liquid nitrogen. Superoxide dismutase activity levels in healthy blesbok were considerably lower than those measured in Jersey cows and remained unaffected for up to 6 days in samples stored at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. The level of activity fell significantly thereafter. Samples stored in liquid nitrogen were unchanged after 40 days.","696":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cardio-respiratory effects of the combination of medetomidine and thiopentone followed by reversal with atipamezole as a combination for anaesthesia in 10 healthy German Shepherd dogs breathing spontaneously in a room at an altitude of 1486 m above sea level with an ambient air pressure of 651 mmHg. After the placement of intravenous and intra-arterial catheters, baseline samples were collected. Medetomidine (0.010 mg\/kg) was administered intravenously and blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every minute for 5 minutes. Thiopentone was then slowly administered until intubation conditions were ideal. An endotracheal tube was placed and the dogs breathed room air spontaneously. Blood pressure, pulse oximetry, respiratory and heart rate, capnography, blood gas analysis and arterial lactate were performed or recorded every 10 minutes for the duration of the trial. Thiopentone was administered to maintain anaesthesia. After 60 minutes, atipamezole (0.025 mg\/kg) was given intramuscularly. Data were recorded for the next 30 minutes. A dose of 8.7 mg\/kg of thiopentone was required to anaesthetise the dogs after the administration of 0.010 mg\/kg of medetomidine. Heart rate decreased from 96.7 at baseline to 38.5 5 minutes after the administration of medetomidine (P &lt; 0.05). Heart rate then increased with the administration of thiopentone to 103.2 (P &lt; 0.05). Blood pressure increased from 169.4\/86.2 mmHg to 253.2\/143.0 mmHg 5 minutes after the administration of medetomidine (P &lt; 0.05). Blood pressure then slowly returned towards normal. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to baseline values after the administration of atipamezole. Arterial oxygen tension decreased from baseline levels (84.1 mmHg) to 57.8 mmHg after the administration of medetomidine and thiopentone (P &lt; 0.05). This was accompanied by arterial desaturation from 94.7 to 79.7% (P &lt; 0.05). A decrease in respiratory rate from 71.8 bpm to 12.2 bpm was seen during the same period. Respiratory rates slowly increased over the next hour to 27.0 bpm and a further increases 51.4 bpm after the administration of atipamezole was seen (P &lt; 0.05). This was maintained until the end of the observation period. Arterial oxygen tension slowly returned towards normal over the observation period. No significant changes in blood lactate were seen. No correlation was found between arterial saturation as determined by blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry. Recovery after the administration of atipamezole was rapid (5.9 minutes). In healthy dogs, anaesthesia can be maintained with a combination of medetomidine and thiopentone, significant anaesthetic sparing effects have been noted and recovery from anaesthesia is not unduly delayed. Hypoxaemia may be problematic. Appropriate monitoring should be done and oxygen supplementation and ventilatory support should be available. A poor correlation between SpO2 and SaO2 and ETCO2 and PaCO2 was found.","697":"Ixodid ticks were collected during the period September 1991 to August 1993 from cattle belonging to small-scale farmers utilising 4 communal grazing areas. Three of these were in North West Province and 1 in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. Ten tick species were collected in North West Province and 7 in Mpumalanga. The adults of Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi were most numerous in North West Province, while in Mpumalanga Boophilus decoloratus comprised more than 75% of the total population. Amblyomma hebraeum was present on all grazing areas, and heavy infestations of adults occurred during the period October to May on 1 of these. Few B. decoloratus were collected in North West Province, chiefly because the sampling method was inadequate, and most of these were present during early summer (October to December) and late summer and autumn (March to May). The initially low population of B. decoloratus in Mpumalanga increased substantially towards the conclusion of the survey, probably because of the cessation of dipping. Boophilus microplus was present in small numbers on 2 grazing areas in the North West Province. Adult Hyalomma marginatum rufipes reached peak numbers from December to February and Hyalomma truncatum from February to April in the North West Province. Only H. marginatum rufipes was collected in Mpumalanga. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus was present on all the grazing areas, with most adults present from December to April. Most adult Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi were collected from September to April and Rhipicephalus simus was present during the period October-April.","698":"Well-known plant poisonings such as 'dunsiekte' (seneciosis) and 'jaagsiekte' (crotalariosis) of horses in southern Africa are briefly reviewed. Relatively unfamiliar mycotoxicoses such as stachybotryotoxicosis and perennial rye grass staggers and potentially occurring exotic intoxications such as equine nigropallidal encephalomalacia and ergot alkaloid poisoning are also discussed. This article is aimed at informing the southern African equine practitioner about probable poisonings that might occur locally in horses.","699":"","700":"The first severe case of caprine contagious ecthyma (parapox) in Tswana goats is described from Botswana. Affected animals were indigenous adult Tswana goats. The case involved a flock of 12 goats of which 4 (33.3%) were very severely affected but none died. The lesions were confined to the head and included swollen lips, swollen submandibular lymph nodes, gingivitis, glossitis, ulceration on lip and gum mucosae and scab formation on ulcerated areas. No lesions were found on other parts of the body. This case was clinically indistinguishable from bluetongue.","701":"A renal T-cell lymphoma with exclusive cerebral metastasis was diagnosed in a 5-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier bitch euthanased for aggression. This is the first recorded case of primary renal lymphoma in a dog. Immune suppression, due to chronic canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, may account for the unusual primary site and metastatic pattern of the tumour.","702":"Xylohypha bantiana is a rare neurotropic fungal infection reported in humans, dogs and cats. In dogs it has only been identified on post mortem examination and thus no successful treatments have previously been reported. Amphotericin B is a potent antifungal drug with a low therapeutic index because of its nephrotoxicity. Liposomal encapsulation of the drug has resulted in much safer use in humans. This article reports a case of Xylohypha bantiana infection in a dog that was diagnosed antemortally and managed with liposomal amphotericin B, which resulted in the prolongation of quality of life for an infection that invariably results in rapid death.","703":"An apparently idiopathic interface diseasee in a 2-year-old Boer billy goat is described. Clinical features of the disease were the presence of a pruritic multiple focally disseminated dermatitis with flat-topped, angular, scaly plaques and papules with corrugated surfaces in the skin of virtually the entire body. The aetiology of the disorder in the described case is unknown.","704":"The aim of the study was to examine the effect of the beta2-adrenoceptor, clenbuterol, on the duodenal epithelium of food-restricted rats. Clenbuterol was administered as a dietary admixture (4 mg\/kg diet) to three groups of male Wistar rats (n = 8) housed individually in metabolic cages and fed ad libitum for 15 days at 110% and 160% of the estimated requirement for energy maintenance. Untreated groups at each energy intake level were also included. Samples of the duodenum were examined by light microscopy. Compared with control animals, clenbuterol treatment significantly increased body mass in all diet groups, although it induced no changes in mean food intake. Gastrointestinal (GIT) dry mass was increased by clenbuterol only in the most severely-restricted-diet group. In this group, clenbuterol treatment increased GIT tissue nitrogen (23%), more than it did in the ad libitum group (13%). In all treated groups, clenbuterol induced significant hypertrophy of duodenal enterocytes and circular muscle layers, and the diameter of lymphatic vessels increased. In the clenbuterol-treated, restricted-diet groups the height of the brush borders of enterocytes increased. It is concluded that clenbuterol has a protective effect on the intestinal structure in rats on restricted as well as ad libitum diets.","705":"A survey of the management of mixed farming of cattle and antelope and use of anthelmintics was conducted on eleven farms between August and December 1999 by a self-administered questionnaire. Seventeen antelope species ranging from grey duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia) to eland (Taurotragus oryx) occurred on the farms. Impala (Aepyceros melampus) was the most abundant antelope on the farms. Seventy-five per cent of the antelope species on the farms were grazers and mixed feeders and shared grazing with cattle. Most farmers (n = 8) did not consider the stocking density for cattle and antelope as an important management factor. Fifty-four per cent of the farmers (n = 6) routinely dewormed both cattle and antelopes. Albendazole and fenbendazole were the most commonly used drugs for deworming cattle (72.7%) and antelope species (54.5%). The deworming of antelope was carried out during the dry season, using albendazole-, fenbendazole-and rafoxanide-medicated supplementary feed blocks. Doramectin injections were given to antelopes on two farms. Cattle were dewormed preventively and according to the general body condition of the animal. Few farmers (n = 4) followed the recommended deworming programme for cattle in Zimbabwe and only one farmer followed a specified dosing programme for game. However, results from the survey on the deworming of game indicate that farmers perceived helminth infections in antelope to be important.","706":"Two trials were carried out to assess the diagnostic sensitivity and practicability of preputial scraping as a method of collecting preputial material from bulls infected with Tritrichomonas foetus. In the 1st trial, preputial material was collected by simultaneous scraping and aspiration from 3 infected and 1 uninfected bull 10 times over a 5-week period. In the 2nd trial, samples from 5 infected bulls were collected by both sheath washing and scraping on 6 occasions, while 8 uninfected animals were sampled 3 times. Samples were cultured using a modified Trichomonas culture medium (Oxoid). In the first trial, 29 of 30 samples from infected bulls were found to be positive. In the second trial, 83 % of samples collected by both methods tested positive. In neither trial were any samples from the control bulls found to be positive. Scraping was found to be quick and safe, and offered advantages over preputial washing in that urine contamination was easily avoided, samples were smaller and more concentrated and contamination was reduced. It may, however, be subject to greater operator variability than sheath washing. It is concluded that preputial scraping is as effective as washing and represents a suitable alternative for the collection of material for direct examination and culture of Tritrichomonas foetus.","707":"This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci in clinical and subclinical mastitis in commercial and small-scale farms in Zimbabwe. Thirty five quarter milk samples from clinical mastitis cases and 371 quarter milk samples from cows with subclinical mastitis were cultured for bacterial pathogens. The most frequent pathogens isolated in clinical mastitis were the enteric bacteria (31.4%), followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (22.9%) and then Staphylococcus aureus (17.1%), whereas in subclinical mastitis S. aureus (34.2%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci were (33.2%) the most common. Bacillus species were only isolated in milk samples from subclinical mastitis. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were observed in mixed infections with other bacteria in only 2.2 of the 406 milk samples from clinical and subclinical mastitis where they were isolated together with Bacillus species in 6 of the 9 mixed infection cases. About 95% of the milk samples from which 131 coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated had correspondingly high somatic cell counts. The coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated most frequently were S. chromogenes (7.9%), S. epidermidis (7.4%) and S. hominis (5.9%). They were all associated with high somatic cell counts. All the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were susceptible to cloxacillin and erythromycin, and more than 90% of the isolates were susceptible to neomycin, penicillin and streptomycin. The highest resistance was to tetracycline (17.6%), followed by lincomycin (13.7%). About 8% of the isolates were resistant to both penicillin and streptomycin.","708":"Erodium moschatum is an exotic weed in the southern and southwestern coastal areas of the Western Cape Province (WCP), South Africa. It has been suspected as the cause of photosensitivity in sheep. However, attempts to induce photosensitivity by dosing it to sheep have thus far been unsuccessful. During August 1999, 2 sheep suffering from severe photosensitivity were presented for clinical examination to the Western Cape Provincial Veterinary Laboratory (WCPVL). One sheep was sacrificed for autopsy. Except for skin lesions associated with photosensitivity, no icterus or other lesions were present. Histopathological examination of affected skin revealed epidermal necrosis while the liver had no microscopic lesions. It was therefore concluded that the sheep might have been suffering from primary photosensitivity. The farm from which the sheep came, situated in the Malmesbury district, WCP, was visited to determine the source of the photodynamic agent. The flock from which the sheep originated had been grazing in a camp where E. moschatum was growing abundantly and had been heavily grazed. Some remaining Erodium in the camp was collected, pulped and dosed over a period of 7 days to an adult sheep. Another sheep was dosed simultaneously with Erodium growing on the premises of the WCPVL. Both sheep developed mild photosensitivity, which was confirmed by histopathological examination of skin biopsies. It was concluded that E. moschatum can induce photosensitivity (probably the primary type) in sheep if ingested in large quantities.","709":"The blood group antigen Dog Erythrocyte Antigen (DEA) 1.1 is clinically the most important canine blood group as DEA 1.1 antibodies are capable of causing acute haemolytic, potentially life-threatening transfusion reactions. Dogs do not have naturally occurring antibodies to DEA 1.1 but are rapidly sensitised by the first incompatible transfusion. The prevalence of DEA 1.1 in the general dog population is estimated at 42-46%. Canine blood donors registered with the Onderstepoort Animal Blood Bank (n = 93) as well as potential donors (n = 140) were typed for DEA 1.1 using a monoclonal antibody card kit. All dogs came from the Onderstepoort area, near Pretoria, Gauteng province, South Africa. Overall prevalence of DEA 1.1 was 47%. Prevalence was 47% in purebred dogs and 48% in mongrels. Distinct breed differences were noted with less than 20% of German shepherd dogs and Boxers and greater than 75% of Rottweilers, Great Danes, St Bernards and Dalmations testing DEA 1.1 positive. Knowledge of local breed differences will increase effectiveness of blood donor recruitment.","710":"An ostrich breeding flock, joined as individual breeding pairs (n = 136 pairs), was used to investigate the possibility of diagnostic ultrasonography as a method to predict the reproductive performance of ostrich females during a breeding season. Follicular activity was easily detected and quantified by using diagnostic ultrasonography. One to 8 follicles were recorded in 25% of females scanned at the beginning of the 9-month breeding season. At the end of the breeding season, 1-3 follicles were observed in 28.7% females. Females in which follicular activity was observed came into production earlier than those in which no follicles were observed, with the mean (+\/- SE) number of days to the production of the 1st egg being 22.3 +\/- 12.5 and 87.4 +\/- 7.2 days, respectively. Females in which follicular activity was observed at the beginning of the breeding season, produced on average 181% more eggs during the 1st month of the breeding season (P &lt; 0.01) than females in which no follicular activity was observed (6.67 +\/- 0.70 vs 2.37 +\/- 0.41 eggs). Egg production over the first 2 months of breeding and over the entire breeding season were similarly affected (P &lt; 0.01), with the mean number of eggs produced over the first 2 months of the breeding season being 14.7 +\/- 1.5 for females with observed follicular activity and 7.4 +\/- 0.9 eggs for females with no observed follicular activity. Females in which follicular activity was observed at the end of the breeding season produced on average 108% more eggs (P &lt; 0.01) during the last month of the breeding season than females in which no follicular activity was observed (2.77 +\/- 0.43 vs. 1.33 +\/- 0.27 eggs). There was a tendency (P = 0.06) for egg production over the last 2 months to be similarly affected (6.10 +\/- 0.85 vs 4.19 +\/- 0.54 eggs). No relationship with egg production over the entire breeding season was found for the end-of-the-breeding-season observations. Diagnostic ultrasonography can thus be used as a management tool to identify reproductively healthy ostrich females and also females with a higher egg production potential over a period of 2 months after or prior to assessment. Future studies should focus on the development of the technique to predict reproductive performance over entire breeding seasons for selection purposes.","711":"The oedematous and traumatised protruding section of the rectal tissue of an adult free-ranging female African black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) was surgically amputated. Immediately before completion of surgery, the rhinoceros died of anaesthetic-related cardiac arrest. At necropsy a deformed pelvis and sacrum associated with a healed fracture of the left ileal wing were noted. New bone formation in and around the left ventral sacral foramina may have resulted in neuropathy of particularly the 3rd and 4th left ventral sacral nerves, which (in the horse) supply the majority of the nerve fibres innervating the caudal rectum and anus. The cause of the injury is not known, although back injuries, presumably sustained during mating by bulls, have been recorded in white rhinoceros. An encounter with elephants could also have been responsible for the injury in this case.","712":"Anaesthesia was required in a heavily-pregnant, adult, free-ranging African black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis with a rectal prolapse for examination and possible treatment. The animal was immobilised with 4.5 mg etorphine and 60 mg azaperone. For continued observation, the immobilised animal was transported to a boma. Additional etorphine and azaperone were administered to keep the animal anaesthetised during treatment and transport. In addition, 15 mg nalorphine was administered during this time to improve ventilation and reduce muscle rigidity. Sixty hours later, in preparation for surgery, 2.5 mg etorphine and 40 mg azaperone were administered, followed by endotracheal intubation and halothane anaesthesia. During anaesthesia, a decrease in tidal volume was observed. Venous blood-gas analysis indicated a decrease in the oxygen partial pressure, and a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Cardiac arrest was preceded by an increase in heart rate and tidal volume after 80 min of inhalation anaesthesia.","713":"Since the late 1980s a distinct form of focally-extensive mucoid to mucopurulent uterine body chronic placentitis,caused by nocardioform organisms, hasbeen recognised in horses in the USA state of Kentucky and possibly in other areas. This disease has led to increasing numbers of foal losses from late abortions, still-births, prematurity, or early neonatal deaths. The foals are usually not infected, but may be small or emaciated. Modes of infection and transmission are as yet unknown. Nocardia spp. and related nocardioform bacteria as causes of equine infertility, endometritis and foal death are briefly reviewed. A case of near full-term abortion involving a Friesian mare in the Pretoria district of Gauteng Province in South Africa during February 2000, with the same placental lesion as described in the Kentucky cases, is presented. Nocardioform organisms were visualised on impression smears and histological sections of affected foetal membranes, and were also cultured. The organism has been identified at the Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center of the University of Kentucky as an Amycolatopsis sp. of the less-commonly diagnosed group of nocardioforms causing placentitis in the USA. The organism was cultured from the uterus of the mare 18 days post-foaling, but after a 2-week course of oral trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole, based on antibiogram sensitivity testing, a uterine flush yielded no growth. A semen sample from the sire of the aborted foal did not yield any Gram-positive filamentous branching bacteria. The mare subsequently conceived to a single insemination.","714":"No sleeping sickness or nagana cases have been reported in Botswana since 1985. In view of several confirmed clinical cases of nagana and reports of heavy bovine mortality, a parasitological survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of trypanosome infection in cattle in Maun and Shakawe areas of Ngamiland district. Wet blood films, buffy coat and Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears were used to detect trypanosomes in animals. Overall,trypanosome infection rate was 15.98%, with 5.94% and 27.29% in Maun and Shakawe respectively. The urgent need to combat trypanosomosis in Ngamiland, particularly in the Shakawe area, is highlighted, and a 3-phase integrated tsetse control strategy for this disease problem is discussed.","715":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectivity of melatonin in addition to light treatment (exposure to 2 hours of light during the night = a long-day photoperiod) to modify the breeding season of Saanen and cross-bred milk goats and to compare the difference between the breeds. Twenty-two Saanen and 22 cross-bred does were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups. Group 1 (controls) received no treatment, Group 2 received light treatment for 37 days and Group 3 received light treatment plus melatonin implants after the light treatment. After a further 35 days the 3 groups were brought together and a billy goat that had also been exposed to the extra light at night, had received a melatonin implant and had been isolated from the does during the treatment period, was introduced to the does for natural mating. Ultrasound scanning was used to diagnose pregnancy and all the pregnant goats kidded. Significantly more Saanen does compared to cross-bred does (P = 0.018) became pregnant and kidded after natural mating, when the group that received melatonin as well as light treatment was compared to the group that received light treatment only. Compared to light treatment only, the addition of melatonin to light treatment improved (P = 0.0028) conception after natural mating, in both the Saanen and the cross-bred does.","716":"A shoe was designed to combine the advantages of a reverse shoe and an adjustable heart bar shoe in the treatment of chronic laminitis. This reverse even frog pressure (REFP) shoe applies pressure uniformly over a large area of the frog solar surface. Pressure is applied vertically upward parallel to the solar surface of the frog and can be increased or decreased as required. Five clinically healthy horses were humanely euthanased and their dismembered forelimbs used in an in vitro study. Frog pressure was measured by strain gauges applied to the ground surface of the carrying tab portion of the shoe. A linear variable distance transducer (LVDT) was inserted into a hole drilled in the dorsal hoof wall. The LVDT measured movement of the third phalanx (P3) in a dorsopalmar plane relative to the dorsal hoof wall. The vertical component of hoof wall compression was measured by means of unidirectional strain gauges attached to the toe, quarter and heel of the medial hoof wall of each specimen. The entire limb was mounted vertically in a tensile testing machine and submitted to vertical downward compressive forces of 0 to 2,500 N at a rate of 5 cm\/minute. The effects of increasing frog pressure on hoof wall weight-bearing and third phalanx movement within the hoof were determined. Each specimen was tested with the shoe under the following conditions: zero frog pressure; frog pressure used to treat clinical cases of chronic laminitis (7 N-cm); frog pressure clinically painful to the horse as determined prior to euthanasia; frog pressure just alleviating this pain. The specimens were also tested after shoe removal. Total weight-bearing on the hoof wall at zero frog pressure was used as the basis for comparison. Pain-causing and pain-alleviating frog pressures decreased total weight-bearing on the hoof wall (P &lt; 0.05). Frog pressure of 7 N-cm had no statistically significant effect on hoof wall weight-bearing although there was a trend for it to decrease as load increased. Before loading, the pain-causing and pain-alleviating frog pressures resulted in a palmar movement of P3 relative to the dorsal hoof wall compared to the position of P3 at zero frog pressure (P &lt; 0.05). This difference remained statistically significant up to 1300 N load. At higher loads, the position of P3 did not differ significantly for the different frog pressures applied. It is concluded that increased frogpressure using the REFP shoe decreases total hoof wall weight-bearing and causes palmar movement of P3 at low weight-bearing loads. Without a shoe the toe and quarter hoof wall compression remained more constant and less in magnitude, than with a shoe.","717":"In a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (4 mg\/kg) after intravenous premedication with or without midazolam (0.1 mg\/kg), in a group of 8 dogs scheduled for ovariohysterectomy. Midazolam administration induced acute behavioural changes, and increased reflex suppression after propofol induction. Compared to the control group, the dose required to obtain loss of the pedal reflex was significantly reduced by 37%, and the end-tidal isoflurane concentration during maintenance, reduced by 23%.","718":"Information on the socioeconomic aspects and the health status of dogs in 2 resource-limited communities in the North West and Gauteng provinces of South Africa was gathered using semi-structured interviews and a standardised questionnaire. The dogs were examined clinically to determine their health status, and their body condition and age were scored. Most of the dogs (93 % in Jericho and 90 % in Zuurbekom) were infected with hookworm, which poses a threat to animal and human health in the 2 study areas. Many dogs were also being given a protein-deficient diet, which together with hookworm parasites would impact considerably on the dog's health. Dogs were mainly kept for security reasons. The need indicated tobe most important by the residents of the 2 communities was a lack of available and affordable veterinary services.","719":"This study provides a reference for the radiographic anatomy of the thoraco-abdominal cavity of female ostriches as a representative of ratites. One ostrich cadaver, 2 adult and 2 growing ostriches were used. Right lateral radiographs produced by a 6-frame technique and 2 dorsoventral radiographs produced by an adapted 3-frame technique were selected and schematic illustrations of these were labelled to illustrate normal radiographic anatomy. Differences from other avian species and unique features of the ostrich are briefly discussed.","720":"Ostrich chick mortality was studied in 2522 chicks that were hatched artificially during the 1999\/2000 breeding season. High levels of mortality were observed, with 1978 (78.4 %) of these chicks dying before 90 days after hatching. A total of 46.7 % (1,177) of these chicks died before 28 days of age, and a further 30.7% (801) died between 28 and 90 days post-hatching. Chick mortality to 28 days of age could not be conclusively related to sex, day of external pipping or breeder diet. Mortality rates were higher (P&lt; 0.05) at the beginning and end of the breeding season than in the middle months. Differences in mortality levels of chicks incubated in different incubators could be related to the time of the breeding season during which the incubator was mostly used. The regression of chick mortality to 28 days of age on day-old chick mass followed a 2nd-degree polynomial. Chicks with day-old masses below 762.5 g were particularly at risk of dying before 28 days after hatching. Chicks hatching from eggs where excessive water loss to 35 days of incubation (&gt;18%) was recorded were also at risk of succumbing before 28 days of age. Chick mortality percentages for the period from 28 to 90 days of age exceeded 80 % in chicks weighing an average of 1.050 g at 28 days. Mortality percentages declined sharply at higher live masses, to between 20 and 30 % in chicks weighing &gt; or = 1,950 g. This 'core' level of mortality remained throughout, even in the heaviest chicks. It was concluded that the high levels of chick mortality could be related to stress in chicks, resulting from an inability to adapt to the rearing environment. The high subsequent mortality percentages of low live mass chicks that survived to 28 days after hatching could probably be attributed to residual setbacks suffered earlier. Abetter understanding of the underlying principles involved in ostrich chick mortality in intensive rearing environments is required for progress in this field, resulting in more predictable survival rates under these conditions.","721":"Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) methods were employed to document the use of ethnoveterinary medicinal plants in cattle by Setswana-speaking people in the Madikwe area of the North West Province of South Africa. The study indicated that Setswana-speaking people in the North West Province have a rich heritage of ethnoveterinary knowledge, which includes all aspects of ethnoveterinary medicinal plant use. Information was gathered from informants through individual interviews, group interviews, guided field walks and observations. Ethnoveterinary uses in cattle of 45 plant species representing 24 families were recorded. Plants were used in 84% of the total number of recorded ethnoveterinary remedies. These plants were used alone (64%) or in mixtures (36%) for 29 indications. The most important indications were retained placenta, diarrhoea, gallsickness, fractures, eye inflammation, general ailments, fertility enhancement, general gastrointestinal problems, heartwater, internal parasites, coughing, redwater and reduction of tick burden. Plant materials were prepared in various ways including infusion, decoction, ground fresh material, sap expressed from fresh material, charred and dried. The most common dosage form was a liquid for oral dosing. Other dosage forms included drops, licks, ointments, lotions and powders. Liquid remedies for oral dosing were always administered using a bottle. Medicinal plant material was preferably stored in a dried form in a cool place out of direct sunlight and wind. Lack of transfer of ethnoveterinary knowledge to younger generations puts this knowledge at risk. RRA was found to be a successful method of investigation for the study of ethnoveterinary medicine.","722":"The efficacy of a molybdate formulation and a zinc oxide bolus as prophylactic agents for enzootic icterus was evaluated in sheep. Before copper loading, liver biopsies were performed on 12 male, 6-month-old, Mutton Merino sheep to determine hepatic copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations. The animals were restrictively randomised according to liver copper concentrations to 3 treatment groups (n = 4) to achieve similar mean liver copper concentrations per group. All sheep received 4 ml\/kg of a 0.5 % aqueous solution of CuSO4 5H2O intraruminally 7 days per week for 10 weeks. On Day 0 the sheep in the Mo-group were injected subcutaneously with 42 mg molybdenum (Mo) contained in a commercial molybdate formulation. The animals in the Zn-group each received a zinc oxide bolus, containing 43 g zinc oxide, via a rumen cannula. Treatment was repeated on Day 42. Four animals served as untreated controls. Urinary copper excretion, plasma copper concentration, haematocrit and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) activity were determined throughout the trial. The animals were sacrificed after 10 weeks and liver samples were submitted for histopathological examination. Liver and kidney copper and zinc concentrations were determined. Neither the molybdate treatment nor the zinc oxide boluses prevented hepatic copper accumulation. The urinary copper excretion, plasma copper concentration, haematocrit and GLDH activity were not significantly different (P &gt; 0.05) from the controls.","723":"","724":"Wild dogs Lycaon pictuis (n = 8) were vaccinated 4 times against canine distemper (n = 8) (initially with inactivated and subsequently with live attenuated strains of canine distemper) and canine parvovirus infection (n = 8) over a period of 360 days. Four of the wild dogs were also vaccinated 3 times against rabies using a live oral vaccine and 4 with an inactivated parenteral vaccine. Commercially-available canine distemper, canine parvovirus and parenteral rabies vaccines, intended for use in domestic dogs, were used. None of the vaccinated dogs showed any untoward clinical signs. The inactivated canine distemper vaccine did not result in seroconversion whereas the attenuated live vaccine resulted in seroconversion in all wild dogs. Presumably protective concentrations of antibodies to canine distemper virus were present in all wild dogs for at least 451 days. Canine parvovirus haemagglutination inhibition titres were present in all wild dogs prior to the administration of vaccine and protective concentrations persisted for at least 451 days. Vaccination against parvovirus infection resulted in a temporary increase in canine parvovirus haemagglutination inhibition titres in most dogs. Administration of both inactivated parenteral and live oral rabies vaccine initially resulted in seroconversion in 7 of 8 dogs. These titres, however, dropped to very low concentrations within 100 days. Booster administrations resulted in increased antibody concentrations in all dogs. It was concluded that the vaccines were safe to use in healthy subadult wild dogs and that a vaccination protocol in free-ranging wild dogs should at least incorporate booster vaccinations against rabies 3-6 months after the first inoculation.","725":"An 8-week-old piglet with dyspnoea, bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge and mouth breathing was euthanased and a necropsy was performed. Apart from histological evidence of diffuse rhinitis, large intranuclear inclusion bodies, pathognomonic forporcine cytomegalovirus infection, were detected within mucous glands on the nasal turbinates. This is the first such case to be diagnosed in South Africa.","726":"Resistance to natural infections of Haemonchus contortus (wireworm) was studied in Merino sheep. From February 1995 to July 1996 data were collected from the OTK Merino Stud on the farm Wildebeesfontein near Hendrina in Mpumalanga province. From March 1998 to January 2000 another Merino flock at Irene in Gauteng province was included in the study. In both cases, 50 randomly-chosen animals from each group of lambs weaned were sampled weekly for faecal egg count (FEC) until a mean of 2500 eggs per gram faeces (epg) was reached. At this stage, all lambs in the group were sampled for FEC, packed cell volume (PCV) and live mass in the case of the Wildebeesfontein flock. Animals were monitored from weaning to about 1 year of age. Data from 5 different groups of lambs (583 animals and 1722 records in total) with genetic links were accumulated and analysed. Variance components and resulting heritabilities for logFEC and PCV were estimated using a bivariate animal model with repeated records. The estimated heritabilities were 0.24 +\/- 0.02 for logFEC and 0.14 +\/- 0.02 for PCV. A strong negative correlation (-0.84 +\/- 0.06) existed between the 2 traits. The genetic correlation between PCV and live mass for the Wildebeesfontein flock was low (0.28 +\/- 0.09), while that between logFEC and live mass was negative, although not significantly different from zero (-0.13 +\/- 0.09). These results suggest that FEC can be used as a selection criterion for resistance to H. contortus infections in Merino sheep.","727":"A 16-day-old white rhinoceros calf died suddenly while in excellent condition and showing no obvious previous clinical signs. It was the 9th calf of a mature female kept free-ranging with 11 other rhinoceros as well as various other game species on a 2000 hectare game breeding centre adjacent to the town of Lichtenburg and outlying cattle farmlands in the Northern Province. At post mortem examination, death was ascribed to heart failure. There was marked multifocal to coalescing subacute parasitic myocarditis with numerous protozoan bradyzoite cysts and free tachyzoites present amongst the predominantly round cell inflammatory infiltrate. The coccidian was positively identified as Neospora sp. using both polyclonal and murine monoclonal Neospora caninum antibody immunohistochemistry in the avidin-biotin technique. The parasites stained poorly with Toxoplasma gondii-specific immunoperoxidase staining. Ultrastructurally, a section of a bradyzoite-containing cyst, as well as tachyzoites, were largely but not totally consistent with those described for Neospora caninum. The dam showed no sign of illness. Neosporosis affecting white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) has not previously been reported. A summarised overview of neosporosis from selected publications and a recent review is given.","728":"An epidemiological survey undertaken in Kenya indicated that 2 previously well-established factors, namely decline in reproductive efficiency with age, and non-seasonality of canine reproductive parameters, hold true for German shepherd (GSD) bitches in Kenya. Data collection forms were distributed to randomly selected GSD breeders and information so obtained was verified using East African Kennel Club records. Whelping was recorded throughout the year. The litter size varied from 1 to 14 pups per litter with a mean of 6.3 +\/- 0.4 SD puppies. Records of 567 whelpings and 3592 puppies were studied. The mean monthly whelping rate was 47.3 +\/- 7.2. There was no significant difference in the mean litter size by month (P &lt; 0.05).","729":"Biological control of parasitic nematodes of livestock is currently under development and represents another tool that may be integrated into helminth parasite control strategies. This paper presents a brief introduction to commercial sheep farming in South Africa and currently available nematode parasite control methods. These include the FAMACHA clinical assay, strategies of pasture management, dilution of resistant worm species by introduction of susceptible worms, breed resistant sheep and nutritional supplementation. The purpose of this paper is to outline the principles of biological control using nematophagous fungi and how it may be applied on sheep farms in South Africa.","730":"Indigenous goats belonging to small-scale farmers in 4 communal grazing areas in South Africa were sampled for ixodid ticks during the period September 1991 to May 1993. Three of these areas were in the North West Province (Rietgat, Madinyane and Bethany), and one in Mpumalanga Province (Geluk). No tick control was practised unless requested by the owners. Seven ixodid tick species, of which the majority were immature ticks, were collected from the goats in North West Province. Amblyomma hebraeum was the most numerous of these, followed by Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Substantially more ticks were collected from goats at Rietgat than at the Madinyane and Bethany grazing areas. Five tick species were collected at Geluk and R. evertsi evertsi comprised more than 95 % of the total population. At Rietgat and Geluk A. hebraeum nymphs were present on goats throughout the year, while most R appendiculatus nymphs were collected during September and October 1991 and most adults during January and February 1992. At both Rietgat and Geluk most immature R. evertsi evertsi were collected from spring to late summer, while adults were present throughout the year.","731":"During October 1998 a study was performed in the Caledon area to determine the presence of anthelmintic resistance in the southern Western Cape, which falls within the winter rainfall region of South Africa. The study took the form of an undifferentiated faecal egg count reduction test (FECRt) survey. The predominant worm genera of the region are Teladorsagia and Trichostrongylus, but Haemonchus causes occasional outbreaks in sheep. No resistance data for any area in the Western Cape Province are available at present. Resistance (&lt; 90% FECR) was recorded on 73% of the farms included in the study, with 46% of these involving resistance to 1 drench, 36% to 2 drenches and 18% to 3 drenches. No moxidectin resistance was detected when it was administered at the therapeutic dosage of 0.2 mg\/kg. The results of this study show clearly that resistance of nematodes to other anthelmintics occurs in the Caledon area.","732":"","733":"","734":"The organic component of the avian eggshell can be divided into 3 portions, the shell membranes, the matrix and the cuticle. These have been well characterised in the chicken but little has been published with regard to the ostrich (Struthio camelus). A number of recent studies have indicated that the cause of intra-shell embryonic deaths in the ostrich is similar to intra-shell embryonic deaths that occur in the chicken. These deaths in the chicken are associated with the loss of or damage to the waxy cuticle and other organic components of the eggshell, which is reported to be absent in the ostrich eggshell. In this study, preliminary morphological and histochemical analyses, at the level of the light and electron microscope, have characterised the various organic components of the ostrich eggshell. The results of the histochemical and electron microscopical analyses suggest that there may only be 1 shell membrane in this species, which could play a major role in the limitation of bacterial penetration to the embryonic chamber The shell membrane has a distinct elemental profile as determined by EDS analysis. The matrix is shown to decrease in mesh size from the mammillary layer to the vertical crystal layer. The closer packing of the mesh may indicate the presence of a morphologically discernible termination signal to calcification or the remnants of an evolutionary calcified cuticle. The matrix of the pores may also form a defensive barrier against bacterial invasion, which could be damaged as a result of dipping the eggs before incubation.","735":"Nitrite poisoning in pigs was suspected when 4 of 18 pigs died in a piggery near Ellisras in the Northern Province. The pigs showed typical brownish discolouration of the blood at autopsy. It was established that they ingested vegetable tops and weeds from the adjacent garden as part of their daily ration. Of the available plants, only Capsella bursa-pastoris contained nitrites. The drinking water and some of the other plants tested positive for nitrates but not for nitrites. This is the first report of suspected nitrite poisoning in pigs caused by Capsella bursa-pastoris.","736":"The syndrome delusions of parasitosis (DP) constitutes a psychiatric disorder of humans in which patients falsely believe that they are infested with parasites. This report describes 2 cases of DP observed at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital (OVAH). The first case involved a 34-year old, single female, who believed that she and her three cats were being parasitised by insects of unknown origin. Before referral to the OVAH, she had taken her cats to 2 other veterinarians and had consulted 2 dermatologists herself. The second case was a single male who believed that he was being parasitised by insects originating from his cat. A full diagnostic evaluation performed on all 4 cats failed to reveal any dermatological abnormalities. No parasites were seen or cultured from any of the cats.","737":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the perineal region of goats is described for the first time in Botswana. The tumour was irregularly shaped, cauliflower-like and ulcerated. The exposed surface had an unpleasant smell and was covered by a black keratinous exudate. Histopathologically the lesions were compatible with previous descriptions.","738":"Horses on several farms in Mozambique were inadvertently fed with a concentrate containing 69 ppm monensin. The horses developed acute signs of toxicity and several died. The animals were depressed, anorectic and paretic before death. Epistaxis was observed in 1 case. Petechial haemorrhages were present in the muscles, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and spleen in 3 horses necropsied. No significant histopathological cardiac and skeletal muscle lesions were seen, except in 1 case, in which there was focal loss of myofibrils.","739":"This study was designed to document the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in dogs with complicated babesiosis, and to assess their impact on outcome. Ninety-one cases were evaluated retrospectively for SIRS and 56 for MODS. The liver, kidneys, lungs, central nervous system and musculature were assessed. Eighty-seven percent of cases were SIRS-positive. Fifty-two percent of the cases assessed for organ damage had single-organ damage and 48 % had MODS. Outcome was not significantly affected by either SIRS or MODS, but involvement of specific organs had a profound effect. Central nervous system involvement resulted in a 57 times greater chance of death and renal involvement in a 5-fold increased risk compared to all other complications. Lung involvement could not be statistically evaluated owing to co-linearity with other organs, but was associated with high mortality. Liver and muscle damage were common, but did not significantly affect outcome. There are many similarities between the observations in this study and previous human and animal studies in related fields, lending additional support to the body of evidence for shared underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in systemic inflammatory states.","740":"While particular attention is paid to the nature and content of anatomy curricula, little has been published about the actual problem topics\/concepts experienced by students of anatomy. This information is relevant to modifying existing courses and methods of teaching. The present study thus sought to identify, by means of a questionnaire administered to students of veterinary anatomy, perceived problem topics, the possible reasons for the problems, as well as student suggestions for solving the problems. A wide range of problem topics was identified by this survey, of which neuroanatomy, neurohistology and organogenesis recurred most frequently. A major reason given for the problems experienced was an inability to conceptualise 3-dimensional structures. Students requested more time, more lectures and appealed for a reduction in detail of textual information. Many of the problems experienced by this group of students are reflected in other studies of veterinary, medical and dental students, which suggests the existence of 'universal' problem topics in the various fields of anatomy. We believe that these universal problem topics exist in many anatomy courses, despite the application of innovative teaching methods and advanced audio-visual technologies. Only by identifying these topics can suitable strategies (within the constraints of the particular curriculum) be devised to resolve them.","741":"A 15-year retrospective study was performed to determine the role of parasitic diseases in causing mortalities in small ruminants. In total, 115 (32 %) sheep were diagnosed as having been killed by parasitic diseases out of 366 that died as a result of disease. The major cause of mortality was helminthosis (63 % of all parasitic cases). Most of the helminthosis cases were attributed to haemonchosis (40% of parasitic cases). Heartwater was the second most important parasitic disease (27% of all parasitic cases). Ninety-five (26%) goats were diagnosed to have been killed by parasitic diseases out of 365 cases presented at the post mortem facility. Helminthosis was the most frequent cause of mortality (55% of the total parasitic diseases). Twenty-six goats were killed by haemonchosis (27% of all parasitic diseases). Heartwater was the second most important parasitic disease, accounting for about 20% of all parasitic diseases. These findings indicate that viable helminth and tick control strategies should be devised in order to reduce mortality caused by helminthosis and heartwater and thereby achieve improved productivity.","742":"The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of application site and sheep breed on the efficacy of a flumethrin (1% m\/v) solution for the control of 'bont'-legged (Hyalomma spp.) and red-legged ticks (Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi). This study was conducted from November 1996 to February 1997 on 3 farms in the southwestern Free State Province. Two trials were conducted on Dorper sheep and 2 on Merino sheep. For each specific application 30 sheep were selected and allocated to 3 groups of 10 animals each using randomisation through minimisation, with pre-treatment total tick count as only criterion. Groups consisted of an untreated control group, a group treated with 3 ml of a flumethrin (1% m\/v) solution applied only to the anogenital region, and a group treated at a dose rate of 1 mf flumethrin (1% m\/v)\/5 kg host body mass. The total dose volume for animals in the last group was divided into 3 equal parts and applied to the brisket\/axillae, groin and anogenital regions respectively. Animals grazed under extensive farming conditions and were infested by ticks that occurred naturally in the environment. Ticks were counted and removed weekly over a 6-week period. In all 4 trials, Rhipicephalus e. evertsi was the dominant tick species, followed, in 3 of the trials, by Hyalomma spp. Efficacy (%) of control against ticks for Dorper sheep, treated only on the anogenital region, was variable, ranging between 29.5 and 97%. In Merino sheep the efficacy values ranged between 23.1 and 90 %. The site-spcific (anogenital region) efficacy of control against ticks infesting Merino sheep was in general 100% or almost 100%. In Dorper sheep the efficacy values were &gt;80 % for 3-5 weeks. The efficacy (%) of control against ticks for sheep treated on the brisket\/axillae, groin and anogenital regions was always higher compared to sheep treated only on the anogenital region. In Dorper sheep, efficacy of control was &gt;80 % for up to 4 weeks and in Merino sheep &gt;80 % for 6 weeks.","743":"The physiological effects on respiratory function of etorphine (M99, Logos Agvet) (30 microg\/kg) administered intramuscularly were determined in boer goats. The goats were habituated to the experimental procedures so that respiratory function could be determined while the animals stood quietly at rest. This enabled the physiological changes induced by etorphine to be measured and compared with those obtained before administration of the immobilising drug. The effectiveness of diprenorphine (M5050, Logos Agvet) (3 mg\/l mg etorphine) as an antagonist of the physiological changes induced by the etorphine treatment was also determined. Etorphine depressed respiratory function, which resulted in a decrease in PaO2 and an increase in PaCO2. These changes were limited and occurred as a result of decreases in respiratory minute volume and alveolar minute ventilation caused by a decrease in respiratory rate. The physiological shunt fraction did not change significantly but there was a significant decrease in percentage physiological dead space ventilation. It was not possible to determine how effectively diprenorphine reversed the respiratory effects due to etorphine.","744":"Canine distemper virus is a member of the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae that causes severe disease in dogs and a range of wild mammals. The clinical signs relate essentially to the respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. In South Africa, infection with Ehrlichia canis and canine parvovirus may present similarly Many dogs will initially present with a wide range of central nervous system signs without any history of systemic disease. A recent South African study evaluating ante mortem diagnosis highlighted the importance of recognising clinical signs, cerebrospinal fluid IgG titres, serum IgM titres and immunocytochemistry of epithelial tissue. A 2-year retrospective evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from dogs presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital indicates that distemper infection is common, and this disease should routinely be suspected in cases of diverse neurological disease in dogs. The South African dog population is specifically at high risk for the disease because of the large pool of unvaccinated, reproductively-active dogs that expose the wildlife resources of the country to risk of fatal disease. Outbreaks of disease in dogs continue to occur in developed and developing communities in both vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs worldwide, and have also been described in a wide range of free-ranging wildlife, including seals, dolphins and lions, and in endangered zoo animals. Modified live virus vaccines have contributed markedly to disease control in the dog population but have caused mortality in some wild carnivores. New recombinant vaccines are being developed that will be safe in wild animals. The pathogenesis of CNS demyelination has been compared to various important demyelinating diseases in humans and, amongst other things, relates to down-regulation of the oligodendrocyte gene coding for myelin synthesis and non-immunocyte CNS cell expression of type II major histocompatibility receptors. Early CNS lesions are characterised by demyelination and later lesions by perivascular round cell cuffing. Treatment is supportive.","745":"The Veterinary Pharmacovigilance Centre received 59 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions during the period January 1998 - February 2001. The number of reports received increased after the establishment of a formal procedure for recording and responding to reports. The number of reports received per species was: dogs 19, cats 15, cattle 7, sheep\/ goats 6, chickens 4, pigs 3, horses 2 and giraffe 1. Many different types of adverse reactions were reported, including lack of efficacy, hypersensitivity, inappropriate use of products by non-veterinarians, known adverse effects and adverse effects encountered with extra-label use of products.","746":"","747":"According to a survey, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents were the most popular analgesic used in South Africa for management of peri-operative pain, acute post-operative pain and chronic pain. The most popular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone. The most popular opioid type drug is buprenorphine, followed by morphine. In the peri-operative setting, analgesic agents were not actively administered to 86.3% of cats and 80.7% of dogs. Analgesic premedications were frequently administered, e.g. xylazine or ketamine, but no specific drug was administered for post-operative pain. Veterinarians need to critically review their anaesthetic and analgesic practices in order to achieve balanced anaesthesia.","748":"Failure of penile protrusion during attempted service of a cow on heat was investigated in a 3-year-old Brahman bull at Kwakwadi cattle-post in the Kgalahadi sandveld, Kweneng District, Botswana. The investigation revealed that penile protrusion was obstructed by a devil's claw (grapple thorn), a dry fruit of the plant Harpagophytum procumbens, which had lodged in the cavum preputiale. The thorn, which was removed almost completely manually with minimal tissue dissection, had also caused minor lacerations and puncture wounds on the lamina interna pars parietalis. The wounds healed well following treatment with antiseptics and antibiotics and subsequently the bull regained full penile protrusion and served the cows well. This report describes the first case of lodgement of a devil's claw fruit in, and its extraction from, the cavum preputiale of a Brahman.","749":"Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) may be primary or secondary. In primary IMHA, no underlying cause can be found, whereas secondary IMHA is triggered by an underlying cause, such as neoplasia, infectious diseases, or drugs. This paper describes 3 dogs with typical signs of IMHA that was possibly associated with the intestinal parasite Ancylostoma caninum. As intestinal helminths can be difficult to diagnose on faecal examination, it would be pertinent to perform multiple faecal examinations on any animal that has IMHA with no apparent underlying cause, as part of the therapy.","750":"A young adult boxer dog was examined for a painless swelling in the left cranial cervical area that was refractory to antibiotic therapy. Ultrasound examination revealed a hypoechoic mass abutting the rostrolateral aspect of the left mandibular salivary gland. The cystic mass was excised and was found to extend through the capsule of the salivary gland and appeared to be confluent with the glandular tissue at this point. Histopathological examination of the excised tissue demonstrated tissue from all 3 germinal layers. There was no indication of malignancy and the mass was diagnosed as a benign cervical teratoma. Hypotheses regarding the origin of teratomas in general are discussed and the origin of the teratoma in this case is suggested.","751":"Biochemical and qualitative evaluation of the supernatant of urine from hydrated farmed ostriches (Struthio camelus) indicated that the urine was comparable to that described by other workers. The disparities obtained between the biochemical constituents in the present and previous studies were partly attributed to the state of hydration influenced by climatic factors. Results of the cytological examination of the supernatant and the sediment concurred with the observations of other workers. It was therefore concluded that parameters from both the quantitative and qualitative analyses could be used as a guideline to monitor the health status of farmed ostriches in Botswana.","752":"An aqueous emulsion of amitraz (Bovitraz, Bayer AH), prepared and applied according to the manufacturer's recommendations, was evaluated for its activity against cattle ticks on a dairy farm in Ethiopia. Eight crossbred heifer calves aged between 6 and 8 months and heavily infested with ticks were selected and divided into equal treatment and control groups. The calves in the treatment group were hand-sprayed with the amitraz emulsion while the control group was left untreated. Each calf was restrained and ticks were counted and identified in situ. One hundred percent tick control was achieved on Day 3 after acaricide application, and this was maintained for a further 18 days. The residual effect was long, and protected the animals from re-infestation for 21 days. There was a significant difference between the mean number of ticks on the control group compared to the treated group (P &lt; 0.05). An important finding in this trial was the rapid detachment of all tick instars from animals treated with the test acaricide.","753":"Fifty-six cats with naturally occurring Babesia felis infection were studied. No breed or sex predilection could be identified, but there was an apparent predilection for young adult cats less than 3 years of age. Macrocytic, hypochromic, regenerative anaemia was present in 57% of the cats and in-saline agglutination tests were positive in 16%. No characteristic changes were observed in total or differential leukocyte counts. Thrombocyte counts were variable and thrombocytopaenia was an inconsistent finding. Hepatic cytosol enzyme activity and total bilirubin concentrations were elevated in the majority of cats. Serum protein values were mostly normal, but increased values were occasionally observed and polyclonal gammopathies were observed in all cats with increased total globulin concentrations. No remarkable changes in renal parameters were observed. A variety of electrolyte abnormalities occurred in a number of cats, but no consistent pattern of change could be identified. A close correlation was evident between peripheral and central parasite counts. Concurrent infections with Haemobartonella felis, feline immunodeficiency virus and\/or feline leukemia virus were identified in a number of cats.","754":"Structured interviews using a questionnaire were conducted to gather information on socioeconomic aspects, health, nutrition, breeding and management of working equids in 3 study areas of Moretele 1 near Hammanskraal, North West Province, South Africa. The questionnaire addressed questions about the role of animals with a focus on donkeys used for work in these areas. Extension and animal health officers and donkey owners participated. The analysis highlights the use of donkeys for transport of water, wood and people; that ticks, wounds and harness sores are the conditions reported most frequently by owners; and that the range for the body condition score index of 2.7-4.0 suggests that an overall adequate level of nutrition and management is maintained in the donkeys in these villages.","755":"Midazolam was administered intravenously to 8 bitches in a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial before propofol induction of surgical anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane-in-oxygen during surgical endoscopic examination of the uterus and ovariohysterectomy. Clenbuterol was administered at the start of surgery to improve uterine muscle relaxation, and to facilitate endoscopic examination of the uterus. Ventilation was controlled. Induction of anaesthesia with propofol to obtain loss of the pedal reflex resulted in a statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in minute volume and arterial oxygen partial pressure in the midazolam group. Apnoea also occurred in 50% of dogs in the midazolam group. The dose for propofol in the midazolam group was 7.4 mg\/kg compared to 9.5 mg\/kg in the control. Minute volume was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in both groups during isoflurane maintenance, compared to the value after incremental propofol to obtain loss of the pedal reflex. Propofol induction resulted in a 25-26% reduction in the mean arterial blood pressure in both groups, and the administration of clenbuterol at the start of surgery resulted in a transient, but statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), decrease in mean arterial blood pressure in the midazolam group during isoflurane anaesthesia. It is concluded that intravenous midazolam premedication did not adversely affect cardiovascular function during propofol induction, but intra-operative clenbuterol during isoflurane maintenance of anaesthesia may result in transient hypotension. Midazolam premedication may increase adverse respiratory effects when administered before propofol induction of anaesthesia.","756":"","757":"A dose range was determined for anaesthesia of 20 recently boma-captured roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) with the synthetic opiate A3080 combined with medetomidine and ketamine. A dose of 10-30 micro\/kg A3080 (x = 20+\/-8 microg\/kg) combined with 5-21 microg\/kg medetomidine (x = 13+\/-7 microg\/kg) plus 0.29-1.11 mg\/kg ketamine (x = 0.71+\/-0.24 mg\/kg) was found to be safe and effective for the field conditions in this study. The anaesthesia produced by this drug combination was predictable and characterised by a short induction time, good muscle relaxation, and acceptable physiological parameters for anaesthesia periods ranging from 49-103 min (x = 64+\/-19 min). The wide range (3-4-fold) of doses with acceptable results is also an indication that this drug combination has a wide margin of safety in roan antelope, making it desirable for field use. When 2 dose levels (2-3-fold dif ference) were retrospectively evaluated, no statistical difference was found in induction times, and no observable clinical differences in the anaesthetic episodes were seen. Based on this study, the recommended dose range in roan antelope for this combination is 10-13 microg\/kg A3080, 5-6 microg\/kg medetomidine and 0.3-0.6 mg\/kg ketamine. The anaesthesia produced by this combination was rapidly and completely reversed by i.m. or i.v. injections of naltrexone at 30 times the A3080 dose (x = 0.60+\/-0.25 mg\/kg) and atipamezole at 3 times the medetomidine dose (x = 38+\/-20 microg\/kg). No residual effects from ketamine were noted following reversal of A3080 and medetomidine. No mortality was associated with this protocol.","758":"Proteinuria, and renal tubular casts and epithelial cells in urine sediment, are commonly observed in both complicated and uncomplicated babesiosis, but do not necessarily reflect or predict renal failure. This study investigated the presence and degree of renal damage in canine babesiosis. Renal function and integrity were evaluated using serum urea and creatinine, serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium), fractional clearance of sodium (FcNa) and potassium (FcK), urine enzyme activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase, urine protein:creatinine ratio, and urinalysis. One control group (n = 10) and 3 groups of babesiosis cases were studied: mild uncomplicated (n = 10), severe uncomplicated (n = 11), and complicated (n = 9). All babesiosis groups showed well-concentrated urine. Mean serum urea was elevated in the severe and complicated groups, and was significantly different from the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for creatinine, although the complicated group had a mean value above the normal reference range. Hypokalaemia was uncommon in all the groups. Hyperkalaemia was present in only 2 dogs in the complicated group. Marginal hyponatraemia was present in a minority of dogs in all groups. The serum electrolytes were not significantly different between groups. There was no overall elevation, nor any statistically significant difference in both the FcNa and FcK between the groups. Only 1 dog, in the complicated group, showed marked enzymuria. Proteinuria was a common finding and was significantly different between the severe and complicated groups and the control group. Some dogs in all groups had renal tubular epithelial cells in the urinary sediment, which increased in severity from the mild to the complicated groups and was significantly different from the control group. This study demonstrated that minimal renal damage occurs more often in canine babesiosis than significant damage or acute renal failure.","759":"","760":"Genetic variation at 7 blood-group and 10 biochemical genetic loci was examined in 30 horses from a feral herd from the Namib Desert of Namibia, Africa. The observed genetic variability was extremely low compared with that found in domestic horse breeds. The low variation was most probably a result of recent small population size and a small founding population size. Genetic comparison of the Namib horses, which were of unknown origins, to domestic horse breeds, showed that the Namib horses had the highest genetic similarity to Arabian type horses, although they did not closely resemble this type of horse in conformation.","761":"The most useful diagnostic methods in the initial evaluation of horses with colic assess the morphological and functional status of the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular status. This evaluation is best achieved using a combination of clinical and laboratory data. Blood lactate concentration (BL) is one of these variables. BL rises mainly due to poor tissue perfusion and anaerobic glycolysis associated with shock, providing an indicator of both the severity of disease and its prognosis. A hand-held lactate meter, Accusport, provides a rapid (60 seconds), inexpensive dry-chemical-based determination of BL. This trial evaluated the Accusport's ability to provide BL data as an adjunct to the initial clinical evaluation of horses with colic. The accuracy of the Accusport was tested by evaluation of its interchangeability with the benchmark enzymatic kit evaluation of BL in a trial using data collected firstly from 10 clinically normal control horses and subsequently from 48 horses presented with signs of colic. The BL values were recorded together with the clinical variables of heart rate (HR), capillary refill time (CRT), haematocrit (Hct), and pain character and severity on the initial assessment of the colic horses. Information regarding choice of therapeutic management (medical or surgical) and eventual case outcome (full recovery or died\/euthanased) was recorded. The Accusport was found to be interchangeable with the enzymatic kit for recording BL values in colic horses with BL &lt; 10 mmol\/l, which is within the BL range associated with survival. The interchangeability of an additional, laboratory-based wet chemical assay for BL, the Stat 7 was simultaneously evaluated for the colic and control horses. The Stat 7 was found to be interchangeable with the enzymatic kit for BL determination of colic horses. No linear associations between BL values with HR, CRT, Hct or pain assessment were observed. No relationship with either selection of therapeutic method or eventual case outcome was observed. All horses with BL &gt;8 mmol\/l died or were euthanased.","762":"Disseminated mycosis caused by Paecilomyces varioti in a female German shepherd dog presented with chronic forelimb lameness is described. Radiographs of the swollen carpal joint revealed geographic lysis of the radial epiphysis. Diagnosis was based on cytological demonstration of fungal hyphae and chlamydiospores, as well as fungal culture of fluid obtained by arthrocentesis. Temporary remission was characterised by markedly improved clinical signs and laboratory parameters, following treatment with ketoconazole. The dog was euthanased 9 months after the initial diagnosis, following the diagnosis of multifocal discospondylitis. This appears to be the longest described period of temporary remission obtained with treatment in dogs with paecilomycosis. Clinical, clinicopathological and necropsy findings of this disease in another German shepherd dog are briefly described.","763":"Six hundred and thirty clinically-normal milk samples from dairy goat flocks comprising a mixed population of German Alpine, Toggenburg, Saanen and Galla crosses were examined over a 3-month period to determine the prevalence of bacterial organisms. Bacteria were isolated in 28.7% of the milk samples (181\/630) either singly (92.8%) or in combination (7.2%). The most prevalent bacterial organisms were Staphylococcus spp. (60.3%), followed by Micrococcus spp. (17.7%), Acinetobacter spp. (5%), Actinomyces spp. (5%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.1%). The Staphylococcus spp. were mainly coagulase negative (64.3%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci accounted for 37.5% and 22.7% respectively of the total bacteria isolated. The isolation of bacteria, some of which are important in clinical and subclinical mastitis, in apparently normal caprine milk, indicates that particular attention should be given to the management of these dairy goat flocks in order to avoid the development of cases of clinical mastitis.","764":"A 4-month-old German shepherd puppy developed hindquarter weakness after vaccination with a multivalent vaccine. This is suggestive of post-vaccinal polyradiculoneuritis. To date, only 1 similar case has been reported, which may be due to the under-reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions.","765":"Haemophilus somnus was consistently isolated from vaginal discharges of dairy cows submitted from field cases of vaginitis, cervicitis and\/or metritis in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands during the period July 1995 - December 2000 and from the East Griqualand area in November\/December 2000. The purulent vaginal discharges, red granular vaginitis and cervicitis, and pain on palpation described in these cases was very similar to that reported in outbreaks of H.somnus endometritis syndrome in Australia, Europe and North America. In all the herds involved in these outbreaks, natural breeding with bulls was employed. Although there was a good cure rate in clinically-affected animals treated with tetracyclines, culling rates for chronic infertility were unacceptably high. Employment of artificial insemination in these herds improved pregnancy rates in cows that had calved previously, but many cows that had formerly been infected failed to conceive.","766":"Rabies isolates that had been stored between 1983 and 1997 were examined with a panel of anti-lyssavirus nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies. Out of 56 isolates from cats and various wild carnivore species, 1 isolate of Mokola virus and 5 other non-typical rabies viruses were identified. The Mokola virus isolate was diagnosed as rabies in 1993 from a cat. Genetic analysis of this isolate suggests that it falls in a distinct subgroup of the Mokola virus genotype. The 5 non-typical rabies viruses were isolated from honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), African civets (Civettictis civetta) and an unidentified mongoose (Herpestidae). These isolates are representatives of rarely-reported wildlife-associated strains of rabies, probably maintained by the slender mongoose (Galerella sanguinea). These findings indicate that both Mokola virus and the mongoose-associated variant may be more common in Zimbabwe than is apparent from routine surveillance.","767":"The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of romifidine alone (50 microg\/kg) and a combination of romifidine (50 microg\/kg) and ketamine (2.5 mg\/kg) after intrathecal administration in goats. Ten adult goats of either sex weighing between 15 and 20 kg were randomly placed in 2 groups (groups I and II). The agents were administered at the lumbosacral subarachnoid space. Clinico-physiological parameters such as analgesia, motor incoordination, sedation, salivation, heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial pressure, central venous pressure and rectal temperature were studied. Other haematobiochemical parameters monitored were packed cell volume, haemoglobin, plasma proteins, glucose, urea and creatinine. The onset of analgesia was faster in group II (35.5 +\/- 6.25 s) compared to that of group I (5.2 +\/- 0.54 min). Analgesia of the tail, perineum, hind limbs, flank and thorax was mild to moderate in group I, but complete analgesia of tail, perineum and hind limbs was recorded in group II. Motor incoordination was mild in group I and severe in group II. Significant reduction in heart rate (more pronounced in group I) and respiratory rate (more pronounced in group II), and a significant increase in central venous pressure were recorded in both groups. Mean arterial pressure was reduced in both groups, but more markedly in group I. Sedation, electrocardiogram, rectal temperature and haemato-biochemical parameters did not show significant differences between the 2 groups. The results of this study indicated a possible synergistic analgesic interaction between intrathecally administered romifidine and ketamine, without causing any marked systemic effects in goats.","768":"An effective anaesthesia protocol was developed for adult free-ranging gemsbok (Oryx gazella) using a combination of A3080, medetomidine and ketamine. A short induction time; good muscle relaxation, adequate oxygenation and stable heart rate and respiration rate characterised this anaesthetic regime. Equal doses of A3080 and medetomidine (22-45 microg\/kg) plus 200 mg of ketamine were administered to each animal. The anaesthesia was rapidly and completely reversed by intramuscular naltrexone at a dose of X = 0.9 +\/- 0.2 mg\/kg and atipamezole at a dose X +\/- 90 +\/- 20 microg\/kg. No mortality or morbidity occurred with this protocol.","769":"The effects of anionic salts in the transition diet on serum and urine calcium at calving and on peripartal health, subsequent milk production and fertility performance were studied in a well-managed, high-producing Friesland dairy herd. Over a period of a year, approximately 21 days before the expected date of calving, 28 pre-partum heifers and 44 multiparous dry cows were randomly allocated within parity to 1 of 2 transition diets, designated control and experimental anionic diets. The anionic diet contained the same quantities of the basic transition ration fed to the control group as well as a standard anionic salt mixture containing 118 g NH4Cl, 36 g (NH4)2SO4 and 68 g MgSO4 (total 222 g) per animal per day. This reduced the DCAD to -11.68 mEq\/100 g dietary dry matter compared to +13.57 for the control diet. Blood and urine were randomly sampled from 7 to 8 animals within each category within 3 hours post-partum. Serum calcium (total and ionised) and creatinine, urine calcium and creatinine and the fractional clearance of calcium were assessed. Relevant clinical, milk production, and fertility data were collected. The total serum calcium (2.07 versus 1.60 mmol\/l), serum ionised calcium (1.12 vs 1.02 mmol\/l), urine calcium (0.92 vs 0.10 mmol\/l) and the fractional clearance of calcium (1.88 vs 0.09%) were significantly higher(P &lt;0.01) at calving for multiparous cows fed the anionic diet compared to those fed the control diet. In the primiparous cows there were no significant differences in serum calcium levels. However, the urine calcium (1.07 vs 0.43 mmol\/l) and the fractional clearance of calcium was higher (1.75 vs 0.45%) in cows fed the anionic diet (P &lt;0.05 and 0.01 respectively). These results illustrated that there were benefits, although no differences were demonstrated with respect to health, milk production or fertility. The supplementation of diets with anionic salts in the last 2-3 weeks before calving has the potential to significantly improve parturient calcium homeostasis.","770":"In vitro fertilisation (IVF) has become a useful breeding tool in most of the developed world. In this paper the success of bovine IVF and the birth of live calves under typical South African conditions is reported. Oocytes for IVF were collected from the ovaries of 6 slaughtered Bovelder beef cows. On average, 36.2 oocytes per donor were retrieved. From these oocytes, 43 blastocysts were produced from 5 of the donors by IVF with frozen Bovelder semen. The best 11 of these embryos were transferred into oestrous, synchronised Bovelder recipients in the same herd. As a result, 7 calves were born (a 64% calving rate) from 4 of the original donors. The calves had a normal birth mass, but the mean gestation length of the male calves was significantly longer than the herd average (291.6 versus 285.2 days respectively). No calving difficulties were encountered. In summary, it was shown that IVF for bovine embryo production and transfer is possible on a commercial basis in South Africa.","771":"This article reviews some of the important aspects of lumpy skin disease (LSD) that may impact on its successful control. A resurgence of the disease in the last decade has highlighted some constraints of the Neethling strain vaccine, but there is no evidence of vaccine breakdowns owing to the presence of heterologous field strains. More research is needed on epidemiology and transmission of LSD in South Africa to formulate control measures.","772":"Yohimbine, 4-aminopyridine, and a combination of the 2 drugs were studied to assess their potential as antagonists to xylazine in goats. Twenty-four small East African goats were divided randomly into 4 groups of 6 goats each in a placebo-controlled study. They were all treated with intramuscular xylazine at 0.44 mg\/kg. At the time of maximum sedation, sterile water was administered intravenously to the control group, 0.15% 4-aminopyridine at 0.4mg\/kg to Group 2, 0.1% yohimbine at 0.25 mg\/kg to Group 3, and the combination of the 2 drugs at the same dose rates to Group 4. The yohimbine\/4-aminopyridine combination was also used to antagonise xylazine at 0.88mg\/kg in 6 goats. The heart rate, respiratory rate and rate of ruminal movements, the pedal and palpebral reflexes as well as the reaction to noxious stimuli, the standing time and the total recovery time were established and evaluated to assess the effects of the treatments. The drugs reversed the xylazine-induced decrease in the heart rate, respiratory rate and rate of ruminal movements, and also rapidly restored the reflexes as well as the reaction to noxious stimulation. In addition, they significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased the mean standing time. The mean total recovery time was decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) by 4-aminopyridine and the yohimbine\/4-aminopyridine combination, but non-significantly (P &gt; 0.05) by yohimbine. No relapse in sedation occurred. Overall, the combination of yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine produced better responses than the individual drugs, and may therefore be used for rapid reversal of xylazine-induced sedation in goats. Yohimbine or 4-aminopyridine may also be useful for this purpose but recovery may be prolonged.","773":"","774":"","775":"Leptotrombidium subqunadratum larvae were collected for the first time in 1994 from dogs in Bloemfontein. The larvae have been collected annually, during the summer months, over a period of 6-7 years. Previously the only known hosts were scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis) (locality unknown) and short-snouted elephant shrew (Elephantulus brachyrhynchus) (Kruger National Park). These mites cause severe itching and dermatitis in humans and dogs.","776":"","777":"Vulvovaginectomy and neo-urethrostomy were performed in a 9-year-old German shepherd dog following a diagnosis of infiltrative vulvar and vestibulovaginal haemangiosarcoma. The dog was presented for intermittent vulvar haemorrhage over a 3-month period. On examination the vulva and vestibulovagina were distended and firm. Vaginal discharge and fine needle aspiration cytology detected anaplastic cells. Haemangiosarcoma was diagnosed on biopsy. A new urethral opening was created in the floor of the vagina allowing resection of the vulva and caudal vestibulovagina. Urinary continence was preserved and healing was without complications.","778":"Gastritis, vomition and weight loss are common in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Gastric spiral bacteria (Helicobacter spp.) and the very small, viviparous nematode Ollulanus tricuspis, a stomach worm of cats, are believed to be important causes. Three sibling cheetahs at Wellington Zoo, New Zealand, developed chronic vomiting, diarrhoea and debility. Their parents were both South African-born. Response to antibacterial treatment was poor. Endoscopic examinations revealed chronic lymphoplasmacytic gastritis and Ollulanus infection. Treatment with oxfendazole and pyrantel embonate resulted in clinical improvement; however, 1 cheetah, which died 7 months later as a result of a ruptured liver due to hepatic amyloidosis, still had Ollulanus worms present in her stomach. Ollulanus tricuspis is a significant cause of gastritis and vomiting in captive cheetahs, lions and tigers, as well as wild cougars and tigers. The parasite has not yet been found in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of the unusual characteristics of this parasite, the literature on its life history and techniques for diagnosis is reviewed.","779":"The following parasites were found in apparently healthy pigeons kept in Sebele: a haemoprotozoan, Haemoproteus columbae (80%); endoparasite metazoan nematodes, Ascaridia columbae (30%) and Dispharynx spiralis (10%); a cestode, Raillietina sp. (80%) and coccidian oocysts (40%); 2 ectoparasites, namely the pigeon fly, Pseudolynchia canariensis (50%) and the louse, Columbicola columbae (30%). The pigeons also had highantibody titres, (1:256) to the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (100%). The latter infection in these domestic pigeons has public health implications.","780":"Thirteen adult indigenous chickens from Oodi, Kgatleng district, Botswana, were examined for helminth parasites. Two species of nematodes, Ascaridia galli and Heterakis gallinarum, and species of the cestode genus Raillietina, were recovered. A. galli and H. gallinarum were the most commonly seen parasites. The nematode A. galli occurred concurrently with Raillietina spp.","781":"Anaesthesia was required in a captive female African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) for surgical wound treatment. After it was immobilised with a medetomidine-ketamine combination, bradycardia, hypothermia, systolic hypertension and metabolic acidosis were observed. Surgical anaesthesia was maintained with a 1% end-tidal isoflurane concentration. A decrease in the arterial blood pressure, rectal temperature and pH occurred during maintenance of anaesthesia.","782":"Twenty 9-month-old crossbred calves were divided into 2 equal groups (A and B; n = 10). The feeding trial was conducted for 119 days to study the effect of concentrate supplementation on body immune response and blood metabolites in calves. The concentrate and roughage (wheat straw) ratio in the diet of Groups A and B was 60:40 and 30:70, respectively. Daily dry matter intake was significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher in Group A than in Group B, which also resulted in significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) total body weight gain in the former group. Protein, albumin, globulin, total and differential leukocyte count in blood were similar in the 2 groups but blood glucose level was higher (P&lt;0.05) in the calves of Group A. There was no difference in body immune response between the groups, which indicated that body immune response of animals is not significantly influenced by restricted concentrate feeding.","783":"Information on the traditional tick control methods used in Keffa, Illubabor and Wellega Provinces in western Ethiopia was obtained from 86 veterinary clinics and 865 peasant farmers through a questionnaire survey. Latexes of Euphorbia obovalifolia and Ficus brachypoda, juice of crushed leaves of Phytolaca dodecandra and Vernonia amygdalina, fruit juice of Solanum incanum, crushed seeds of Lepidium sativum mixed with fresh cattle faeces, juice of crushed leaves and bark of Calpurnea aurea and commercially available spice of Capsicum spp. mixed with butter, were used by peasant farmers to control ticks. Preliminary in vitro efficacy tests of these plant preparations were performed on engorged female Boophilus decoloratus. Preparations of Capsicum spp., E. obovalifolia, S. incanum and F. brachypoda were found to have 30-100% killing effects. Subsequently, in vivo treatment trials of these preparations were conducted using indigenous Bos indicus cattle naturally infested with ticks. Results indicate that treatments at the rate of once per day for 5 consecutive days with the latexes of E. obovalifolia and F. brachypoda can reduce tick burdens by up to 70% on cattle.","784":"This retrospective study describes 4 cases of canine babesiosis with histologically confirmed acute pancreatitis. In addition, 16 dogs with babesiosis are reported with serum amylase (&gt;3500 U\/l) and\/or lipase (&gt;650 U\/l) activity elevations of a magnitude that would support a diagnosis of probable acute pancreatitis, although extra-pancreatic sources of the enzymes could not be excluded in these cases. Median time of pancreatitis diagnosis was 2.5 days post-admission, with primarily young (median age 3 years), sexually intact dogs affected. The development of pancreatitis was unrelated to the degree of anaemia at time of admission. In addition to pancreatitis, 80% of cases suffered from other babesial complications, namely icterus (13), acute respiratory distress syndrome (6), immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (6), renal failure (3), haemoconcentration (2) and cerebral syndrome (2). Acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure and cerebral syndrome were associated with a poor prognosis, with 4 of the 5 dogs included in the overall 26% mortality rate having at least 1 of these complications. Haemolytic anaemia with ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the pancreas is proposed as a possible primary pathophysiological mechanism in babesial pancreatitis. Hypotensive shock, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, haemoconcentration and possibly altered lipid metabolism in babesiosis may also be involved. The previously postulated pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu of complicated babesiosis may underlie the progression, if not the primary initiation, of pancreatic pathology. Acute pancreatitis may represent the previously reported 'gut' form of babesiosis.","785":"The effects of acute exposure to 3 different temperature and humidity conditions on arterial blood-gas and acid-base balance in goats were investigated after intravenous bolus administration of xylazine at a dose of 0.1 mg\/kg. Significant (P&lt;0.05) changes in the variables occurred under all 3 environmental conditions. Decreases in pH, partial pressure of oxygen and oxyhaemoglobin saturation were observed, and the minimum values for oxygen tension and oxyhaemoglobin saturation were observed within 5 min of xylazine administration. The pH decreased to its minimum values between 5 and 15 min. Thereafter, the variables started to return towards baseline, but did not reach baseline values at the end of the 60 min observation period. Increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, total carbon dioxide content, bicarbonate ion concentration, and the actual base excess were observed. The maximum increase in the carbon dioxide tension occurred within 5 min of xylazine administration. The increase in the actual base excess only became significant after 30 min in all 3 environments, and maximal increases were observed at 60 min. There were no significant differences between the variables in the 3 different environments. It was concluded that intravenous xylazine administration in goats resulted in significant changes in arterial blood-gas and acid-base balance that were associated with hypoxaemia and respiratory acidosis, followed by metabolic alkalosis that continued for the duration of the observation period. Acute exposure to different environmental temperature and humidity conditions after xylazine administration did not influence the changes in arterial blood-gas and acid-base balance.","786":"South Africa appears to be the only country where feline babesiosis is a significant clinical entity in domestic cats. Little is known about its epidemiology or the clinical challenges facing practitioners. A questionnaire posted to 1760 South African veterinarians was returned by 16%, representing approximately 40% of practices. Just over half reported seeing feline babesiosis, with most cases occurring in the coastal areas of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces. Overall incidence is highest in summer, but seasonality is less pronounced in non-seasonal and winter rainfall areas. No age, breed or sex predisposition was identified. Weight loss, weakness, anaemia, fever and icterus are common clinical findings. Complications include hepatopathy, renal failure, pulmonary oedema, cerebral signs, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and concurrent infections. The antibabesial drug of choice is primaquine phosphate. Response to therapy is generally good, but recurrence and chronic infections were identified as problems. The average mortality rate was 15%. Approximately 3000 cases are seen annually by the respondents, at an estimated cost of R750 000 to the owners. Feline babesiosis is a significant problem in South Africa, and further investigations of taxonomic status, concurrent infections, chemotherapy, complications and management of refractory cases are warranted.","787":"Fleas cause allergic dermatitis in cats and dogs and therefore warrant control. It has been demonstrated previously that there is marked inhibition of the development of the immature stages of the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis on fleece blankets exposed to cats treated with imidacloprid. This study reports on the efficacy of imidacloprid in suppressing adult flea emergence in carpet exposed to treated cats. Circular discs of carpet pre-seeded with flea eggs and larvae were exposed to 6 untreated control and 6 topically treated (imidacloprid 10% m\/v) cats 1 to 2 days after treatment and subsequently fortnightly for 6 weeks. Exposure times on alternate days were either 1 or 6 hours. Adult flea yield from carpets was determined 35 days after exposure. Differences between flea yield on control carpets and those exposed for 1 hour were significant only for days +1 and +14. For the 6-hour exposure, differences were significant at all times except on Day +43. The ability of imidacloprid to suppress the yield of adult fleas on carpets (6-hour exposure) steadily declined from 82 % (Day +2) to 12% (Day +43). For the 1-hour exposure it varied inconsistently between 0 and 83% over the 6-week study period.","788":"Thirty Brahman-Angus cross heifers at breeding age on extensive grazing were used to test the effectiveness of NH4Cl as an acidogenic agent at 15,18, 21 and 26 % of a dicalcium phosphate lick (A+), compared to a lick of 5 parts dicalcium phosphate and 3 parts salt (A-). Blood and faecal phosphorus (P), faecal calcium (Ca) and faecal magnesium (Mg) were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in A+ compared to A-animals at different stages of the experiment. Bone P did not increase in response to NH4Cl but bone Ca was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in A+ animals offered 18% NH4Cl and significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower at 15 and 26%. Bone Mg in A+ animals was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher at 15 and 18% NH4Cl and lower at 26% NH4Cl compared to A- animals. Percentage ash in bone increased linearly from 62.5 to 64.9% in A+ animals as NH4Cl was increased in the lick from 15 to 21% and then decreased to 63.3% but was significantly (P&lt;0.05) greater than the percentage ash in A-animals when the NH4Cl was increased to 26%. Bone mineral status was only marginally improved by adding NH4Cl to the lick in this study but blood P was significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved in A+ compared to A- animals when the lick contained 15, 21 and 26% NH4Cl. Based on bone mineral results reported here, it is recommended that, when NH4Cl is used as an acidogenic agent in licks for range cattle, the amount in the lick should not exceed 21%.","789":"","790":"Treatment of bovine mastitis depends on the cause, the clinical manifestation and the antibiotic susceptibility of the agent. Mastitis therapy is commonly unsuccessful owing to pathological changes that occur in the udder parenchyma as a result of the inflammatory reaction to mastitogenic bacteria, pharmacokinetic properties of antimicrobial mastitis drugs, mastitogenic bacterial and related factors, and poor animal husbandry and veterinary interventions.","791":"Acute liver failure was diagnosed in a 12-year-old cat. Fine needle aspirate cytology revealed high numbers of unsheathed microfilariae and a hepatocellular reaction with no evidence of bacterial infection. The microfilariae were identified as those of Dirofilaria repens by acid phosphatase staining. The high number of microfilariae seen in both the blood and the liver aspirate samples as well as the favourable response to ivermectin amongst other drugs administered, is suggestive that D. repens was the cause of the liver insult. A positive result obtained with an antigen-capture ELISA (Dirochek) for Dirofilaria immitis antigen was interpreted as false. This is the 1st report of Dirofilaria repens for South Africa.","792":"Conventionally, the assessment of adrenal responses to stress relies on blood sample collection. However, blood collection from animals is impossible without restraint or immobilisation that influences results. This study was undertaken to validate recently established enzyme immunoassays that measure faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in elephants, and to perform a preliminary investigation into the biological relevance of this non-invasive method for use in assessing the degree of stress in this species. Four juvenile African elephants were injected i.m. with 2.15 mg synthetic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (Synacthen, Novartis, Switzerland). Blood and faecal samples were collected over 4 h and 7 d respectively. Concentrations of serum cortisol and faecal cortisol metabolites were determined using immunoassay. Variability of basal and peak values in blood and faeces was observed among the elephants. After ACTH injection, serum cortisol concentrations increased by 400-700%. An 11-oxoaetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay (EIA) proved best suited to measure cortisol metabolites (11,17-dioxoandrostanes) when compared to a cortisol and corticosterone EIA in faecal samples. Concentrations of faecal 11,17-dioxoandrostanes increased by 570-1070%, reaching peak levels after 20.0-25.5 h. Greater levels of glucocorticoid metabolites were measured in faecal samples from elephants kept in small enclosures compared to levels in the faeces of animals ranging over a larger area. The results of this preliminary study suggest that non-invasive faecal monitoring of glucocorticoid metabolites is useful in investigating adrenal activity in African elephants.","793":"Decision support in veterinary epidemiology often depends on density estimates of domestic animals. These estimates are usually based on ground surveys of various types. Ground surveys are difficult to undertake in the informal housing settlements that are frequently encountered in developing countries. In addition, they are time-consuming and expensive. In this study, field experience in enumerating wildlife from helicopters was used to count domestic animals in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Data for domestic dogs are analysed for precision and accuracy and the technique evaluated in terms of its value for decision support.","794":"A questionnaire, designed to obtain qualitative information on a number of variables concerning canine babesiosis (biliary fever) in South Africa, was sent to 510 veterinary practices in late 1993. Of the 157 practices that responded, all were presented with cases of babesiosis and most were situated in Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Apart from the Western Cape, a winter-rainfall region, the prevalence of babesiosis cases in dogs was highest in summer. Most of the respondent practices treated between 1,000 and 5,000 sick dogs that included 100 to 500 babesiosis cases each year. Respondents identified cerebral babesiosis, enterorrhagia, 'red' or haemoconcentrated babesiosis, acute renal failure and pulmonary babesiosis or 'shock lung', amongst others, as the most prevalent forms of complicated ('atypical') babesiosis. Diminazene, imidocarb and trypan blue were the most popular antibabesials. Trypan blue was most often used in shocked patients, whereas diminazene and imidocarb were preferred when there was a high parasitaemia in the absence of shock. At least 19 antibabesial treatment regimens were used in practices. These comprised the use of single doses of antibabesial drugs; split doses with repeat injections, and combined drug variations, some of which are undesirable due to possible sterilisation of Babesia infection or potential toxicity. Side-effects were most commonly associated with imidocarb use. Ninety-six percent of respondents used supportive treatment (e.g. corticosteroids, vitamins and 'liver support') in all cases of babesiosis. The use of blood transfusion as supportive treatment varied according to practice and severity of the case. Most practices never cross-matched blood to be transfused, and transfusion reactions were rare. Diminazene was most frequently incriminated in cases where drug 'resistance' or relapses occurred. Cerebral and 'red' cases resulted in high mortality. Treatment of babesiosis costs the dog-owning public in South Africa more than R20 million each year. Information on the distribution and possible complicating role of Ehrlichia canis was obtained. Development of a vaccine was the first research priority identified.","795":"A total of 344 dogs belonging to people in resource-poor communities in North West Province, South Africa, was examined for ectoparasites, and all visible arthropods were collected from the left side of each dog. By doubling these numbers it was estimated that the dogs harboured 14,724 ixodid ticks, belonging to 6 species, 1,028 fleas, belonging to 2 species, and 26 lice. Haemaphysalis leachi accounted for 420 and Rhipicephalus sanguineus for 14,226 of the ticks. Pure infestations of H. leachi were present on 14 dogs and of R. sanguineus on 172 dogs. Small numbers of Amblyomma hebraeum, R. appendiciulatus, R. evertsi evertsi and R. simus were also collected. The predominance of R. sanguitneus accounts for the high prevalence of canine ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis) within the survey region, compared to canine babesiosis (Babesia canis), which is transmitted by H. leachi, and is a much rarer disease.","796":"The possible spread by horse faeces of plants that may become weeds in sensitive areas was investigated. It was found that the period 24-48 hours after ingestion of seeds included in rations was the retention time for seeds passing through the digestive system of the horse. The ability of seeds to germinate was not influenced by exposure to digestive fluids or sea-water. A feeding regime of compound feeds is suggested.","797":"A survey of the routine anaesthetic management of dogs and cats during sterilisation by veterinarians in South Africa was conducted. This report describes the premedication, induction and maintenance agents most commonly used in dogs and cats. Information about monitoring of patients during the procedure and who is responsible for induction of anaesthesia and monitoring was obtained. Questionnaires were analysed with regard to demographic data, practice size, continuing education, the number of surgical procedures and sterilisations performed per week and an estimate of yearly mortality. Acetylpromazine is the most commonly used premedication in dogs and xylazine in cats. Thiopentone in dogs and alphaxalone\/alphadolone in cats were the induction agents most commonly used. Alphaxalone\/alphadolone in cats and halothane in dogs are the most commonly used maintenance agents. Records of anaesthesia are poorly kept and monitoring of patients is poorly performed. Respiratory rate is the parameter most commonly monitored (90.7%), and in most cases is the sole parameter. On average 10.34 +\/- 8.25 cats were operated per week, of which 5.45 +\/- 5.60 were sterilised; 17.79 +\/- 11.61 dogs were operated per week, of which 8.65 +\/- 7.10 were sterilised. In total, 190 patients died under anaesthesia, a mortality rate of 1:1,243. Just over 50% of practitioners had attended continuing education courses during their careers.","798":"Fourty-two village animal health workers called keymen (KM) and 84 veterinary assistants (VA) involved in a Basic Animal Health Service (BAHS) Programme in northern Malawi were interviewed during 1998. The general characteristics and perceptions of both groups were analysed using uni- and multivariate techniques. Detailed sales and treatment patterns of six KM and 12 VA were evaluated for the period September 1996 to August 1997. Results indicated an overall job-satisfaction for 82% of KM and 83 % of VA. Estimated weekly involvement in livestock service delivery, particularly of KM, was 3.7 days on average. Total annual drug sales of KM and VA between 1996 and 1997 on average were equivalent to US$ 124 and US$ 218 respectively. Most livestock remedies were issued for treatment of calves, followed by adult cattle, chickens and small ruminants. The changes suggested by VA and KM in order to improve field performance focused on regular refresher training by the BAHS programme.","799":"This study was carried out to assess the influence of xylazine administration on clinical, cardiopulmonary and haemocytological variables after acute exposure to different environmental conditions. Xylazine hydrochloride was administered intravenously at 0.1 mg\/kg body mass to 6 clinically healthy, castrated male goats. All animals were exposed for 60 min to 3 sets of climatic conditions: 14 degrees C, 33% relative humidity; 24 degrees C, 55% RH, and 34 degrees C, 65% RH. The variables that were measured for a period of 60 min after xylazine administration were sedation, analgesia, salivation, urination, ventilation rate, heart-rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oesophageal temperature, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. Xylazine induced sedation, analgesia, salivation and urination independently of the 3 environmental conditions. Environment had no influence on the onset, duration and recovery from sedation. In the 14 degrees C environment, xylazine resulted in a significant decrease in ventilation and heart-rate from baseline values. Significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, haematocrit and red cell count were observed in the 3 environments. Total plasma protein was significantly altered at 24 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Acute exposure of goats to different environmental conditions had no significant influence on the clinical, cardiopulmonary and haemocytological variables. Physiological changes induced by xylazine were therefore independent of the environment.","800":"An insecticide-free sheep blowfly trapping system, utilising a synthetic lure, was evaluated at 4 localities in the Western Cape. Control sites, where no suppression was practised, were identified for each locality. The blowfly population was monitored for 48 hours monthly at each of the localities. Five to 7 suppression traps at the respective localities were identified for this purpose. Three to 10 traps were set monthly for monitoring in the control areas. Trapping resulted in the suppression (P &lt; 0.01) of the Lucilia population at Caledon, where a large area of approximately 50 km2 was trapped. The suppression area of all the localities was &lt; or =850 ha. At Elsenburg, blowfly numbers were low. There was a strong suggestion of a general reduction in the Lucilia numbers at this locality. Trapping failed to reduce Lucilia numbers at Tygerhoek and Langgewens. Lack of control over the influx of Lucilia from adjacent sheep-producing areas probably contributed to this result. The observed response at Elsenburg was probably due to its situation in a predominantly wine-growing area. Most of the blowflies recovered from the control traps during the month with the highest yield at the respective localities belonged to the genus Lucilia. The results obtained at Caledon and published reports suggest that large-scale trapping of Lucilia spp. may play a role in an integrated pest management system for blowflies.","801":"The efficacy of ivermectin, fenbendazole, pyrantel pamoate and doramectin was evaluated under field conditions at 2 sites in the Free State Province of South Africa. The study involved 25 horses at each site, divided into 5 groups of equal size. Ivermectin, fenbendazole and pyrantel pamoate were administered orally at doses of 0.2, 10 and 19 mg\/kg respectively. Doramectin was administered by intramuscular injection at a dose of 0.2 mg\/kg. Treatment efficacy was based on the mean faecal egg count reduction 14 days post treatment. At site A a faecal egg count reduction of 100% was found after treatment with ivermectin, fenbendazole and doramectin. A 96.1% reduction was found after treatment with pyrantel pamoate. At site B ivermectin and doramectin produced a 100% reduction in faecal egg counts, fenbendazole produced an 80.8% reduction and pyrantel pamoate a 94.1% reduction. Doramectin produced a 100% reduction in faecal egg counts at both sites, despite not being registered for use in horses. In addition, the results indicated reduced efficacy of fenbendazole at site B, which suggested benzimidazole resistance. Larval cultures showed that cyathostomes accounted for between 86 and 96% of pre-treatment parasite burdens at both sites. Other helminths identified in the faecal samples were Strongylus spp. and Trichostrongylus axei.","802":"The low incidence of clinical signs or pathological lesions compatible with feline panleukopenia in cats has created the perception among practitioners that the disease has disappeared since the emergence of canine parvovirus type 2 in the late 1970s. Three parvoviruses that were recently isolated from a domestic cat and 2 cheetahs in cell culture or detected by means of the polymerase chain reaction were shown to be typical feline parvoviruses. Phylogenetic comparison with other FPV isolates did not reveal a particular African cluster.","803":"An 8-month-old Labrador retriever bitch was evaluated for sudden-onset, progressive abdominal distension. Physical examination revealed an exaggerated inspiratory effort, severe ascites, bilateral jugular vein distension, and hypokinetic femoral arterial pulses. Thoracic auscultation detected tachycardia with muffled heart sounds, without audible cardiac murmurs. Thoracic radiographs identified severe right ventricular enlargement and pleural effusion. The electrocardiogram was consistent with incomplete right bundle branch block or right ventricular enlargement. Echocardiography demonstrated severe right ventricular and atrial dilation, secondary tricuspid regurgitation, and thinning and hypocontractility of the right ventricular myocardium. Left heart chamber sizes were slightly decreased, with normal left ventricular contractility. A diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was reached, based on the characteristic clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic and echocardiographic findings, and the exclusion of other causes of isolated right ventricular failure. Treatment effected good control of clinical signs, until acutely decompensated congestive right heart failure led to euthanasia after 4 months. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a well-described clinical entity in humans, and has previously been documented in 3 male dogs. The condition is characterised by progressive fibro-adipose replacement of right ventricular myocardium, while the left ventricle usually remains unaffected. It should be considered a differential diagnosis in any young dog presented with isolated right heart failure, syncope, or unexplained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This article reports the 1st case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in a female dog, and highlights its echocardiographic features.","804":"Forty-two pigs in a herd of 117 displayed various clinical signs of progressive atrophic rhinitis. The main signs included sneezing, coughing, lachrymation, serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, and nasal bleeding in 1 pig. Three pigs had lateral deviation of the snout, while 4 had brachygnathia superior with obvious deformation of the face. Four acutely affected weaner pigs appeared weak, while the 7 chronically-affected pigs appeared smaller than their apparently unaffected penmates of the same age. Treatment of the acutely affected pigs with long-acting oxytetracycline at 20 mg\/kg body weight intramuscularly, repeated once after 7 days, reduced the severity but did not clear the sneezing from all the pigs. Fifteen pigs were slaughtered 2 months after the clinical diagnosis was made. The carcasses of the chronically affected pigs were about 15% lighter than those of the apparently normal pigs of the same age and from the same pen, which translated to a loss of 921.00 Kenya shillings per pig (US$13.7). Diagnosis of progressive atrophic rhinitis was confirmed by sectioning the snouts of randomly selected slaughtered pigs with obvious deformation of the snout. Sections were made at the level of the 1st\/2nd upper premolar tooth. Varying degrees of turbinate atrophy, from mild to complete, were noted. Histopathology of the turbinates revealed metaplasia of nasal epithelium and fibrosis in the lamina propria.","805":"Two litters of German shepherd dogs were evaluated for a haemorrhagic tendency that was characterised by excessive bleeding from the umbilicus at birth, haemorrhage and haematoma formation at vaccination, excessive bruising, and lameness due to haemarthrosis. Platelet counts, clotting times and Von Willebrand's factor (VWF) assays were assessed in all dogs. Factor VIII determination was performed in 1 puppy and its parents. Based on the clotting times and VWF assay, 6 puppies (4 male and 2 female) showed type I Von Willebrand's disease (VWD), 5 (4 male and 1 female) possible type II VWD, and 4 were unaffected. One puppy with possible type II VWD had very low factor VIII activity; its sire had a normal factor activity, whereas the dam was in the low-normal range. This article reports type I and possible type II VWD in 2 related litters of German shepherd dogs, the latter being rare in German shepherd dogs.","806":"Data relating to reproductive parameters of German shepherd bitches were collected from registered German shepherd dog (GSD) breeders with information kept over a 15-year period (1982-1997). The information obtained was verified using the East African Kennel Club records. A total of 594 bitches from 280 breeders were recorded. From these, 798 heats were observed, 594 of which were used for breeding, resulting in 3592 puppies. The mean age at puberty was 519.0 +\/- 41 days. Heats occurred throughout the year, although significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher and lower incidences were observed in October and April respectively Pregnancy significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased interoestrous interval, which was 247.8 +\/- 99.6 and 183 +\/- 52 days among bred\/pregnant and non-bred bitches respectively. Most bitches in oestrus (73.7%) were bred, and breeding was carried out throughout the year, with a distribution closely related to that of heat incidence. Subsequently, whelping occurred throughout the year, and 95.5% of the bitches that were mated whelped. A mean gestation period of 60.6 +\/- 5.1 days was observed. The mean litter size was 6.4 +\/- 0.4 puppies, and did not differ significantly between months. The preweaning losses were low, with 2.3% stillbirths, 0.9% culls and 11.4% mortalities.","807":"Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedures for typing Clostridium, perfringens, which affects most domestic animals, were compared and evaluated for efficiency as substitute to the guinea-pig intradermal test routinely used in our laboratory, namely a multiplex PCR and a protocol based on the individual amplification of gene sequences specific for each toxin. Reference isolates of C. perfringens types A, B, C and D as well as cultures from clinical specimens were tested. The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR was confirmed on reference isolates. There was similarity in results on 43 of the 46 samples typed by all 3 methods. Clear results were obtained by PCR on 5 clinical samples that showed either equivocal or weak skin reactions in guinea-pigs. The multiplex PCR protocol, in combination with the evaluation of bacterial growth, is a better alternative to in vivo toxin typing, since C. perfringens can only be incriminated as cause of a disease when it is present in large numbers in the intestine.","808":"In South Africa the incidence of NAD-independent Haemnophilus paragallinarum isolation from clinical cases is increasing. This study was carried out to test whether a commercially available coryza vaccine (Nobilis Coryza, Intervet International BV) could protect chickens against challenge with recent NAD-independent isolates. SPF chickens were vaccinated twice at 3 and 7 weeks of age and were challenged at 9 weeks of age with 5 different NAD-independent isolates of serotype A or C-3. The results after challenge show that the coryza vaccine induces good protection against challenge with the different South African NAD-independent isolates of H. paragallinarum, including serotype C-3.","809":"Faecal specimens collected in the Kruger National Park from 103 African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) up to 1 year old and 283 buffaloes older than 1 year were examined for the presence of coccidian oocysts and nematode eggs. Most specimens from animals older than 1 year had negative coccidian oocyst counts. Positive specimens from younger animals had significantly higher coccidian oocyst counts than those from older animals. No such difference was found for nematode egg counts.","810":null,"811":"The ultrastructure of the eggshell of the domestic hen has been well researched and structural studies of other avian species, such as the ostrich, often base their interpretation of egg shell structure on that of the chicken. In the ostrich, lowered hatchability and hatching trauma may be due to shell ultrastructural abnormalities. In the present study the ultrastructure of the calcified portion, and the outer shell membrane (OSM), of domesticated ostrich eggshells was investigated using standard electron microscopic techniques. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrated intimate contact between cup-shaped structures present on the OSM and the mammillary layer of the calcified portion of the shell. The initial calcium carbonate growth of the calcified shell was of a dendritic nature with nucleation sites on the surface of the cup's contents. The dendritic growth gave way to a more randomly-orientated, smaller crystallite growth structure, which changed in form as it neared the vertical crystal layer (VCL). The VCL is described as being both amorphous and 'crumbly' depending on the plane of fracture. These observations suggest that firstly, initial calcification is contained within the cups and is then directed outwards to form the shell and that secondly, the VCL may contain an evolutionary, calcified cuticular layer. These observations serve as a baseline for studies investigating the effect of shell structure and strength on hatchling trauma and the influence of maternal diet.","812":"Little is known regarding the keeping of animals in the Moretele 1 area of North-West Province, South Africa. Therefore, the status and dynamics of animal husbandry, as well as a general assessment of the needs of animal owners in this area were researched. Results of the investigation will be used to make recommendations for improved veterinary extension servicing in the area. Semi-structured interviews, based on discussions with relevant stakeholders in the community and a resultant problem conceptualisation, were undertaken at 266 randomly selected households in 51 villages and centres in the area, after which the data was checked and verified before being captured and analysed. The findings reveal that within the field of veterinary extension delivery: 1) there is a demand for visual and written extension material, 2) the extension services must function where clients reside, 3) limitations in terms of infrastructure are present and should be addressed through partnerships and coordination amongst all the role-players in the Moretele 1 area, and 4) cattle and poultry are the most important of the animal species and should be the focus points of extension, but the need to curb zoonotic disease should not be disregarded. In this regard veterinary clinics, private veterinarians and other role-players should be used in partnership with extension workers. Lastly, the veterinary clinic is regarded as helpful in many respects by the community consulted and the service should be upgraded and made available to a wider client base, especially where private and state veterinarians are unavailable or too expensive in such resource-limited communities.","813":"The use of herbal remedies by African farmers in the treatment of livestock diseases was investigated using a range of methods, including group interviews, structured interviews, semi-structured interviews and participant observation. The study was concerned mainly with the 'why' and 'how' of herbal remedy use among African livestock holders farming on communally-owned land in central Eastern Cape Province. We found that the use of herbal remedies was still widespread because these remedies were cheap, locally available and convenient to administer. Farmers also used herbal remedies because they did not have knowledge of conventional remedies or found these too expensive and therefore used herbal remedies as a last resort. Most of the farmers interviewed (73%) had used some form of herbal remedy. A small number of farmers did not use herbal remedies at all. They rejected them because they had bad experiences in the past or because they considered the practice outdated and socially inferior. Often farmers used herbal remedies in combination with conventional ones, but a substantial number relied on herbal remedies only. Farmers obtained herbal remedies principally by preparing their own or by purchasing from herbalists. Different plant parts were used to prepare herbal remedies in the form of infusions, decoctions, powders, pastes, and juices from fresh plant material. Preparations were made from a single plant or from a range of plants. Application of a remedy was by different routes and methods, depending on the perceived cause of the disease condition. Topical applications were used for skin conditions, powders were rubbed into incisions, drenches were common in the treatment of systemic conditions, and drops to treat ears and eyes. We identified several aspects of herbal remedy utilisation that could be subject to improvement, which included the absence of standard dose regimes, the potential toxicity of certain compounds present in plants used, over-exploitation of the plant resource and a lack of interest by the youth to learn the art.","814":"The development of molecular biology techniques and methods for the isolation and growth of ehrlichias in tissue culture have greatly facilitated the study of these organisms. The available knowledge on ehrlichias is thus rapidly increasing and in this review recent findings on the epidemiology, transmission, clinical and laboratory signs of infection, diagnosis and treatment of canine ehrlichioses are described.","815":"Anaesthesia was required in an 18-month-old Dorper ewe scheduled for surgical repair of an abdominal hernia. Anaesthesia was induced with diazepam (0.15 mg\/kg) and ketamine (6 mg\/kg), and maintained with halothane in oxygen on a circle anaesthetic machine. Hypotension, hypoxaemia, cyanosis and pulmonary oedema were observed from the start of surgery, but the symptoms improved towards the completion of the procedure. The aetiology of this condition could not be established. It is suggested that propylene glycol, the organic solvent in the diazepam formulation, may have stimulated the release of vasoactive substances that resulted in pulmonary oedema.","816":"Nine aardvarks (Orycteropus afer) were captured in the southern Free State, South Africa, for the placement of abdominal radio transmitters. Five combinations of ketamine hydrochloride with xylazine hydrochloride, midazolam or medetomidine hydrochloride were used to induce anaesthesia. In some cases the level of anaesthesia was maintained with 1.5% halothane. A mixture of ketamine hydrochloride and medetomidine hydrochloride was found to be most effective. Atipamizole reversed the affects of medetomidine hydrochloride, resulting in a smooth and full recovery within 8 minutes. The immobilisation and subsequent anaesthesia of these animals on cold winter nights resulted in hypothermia, and keeping the animals warm was essential to the success of the procedures undertaken. Reversal of the sedative medetomidine hydrochloride proved to be important, because animals that were released before they were fully conscious took refuge in their burrows so that care was impossible.","817":"The efficacy of 5 drugs was tested against experimental Babesia felis infection in domestic cats. Two of the drugs, rifampicin and a sulphadiazine-trimethoprim combination, appeared to have an anti-parasitic effect, but were inferior to primaquine. The other 3 drugs, buparvaquone, enrofloxacin and danofloxacin, had no significant anti-babesial effect.","818":"This study was undertaken to determine some blood and other physiological parameters with potential for use as prognostic indicators of viability of newborn goat kids. Of the 143 kids born during the on-farm study, 97 were crosses of Galla x Small East African (SEA) and 46 were pure SEA. The SEA x Galla kids were 46 single males, with a mean body weight at birth of 2.77 +\/- 0.22 kg, 43 females with a mean body weight at birth of 2.36 +\/- 0.76 kg and 5 and 3 sets of female and male twins (mean body weight at birth of 1.8 +\/- 0.19 kg and 2.05 +\/- 0.07 kg for the female and male kids, respectively). The SEA kids comprised 36 single male and female kids (mean body weight at birth of 2.48 +\/- 0.04 kg and 10 sets of twins (both male and female) (mean body weight at birth of 1.50 +\/- 0.04 kg ). Pre-suckling sera obtained on-station from kids born of does vaccinated against Escherichia coli (n = 8) and unvaccinated does (n = 7) had a total protein content of &lt;40.0 g\/l and no detectable levels of IgG and A or E. coli antibodies. Sera obtained 12 hours post partum) from kids that survived in both groups contained about 19-22 g of Ig g\/l, 50-80 g total protein\/l, blood glucose of &gt;5 mmol\/l and had an E. coli antibody titre of between 1\/160 and 1\/640. On the other hand, kids that died within 48 hours of birth (parturient deaths) and had been classified in categories 3 and 4 righting reaction had low (&lt;40 g\/l) total protein, low white blood cell count (4,000\/ml) and low blood glucose concentration (&lt;4.9 mmol\/l). It is concluded that kids with delayed righting reaction (&gt;45 minutes), low rectal temperature (&lt;36 degrees C), low birth weights (&lt;1.5 kg for singles and &lt;1.0 kg for twins), low white blood cells (&lt;4,000\/ml), low (&lt;2 mmol\/l) blood glucose levels, low total protein (&lt;40.0 g\/l), low (&lt;1:160) E. coli antibody titre and IgG (&lt; or =3,350 mg\/l) in sera obtained 12 hours after birth have a poor prognosis for survival.","819":"A questionnaire survey of 716 veterinary practices was undertaken to determine the incidence of Spirocerca lupi in dogs in South Africa. In total, 49% of the questionnaires were returned, indicating a possible incidence of 28%. Fewer than 4 cases per year were recorded by 82% of the respondents; 4-12 by 14%; 12-24 by 3%; and more than 48 by only 1%. No seasonal incidence was reported by 48% of the respondents. Large breeds were considered to be at greater risk by 43% of respondents. No specific age or sex was identified to be at higher risk. The most common complaints by owners and clinical findings were vomiting (46%), weight loss (27%), coughing (21%) or regurgitation (20%), although 14% of respondents reported no abnormal clinical findings. Diagnostic methods used were radiology (74%), endoscopy (27%), post mortem examination (34%) and faecal flotation (4%). Complications associated with S. lupi were reported by 76% of respondents, which included oesophageal neoplasia (41%), hypertrophic osteopathy (38%) and acute haemothorax (30%). Specific treatments were used by 58% of the respondents, whereas 42% of the respondents either used no treatment (72%) or recommended euthanasia (28%). Of the treatment group, 52% used ivermectin, 27% doramectin, 13% other deworming drugs (benzimidazoles, nitroscanate), and 8% used disophenol. Sixty-three percent of the respondents considered their treatment ineffective, whereas 31% considered it effective, and 6% were unsure. The overall mortality rate was high.","820":"Total serum protein, albumin, globulin, globulin fractions (alpha, beta and gamma globulins) and an acute-phase protein (alpha1-acid glycoprotein) were evaluated in dogs with naturally occurring mild (Group 1), severe (Group 2) or complicated babesiosis (Group 3). Results showed that the total serum protein, albumin, A\/G ratio and alpha globulins were statistically different between Groups 1 and 2. There was no statistical difference between groups with total, beta and gamma globulins. The findings from this study suggest that dogs with mild and severe babesiosis had low total serum proteins, albumin, A\/G ratio and alpha globulins; dogs with complicated babesiosis showed no typical serum protein changes or patterns; and that there was no evidence of an acute-phase response detectable on serum protein electrophoresis in any of the 3 groups. A marked acute-phase response was, however, present, as measured by the alpha1-acid glycoprotein, in all 3 groups. As this was a retrospective study, the possibility that the observed responses were due in part to concurrent disease could not be excluded.","821":"A study was carried out to determine the epidemiology of gastrointestinal nematodes in indigenous Tuli cattle and the effect of dietary protein supplementation and anthelmintic treatment on productivity in young growing cattle. Forty steers with an average age of 18 months were divided into 4 groups; 1) fenbendazole (slow release bolus) and cottonseed meal (FCSM group), 2) fenbendazole (FBZ group), 3) cottonseed meal (CSM group) and 4) control (no cottonseed meal and no fenbendazole) (control group). Performance parameters measured included worm eggs per gram of faeces (EPG), packed cell volume (PCV), albumin and live-weight gain. Results showed that faecal worm egg counts were lower and PCV was higher in the FCSM and FBZ groups than in the CSM and control groups (P &lt; 0.01). Weight gains were higher in the CSM and FCSM groups than in the FBZ and control groups (P &lt; 0.05). The cost benefits of anthelmintic treatment and dietary supplementation were apparent in this study. The improved growth performance of the FCSM, FBZ and CSM groups reflected a financial gain over the controls on termination of the study. The dominant genera of gastrointestinal nematodes on faecal culture, pasture larval counts and necropsy were Cooperia and Haemonchus. The incidences of Trichostrongylus, Oesophagostomum and Bunostomum were low.","822":"The efficacy of a ready-to-use 5% dicyclanil pour-on formulation as a preventative of natural flystrike on Merino lambs was investigated in a field trial involving 5 sites in the southern Cape Province. A total of 1,804 lambs treated with dicyclanil were compared with 882 untreated control lambs for up to 25 weeks after treatment. Efficacy was assessed by calculating the weekly cumulative strike rate at each site and aggregated for all sites, as well as by calculating the percentage reduction achieved in treated lambs. Cumulative strike rates for the untreated controls aggregated for all sites at Weeks 9,14 and 19 after treatment reached 6.2, 12.8 and 17.8%, respectively, compared with 0.4, 1.7 and 3.6% for the dicyclanil treated lambs. Percentage control aggregated for all sites at Weeks 9,14 and 19 after treatment was 93, 87 and 80%, respectively. Heavy rains during the 1st half of the trial did not substantially reduce the efficacy of the product.","823":"California mastitis test (CMT), direct leukocytes counts and bacteriological examination were performed on 630 milk samples from apparently healthy mammary glands of dairy goats comprising a mixed population of German Alpine, Toggenberg, Saanen and Galla crosses to find the prevalence of subclinical mastitis. The prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 9.8% according to CMT, 9.7% according to direct leukocyte counts and 28.7% by bacterial isolation during a 3-month period. The proportion of the bacteriologically positive milk samples was significantly (P &lt;0.01) higher than that positive for CMT and direct leukocyte counts. There was a significant (P &lt; 0.01) correlation between CMT and direct leukocyte counts. There was no significant direct relationship between bacterial isolation and CMT Bacterial organisms were isolated in 22.5% of the 568 CMT-negative milk samples. The results suggest that bacterial organisms isolated from the CMT-negative milksamples were either latent infections or did not stimulate any significant increase in somatic cell counts that could be detected by either the CMT or direct leukocyte counts. The observations of this study indicate that the mere presence of bacteria in goat's milk does not mean that the udder is infected and so does not warrant antibiotic therapy.","824":"From blood collected from 94 cattle at 12 locations in the eastern and northeastern areas of Zimbabwe, DNA was extracted and analysed by polymerase chain reaction with primers previously reported to be specific for Babesia bigemina and Babesia borvis. Overall, DNA of Babesia bigemina was detected in the blood of 33\/94 (35%) cattle and DNA from B. bovis was detected in 27\/58 (47%) of cattle. The prevalence of DNA of B. bigemina was significantly higher in young animals (&lt;2 years) (23\/46) than in animals over 2 years of age (10\/48; chi2= 8.77; P &lt;0.01%). Although tick sampling was not thorough, Boophilus decoloratus could be collected at 7\/9 sites sampled and Boophilus microplus at 4\/9 sites. Of the 20 B. decoloratus allowed to oviposit before PCR analysis, 1 (5%) contained DNA that could be amplified with primers for B. bigemina while 12 (60%) were positive with primers for B. bovis. Of the B. microplus allowed to oviposit, 11\/16 (69%) were positive for B. bovis DNA by PCR and 2\/16 (12%) were positive for B. bigemina.","825":"Systemic arterial blood pressures were measured in 30 dogs with acute babesiosis, 10 each with mild uncomplicated, severe uncomplicated and complicated disease. Ten healthy dogs were used as controls. Hypotension was defined as more than 3 standard deviations below the control mean. Normal mean pressures (+\/-SD) were: systolic arterial pressure 151 (+\/-11) mm Hg, diastolic arterial pressure 89 (+\/-8) mm Hg and mean arterial pressure 107 (+\/-10) mm Hg. Hypotension was the most frequent abnormality, and increased strikingly in incidence as disease severity increased, with 5\/10 dogs in the complicated group being hypotensive for systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, compared with 2\/10 in the severe uncomplicated group and 0\/10 in the mild uncomplicated group. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures in the complicated group and severe uncomplicated group, and systolic pressure in the mild uncomplicated group, were significantly lower than in the controls. There were no significant relationships between arterial pressures and age, pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, mucous membrane colour or haematocrit. There was a significant negative correlation between arterial pressures and white cell and immature neutrophil counts. Arterial pressures differed significantly between dogs that were clinically collapsed and those that were not, but not between survivors and non-survivors. Pulse pressure (systolic-diastolic) was low in 7\/10 complicated, 1\/10 mild uncomplicated, and 1\/10 severe uncomplicated cases, and differed significantly between the complicated and control groups. The high incidence of hypotension in clinically severe babesiosis has important implications for therapy.","826":"The prevalence of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) serologically positive animals in 18 dairy herds with clinical and pathological lesions suggestive of BVD infection, the post-vaccinal seroconversion rates in negative animals vaccinated twice with an inactivated BVD vaccine, and the control measures taken, are described. The pathological and histopathological findings in 6 necropsies performed on animals that died in 5 separate herds closely resembled published descriptions. Positive immunohistochemistry results in 3 cases confirmed the diagnosis in those animals. In 1 herd the prevalence of prevaccinal BVD antibodies was only 36.8%, while the prevalence varied from 79.85 to 100% in the remainder. Control measures taken included immunoprophylaxis with an inactivated vaccine, culling animals that were serologically negative after vaccination that were regarded as probably persistently infected (PI) and the implementation of additional biosecurity measures. The prevalence of serologically negative PI animals in 10 herds varied from 0.38 to 4.04%, with 8 herds less than 1% and 2 herds at 2.79% and 4.04%, respectively. Methods based on vaccinating the herd, followed by serological testing and culling cattle that did not develop an antibody titre, are not reliable. The identification of PI animals should be confirmed by isolation of the virus or identification of the antigen.","827":"Krimpsiekte (the syndrome associated with chronic cardiac glycoside poisoning) was purportedly induced by Ornithlogalum toxicarium in the Karas mountains area of Keetmanshoop, Namibia. This chinkerinchee species was previously linked to a condition known as 'kwylbek' krimpsiekte in small stock in the Beaufort West district of the Western Cape Province, South Africa. In a dosing trial, respiratory distress, tachycardia and sternal recumbency were observed in 2 sheep drenched with fresh plant material. A fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA) detected the presence of a substance that cross-reacted with digoxin antibodies in some of the plant material collected at Keetmanshoop and Beaufort West. This is the first time that apparent cardiac glycoside poisoning was induced by a southern African chinkerinchee species. The presence of the cardiac glycoside-like substance in O. toxicarium requires further chemical verification.","828":"A workshop was held at Onderstepoort on 2-3 July 1999 to set priorities in veterinary helminthology for South Africa. Representatives from 19 organisations attended. The workshop achieved 2 of its 3 aims, namely to identify the priority areas within the field and to set specific objectives to be achieved in addressing these needs. Seven strategies were proposed, namely, motivation, education, therapeutic, worm resistance, animal tolerance, biological control and diagnostic strategies. A follow-up session took place on 8 September 1999 and at this workshop and in subsequent meetings, preliminary action plans were developed for these strategies. It was felt that the proposed activities delineated by this process should form the basis for a National Programme for Veterinary Helminthology and a national forum is to be convened to encourage all stakeholders to consider, discuss and adopt these activities. The forum is scheduled to take place in April 2000.","829":"Water intoxication is a condition that is common in cattle, and has also been reported in other domestic animals and man. A comprehensive description of the condition is lacking. For a better understanding of the condition, this paper reviews work that has been reported previously by various authors.","830":"Therapeutic drug monitoring is an underutilised resource in the management of canine primary epilepsy. Many of the anti-epileptic drugs, including phenobarbitone, have variable pharmacokinetic profiles in different dogs, with each individual animal showing variable rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. This results in variable serum drug concentrations with the same oral dose. Many clinicians interpret this situation as therapeutic failure and classify these patients as refractory to treatment. By measuring blood concentrations of drugs at appropriate times, it is possible to explain the efficacy or failure of treatment, and also to prevent serum concentrations from reaching toxic levels. By analysing paired samples, key pharmacokinetic parameters may be calculated for each patient and a profile for the disposition of the drug obtained. Individual optimal drug dosage can be calculated for each patient at little cost to the pet owner.","831":"The effects of a sudden addition of a large quantity of readily fermentable carbohydrate to the feed ration of pregnant heifers are described. Clinical and pathological changes caused by the resulting disease were confined to the digits and skin. The 4 acutely affected heifers were reluctant to get up or move (group II). They tended to lie down or stand with feet bunched together and the back arched, often shifting weight from limb to limb. They walked stiffly with great tenderness and pain in the digits. Extreme pain was noticed when the digits were examined. In 4 of 8 heifers, separation of the sole at the heel, with leakage of exudate, and under-running of the sole were observed. Necrotic dermatitis of the legs, alopecia and hyperkeratosis of the tail were noticed in all 8 heifers. Skin lesions appeared simultaneously. Four of the heifers (group I) recovered, and the other 4 (group II) were sent to slaughter. No post mortem examination was performed. The biochemical findings revealed a significantly higher concentration of total serum globulins and sodium, and increased activity, in CK, LDH and AST. A significantly decreasing pattern was noted in blood urea concentration, cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin and calcium. No significant differences among the various groups were found in the activities of amylase, GGT, and concentration of creatinine, total bilirubin, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium and potassium.","832":"Anaesthesia of 2 five-year-old female African elephants (Loxodonta africana) was required for dental surgery. The animals were each premedicated with 120 mg of azaperone 60 min before transportation to the hospital. Before offloading, 1 mg etorphine was administered intramuscularly (i.m.) to each elephant to facilitate walking them to the equine induction\/recovery room. For induction, 2 mg etorphine was administered i.m. to each animal. Induction was complete within 6 min. Surgical anaesthesia was induced with halothane-in-oxygen after intubation of the trunk. During surgery the mean heart rate was 61 and 45 beats\/min respectively. Systolic blood pressures increased to 27.5 and 25.6 kPa respectively, and were treated with intravenous azaperone. Blood pressure decreased thereafter to a mean systolic pressure of 18.1 and 19.8 kPa, respectively. Rectal temperature was 35.6 and 33.9 degrees C at the onset of surgery, and decreased to 35.3 and 33.5 degrees C, respectively, at the end of anaesthesia. Etorphine anaesthesia was reversed with 5 mg diprenorphine at the completion of 90 min of surgery.","833":"Experimental transmission of Besnoitia caprae from naturally chronically-infected goats to susceptible ones was achieved by intra-nasal instillation and intra-conjunctival inoculation of cystozoite-containing suspensions, subcutaneous implantation of fascia containing cysts and alternate needle pricking between the infected and non-infected goats. Typical chronic symptoms developed in the fascia-infected does. Cystozoite inoculation into the eyes and mouth did not result in infection. Kids born of dams with acute and chronic besnoitiosis did not contract the infection in utero, suggesting that intra-uterine transmission may not occur. In contrast to does with acute besnoitiosis, which occasionally aborted, the does with chronic besnoitiosis gave birth to healthy kids. Kids below the age of 4 months (pre-weaned period) born of both infected and non-infected does were susceptible to besnoitiosis but appeared to be more resistant than adult goats.","834":"Urine analysis, serum biochemical profile and a cortical wedge biopsy for histopathological examination was performed on 42 South African National Defence Force (SANDF) dogs from around the country. The only significant finding on urine analysis and serum biochemistry was a relatively large number (16\/42) of dogs with elevated serum inorganic phosphate levels. Histopathology revealed that only 9 of the animals had normal kidneys reflected in the wedge biopsy material, with over 50% of them showing signs of glomerular pathology (primarily mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis). Other conditions detected histopathologically were haemosiderosis (47% of animals), focal nephrosis (2.4%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (2.4%), focal interstitial nephritis (4.7%) and acute tubular nephrosis (4.7%). The lesions observed were of limited distribution and extent; this histopathological finding may account for the absence of significant abnormalities on urine analysis or serum biochemistry profiles. It appears from these results that a large percentage of the SANDF population would be expected to have mild renal lesions, but that these lesions are not severe enough to lead to clinical signs. The findings of this study are similar to those of randomly selected populations of non-military dogs performed in other areas of the world, which also demonstrated an unexpectedly high incidence of histopathological renal pathology in dogs considered healthy. These lesions may well, however, play a role in later life, and it is recommended that military veterinarians maintain an index of suspicion for renal disease, particularly glomerular disease. The aetiology of the histopathological lesions is unknown.","835":"Mammary gland quarters of 139 lactating dairy cows from small-scale dairy herds were examined visually and by palpation for teat lesions and by California mastitis test (CMT) and bacterial culture for subclinical mastitis. Teat lesions were observed in 97 teats. These included teat chaps (39.2%), teat papillomas (23.7%), teat erosions (22.7%), teat fistulae (5.1%), inverted teats (5.1%) and blocked teats (4.2%). According to the CMT, the prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 33.4% in all the mammary gland quarters, 71.0% in quarters with teat lesions and 24.5% in quarters without teat lesions. There was a significant (P &lt; 0.01) association between teat lesions and the prevalence of subclinical mastitis. The mammary gland quarters with teat lesions were 7.2 times more likely to have a positive CMT (P &lt; 0.01) and 5.6 times more likely to have bacterial organisms (P &lt; 0.01) isolated from them than those without any teat lesions. The bacterial organisms most frequently isolated from the CMT-positive milk samples from both the mammary gland quarters with teat lesions and those without teat lesions were Staphylococcus aureus (50.0%), Streptococcus spp. (34.8%) and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (6.2%).","836":"Sera collected from apparently healthy 6-12-month-old cats (n = 31) presented to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Veterinary Clinic in Bloemfontein for neutering were tested for antibodies reactive to Bartonella henselae (Houston-1 strain) by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Whole blood collected from the cats was used in isolation experiments and subsequent identification of Bartonella species was based on comparison of the nucleotide base sequence of polymerase chain reaction-amplified citrate synthase gene fragments. While none of the cats had antibodies reactive with B. henselae at titres &gt; or =1\/64, an organism with a partial citrate synthase gene sequence identical to that of B. henselae (Houston-1) was isolated from 1 cat.","837":"A preliminary survey on the prevalence of besnoitiosis in domestic ruminants in Kenya based on field and farm visits, clinical and post mortem examinations and histopathological examination of tissues and biopsies, showed that goats are the most affected, followed by cattle, while sheep were unaffected. Caprine besnoitiosis occurred in a continuous belt in 5 of the 8 provinces in Kenya stretching from the Coast, Eastern, North Eastern, Nairobi and the Rift Valley Provinces. Mandera, in the North Eastern Province, had the highest prevalence rate of 36%, followed by Kwale (35%), Isiolo (35%), Marsabit (33%), Wajir (28%), Nairobi (26%), Meru (24%), Garissa (21%), Taita Taveta (18%), Embu (17%), Kitui (9%), Machakos (7%), Laikipia (3%), Kajiado (2%) and Turkana and Elgeyo-Marakwet (1% each). In all flocks where the prevalence rates were over 6%, kids were observed to be affected. There were no significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) between the prevalence rates in bucks and does (18% and 18.4, respectively), but kids were less (4%) affected. Bovine besnoitiosis was found only in the Tana River District, with an infection rate of 11%.","838":"The importance of angiotensin II in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance in sheep is questionable. In this trial the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor were quantified in sheep on restricted water intake. Comparing the phase of water restriction only with that of water restriction plus ACE inhibition, significant increases were observed during the latter phase in urine volume, sodium and potassium excretion via the urine, sodium concentration in the plasma and osmolar clearance. Urine osmolarity decreased with inhibition of angiotensin II formation while variables such as water, sodium and potassium loss via the faeces were unaffected. Most of the renal effects of ACE inhibition, except the increase in urinary potassium excretion, were explicable in terms of the established functions of angiotensin II. Furthermore, results of this trial indicate that angiotensin II has no significant effect on the intestine in regulating water and electrolyte excretion via the faeces.","839":"A study was conducted to monitor changes in cortical bone mineral in the dairy cow in response to demands of lactation and pregnancy using rib bone biopsies in serial sampling. Sixteen Friesian cows from the University dairy herd were used to collect 9 samples during the lactation period and 5 samples during the dry period. The data were analysed using a split-plot design analysis of variance. There were no significant (P &gt; 0.05) differences in cortical bone phosphorus concentrations in rib bone during the lactation period, but calcium concentrations in cortical bone were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher at parturition and during the first 30 days of lactation compared to the next 30 days and between 90 and 120 days. Results reported here indicate that the cow resorbs cortical bone during the middle of the lactation period and not during the periparturient period as previously thought. Magnesium concentrations were also significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher at the beginning of lactation compared to some of the other sampling times, but cortical bone was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) thinner at the beginning of lactation compared to several of the other sampling times. There were no significant (P &gt; 0.05) differences in cortical bone Ca or Mg concentrations during the gestation period. Cortical bone P concentrations significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased during the first 180 days, but significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased at 181-230 days and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased again at 231 days to term. Cortical bone thickness decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from the beginning of gestation to term. There were no significant (P &gt; 0.05) differences in cortical bone thickness or Ca or Mg concentrations in cortical bone during the dry period, but cortical bone P concentrations were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater at the end of the dry period compared to the first 30 days of the period. In general, cortical bone Ca and Mg values decreased as milk production increased up to 20 kg\/day and cortical bone P values and bone thickness increased. In animals producing over 20 kg\/day, however, cortical bone mineral values were greater and cortical bone thickness was lower compared to those animals producing less than 20 kg.","840":"","841":"","842":"From a group of 11 recently weaned pigs, 4 were reported to be sick. Clinical examination of the sick pigs revealed marked dyspnoea, bluish-red discolouration of the skin, incoordination and difficulty in walking. Bacteriological examination of the gut contents of 2 pigs that had died earlier yielded pure cultures of haemolytic Escherichia coli. Post mortem examination of the remaining 2 pigs that died subsequently revealed progressive pulmonary collapse. One of these also showed subcutaneous oedema of the head and marked oedema of the mesentery of the spiral colon and oedema of the brain. Microscopically there was pulmonary alveolar collapse and degenerative changes in the liver. On the basis of the clinical signs, isolation of haemolytic E. coli and the post mortem findings, a diagnosis of oedema disease was made.","843":"Mortalities and abortions associated with starvation occurred at Cape Cross, Namibia, in Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). Affected seals showed lethargy and emaciation, and the most common pathological signs were those of a respiratory infection, both in adults and offspring. Streptococcus phocae was isolated from adult seals, a cub and aborted foetuses.","844":"The number of sick dogs diagnosed with and without gastroenteritis presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital situated north of Pretoria is reported from counts extracted from the records of the Outpatients clinic for 6 years, 1988 to 1993. The average percentage of sick dogs diagnosed with gastroenteritis was 11.51% and the average percentage of sick dogs that were admitted to the parvovirus isolation hospital ward was 2.8%. A strong correlation exists between the number of dogs admitted to the parvovirus ward and average monthly wind speed and inverse humidity values.","845":"Biological samples were collected from dogs in resource-limited communities in the North-West and Gauteng Provinces of South Africa to assess the prevalence of helminth parasitism. These samples included adhesive tape peri-anal skin swabs and fresh faecal samples for helminth examination, and thick and thin blood films (smears) and whole-blood samples in anticoagulant for examination of filarial nematode microfilariae and haemoprotozoa. The eggs of Ancylostoma caninum, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dipylidium caninum and taeniids were identified. None of the blood samples and smears tested positive for microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis or Dipetalonema spp. or for haemoprotozoa. The adhesive tape swabs were negative for cestode eggs and segments. Most of the helminth parasites identified in this study are zoonotic and consequently are regarded as a public health hazard.","846":"Treatment of pregnant mares to prevent abortions due to equine piroplasmosis is a novel idea practised empirically at some Thoroughbred studs in South Africa. This paper presents the results of an investigation to ascertain whether imidocarb dipropionate crosses the equine placenta. Three pregnant mares were injected intramuscularly with imidocarb and their foetuses were mechanically aborted at varying time intervals thereafter. Imidocarb was found in foetal blood at a level similar to that in the dam's blood, suggesting that imidocarb administered to the dam would be available for anti-parasitic activity in the foetal circulation. Uncertainty concerning the time of treatment to achieve the desired effect currently makes this a questionable exercise.","847":"Abundances of Culicoides imicola, the insect vector of several livestock viruses, including bluetongue and African horse sickness, were recently published for 34 sites in southern Africa, together with associated climate data. Here, these data are analysed statistically in combination with certain satellite-derived variables, with the aim of developing predictive models of C. imicola abundance. Satellite-derived variables were the land surface temperature (LST, a measure of temperature at the earth's surface) and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI, a measure of photosynthetic activity). Two models were developed: (1) climatic variables only and (2) satellite-derived and climatic variables. For model I, the best model used a single predictor variable (the mean daily minimum temperature) only, and accounted for nearly 34% of the variance in C. imicola abundance. Two variable climatic models did not perform significantly better. For model II, the best 1-variable model used the annual minimum LST as a predictor of C. imicola abundance, and accounted for nearly 40% of the variance in C. imicola abundance. The best 2-variable model, which gave a significantly better fit than the 1-variable model, combined the minimum LST and minimum NDVI as predictors of C. imicola abundance, and accounted for nearly 67% of variance. A map of predicted C. imicola abundances is produced on the basis of this 2nd model which, despite some anomalies, agrees largely with what is currently known of the prevalence of C. imicola in the region.","848":"The plasma and salivary disposition of closantel and rafoxanide were examined following intravenous administration in adult sheep. Two studies were conducted with rafoxanide at 7.5 mg\/kg and 1 with closantel using 2 doses (5 and 15 mg\/kg). The pharmacokinetic profile of both drugs in plasma were best described by a 2-compartmental model with 1st-order rate constants. Plasma disposition of closantel and rafoxanide were characterised by a rapid distribution (t1\/2(alpha)) of &lt;30 min), long elimination half-life (t1\/2(beta)) of 17.0 +\/- 4.0 days for closantel and 7.2 +\/- 0.6 days for rafoxanide), small apparent volume of distribution (V(SS) of &lt;0.15 l\/kg) and a slow rate of total body clearance (Cl of &lt;0.01 ml\/min\/kg). The area under the drug plasma concentration curve (AUC) of closantel at 5 mg\/kg was nearly twice as large as that of rafoxanide at 7.5 mg\/kg resulting from the slower t1\/2(beta) observed with closantel compared to rafoxanide. Large individual differences were observed in the rate measurements of distribution (k12, k21 and t1\/2(alpha)), whereas the parameters of elimination (k10, t1\/2(beta) and Cl), were more consistent between animals. A dose proportional increase in AUC was observed for closantel administered at 5 and 15 mg\/kg. A low, constant salivary concentration of closantel (mean of 0.04 +\/- 0.05 microg\/mL) and rafoxanide (mean of 0.07 +\/- 0.04 microg\/mL) was observed during the 24-h examination period after dosing.","849":"The bioavailability of rafoxanide was compared after intraruminal and intra-abomasal administration in healthy adult sheep (n = 6) in a single dose, 2 parallel group study at 7.5 mg\/kg. Rafoxanide concentrations in plasma were measured by means of HPLC analysis. Primary pharmacokinetic parameters for bioavailability and disposition of rafoxanide in plasma for both routes of administration were determined by non-compartmental and non-linear, 1-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis, respectively. Significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) higher peak plasma concentrations (c(max)) of rafoxanide and a more rapid rate of absorption (c. 3.5 times) was observed in sheep after intra-abomasal (i-a) administration compared to intraruminal (i.r.) administration. A significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) longer lag period (t(lag)) before absorption (6.8 +\/- 2.9 h) occurred after i.r. than after i-a treatment (1.9 +\/- 0.6 h). There was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in AUC, MRT and in the rates of elimination (k10-HL and t(1\/2beta)) between the i.r. and i-a routes of administration. The results of the study demonstrated the important influence of the rumino-reticulum on absorption of rafoxanide in sheep.","850":"The halogenated salicylanilides are a large group of compounds developed mainly for their antiparasitic activity in animals. Several halogenated salicylanilides with potent antiparasitic activity have been synthesised of which only closantel, niclosamide, oxyclozanide, rafoxanide and resorantel are commercially available. Closantel and rafoxanide, which represent the most important drugs in the group, are used extensively for the control of Haemonchus spp. and Fasciola spp. infestations in sheep and cattle and Oestrus ovis in sheep in many parts of the world. Niclosamide is used extensively for its anticestodal activity in a wide range of animals. Antiparasitic activity of the halogenated salicylanilides has also been demonstrated against a large number of other internal parasites, in particular haematophagous helminths, and external parasites including ticks and mites, in a variety of animal species. Several cases of toxicity and mortality have been reported for closantel and rafoxanide in sheep and goats. Their unique pharmacokinetic behaviour appears to play an important role in the efficacy and safety of these compounds. The chemical and physical characteristics, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, antiparasitic activity and toxicity of the halogenated salicylanilides in animals are reviewed.","851":"","852":"A systemic disease associated with pyrexia, lymphadenopathy, and arthropathy of several joints of the appendicular skeleton in a dog is described. Chlamydia-like organisms were detected on light-microscopic examination of a smear made from joint fluid aspirated from one of the affected joints. A group-specific lipopolysaccharide antigen shared by all Chlamydia spp. was demonstrated by direct fluorescent antibody staining of joint fluid, which also proved positive for chlamydia by means of the relevant polymerase chain reaction test. An indirect fluorescent antibody test on serum was also positive, although the complement fixation test was negative. Attempts to grow the organism from joint aspirates in the yolk sac of embryonating hens' eggs and on appropriate tissue cultures, however, failed. Chlamydia spp. are considered to have played an aetiological role in this case, making it the first substantiated case of naturally-occurring arthropathy in a dog due to chlamydiosis. The origin of the infection could not be traced.","853":"Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast-like organism associated with pulmonary, meningoencephalitic, or systemic disease. This case report documents 2 cases of cryptococcosis with central nervous system involvement in captive cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). In both cases the predominant post mortal lesions were pulmonary cryptococcomas and extensive meningoencephalomyelitis. Both cheetahs tested negative for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus. The organism isolated in Case 2 was classified as Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii, which is mainly associated with disease in immunocompetent hosts.","854":"Three case studies involving Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona outbreaks within mixed farming systems in South Africa are described. On 2 farms, pigs constituted the main enterprise with cattle and sheep of secondary importance. On each of these 2 farms, abortion due to L. pomona in sows was confirmed by culture, and antibody titres to pomona were detected in cattle, sheep, horses and dogs. On the 3rd farm, a piggery was of secondary importance to cattle farming. Abortion and death in cows occurred on this farm and serology showed titres to various serovars, including pomona. L. pomona was also isolated from bovine urine, an aborted bovine foetus and kidneys from slaughtered pigs. This particular case study was regarded as clinically atypical in that adult Jersey cattle died of acute leptospirosis in a semiarid region of South Africa. In all 3 case studies, the poor management of pig effluent and of the drinking water and its sources played a pivotal role in the transmission of the disease. Inadequate vaccination of animals against Leptospira and poor record-keeping within the secondary farming enterprises were also contributing factors to the spread of leptospirosis.","855":"A 1-year-old Irish wolfhound was presented with a history of slowly progressive left pelvic limb paresis. A neurological examination demonstrated bilateral deficits referable to the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid contained neoplastic cells. An intradural, extramedullary mass was demonstrated by myelography at the caudal aspect of T13. Surgical excision was abandoned owing to severe macroscopic damage to, and apparent infiltration of, the cord, and the dog was euthanased. The tumour was diagnosed histologically as an extrarenal nephroblastoma. Nephroblastoma should be suspected in young, large-breed dogs with intradural extramedullary masses over spinal segments T10-L2. The prognosis for complete recovery after surgical excision is guarded to poor.","856":"This paper describes a primary health care approach to an infestation of indigenous goats by the common cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis. The flea species was identified using scanning electron microscopy. The infested goats were kept on communal grazing at Winterveld in the North-West Province. They were penned at night in housing made of wire and corrugated iron. The owner complained that the goats were lethargic. Fleas were found on the goats and flea larvae were found in the kraal. Haematology and blood biochemistry performed on the infested goats revealed no abnormalities; however, infestation caused irritation that made the animals lethargic. Available flea control methods for domestic animals were appraised in terms of cost, availability and ease of administration at a primary animal health care level using participatory extension methods. It was found that a carbamate powder was available, affordable and effective for flea control in this small flock of goats kept under communal grazing conditions. Although the authors had observed fleas on goats kept under similar conditions elsewhere in Mpumalanga and the North-West Province, this was the 1st time that the species had been identified.","857":"A study on the semen obtained from breeding goats suffering from mild to severe chronic besnoitiosis revealed marked changes in semen volume, colour, density, concentration, mass and individual motility and percentage live. There were also many neutrophils and spermatozoa with primary and secondary defects, including missing tails and deformed heads and tails. The observed changes were considered to be severe enough to account for the infertility observed in the flock. Sections of testes obtained for histopathology were characterised by massive blockage of the pampiniform plexus, degeneration of the germinal epithelium, tubular necrosis with an inflammatory infiltrate and, in some cases, accumulation of haemosiderin-like material in the tunica vaginalis.","858":"The objective of the study was to outline the characteristics of the development of hypertension and some neurohumoral, haematological and morphological factors contributing to development of high blood pressure in a genetic model of salt-sensitive rat. Characteristics of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats, as compared to their Dahl salt-resistant (DR) controls were as follows: 1) DS rats display higher blood pressure and lower heart rate compared to DR rats as early as 1 month of age at weaning). They gradually develop hypertension at 2 months of age, irrespective of diet. Low-Na diet (0.5% NaCl) does not prevent hypertension but delays its development and ameliorates it. High Na-diet (8% NaCl) exacerbates hypertension. 2) DS rats have retardation in body weight gain. They develop mild hypochromic anaemia. 3) After 2 months of Na loading (3 months of age), DS rats express significantly increased Na and water retention and increased plasma volume by 15% compared to 2.8% increase in DR rats on high-Na diet. 4) DS rats showed renal parenchymal lesions, more pronounced after Na-loading, focal atrophy of cortical tubules, mesangial matrix expansion and glomerulosclerosis. Consistent with high blood pressure were changes in renal arterioles, fibromuscular proliferation, deposition of fibrinoid material in intima. 5) Sodium loading produced increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and sodium restriction reduced SNS responsiveness.","859":"Increased dietary protein consumption is thought to cause calciuresis, a negative calcium balance and increased bone loss that may result in skeletal deformities and fracture. To explore this hypothesis, 40 approximately 100-day-old meat-type Merino ram lambs were fed, for 6 months, diets with an increasing crude protein (CP) content (114, 142, 171 and 190 g\/kg DM) but approximately on an iso-nutrient basis with regard to metabolisable energy, calcium and phosphorus. Increased protein consumption modestly (NS) enhanced calciuresis and resulted in significant (P &lt; or = 0.01) limb skewness. This could not, however, be ascribed to osteopaenic bones, and compared with animals consuming lower protein rations, the bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral trabecular bone volume of animals fed high protein diets were significantly increased: the BMD of thoracic vertebrae was positively related to the CP intake (r = 0.62; P &lt; or = 0.001). In animals consuming higher protein diets, skeletal radiology and quantitative bone histology revealed no evidence of increased bone turnover as would be expected in animals that are in negative calcium balance. No relationship existed between limb skewness and the growth rate of lambs. However, the ratio of Ca:P in the forelimb (r = -0.98), vertebrae (r = -0.72) and rib (r = -0.42) was found to be inversely correlated with increased protein intake and resulted from an increase in the phosphorus content of bone, while the amount of bone calcium was unaffected. We conclude that qualitative micro-architectural abnormalities, and not mere bone loss, may underlie the skeletal deformities induced by increased protein consumption in sheep.","860":"In order to establish the incidence of vacuum phenomenon in horses' carpal, metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, stress-flexed radiographs were made of normal joints, joints with known pathology and in anaesthetised horses with joints under traction. Focal intra-articular radiolucencies were identified in normal stress-flexed carpal, metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. These radiolucencies can be confused with those associated with pathological conditions.","861":"","862":"","863":"Blood transfusion therapy is often under-utilised in feline practice in South Africa. However, it is a technique that can be safely and effectively introduced in practice. Cats have naturally occurring allo-antibodies against the blood type that they lack, which makes blood typing, or alternatively cross-matching, essential before transfusions. Feline blood donors must be carefully selected, be disease free and should be sedated before blood collection. The preferred anticoagulant for feline blood collection is citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine. Blood can either be administered intravenously or into the medullary cavity, with the transfusion rate depending on the cat's hydration status and cardiac function. Transfusion reactions can be immediate or delayed and they are classified as immunological or non-immunological. Indications, methods and techniques to do feline blood transfusions in a safe and economical way are highlighted.","864":"Clinical disease caused by feline herpesvirus type-1 in wild felid species is similar to that in domestic cats. Herpesviruses are endemic in free-ranging lions in South Africa but actual clinical disease due to them has not been reported in free-ranging felids. The first reports of feline herpesvirus infection associated with clinical disease in wild felids came from Australia and the USA in 1970. Subsequent reports of clinical disease in cheetahs and other wild felid species were limited to captive animals. This report deals with clinical disease in a group of semi-captive cheetahs in which 18 animals were affected, and included 12 adult males, 4 adult females and 2 subadults. No mortalities occurred in this group, the most common clinical signs being sneezing, nasal discharge and loss of appetite.","865":"A Holstein cow of high genetic merit, in late lactation (205 days) and diagnosed with salpingitis (after 4 infertile services and veterinary consultation), was subjected to 1 trans-vaginal oocyte collection attempt, prior to slaughter. Of an estimated 10 follicles punctured, a total of 4 cumulus-oocyte complexes were retrieved. These were matured in vitro in a maturation medium for 24 hours. After 24 hours maturation, the oocytes were fertilised in vitro with Percoll-processed frozen\/thawed imported semen, of the owner's choice. Fertilisation was achieved in a modified Tyrode's medium. At 18 hours post-insemination, the presumptive zygotes were transferred into culture in vitro in Charles Rosenkran's amino-acid medium and supplemented on Day 4 post-insemination with 10% foetal calf serum. All in vitro procedures were conducted in 50 microl medium droplets, under oil, in a humidified incubator at 38.5 degrees C in 5% CO2 in air. Three of the potential zygotes cleaved and, by Day 7 of culture, these had developed to the morula stage. The embryos were frozen in 1.5 M ethylene glycol and later transferred non-surgically to synchronised Holstein recipient heifers. One morula resulted in the only pregnancy and subsequent birth of a healthy heifer calf. An independent commercial company confirmed parentage through standard blood-typing assays. The genetic salvage of oocytes, for in vitro production of embryos, has potential benefits to the producer.","866":"A 7-year-old Brahman cow was diagnosed as suffering from chronic foetal mummification of unknown aetiology, concurrent cystic ovarian disease, prolapse of the 2nd cervical ring and chronic cervicitis. Repeated treatment with prostaglandin F2alpha and oestrogen failed to resolve the mummification. A hysterotomy was performed via an incision in the dorsolateral vaginal wall. Good exposure of the uterine horn was achieved and mild post-operative complications were observed. Colpotomy can be regarded as an alternative surgical approach to the moderately enlarged bovine uterus.","867":"Xylazine, midazolam and a midazolam\/ketamine combination were administered to 6 goats in a randomised 3-way block design. All goats received all treatments with at least a 7-day interval between treatments. Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) changes were observed in some of the measured cardiopulmonary variables for xylazine and midazolam\/ ketamine. Xylazine administration resulted in statistically significant decreases in minute volume, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. The increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide was not statistically significant. For the midazolam\/ketamine combination, the decrease in tidal volume was statistically significant, but not the decrease in minute volume and increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The decrease in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was also statistically significant. The mean arterial blood pressure for the combination was statistically significantly higher compared to xylazine. The changes in cardiopulmonary variables after midazolam administration were not statistically significant, such as tidal and minute volume, arterial partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, clinically significant effects such as hypoventilation and hypoxia were observed after its administration. The change in mean arterial blood pressure was minimal.","868":"In an attempt to assess the possible risk to humans of soil-transmitted canine helminths of of zoonotic significance, 161 faecal samples and 81 soil samples were collected from 6 public parks and playgrounds in Harare between March and June 1998 and examined for nematode ova. Of the 161 faecal samples collected, 17.4% were positive for Ancylostoma sp. ova and 5.6% were positive for T. canis ova. No other nematode species ova were found. Over 50% of the faecal samples positive for Ancylostoma sp. ova were 'moist', and this suggests that the moisture content of faeces contributes to the development and survival of this parasite in the environment. Only 3 of the 81 soil samples collected were positive for T. canis. The low levels of contamination of public playgrounds and parks with T. canis ova suggests that environmental contamination might not be important in the aetiology of human toxocarosis in Harare.","869":"Butorphanol and detomidine constitute an effective combination for sedation and analgesia in horses. This trial was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this combination in donkeys. The detomidine and butorphanol were given intravenously one after the other. A dose of 10 microg\/kg of detomidine and 25 microg\/kg of butorphanol was used. Sedation is easily extended by additional doses of butorphanol. The average dose of detomidine was 11.24 microg\/kg and that of butorphanol was 28.0 microg\/kg. Four donkeys in the detomidine group required additional sedation and analgesia. Detomidine alone did not totally eliminate coronary band pain. Heart rates dropped significantly in the first minute after the injection of the combination. One donkey developed an atrioventricular block, while another developed a sino-atrial block. Four donkeys developed a Cheyne-Stokes respiratory pattern. The combination of detomidine and butorphanol is an effective combination for sedation and analgesia of donkeys for standing procedures.","870":"A commercial fertiliser, consisting of a poorly soluble barium selenate core with a coating of highly soluble sodium selenite, was evaluated in 2 trials for the provision of selenium (Se) to grazing sheep. The fertiliser was administered at a level of 1 kg per hectare to 3 of 6 kikuyu paddocks during 1995 and 1996 in Trial 1, while the other paddocks were left untreated. The Se status of SA mutton merino ram lambs, as reflected by whole blood, liver and kidney Se concentrations, was elevated (P &lt; 0.01) for at least 5 months after application of the fertiliser. Whole blood and liver Se concentrations of animals grazing unfertilised control paddocks were indicative of a subclinical Se deficiency at times (&lt;100 ng Se\/ml whole blood and &lt;300 microg Se\/kg liver dry matter). In Trial 2, 4 of 7 paddocks on which an oat fodder crop was established were treated with the Se fertiliser during 1995 and 1997. The remaining 3 paddocks were left unfertilised as controls. Groups of 10-15 pregnant SA mutton merino ewes were introduced to these paddocks within 2 weeks of parturition. These ewes and their progeny utilised these paddocks for a mean (+\/- SD) period of 41 +\/- 8 days after parturition. The whole blood Se concentrations of these ewes and their offspring were elevated (P &lt; 0.01) relative to their contemporaries utilising control paddocks. No suggestion of a subclinical Se deficiency was discernible in animals grazing control paddocks, although whole blood Se levels approached 100 ng Se\/ml during 1997. The application of Se fertiliser did not result in improvements in ewe reproduction or lamb growth. There was a suggestion of an improvement (P = 0.21) in mean (+\/- SE) lamb survival on paddocks receiving Se fertiliser compared to control paddocks (71.5 +\/- 4.6% vs 62.2 +\/- 5.3% respectively).","871":"A workshop was held at Onderstepoort to set priorities in veterinary helminthology for South Africa. Representatives from 19 organisations attended. The workshop achieved 2 of the 3 aims set, namely to identify the problems within the field and to develop strategies to address these challenges. The 7 strategies proposed are: motivation, education, therapeutic, worm resistance, animal tolerance, biological control and diagnostic strategies. A follow-up session is being planned to formulate action plans for each sphere.","872":"Various types of information contribute to the selection of an antimicrobial agent. Initial requirements are diagnosis of the site and nature of the infection, assessment of the severity of the infectious process and medical condition of the diseased animal; these are embodied in clinical experience. Additional considerations include identification of the causative pathogenic microorganism, knowledge of its susceptibility to antimicrobial agents (microbiological considerations) and of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug of choice and alternative drugs, and their potential toxicity (pharmacological considerations) in the animal species. Select an antimicrobial drug and dosage form appropriate for use in the particular animal species. Usual dosage regimens may be applied, except in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment, when either modified dosage or a drug belonging to another class should be used. The duration of therapy is determined by monitoring the response both by clinical assessment and bacterial culture. A favourable clinical response is the ultimate criterion of successful therapy.","873":"Persistent dermatomycosis (ringworm) caused by Trichophyton verrucosum affected 20 dairy calves aged between 3 months and 1 year and housed together. The infection also spread to 2 animal attendants working among the calves. The major clinical lesions observed on the affected calves were extensive alopecia and\/or circumscribed thick hairless skin patches affecting the head, neck, flanks and limbs. The observed lesions persisted for more than 17 weeks and most of the calves did not respond to topical treatment with various anti-fungal drugs within the anticipated period of 9 weeks. Two animal attendants developed skin lesions that were circumscribed and itchy and there was good response to treatment following the application of anti-fungal skin ointment. Although ringworm in dairy animals in Kenya has not previously been associated with spread to humans, the potential is evident from this report.","874":"Five cases of Mokola virus, a lyssavirus related to rabies, are described. The cases occurred in cats from the East London, Pinetown and Pietermaritzburg areas of South Africa from February 1996 to February 1998. Each of the cats was suspected of being rabid and their brains were submitted for laboratory confirmation. Four of the cases were positive, but with atypical fluorescence, and 1 was negative. Mokola virus infection was identified by anti-lyssavirus nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody typing. As in rabies cases, the predominant clinical signs were of unusual behaviour. Aggression was present, but only during handling. Four of the 5 cats had been vaccinated for rabies, which is consistent with other studies that show that rabies vaccination does not appear to protect against Mokola virus. Since Mokola may be confused with rabies, the incidence of Mokola virus may be more common in Africa than is currently reported. As human infections may be fatal, the emergence of this virus is a potential threat to public health.","875":"A Belgian shepherd dog aged 4 years and 9 months was presented with acute onset of non-weight bearing lameness and stifle effusion of the left hind limb, caused by the deep form of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma originating in the deep musculature and fascia surrounding the stifle joint. The tumour progressed rapidly in the tissues along the femoral diaphysis with marked periosteal new bone formation. Cytology of a stifle joint aspirate revealed numerous large polygonal neoplastic cells with considerable anisocytosis and anisokaryosis. These cells were present in clusters, with cytoplasmic projections between the cells, but occasionally also occurred singly. Several cells contained multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles and occasional giant cells were also encountered. Adequate tumour-free margins were not possible with radical limb amputation and the dog was euthanased. Macroscopically the tumour appeared as an extensive pale tan, firm mass with scattered small haemorrhages and foci of yellow discolouration. Histologically the tumour consisted of dense neoplastic expanses or multiple nodules, composed of spindle-shaped fibroblastic cells, polygonal histiocytic cells or cell clusters and scattered giant cells with 2-3 nuclei. The polygonal neoplastic cells were frequently present around and invading lymphatics and blood vessels, causing neoplastic emboli. This is the 1st report of the clinical behaviour, radiography and cytology of the deep form of malignant fibrous histiocytoma in the dog.","876":"Calves 1-2 months old were experimentally infected with eggs of Taenia saginata and clinical and haematological deviations, development and distribution of cysticerci and pathological changes were recorded. The calves infected with 5,000, 10,000 or 50,000 eggs showed an increase in pulse and respiratory rates. The animals that received 50,000 eggs had significantly increased pulse (p &lt; 0.05) and respiratory rates (p &lt; 0.005). The symptoms were more severe in young, 30-day-old calves infected with 50,000 eggs. Haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit values and red blood cell count decreased, but white blood cell count increased slightly. Lymphocytes and eosinophils also increased up to 88% and 14% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. Most of the cysticerci were not fully formed 1 month post-infection, but at 2 months the cysts were fully mature and at 4 months, some cysts had degenerated. There was no uniform pattern of distribution of cysticerci in the body of infected calves, but the most commonly affected sites were masseter and heart muscles, followed by diaphragm, tongue and other skeletal muscles. The maximum concentration of 8-14 cysticerci per 10 g of tissue was recorded in masseter muscles and heart. The affected parts revealed tissue reactions that included pressure atrophy, necrosis and fibrosis. Microscopically, the lesions comprised infiltration with lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and macrophages, fibrosis, necrosis and calcification. The tissue reaction was severe in calves infected with 50,000 eggs. The severity of clinical signs, haematological and pathological changes depended mostly on the age of the animals and dose of infection.","877":"Sixty-four Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arab mares aged 6-12 years were randomly allocated to 4 dietary groups and fed diets that differed in the total protein content and quality (essential amino-acids). Forty mares were non-lactating and 24 lactating. Eight mares were withdrawn from the investigation owing to injuries or gynaecological pathology. An overall conception rate of 94.6% and a foaling rate of 80% was achieved. Five of 14 (35.7%) mares (Group 1) fed a low-quality protein diet suffered from early embryonic loss before 90 days of pregnancy compared to 3 of 41 (7.3%) mares in the remaining groups that received the higher-quality protein in their diets. Serum progestagen concentrations of mares in Group 1 that suffered foetal loss were indicative of luteal function insufficiency during the 1st 40 days post-ovulation. Non-lactating mares in all 4 groups gained on average approximately 30 kg in mass during the 90 days before the breeding period. Lactating mares in Group 1 (low-quality protein) lost on average 25 kg in mass during lactation, with no weight loss observed among the lactating mares in the other 3 groups. No difference in the diameter of the embryonic vesicle was found between dietary groups until Day 35 of pregnancy.","878":"Sixty-four Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arab mares aged 6-12 years were used, of which 40 were non-lactating and 24 lactating. Foals from these 24 mares were weaned at the age of 6 months. Non-lactating and lactating mares were divided into 4 dietary groups each. The total daily protein intake and the protein quality (essential amino-acid content) differed in the 4 groups of non-lactating and 4 groups of lactating mares. The mares were covered and the effect of the quantity and quality of dietary protein on serum progestagen concentrations during pregnancy was studied. A sharp decline in serum progestagen concentrations was recorded in all dietary groups from Days 18 to 40 of pregnancy, with some individual mares reaching values of less than 4 ng\/ml. Serum progestagen concentrations recorded in some of the non-lactating mares on the low-quality protein diet increased to higher values (p &lt; 0.05) than those of mares in the other 3 dietary groups at 35-140 days of pregnancy. A similar trend was observed for the lactating mares on a low-quality protein diet at 30-84 days of pregnancy. No such trends were observed in any of the other dietary groups. High-quality protein supplementation increased serum progestagen concentrations during the 1st 30 days of pregnancy. Lactation depressed serum progestagen concentrations until after the foals were weaned.","879":"The cortisol response to anaesthesia and surgery was studied in 2 groups of horses undergoing either abdominal or non-abdominal surgery. The preoperative mean plasma cortisol concentration (pcc) of 381.7 nmol\/l (s.d. 254.7) was markedly higher in the abdominal group than the early-morning mean pcc of 115.6 nmol\/l (s.d. 78.4) in the non-abdominal group. During halothane anaesthesia and surgery the mean pcc increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from the preoperative mean of 119.2 to 215.9 nmol\/l (s.d. 79.8) after 30 min of surgery in the non-abdominal group. In the abdominal group a decrease occurred after induction of anaesthesia and surgical preparation, but increased during surgery to a mean pcc of 418.1 nmol\/l (s.d. 236.5). In the postoperative period a large decrease in the mean pcc occurred after 24 h in the abdominal group. It was only after 60 h that the pcc (153.2 nmol\/l) equalled the pcc of the non-abdominal group (171.4 nmol\/l) at 24 h. The slow decline over 60 h could be an indication of the prolonged recovery associated with abdominal surgery in the horse.","880":"Diuretics, in particular furosemide, are generally recommended as a supportive treatment in the advanced stages of heartwater in ruminants. However, after what appeared to be possible adverse effects accompanying its use in field cases of heartwater, the effects of this drug on certain blood and urine parameters were investigated in normal sheep at the same dose rates. Diuresis with concomitant natriuresis was significant after furosemide administration, as was the expected plasma volume decrease. Other significant changes included metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and reduced blood ionised calcium. The difference in duration of the diuretic effect and the duration of the changes in blood parameters from c. 3 h and c. 6 h respectively make it difficult to determine a time interval between successive treatments with furosemide. It appears that the probable cause of death of sheep with heartwater is a drastic reduction in blood volume and decreased cardiac output that leads to general circulatory failure. A therapeutic approach that involves further loss of plasma volume due to diuresis appears contradictory. The added effects of potentiating respiratory alkalosis and the terminal drop in blood ionised calcium seen in heartwater-affected animals indicate that the use of furosemide in supportive treatment of this disease is not warranted.","881":"Sera from 161 dogs in the Bloemfontein area in South Africa were tested for the presence of antibodies reactive with Ehrlichia canis and E. chaffeensis by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Overall, 68 (42%) of the dogs had significant antibody titres (&gt; or = 1\/64) against E. canis and 61 (38%) had significant titres (&gt; or = 1\/64) against E. chaffeensis. Seven (11%) dogs had higher titres to E. chaffeensis than E. canis (1\/2048 and 1\/1024 (2 dogs); 1\/1024 and 1\/512 (2 dogs); 1\/2048 and 1\/512; 1\/512 and 1\/256 and 1\/512 and &lt; 1\/64, respectively). The remaining seropositive dogs had equal (n = 26; 42%) or 2-(n = 17; 25%), 3-(n = 13; 2%) or 4-fold (n = 5; 7%) higher titres against E. canis. Dogs from economically depressed, high-density suburbs (60\/112; 48%) had significantly higher prevalences of antibodies against E. canis than those from more affluent, low-density suburbs (8\/49; 14%) (chi 2 = 19.38, p &lt; 0.001). Higher titres to E. chaffeensis than E. canis were found in dogs from affluent, low-density suburbs (3\/49) and in dogs from economically depressed, high-density suburbs (4\/112).","882":"Genetic variability at 7 blood-group and 10 biochemical genetic loci was examined in 3 South African horse breeds, the Nooitgedacht, Boerperd and Basuto Pony. Observed heterozygosity for these breeds was intermediate for domestic horses, with the highest heterozygosity in the Boerperd and the lowest in the Basuto Pony. The 3 breeds show greater genetic similarity to each other than to other domestic horse breeds. Compared to other breeds, the South African breeds show greater genetic similarity to breeds such as the Thoroughbred, Holstein, Trakehner and Hanovarian and also to North American breeds such as the Saddlebred, Standardbred and Morgan Horse.","883":"","884":"","885":"Digital skin lesions and lameness of several weeks duration, with a morbidity rate of 28.3%, was reported in a group of 60 Holstein-Israeli dairy cows in various stages of lactation. A clinical survey was performed to monitor recovery and to confirm eradication of bovine papillomatous digital dermatitis in the herd. The combined effects of intensive individual treatment of the 4 lame cattle with procaine penicillin and metronidazole, and subjecting all animals in the herd to a foot bath with a solution composed of formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide twice a week for 12 weeks, were found to achieve a dramatic positive response in all affected cows in the herd. During a 1-year follow-up period no recurrence and\/or new cases have been diagnosed.","886":"Repair of parotid duct lacerations in 2 horses is described using intraluminal silastic tubing as a stent. The duct was lacerated traumatically at the facial vessel notch (incisura vasorum facialium) in the 1st horse, and iatrogenically after removal of an intraluminal sialolith after development of infection within the duct in the 2nd horse. In both cases, a silastic tube was passed retrograde into the duct via the salivary papilla, past the wound until the end lay rostroventral to the parotid salivary gland. The severed salivary ducts and the wounds were sutured. The external portion of the silastic tube was sutured to the skin and the tube left in place. Recovery in the 1st case was uneventful. In the 2nd case a salivary duct\/cutaneous fistula formed at a wound distant from the sutured wound, which healed spontaneously. This technique differs from a similar described technique in that the stent tube exits the oral cavity and is attached to the outer skin surface.","887":"Ovine lymphosarcoma was diagnosed clinically in a 5-year-old Blackhead sheep in Kenya, and confirmed on blood smear, leukocyte count and macroscopic pathology. Four progeny of the ewe were examined. They were normal haematologically but 2 revealed bilaterally enlarged lymph nodes.","888":"A case of multiple dermoid sinuses in the dorsal cervical and craniothoracic regions in an adult chow chow dog is described. One sinus did not open on the skin surface. This is the first reported case of the condition in this breed and the first time absence of the sinus opening on the skin is described. The use of the term pilonidal sinus to describe this condition is challenged.","889":"Mycobacteriosis was diagnosed for the first time outside a national park in free-ranging wild animals on a game ranch in Zambia. A Kafue lechwe (Kobus leche kafuensis) was found dead with tuberculous lesions on a ranch near Lusaka. Acid-fast bacilli were found in the affected organs. Mycobacteria were isolated from these tissues. A bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) was found dead on the same ranch with multiple superficial abscesses in the neck region, extensive granulomatous lesions in the lung, the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes and several nodular lesions in the spleen. Few acid-fast bacilli were found in the exudate from the abscesses and lesions in the affected organs. Histologically the lesions resembled those of tuberculosis, but mycobacteria could not be isolated. In addition, 1 Kafue lechwe among 37 wild ungulates of 13 species shot on the ranch showed typical tuberculous lesions in the lungs, but the diagnosis was not confirmed by bacterial isolation. The role of the Kafue lechwe as maintenance host for tuberculosis as well as in the possible spread of this disease to other wildlife are discussed.","890":"The management of pain in patients with burn wounds is complex and problematic. Burn-wound pain is severe, inconsistent and underestimated. Patients experience severe pain, especially during procedures, until wound healing has occurred. A multi-modality approach is needed for effective management of pain, which requires an understanding of the mechanisms of pain. Altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in burn-wound patients makes drug actions unpredictable. Opioids alone are seldom sufficient for pain control. The multi-modality approach includes the use of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic and alternative drugs. Ketamine has been found to be a useful agent for analgesia in burn-wound patients; a dose of 10 mg\/kg qid per os was found to be an effective adjunct to pain therapy.","891":"The seasonal occurrence of coccidial oocysts was determined in a mixed herd of indigenous goats and cross-bred sheep at Nebo, Northern Province, South Africa. The herd of c. 30 sheep was housed with c. 70 goats in 1 camp. Over a period of 14 months, 114 faecal specimens were collected from sheep and 369 from goats and the number of oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG) determined. The mean OPG value for the adult sheep (1187.9) was significantly (p = 0.035) lower than the mean OPG value for the adult goats (7042.9). The highest mean value was recorded in the adult sheep during March 1996 (3044.4) and in adult goats during June 1995 (51568.7).","892":"Midazolam hydrochloride administered intramuscularly at a dosage of 0.4 mg\/kg induced sedation and sternal recumbency in goats. Increasing the dosage to 1 mg\/kg resulted in rapid onset of ataxia followed by lateral recumbency, and loss of consciousness. Light surgical anaesthesia lasted for a period of 7-15 min and was suitable for non-painful procedures. Heart rate was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) at both dosage rates, while respiration rate was only increased after midazolam at 0.4 mg\/kg. The combination of midazolam (0.4 mg\/kg) and ketamine hydrochloride (4 mg\/kg) increased heart and respiration rate significantly (p &lt; 0.05). A light plane of surgical anaesthesia suitable for endotracheal intubation was induced, which lasted for a period of 16-39 min.","893":"Pregnant Anglo-Arab and Thoroughbred mares (n = 24) were divided randomly according to age and breed into 4 groups of 6 mares each from approximately 6 weeks before their expected foaling date. Diets received by the 4 groups varied in essential amino-acid and total protein contents. Serum progestagen, FSH and LH concentrations were determined from the day of parturition until foal heat and during the 1st oestrous cycle following foal heat. Serum progestagen, FSH and LH concentrations did not differ between the treatment groups. Progestagen concentrations were high (mean = 7.0: 5.2-16.4 ng\/ml) at parturition but decreased rapidly within 48 h. As progestagen concentrations decreased LH concentrations increased from Days 3-6 post partum to reach maximum values at, or the day after ovulation. FSH concentrations declined 3-4 d after parturition and increased 2-3 d before ovulation at foal heat. The duration of elevated progestagen concentrations during the luteal phase of the subsequent oestrous cycle affected the interovulatory period. A 12-14 d FSH cyclical releasing pattern occurred. Season\/photoperiod affected the resumption of normal oestrous cyclicity during the post partum period. The duration of the 1st oestrous cycle after foal heat in mares fed a low-quality protein diet showed a greater range (13-30 d) compared to mares fed a high-quality protein diet (18-26 d).","894":"Samples of either gut content from ostriches showing symptoms of enteritis, or allantoic fluid of eggs inoculated with ostrich isolates, were examined for the presence of viral agents by direct negative-contrast electron microscopy. Only a few virus types could be identified with certainty, namely a circovirus (1 sample), a coronavirus (1 sample), a member of either the toga- or bunyaviridae (1 sample), enterovirus (16 samples) and paramyxovirus (26 samples). A large number of samples contained structures resembling myxovirus particles that were interpreted as fringed membranous particles of non-viral origin. An unusual observation of probable single-strand nucleocapsid helices, possibly originating from digested plant material and which were identified in a number of small intestine samples, is reported. This is the 1st report of a spectrum of viruses and virus-like particles occurring in enteric samples from ostriches in South Africa. The low incidence and variety of viruses reported here contribute to the multifactorial origin and complexity of enteric disease in ostriches as well as in other birds and mammalian species.","895":"","896":"A case of zoonotic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in a marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is reported. Genomic typing of the relevant M. tuberculosis isolates strongly suggests that the marmoset, which was kept as companion animal, acquired the disease from an infected member in the household who had been treated for pulmonary tuberculosis 8 years prior to this case.","897":"This report concerns an outbreak that occurred during July\/August 1997. Ten pigs from a herd of 181 pigs in a medium-scale, semi-closed piggery in Kiambu District, Kenya, contracted the clinical disease. The main clinical findings in affected pigs included: fever (40.5-41.8 degrees C), prostration, inappetence, dog-sitting posture, abortion, erythema and raised, firm to the touch and easily palpated light pink to dark purple diamond-shaped to square\/rectangular spots on the skin around the belly and the back. Based on the pathognomonic skin lesions, a clinical diagnosis of swine erysipelas was made. The diagnosis was confirmed by the isolation of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae organisms from the blood and skin biopsies taken from the affected pigs. Response to treatment with a combination of procaine penicillin and dihydrostreptomycin at the dosage rate of 20,000 IU\/kg body weight (based on procaine penicillin) for 3 days was good and all the affected pigs recovered fully. The farm was placed under quarantine to prevent spread of the disease.","898":"Ulceration of the gastric pars oesophagea is a common problem in intensive pig production that is often detected at slaughter. A survey was carried out at the Pietersburg abattoir in the Northern Province during a 6-month period. In total, 4320 pig stomachs were examined. Gastro-oesophageal ulcers were observed in 5.1% of the stomachs, gastric erosion in 15.2%, and hyperkeratosis in 18.9%. Time of slaughter was found to affect the prevalence of gastric lesions in the pig.","899":"Stilboestrol tablets (20 x 1 mg) were given to 4 ostriches. Urine was collected over a period of 8 days and stored frozen at-20 degrees C pending analysis. Analyses were performed on a gas chromatograph-mass selective detector for the presence of parent compound and\/or metabolites. Diethylstilbestrol and its metabolite, dienestrol, were detected in urine; dienestrol only for 1 day but diethylstilbestrol for 8 days after administration. Residue analysis for the use of diethylstilbestrol as growth promoter can be performed on the urine of ostriches by scanning for parent compound only since it can be detected longer than the metabolite.","900":"In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was used to compare the efficacy of imidocarb dipropionate and doxycycline on the growth of Ehrlichia canis in DH82 cell cultures. Over a 9-day period there were no significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) in the growth of E. canis in untreated control wells and those to which imidocarb dipropionate was added at 1.2, 2.4, 4.8 or 12 micrograms\/ml for the 1st 3 days. Average infection rates rose from 50 to 55% on day 0 to 100% on day 5 or 6. Doxycycline at 1 microgram\/ml had residual or rickettsiocidal activity against E. canis with the average percentages of DH82 cells infected declining from 51 to 24% while the organism was exposed to the drug (3 days) and from 21 to 2% in the 6 days following removal of the drug from the cell culture medium.","901":"Elbow dysplasia is a non-specific term denoting abnormal development of the elbow. Elbow dysplasia encompasses the clinical and radiographic manifestation of ununited anconeal process, fragmented medical coronoid process, osteochondritis dissecans, erosive cartilage lesions and elbow incongruity. The net result is elbow arthrosis, which may be clinically inapparent or result in marked lameness. These conditions may be diagnosed by means of routine or special radiographic views and other imaging modalities, or the precise cause of the arthrosis or lameness may remain undetermined. Breeds most commonly affected are the rottweiler, Bernese mountain dog, Labrador and golden retriever and the German shepherd dog. Certain breeds are more susceptible to a particular form of elbow dysplasia and more than 1 component may occur simultaneously. The various conditions are thought to result from osteochondrosis of the articular or physeal cartilage that results in disparate growth of the radius and ulna. Heritability has been proven for this polygenic condition and screening programmes to select suitable breeding stock have been initiated in several countries and have decreased the incidence of elbow dysplasia.","902":"","903":"A 9-year-old male German shepherd dog was evaluated for clinical and clinico-pathological changes that were suggestive of Addison's disease. On further investigation the basal plasma cortisol concentration was high, a normal cortisol response to ACTH stimulation occurred, plasma renin activity was elevated and low serum aldosterone concentration was present. A diagnosis of hyperreninaemic hypoaldosteronism was made. Replacement fludrocortisone resulted in complete normalisation of the electrolyte and fluid imbalances. Hyperreninaemic hypoaldosteronism has never been reported in the dog.","904":"Acute Lantana camara poisoning in a Boer goat kid is described. The animal was part of a flock of boer goats that was introduced from the Kalahari thornveld, where the plant does not occur, to an area where the plant grew abundantly. At necropsy, the animal was severely icteric, dehydrated and constipated, with hepatosis, distention of the gall-bladder and nephrosis, but no skin lesions. Histopathological findings of the liver confirmed moderate hepatosis with single-cell necrosis and bile stasis. The pathology is consistent with that described in acute Lantana poisoning in cattle, sheep and goats. The absence of photosensitisation may be attributed to relatively mild liver damage, or the rapid course of this toxicosis.","905":"A sunflower-based feed supplement grossly contaminated with the seed of a Datura sp. resulted in severe signs of poisoning in 2 horses. One horse died peracutely of acute gastric dilatation and rupture following ingestion of the contaminated feed. The 2nd horse developed unresponsive paralytic ileus that led to euthanasia. Examination of the feed and gastrointestinal contents of both horses showed a high proportion of the characteristic Datura sp. seeds. The clinical signs and pathology in both cases were consistent with intoxication by the parasympatholytic alkaloid components of Datura sp.","906":"An adult Ayrshire cow was presented with bilateral hind-limb lameness 5 weeks after routine claw trimming. Examination under intravenous regional anaesthesia revealed ulceration of the sole at the toe of both the right lateral and left medial claws of the hind limbs. Radiographic examination showed osteolysis and pathological fractures of the 3rd phalanx of both affected claws. Wooden blocks were fixed to the 2 healthy claws and the bone fragments were removed using a different technique for each claw. Full recovery followed within 11 weeks. The aetiological factors and treatment options for this condition, which was considered to be caused primarily by incorrect claw trimming, are discussed.","907":"","908":"The stability of cardiodynamic and some blood parameters during a slow, continuous infusion of a combination of ketamine and diazepam is reported. Contractility (dP\/dt), myocardial relaxation (Tln), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), arterial blood pressure and certain blood parameters were assessed in 3 male and 3 female juvenile baboons (Papio ursinus). Anaesthesia was induced with 15 mg\/kg ketamine i.m. and maintained with a continuous i.v. infusion (40-60 ml\/h) of ketamine and diazepam. The mixture consisted of 2 ml ketamine (100 mg\/ml), 2 ml diazepam (5 mg\/ml) and 50 ml saline. A period of 75 +\/- 10 min was allowed for preparation of the animals, after which lead II of the ECG, femoral artery blood pressure and left ventricular pressure were recorded at 15-min intervals for a period of 2 h: the total duration of anaesthesia was 195 min. Arterial blood samples were analysed at 30-min intervals for blood gases, electrolytes, glucose and insulin. Left ventricular parameters were derived from the left ventricular pressure curve. Tln, LVSP and LVEDP showed small fluctuations. Contractility decreased (p &lt; 0.037) at the 195-min interval. No arrhythmias or ECG changes were seen, while blood pressure decreased gradually. Serum calcium concentration decreased and blood glucose levels increased gradually over time. Anaesthesia and analgesia were sufficient and no other drugs were necessary. The animals appeared sedated and dazed 60-80 min after the procedure. A continuous infusion of a combination of ketamine and diazepam for a duration of 150 min can provide stable anaesthesia for cardiodynamic measurements.","909":"Nine dogs with primary bone tumours were treated with Samarium-153-EDTMP (Sm-153-EDTMP). Conventional treatment protocols were precluded by the size of the dogs and the owners' refusal of limb amputation. All the tumours were of the appendicular skeleton; 4 were confirmed osteosarcomas. The other 5 tumours were radiologically suspect for osteosarcoma. Bone scans were performed on all dogs using Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP) before administration of Sm-153-EDTMP. Regions of interest were identified over the contralateral limb at the same site as the tumour and counts per pixel were recorded for the tumour and contralateral limb and expressed as a ratio. The dogs were given 1 injection of 37 MBq\/kg (1 mCi\/kg) of Sm-153-EDTMP intravenously. Thoracic and primary tumour site radiographs were taken at monthly or 2-monthly intervals to monitor progression of the primary tumour and search for evidence of metastasis. Two dogs showed no response to treatment, with an increase in bone pain, and were euthanased within 1 month. In 1 dog, a tumour of the scapula underwent complete involution and the dog is considered free of disease at 20 months post Sm-153-EDTMP treatment. The overall tumourcidal effect of a single dose of Sm-153-EDTMP on primary bone tumours was difficult to evaluate in this group of dogs, as, with one exception, all the primary tumours progressed over time and the dogs were euthanased. Pain control, for which Sm-155-EDTMP is used in man, was not evident, except in the dog that responded completely to treatment.","910":"","911":"In this review an attempt is made to list the most important events in the search for genetic markers in the blood of animals. In chronological order, blood groups, biochemical polymorphisms, lymphocyte antigens and DNA markers have been discovered and used in practice. Of all practical uses, parentage verification and exclusion are regarded as the most important, and it can be said with pride that the South African Stud Book is as infallible as any other stud book in the world.","912":"","913":"","914":"Amanita pantherina poisoning is suspected as the cause of a severe, transient neurological disorder in three 5-week-old German shepherd puppies. There was very strong circumstantial evidence that this mushroom had been eaten, and the signs encountered were similar to those described in confirmed field cases of intoxication in dogs. It was also in many respects consistent with the syndrome seen in humans. A veterinary perspective on the hallucinogenic Amanita spp. is given and the veterinary literature on mushroom intoxication is briefly reviewed as, in contrast to humans, it is not often reported in animals. This is the 1st report of suspected mushroom intoxication of animals in South Africa.","915":"Unilateral segmental uterine horn aplasia was found in 2 mixed-breed bitches. The 1st bitch was presented with clinical signs of acute abdominal pain, and pyometra was suspected. Pyometra was confirmed surgically with rupture of a blind-ending cranial portion of the anomalous right uterine horn, which had resulted in peritonitis. The 2nd bitch was presented for routine ovariohysterectomy. The right uterine horn was affected by segmental aplasia, with mucometra of the cranial portion of the affected horn. Histopathology demonstrated both uteri to have diffuse cystic endometrial hyperplasia. It is postulated that cystic endometrial hyperplasia, together with the congenital anomaly, resulted in pyometra in one case and in mucometra in the other case. This is believed to be the 1st report of uterine horn aplasia in the bitch in association with clinical signs and lesions other than infertility.","916":"A 3-year-old German shepherd dog was presented with a history of lifelong episodic diarrhoea. An adverse reaction to food was considered the most likely cause of the diarrhoea. The dog had received prolonged antibiotic therapy for most of its life as well as receiving probiotics containing the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (syn. S. boulardi) for a year before referral. The probiotic was discontinued 2 months before to referral. Examination and culture of faecal samples identified yeast-like organisms, S. cerevisiae and Candida famata. S. cerevisiae has been isolated from humans in association with predisposing conditions such as prolonged sojourns in hospital, immunosuppression, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and prosthetic devices, but is regarded as non-pathogenic in humans and is rarely associated with disease in animals. C. famata has been isolated from animals, humans and the environment, but is regarded as a very rare pathogen. No evidence of immunosuppression was found in the dog. The presence of yeasts in the faecal isolates and the history of prolonged use of antibiotics and probiotics with a concurrent adverse reaction to food, suggest that conditions may have occurred within the bowel that made it possible for the yeasts to colonise parts of it. This has apparently not been reported before.","917":"A case of right atrial myxosarcoma is described in a Staffordshire bull terrier with a history of weight loss, exercise intolerance and collapse. The diagnosis of an intracavitary cardiac tumour was made on echocardiography. The dog was euthanased. Secondary spread to the lungs and lymph nodes was present. Myxoma is one of the rare intracavitary cardiac tumours and this case is believed to be the 1st report of its more malignant form in the dog.","918":"A survey to detect anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of sheep was conducted on 10 randomly-distributed farms in the Chivhu District, Mashonaland East Province, Zimbabwe. Before the survey, a questionnaire was circulated to the farmers concerning nematode parasite control. Results showed that parasite control using anthelmintic treatment was the only method practised and that the benzimidazoles were the most frequently used anthelmintic drugs. The faecal egg count reduction test was used to detect resistance. The anthelmintic groups tested were benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin. Resistance to benzimidazoles was detected on 6 of 10 farms and levamisole resistance on 2 of 3 farms. Ivermectin resistance was not observed on the farms surveyed. Post-treatment larval cultures indicated that Haemonchus contortus survived administration of fenbendazole, albendazole, oxfendazole and levamisole. A Cooperia sp. strain resistant to albendazole was detected and this is the first report in Zimbabwe of a resistant parasite in this genus.","919":"The diagnostic phase of an interactive research evaluation model was used in the investigation of the animal welfare needs of a low-income urban community in South Africa. Data were gathered by means of a structured interview and direct observations by animal welfare officers. During the survey of 871 animal owners in Soweto, it was found that dogs were owned by 778 households and cats by 88 households. The dog to human ratio was estimated at 1:12.4. Respondents were asked whether they enjoyed owning animals and 96.1% said that they did. Only 26.3% mentioned that they had problems with their own animals and 16.6% had problems with other people's animals. Treatment of sick animals (29.7%) was seen as a priority. However, less than 1% (n = 6) used the services of private veterinarians. Others took their animals to welfare organisations or did not have them treated. Perceptions of affordable costs of veterinary treatments were also recorded. In addition to treatment, respondents indicated a need for vaccination (22.5%), sterilisation (16.5%), control of internal (3.7%) and external (8.8%) parasites, education and extension (6.6%), prevention of cruelty to animals (3.2%) and expansion of veterinary clinics to other parts of Soweto (1.3%).","920":"Conventional methods of ensuring the safety and soundness of cows' milk for human consumption, such as pasteurisation, are not always practical in poor socioeconomic conditions or in rural communities that lack modern amenities. Activation of lactoperoxidase (LP) system and souring of milk were investigated as potential alternative methods to sustain the safety of milk by inhibiting certain microorganisms with known pathogenic potential. The activation of the LP-system inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by the order of 2 log values. The inhibition of Brucella abortus was negligible. The replication of Coxiella burnetti in milk was not disturbed even after 17 h of LP-system activation at 20 degrees C, but the outcome of the LP-system treatment on Mycobacterium bovis could not be determined as the conventional culturing technique used to grow this organism did not allow full recovery. Souring inhibited the growth of S. aureus and E. coli also by the order of 2 log values. From the results obtained in this investigation are concluded that the activation of the LP-system and souring can be used to inhibit the growth of S. aureus and E. coli in cows' milk, thereby increasing its safety.","921":"Wastage is the term used to describe the phenomenon of the loss of racehorses from conception to adulthood due to death or injuries (i.e. they never reach a race-track), or the days lost by racehorses due to not training or being withdrawn from a race. This epizoological study was conducted to investigate wastage in Thoroughbred horses used for flat racing in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Data from 6 racing stables were recorded from 1 March 1993 to 28 February 1994. Each trainer completed a daily training record of the horses in his stable. This questionnaire included reasons why a horse failed to train on a specific day, or was withdrawn from a race. During the year, 8480 days (8.1%) of the 105,108 total potential training days were lost by horses in the stables investigated. Of the days lost, 72.1% were due to lameness, 8.6% to respiratory problems, and 19.3% to other causes. The lost training days for the individual trainers ranged from 5.4 to 12.6%. Of the 579 horses included in the study, 291 horses (50.3%) lost one or more training days; 541 problems resulting in wastage were found in these 291 horses; 263 (48.6%) cases were due to lameness and 49 (9.0%) were caused by coughing. The balance were caused by poor weather conditions (11.3%), vaccinations (7.2%), wounds (4.6%), abnormal haematology results (1.8%), inappetence (2.2%), nasal discharge (2.0%), epistaxis (1.8%), babesiosis (1.8%), miscellaneous other conditions (7.9%) and unknown causes (1.8%). An attempt was made to continue the study for a 2nd year but too few questionnaires were returned. However, it was evident that the percentage of lost training days (8.2%) was similar to that of the previous year. The training days lost due to lameness (66.9%) and respiratory problems (8.4%) were also similar to those of the previous year. From the findings of the present study, it was concluded that lameness and respiratory disorders were the major causes of wastage in Thoroughbred racehorses in Gauteng. Further research into these causes of wastage in racehorses is needed.","922":"The use of broiler litter as an emergency feed during droughts and other periods of feed shortages was evaluated in terms of its effect on the health of sheep. Pure broiler litter (i.e. excreta plus wood shavings), and litter mixed with 7.5 or 15% molasses were fed for 83 days to 2-year-old wethers. The addition of molasses to the litter caused a significant increase (p &lt; 0.01) in feed intake and final body mass. Various parameters such as plasma enzyme activity, plasma metabolite concentrations and urine mineral and purine excretion did not differ among treatments. Histological evaluation revealed no liver or kidney pathology. Mild myocardial pathology was observed in all 3 treatment groups. This seems to be related to the presence of the ionophore-based coccidiostat, narasin, which was present in the litter at a concentration of 10 mg\/kg. It is suggested that these histological lesions are of little practical significance and would not affect the health of sheep being fed the broiler litter as a survival feed.","923":"The effect of total protein intake and protein quality on the serum concentrations of certain reproductive hormones during the anovulatory, transitional and ovulatory periods were studied in 36 Anglo-Arab mares. High-quality protein stimulated FSH and LH production during the late transitional period. Serum progestagen and melatonin concentrations were unaffected by the quality of protein nutrition during the anovulatory period. Mares receiving high-quality protein exhibited a 10-14-day cyclical pattern of FSH release approximately 4-6 weeks earlier than the mares fed the lower-quality protein diet, and also ovulated 3-4 weeks earlier than the mares on the lower-quality protein diet. Progesterone concentrations during the 1st oestrous cycle after the anovulatory period were unaffected by protein quality in the diet.","924":"A clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effects of diminazene aceturate and its stabiliser antipyrine on serum pseudocholinesterase (PChE) and red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC AChE) in dogs with babesiosis. The trial was conducted on naturally occurring, uncomplicated cases of babesiosis (n = 20) that were randomly allocated to groups receiving a standard therapeutic dose of diminazene aceturate with antipyrine stabiliser (n = 10) or antipyrine alone (n = 10). Blood was drawn immediately before and every 15 minutes for 1 hour after treatment. Plasma PChE showed a 4% decrease between 0 and 60 min within the treatment group (p &lt; 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups at any of the time intervals for PChE. There was an increase in RBC AChE activity at 15 min in the treatment group (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups at any time interval for RBC AChE. In view of the difference in PChE, samples from additional, new cases (n = 10) of canine babesiosis were collected to identify the affect of the drug over 12 hours. No significant depression was identified over this time interval. The results suggests that the underlying mechanism in producing side-effects, when they do occur, is unlikely to be through cholinesterase depression.","925":"This report describes the epizootiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of an outbreak of leptospirosis caused by Leptospira canicola in feedlot calves. The infection appeared to be of high morbidity with a cumulative clinical incidence of 15.6%, cumulative subclinical incidence of 39% and high mortality (8.3%). Clinical disease was diagnosed in 4-8-month-old calves, while subclinical infection occurred in 9-12-month-old calves. Subclinical infection was based on serological evidence only. The zoonotic aspects of the infection are emphasised.","926":"Bilateral ovariectomy was performed in 11 mares and unilateral ovariectomy in 2 mares. The horses were standing and sedated for surgery. After appropriate preparation a laparoscope was inserted into the abdomen through the paralumbar fossa and the ovary was identified and anaesthetised with local anaesthetic via a custom-built needle. The ovary was then withdrawn from the abdomen through a separate flank incision and removed. The abdomen was not distended with gas before surgery. This method proved to be minimally invasive, rapid and effective.","927":"The 1st field outbreak of vermeersiekte induced by Geigeria burkei Harv. subsp. burkei var. hirtella Merxm, is reported. It is also the first recorded outbreak of this disease in the arid sweet bushveld of the Northern Province of South Africa. The toxicosis was experimentally reproduced in a sheep following daily intraruminal administration of 2.5-5.0 g\/kg dried, milled plant material for 18 consecutive days. Neither the sheep in the field outbreak nor the ewe in the experiment exhibited any signs of regurgitation of rumen contents (vermeersiekte). All developed only the stiff or paretic\/paralytic forms of the disease. Serum activities of CK and GGT were slightly raised in clinically affected sheep (n = 11) during the field outbreak, and serum activities of AST, GLDH, GGT, LDH and CK increased in the ewe dosed with the plant material. Analysis of dried, milled Geigeria plant material confirms that this species is moderately nutritious.","928":"The performance characteristics of 2 enzyme immunoassays (ELISAs) and 4 latex agglutination assays (LXs) were evaluated for the detection of bovine rotavirus in faecal specimens of young calves with diarrhoea. A total of 26 specimens from calves less than 5 months of age were examined with different commercial assays and compared with electron microscopy (EM) as the gold standard and with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for the detection of atypical, non-group A rotaviruses. In the 2nd study, EIA (Dako) and LX (Murex), the assays of choice, were used to analyse 97 further faecal specimens from calves with diarrhoea. The ELISAs proved to be the most sensitive compared with the other tests used. The EM and PAGE are 100% specific although slightly less sensitive than the commercial assays. The results show that all the commercial assays can accurately detect rotavirus in the stools of calves with gastroenteritis, although the suitability and choice of assay will depend upon the requirements of individual laboratories.","929":"In the main experiment the total daily protein intake and quality (essential amino-acids) was varied in 4 groups of mares. The incidence of oestrus in mares during the transitional period was unaffected by protein nutrition. Ovarian activity, as evaluated by follicular development and size of the ovaries, was affected. Mares that received low-quality protein (Groups 1 and 2) had a higher number of smaller follicles (&lt; 10 mm) that developed during the transitional period compared to mares on a high-quality protein intake (Groups 3 and 4). The mares that received the high quality protein ovulated 2-3 weeks earlier in the breeding season in a synchronised period of 4-5 weeks compared to a period of 6-8 weeks in Groups 1 and 2. The duration of the subsequent oestrous cycles was not affected. There was no difference in the diameter of the largest follicle of mares between groups on the day before ovulation. In a separate experiment, 5 maiden Anglo-Arab mares, 4-5 years of age, were slaughtered at different stages during the anovulatory, transitional and ovulatory periods of the breeding cycle. The morphology of the ovaries and uteri of these mares was described and photographed for use as guidelines when comparing ovarian changes and follicular activity of mares.","930":"The effect of 4 different diets, in terms of protein quantity and quality, on total serum protein (TSP), albumin and globulin was investigated. Non-pregnant mares that were not lactating (n = 36), pregnant mares that had foaled (n = 24) and their foals (n = 24) were used in this study. Daily total protein intake had no effect on blood protein concentrations in the mares. Total protein intake and quality (available essential amino-acids) did affect the body mass of mares during lactation. When mares were fed the minimum recommended (National Research Council 1989) total daily protein, foal mass decreased by approximately 25% at weaning compared to the foals whose dams were on a higher level of protein intake. The TSP concentrations of foals at birth were on average 10 g\/l lower than those of the mares. Albumin concentrations of foals during the first 60 days of life were on average 2-3 g\/l lower than those of the mares. Globulin concentrations of foals were approximately 5 g\/l lower than those of mares at weaning.","931":"Four rations that differed in their crude protein and essential amino-acid content were compiled. Digestibility of the crude protein and essential amino-acid contents were determined biologically in a feeding trial using 4 Anglo-Arab stallions. Their respective daily diets were: Diet 1:2 kg cubes, 5 kg tef hay (Eragrostis tef); Diet 2:2 kg cubes, 5 kg lucerne hay (Medicago sativa); Diet 3:2 kg cubes, 5 kg tef hay, 200 g fishmeal; Diet 4:2 kg cubes, 5 kg lucerne hay, 200 g fishmeal. The concentrations of the amino-acids threonine, iso-leucine, leucine and arginine were increased in the total ration when lucerne hay replaced the tef hay while fishmeal supplementation increased the methionine and lysine contents, which provided a wide-range of concentrations of digestible amino-acids in each of the 4 rations.","932":"Fifteen Friesian oxen between 12 and 18 months of age with a mean body mass of 240.7 kg were randomly assigned to diets containing 0.25% phosphorus (P) or less to evaluate the acute effects of an acidiogenic diet of -11.1 meq\/100 g of diet dry matter, compared with a basiogenic diet of +25.6 meq\/100 g or a control diet of +16.5 meq\/100 g of diet dry matter calculated as (Na + K)-(Cl + S), on blood, bone and faecal P, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) for a period of 9 weeks. Blood, bone and faecal responses to an anionic diet are described. An inverse relationship existed between bone and blood Ca, in which there was resorption from bone with increased blood Ca in response to the anionic diet. The anionic treatment group demonstrated simultaneous increases in bone, blood and faecal P concentrations at various stages of the experiment compared to the cationic and control treatment groups. Results indicate independent absorption and resorption of Ca and P into and out of bone. There was wide variation in the bone Ca:P ratio between 2.02 and 1.51 among animals fed the anionic diet, with the Ca:P ratio following Ca values and not bone P values. Bone and blood P had a linear relationship with dietary cation:anion balance (DCAB), increasing as the diet became more anionic in nature, but faecal P was curvilinear with highest concentrations at -11.1 and +25.6 meq\/100 g compared to +16.5 meq\/100 g. Concurrent blood, bone and faecal P increases at some stages of the experiment indicate a P-sparing effect of the anionic diet and warrants further research into the long-term effects of anions in the diet, leading to their use as a possible addition to improved licks in P-deficient areas.","933":"","934":"A 3-year-old male German shepherd dog was presented with severe generalised seizures. The dog was protein-intolerant and showed severe hyperammonaemia on ammonia stimulation. The hyperammonaemic state was present for at least 6 weeks and then spontaneously resolved. No obvious cause (liver disease, portocaval shunts, urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, drug therapy or urinary tract obstruction) could be identified. It is possible that this dog had a variation of transient hyperammonaemic syndrome, described in man and recently in a juvenile Irish wolfhound, that extended into adulthood.","935":"A 2-year-old cat was presented with generalised muscle tremors and progressive fore- and hindlimb ataxia, 5 months after the initiation of chemotherapy for thymic lymphoma. The lymphoma was treated with combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone), which resulted in remission. The neurological signs progressed to paralysis and the cat subsequently died. On autopsy, multiple meningiomas were diagnosed, which is an unusual finding. It is possible that the lymphoma chemotherapy resulted in the development of the multiple meningiomas as secondary malignancies.","936":"A questionnaire survey of teenagers was conducted in 1995 to discover if the perceptions of the role of the veterinarian in practice differed among 3 cultural groups. Teenagers in their 1st year of secondary school education in 16 schools in the Krugersdorp area were used as the sample. Two thousand and sixty-five questionnaires were processed. A statistically significant difference in perceptions of the role of the veterinarian in practice was found between Black, Indian and White teenagers. Only 19.2% of the Black teenagers and 51.6% of the Indian teenagers had any idea of what a veterinarian did, compared to 88.1% of White teenagers. Similar differences in pet ownership, disease recognition, and veterinary care between the cultural groups were also found. The study emphasised the tremendous need for increased exposure to the veterinary profession within the historically disadvantaged communities of South Africa.","937":"The clinical efficacy of doxycycline (Doxycen, Cenavisa, Spain), a long-acting preparation, was evaluated for treatment of Pasteurella haemolytica infection in 6 goats. One goat was not infected and served as a control. The disease was induced by intratracheal inoculation of 10(7) to 10(9) cfu of P. haemolytica. Confirmation of respiratory disease was based on evidence of appropriate clinical signs. Before and after initiation of doxycycline treatment on day 10, each goat was examined daily. Three clinical responses to doxycycline treatment were noted. Mean rectal temperatures decreased from 40.1 degrees C to normal, while mean respiratory rate decreased from the pre-treatment value of 32 to 27\/min after 4 days. Other clinical signs associated with pneumonia resolved within 3-5 days post treatment. In addition the minimum inhibitory concentration of DOTC for the P. haemolytica isolate was found to be &lt; 0.5 microgram\/ml. The present study indicates that DOTC may be a useful antimicrobial agent in the treatment of caprine pasteurellosis.","938":"Clinical, virological and serological responses were evaluated in 10 pregnant mares after different challenge exposures to the asinine-94 strain of equine arteritis virus (EAV). The outcome of maternal infection on the progeny was also investigated. Mares were inoculated intranasally (n = 4), intramuscularly (n = 2), intravenously (n = 1), or contract-exposed (n = 3). All inoculated mares developed pyrexia, 5 showed mild clinical signs related to EAV infection and 2 remained asymptomatic. Viraemia was detected in all the inoculated animals and shedding of virus from the respiratory tract occurred in 6. Five mares were re-challenged intranasally 7 and 15 weeks after inoculation. Clinical signs of the disease in these mares were limited to mild conjunctivitis. After re-challenge, virus was recovered from buffy coat cultures of 2 mares 2-6 days after re-infection. EAV was not recovered from colostrum and milk samples during the 1st week post partum. All inoculated mares seroconverted to EAV 8-12 days post inoculation and also seroconverted after re-challenge. No clinical signs of EAV infection were observed in the 3 mares kept in close contact during the post-inoculation and re-challenge periods. Serum neutralising antibody to the virus was detected in 1 in-contact mare only, while a detectable concentration of specific IgG was found by ELISA in the colostrum of 1 of the other in-contact mares. Eight of the mares gave birth to clinically normal foals, although 1 was born prematurely. Shortly after birth, 7 foals developed fever and variable clinical signs; 5 foals became septicaemic and 3 of them died 2-5 days after birth, while the remaining 2 were euthanased at 1 month of age. EAV was not recovered from the placenta, from buffy coat fractions of blood collected from foals immediately after birth and 1-3 days later, or from a range of tissues taken from the 3 foals that died and 2 that were euthanased. Virus was not isolated from tissues collected from 1 mare and her foetus 3 weeks after this mare was re-challenged.","939":"A survey conducted in 5 magisterial districts involving rapid rural appraisal and a questionnaire showed participation in state-managed and funded dipping programmes by cattle owners in communal areas of the central Eastern Cape to be nearly complete, with 98% of livestock owners interviewed participating in all dipping events. Disease control was the main reason for participation, but farmers perceive dipping to have a much broader disease-preventing activity than is really the case. Other reasons for participation in dipping programmes were to prevent ticks from sucking blood, provide animals with a clean appearance, and prevent damage to teats of cows. many livestock owners complement dipping with other tick control measures, including old motor oil, household disinfectant, pour-on acaricide and manual removal of ticks. Recently local farming communities were given the responsibility of buying dipping acaricide. This has presented them with the challenge of developing farmer-managed, cost-effective tick control programmes. At present, this process is constrained by lack of information and farmer training.","940":"Perceived causes, diagnosis and treatment of redwater (babesiosis) and gallsickness (anaplasmosis) in cattle by livestock farmers in communal areas of the central Eastern Cape Province were investigated by means of participatory methods, semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey. Most livestock owners relate the causes of these diseases to excessive grazing of lush green grass, which is thought to bring about an accumulation of bile in the body. The majority of livestock owners diagnose gallsickness and redwater on the basis of presenting signs and post mortem findings. Eighty nine percent of a total of 343 livestock owners participating in the study claimed to administer herbal remedies to treat the 2 tick-borne diseases; 75% of these combine herbal remedies with conventional medicines and 25% use herbal remedies only. Application of herbal remedies was reportedly aimed mainly at the removal of excess bile. However, some plant species used to prepare herbal remedies are reported to possess activities ranging from anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, anti-pyretic and purgative, and may be effective in the treatment of gallsickness and redwater. A lack of understanding of the causes and transmission of gallsickness and redwater, leading to ill-directed treatment, and widespread deviation from the directions of use when administering conventional medicines, were identified as problems that could be addressed by farmer training and the supply of appropriate information.","941":"Two thyroidal evaluation systems in euthyroid cats (n = 12) were compared. A single, confirmed hyperthyroid cat was included for interest. Firstly, thyroidal uptake of an intravenous bolus of approximately 111 MBq (3 mCi) 99MTcO4 was estimated by using a scintillation camera and calculating the ratio of thyroid to salivary activities at 20 min and 4 h. Thyroid to salivary activity ratios were 1:1 at 20 min and 2:1 at 4 h. Two discrete areas of salivary uptake were identified, namely a parotid\/mandibular complex and a more rostral buccal\/sublingual complex. These results were compared to radioiodine uptake of an oral dose of approximately 0.925 MBq (25 microCi) 131I using a standard thyroid uptake system, measured at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h after administration. Mean radioiodine thyroidal uptake started at 33% at 1 h, stabilised at 21% between 4 and 24 h, and dropped to 18% at 48 h. There was a significant correlation between the early thyroid:salivary ratio of the parotid\/mandibular complex and the radioiodine uptake at 12 h.","942":"","943":"Osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease is a condition characterised by degeneration of articular cartilage often associated with the formation of new bone at joint surfaces on margins. Commonly encountered in dogs, osteoarthritis may have a gradual onset, but may also occur acutely. Osteoarthritis can be a primary disease of joint cartilage, but is more after secondary to abnormal stresses on joints. This article describes the pathogenesis and progression of cartilage degeneration as well as the dietary, lifestyle and pharmacological management of osteoarthritis. Recent pharmacological developments allow the clinician not only to control clinical signs of the disease, but also to slow the progression of cartilage degeneration.","944":"Field outbreaks of Kalanchoe lanceolata poisoning in cattle on a commercial farm in Zimbabwe are reported. The clinical signs and pathological lesions observed in field cases resembled those reproduced in an experimental cow and were consistent with acute cardiac glycoside poisoning.","945":"The effect of a slow-releasing oxytocin preparation on the ovulation rate of Merino ewes was investigated. Synchronised Merino ewes were subcutaneously injected with a slow-releasing preparation containing 10 IU oxytocin, 48 hours after sponge withdrawal. Laparoscopic examination of the ovaries of all ewes was performed 10 d after the oxytocin treatment in order to determine the number of corpora lutea per ewe. The ovulation rate of the adult ewes of the treated and control groups was 179.1% and 159.1% respectively (p &lt; 0.05) while that of the 2-tooth ewes was 108.3% and 112.8% respectively (p &gt; 0.05). It would appear that a higher ovulation rate can be obtained by a single injection of a slow-releasing oxytocin preparation at the onset of oestrus. The lack of response in the 2-tooth ewes was probably due to their relatively low body weight.","946":"Vermiculite, pine shavings and unbleached eucalyptus pulp contact-bedding were compared using the number of litters and individuals born and weaned, mortality rates at different stages of the lactation period, and the weight increase of pups as evaluation indices for bedding quality. These bedding materials exerted different effects on the reproductive performance of the same mouse strain. The same is true for the effect of a specific bedding material on different mouse strains. These effects are most pronounced during the first 4 days of life. As a whole, the results demonstrated that eucalyptus pulp was the better bedding type, followed by pine shavings and vermiculite. The latter material had a detrimental effect on the mating success of AKR mice.","947":"","948":"","949":"","950":"","951":"","952":"Multifocal fungal (Aspergillus terreus) discospondylitis was diagnosed in 2 German shepherd dogs. In one dog, the aetiology was established by means of fluoroscopic-guided disc aspiration, cytology and culture of disc material and urine. Disseminated aspergillosis was confirmed at necropsy and A. terreus cultured from numerous organs in this dog. The aetiology in the other dog was not established until therapeutic failure forced surgical curettage of disc material from which the fungus was cultured. Ketoconazole therapy failed to effect an improvement, and at necropsy, disease was localised to the spinal column, with A. terreus cultured from the affected discs and associated vertebrae. Immunodeficiency was suspected in both cases. In the case of disseminated disease a reduced lymphocyte blastogenic response was demonstrated. Reduced IgA was shown in both cases. The German shepherd breed seems to be predisposed to Aspergillus infections and IgA deficiency.","953":"A report is given of the 1st confirmed outbreak of Albizia versicolor poisoning in Malawi and the 1st natural outbreak reported in sheep and goats. Approximately 800 animals are estimated to have died over a 9-year period on a government farm near Lake Malawi. Deaths occurred exclusively from August to December when ripe dry pods that fell to the ground were ingested. The major clinical signs were hyperaesthesia, wild running, lateral recumbency with rapid leg movements, nystagmus and rapid blinking. Approximately 75% of clinical cases made a full and rapid recovery. Sheep more often showed signs of poisoning than goats which was attributed to inherent susceptibility rather than selective feeding. The majority of animals affected were under 1 year of age. A series of experiments was conducted and all animals dosed with 6.4 g\/kg or more of dry pods died with typical clinical signs. Although A. versicolor is well known to the local population there appeared to be no appreciation of its toxicity. Poisonings are probably rare under traditional management systems.","954":"An apparatus for collection of free-flow urine from female horses is described. This apparatus is a modification of a similar device described previously. It allows the collection of voided urine from adult female horses without confining them to metabolic stables or resorting to invasive procedures like bladder catheterisation. It is relatively easy to use after a short adaptation period.","955":"The effect of selenium (Se) supplementation of ewes with blood Se concentrations ranging between 100-200 ng\/ml on embryonic survival during the early post-mating period (days 15-35) was studied in 4 trials. In the 1st 2 trials 137 ewes were used in 1991 and 118 in 1992. After being mated as a single flock, these ewes were stratified randomly into 3 groups. One group served as a control, the 2nd was injected with 1 ml Deposel (containing 50 mg Se as Ba selenate) and the 3rd group injected with 1 ml containing 1 mg Se as Na selenite. During 1991, supplementation was administered immediately after the mating period. It was postponed by 14 days in 1992. Parenteral Se supplementation reduced (p &lt; 0.10) the number of ewes that lambed by &gt; 19% during 1991 but not during 1992. The number of ewes producing twins was unaffected. In Trials 3 and 4 there was a consistent indication that parenteral Se supplementation of pregnant ewes between 15-35 days after mating resulted in a reduced (22-40%) embryonic survival rate, although significant (p &lt; or = 0.10) differences were only observed after the pooling of treatments receiving parenteral Se supplementation. Drenching of ewes with 50 mg Se as Na selenite resulted in a similar tendency. Biochemical appraisal of the blood, kidney and liver Se status of ewes failed to reveal toxic levels. The possible mechanisms involved in impaired embryonic survival are unclear. Supplementation of ewes during the 1st month of pregnancy with parenteral Se preparations is not recommended.","956":"Serum samples from yearling Thoroughbred horses (n = 176) in the magisterial districts of Colesberg, Venterstad, and Wodehouse in the Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces were collected between September and November 1995 to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Babesia equi and Babesia caballi in these regions. Samples were examined for specific antibodies using the indirect fluorescent antibody test. The 95% confidence intervals for the prevalence of serum antibodies in the 3 districts combined varied from 47% to 61% for B. equi and from 26% to 40% for B. caballi. Antibody prevalence did not correlate with the known distributions of the tick vectors (Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi and Hyalomma truncatum). Colts had a significantly higher prevalence of antibodies against B. caballi than fillies. No such difference could be determined for B. equi.","957":"Anaesthesia was induced in horses (n = 6) with a mixture of thiopentone and guaiphenesin and maintained by mechanical ventilation with a mixture of oxygen, air and isoflurane. Inspiratory and end-expiratory concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide and isoflurane were measured. Electrocardiography was used to evaluate heart rate and rhythm. Mean systemic arterial pressure (SAPm), pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm), right atrial pressure (RAPm) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) were measured directly. Cardiac output was determined using the thermodilution method. Microcirculation in the upper triceps brachii muscle was estimated using laser Doppler flowmetry. Blood gas values, pH and haemoglobin concentration (Hb) were determined in arterial and mixed venous blood. Baseline values were taken after stabilisation of anaesthesia and were statistically compared to values obtained after an intravenous bolus of detomidine (10 micrograms\/kg) had been injected at Time 0. Samples were then collected at 2, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 min. End-expiratory concentration of isoflurane was maintained at 1.8% during the experimental period described above. Thereafter, the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 1.3% and samples were collected at 60, 70 and 80 min. Detomidine caused a significant reduction of heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), oxygen transport (O2TR) and a significant elevation of the SAPm, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and coefficient of utilisation of oxygen (O2CU) at 2 min. A significant reduction in HR, CI, SAPm, Hb, content of oxygen in arterial blood (CaO2) and O2TR and a significant elevation of O2CU were observed 10-50 min after the injection of detomidine. Reduction of the isoflurane end-expiratory concentration to 1.3% was followed by a progressive improvement of the SAPm, CI and muscle perfusion towards the baseline values. Further reduction of Hb and CaO2 as compared to the baseline values was observed during the period. The data suggest that detomidine potentiates some of the cardiovascular effects of isoflurane in horses.","958":"Renal pathology associated with haemoglobinaemia resulting from Babesia canis infection is ascribed to haemoglobinuria, with or without a contribution from anaemic hypoxia. This study was undertaken to investigate the relative roles of haemoglobinaemia and hypoxia in renal function and pathology in the dog. Three groups of 6 dogs each were used over a 4-day period. The dogs in the 1st group were infused with homologous canine haemoglobin, anaemic hypoxia was induced in the 2nd group, and both treatments were applied in the 3rd group. Full urinalyses, serum urea and creatinine concentrations, fractional clearance of sodium and the activity of urine enzymes, were assessed daily. At the end of the trial period, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined and kidney specimens collected for light and electron microscopy. In the group with hypoxia only, the urine sediment contained more casts and a greater number of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells than in either of the other groups. Hypoxia resulted in greater enzymuria, suggestive of RTE cell pathology, whereas haemoglobinuria did not appear to have any effect on urine enzyme activity. Hypoxia resulted in a decreased GFR. Histological examination revealed a mild, single-cell tubular necrosis in the majority of the animals (all 3 groups), with granular casts in the hypoxic groups. There appeared to be a large individual variation in the ability of the kidney to handle infused haemoglobin. It was concluded that severe haemoglobinaemia did not induce a significant nephropathy, anaemic hypoxia appeared to cause a very mild nephropathy, and the combination of haemoglobinaemia and anaemic hypoxia did not exacerbate this change. These lesions were very different from those described in canine babesiosis.","959":"Substantial evidence has recently accumulated showing domestic cats to be the principal reservoirs of Bartonella henselae, the aetiological agent of human diseases including cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, bacillary peliosis and a febrile bacteraemia syndrome. To determine the prevalence of antibodies reactive with Bartonella henselae in cats from southern Africa, indirect fluorescent antibody assays were carried out on feline sera from South Africa and Zimbabwe. Overall, 23% (39\/171) of cats had antibody titres &gt; or = 1\/64, with cats from Zimbabwe (24%; 28\/119) having higher seroprevalences than those from South Africa (21%; 11\/52) although this difference was not statistically significant. The implications of these findings for veterinarians in southern Africa are discussed.","960":"To commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of rinderpest in South Africa, the historical events leading up to and following this major epidemic are recounted. Its impact on livestock and human populations, as well as initial and eventual successful attempts to control it are discussed.","961":"A male pitbull terrier was presented with a history of stranguria and depression. On clinical and radiological examination a suspected necrogranuloma of the caudal os penis, which obstructed the urethra, was found. The necrogranuloma was removed surgically and contained blood and necrotic tissue as well as several adult male and female Ancylostoma caninum worms. The urethral obstruction resulted in post-renal azotaemia, hydronephrosis and eventually bladder rupture. A rare case of aberrant migration of A. caninum to the os penis of a dog is described.","962":"A Nguni heifer aborted a 6-month-old foetus 35 days after intravenous inoculation with Onderstepoort heartwater vaccine. Histopathological examination of the brain revealed numerous suspected Cowdria ruminantium organisms in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels. The organisms were ultrastructurally and immunohistochemically compatible with Cowdria ruminantium, although, owing to autolysis and cross-reactions, the possibility that they represent another rickettsial or related organism could not be completely excluded. As far as we could ascertain this is the first recorded case of suspected intra-uterine transmission of Cowdria ruminantium in ruminants.","963":"A 4-year-old neutered Rhodesian ridgeback\/dalmatian crossbred bitch was presented with a cervical, dorsal midline cutaneous swelling after 2 unsuccessful attempts at surgical resection of a dermoid sinus. Radiographs of the cervical spine indicated a C2 transosseous communication with the vertebral canal. Ultrasonographic evaluation demonstrated 2 interlinking cavities terminating close to C2. Complete resection of the sinus tract necessitated a partial dorsal laminectomy. Histology confirmed the diagnosis. This case is compared to similar cases in the literature.","964":"Human-animal interaction is regarded as a positive factor in child development, yet fears have been expressed about the risk of zoonotic diseases. A literature review of zoonotic diseases indicated that it was difficult to judge the relative importance of zoonoses in a population by using incidence or prevalence, as these were not available for all the zoonoses which could occur in children and the data which were available were not comparative. Therefore, in order to investigate the relative importance of zoonoses as a cause of disease in children, relative morbidities were calculated from available medical records from the Department of Paedatrics and Child Health at Ga-Rankuwa Hospital. Diagnoses made were listed and ranked. The relative morbidities of zoonotic diseases were found to be very low. It was concluded that this may have been partially due to the tendency for symptomatic rather than aetiological diagnoses to be made by clinicians, as several of the symptomatic diagnoses made (such as respiratory disease and gastroenteritis) could have had a zoonotic aetiology.","965":"The possible role of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Amblyomma hebraeum in the mechanical and transstadial transmission of bovine leukosis virus (BLV) was investigated. BLV-free laboratory strains of R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum nymphal ticks (n = 400) were fed on a BLV-infected and a negative control bovine. At various intervals after engorgement the ticks were homogenised and injected subcutaneously into BLV-negative sheep. Adult R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum, which had fed as nymphs on the BLV-infected bovine, were then allowed to feed on BLV-negative sheep. A control sheep was also injected intravenously with blood from the infected bovine. Only the control sheep that received blood from the BLV-positive bovine seroconverted 9 months later. All the other surviving sheep remained serologically negative during the 13 months observation period. It is suggested that the nymphal stages of these ticks probably do not play a role in the transstadial transmission of BLV in southern Africa. The significance of these results is discussed.","966":"Cattle from a farm where enzootic bovine leukosis had been diagnosed were tested to determine the prevalence of bovine leukaemia virus antibodies. Farmers who had bought cattle from this farm were identified and their herds also tested. Of 381 adult dairy cattle tested, 14 animals reacted positively (3.67%). Cattle (n = 81) from 3 selected herds, not associated with the affected farm were also bled and 7 animals reacted positively (8.64%).","967":"A retrospective survey on the causes of disease and death in captive wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) (n = 87) presented for examination and investigation from 1983 to 1995, revealed that 50 were less than a week old, 13 were between a week and 1 year of age, 7 were less than 5 years old, and 6 were older than 5 years. The age of 11 adult dogs could not be determined. The cause of death could not be determined in the majority of neonates but 37 probably died of exposure and 13 of septicaemia and pulmonary lesions. Various causes of trauma, including aggression and siblicide, were diagnosed in 13 wild dogs. Lesions of the lungs, kidneys, heart, pancreas, uterus, intestines and skin were diagnosed respectively in 4, 6, 3, 3, 5, 5 and 2 of the cases. An aberrant behavioural pattern was diagnosed in a hand-reared wild dog.","968":"Although the veterinarian as a person is not traditionally seen as part of veterinary science research, perceptions are changing. The aim of this investigation was to analyse veterinary practice as a social system, by quantifying interaction within the practice. The veterinarians' biographical parameters of gender, residential area, home language, age and type of practice were taken as independent variables and questions regarding the other factors in practice as dependent variables. Relationships were considered to be statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05 using the chi-square test. Results indicated that younger, female, urban, companion animal, English-speaking veterinarians are relatively more aware of their clients' and patients' needs, as well as the interaction between owner and animal. They are more orientated towards financial success and are more aware of opposition practices. They also ascribe more emotional behaviour to their clients. Rural practitioners in mixed or production animal practices, who are predominantly Afrikaans-speaking, saw their clients as more calculating and omniscient and they are more likely to take their clients' financial position into account. The study revealed the necessity of a new human orientation in successful practice management, from a social system perspective.","969":"Primary health care (PHC) has been defined by the World Health Organisation as essential health care made universally accessible to community members, with their full participation, at a cost affordable to the community. PHC could therefore be used in the prevention and treatment of zoonotic diseases in humans, as such diseases are more prevalent in disadvantaged communities. The successful use of PHC principles in the treatment and control of cutaneous larva migrans in children in a semi-rural, low-income community is discussed in this paper. Constraints to implementation of PHC principles were identified as resistance from health care professionals, lack of interdepartmental cooperation and bureaucratic delays. It is concluded that PHC principles can be used successfully for the prevention and treatment of specific zoonoses provided that an aetiological diagnosis is made and the epidemiology of the condition understood. The results also confirmed the relevance of the veterinarian in the control of zoonotic diseases as part of the PHC team.","970":"Ornithonyssus bacoti (Hirst) is an important parasite of rodents. The characteristic shape of the dorsal and sternal shields and gnathosoma used as taxonomic characteristics was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The anal plate is distinctly pear-shaped with a pair of adanal setae lateral to the anal valves, a single postanal seta and a distinct dentate cribrum formed by peg-like projections. In the adult mites a peritreme extends anteriorly to the 1st coxa from the spiracle situated laterally between the 3rd and 4th coxa. The peritreme is an open canal protected by an overhanging dorsal ridge and lined with short peg-like aciculae. The gnathosoma includes a pair of pedipalps, a pair of protrusile chelicerae retracted into the hypostoma, and a serrate tritosternum ventrally. A unique feature to the normal setae of the pedipalps is a golf club-shaped seta which is found medially on the palp genu. A distinctive double-bladed 'palpal claw' or apotele is directed medially from the palp tibia. The pincer-like chela consists of a spear-like prong forming the moveable digit and a curved stylus-like fixed digit used to pierce the skin. Each leg ends with a pair of hooked tarsal claws and a pair of lateral comblike pretarsal appendages adjacent to the pulvillus. The pulvillus may be retracted, allowing the pretarsal operculum to function as a 'clasping organ' that enables the mite to clasp the hairs of the host during feeding.","971":"Respiratory rate, heart rate, blood-gas tensions (PO2 and PCO2) and pH of arterial (a) and peripheral venous (v) blood, concentration of haemoglobin in arterial blood (Hb), saturation of arterial haemoglobin with oxygen and the end-expiratory concentration of oxygen were measured in 22 juvenile African elephants (Loxodonta africana) anaesthetised with etorphine and azaperone during a period of 35-65 minutes after they had assumed lateral recumbency. Based on these parameters the alveolar-arterial and arterial-peripheral venous differences of PO2 [P(A-a)O2 and P(a-v)O2 respectively] and oxygen content of arterial blood (CaO2) were calculated. Elephants with body mass of &lt; or = 600 kg showed statistically significant changes in the following parameters, compared with elephants with a body mass of more than 600 kg (x +\/- SD): PaO2 (64 +\/- 11 versus 82 +\/- 8 mmHg), P(a-v)O2 (9 +\/- 5 versus 22 +\/- 9 mmHg), P(A-a)O2(37 +\/- 16 versus 15 +\/- 8 mmHg) and Hb (148 +\/- 20 versus 130 +\/- 10 g\/l) (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggested a tendency towards impaired oxygen exchange in the lungs, reduced peripheral extraction of oxygen and elevated oxygen-carrying capacity of arterial blood in smaller elephants. These changes were theoretically attributed to the respiratory-depressant and sympathomimetic effects of higher dosages of etorphine used in the smaller elephants to maintain a clinically acceptable anaesthetic plane. Individual elephants spent 35-150 minutes under anaesthesia and all recovered uneventfully after reversal of etorphine with diprenorphine.","972":"The microstructure of the omasum of the African goat was investigated macroscopically, as well as by scanning electron microscopy to determine how the omasum is anatomically specialised to enable the goat to graze and browse so successfully in the harsh environments of Africa. The omasum of the African goat was found to be more simple in structure than that of other domesticated ruminants. The omasal laminae were arranged in only 3 orders with the number of laminae varying between 27 and 33, considerably fewer than previously described for other goats, sheep or cattle. The large conical and unguiculiform papillae surrounding the reticulo-omasal orifice, as well as the hooked papillae present on the laminae, were more similar to those of wild ruminants that browsed than domestic grazing species. The papillae on the laminae were also found to be directionally orientated towards the orifices, which may suggest a \"sieve mechanism' at the reticulo-omasal orifice and interlaminar spaces. In addition, it may suggest a directional movement of ingesta between the laminae. The stratified squamous epithelium lining the laminae and papillae was lightly keratinised which, along with the microplicae-like surface folds and pits of the superficial cells, indicated that it was functionally structured for absorption. These morphological specialisations of the omasal surfaces of the indigenous African goat demonstrated similarities with that of wild ruminants that are able to graze and browse.","973":"The incidence of rotavirus at a pig farm in Gauteng was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Faecal specimens were collected from 172 litters over a 6-month period. Rotavirus was detected in 37.8% of piglets exhibiting signs of scouring. When these PAGE patterns were examined, 84.6% group A, 4.6% group B and 10.8% group C rotaviruses were observed. A few specimens subsequently collected from other farms in the Gauteng. North-West and Northern Provinces also contained group B and C electropherotypes. This is the first report of group B and group C rotaviruses in the South African pig population.","974":"Haematocrit, plasma osmolality and plasma calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium concentrations were measured in 10 healthy ostrich chicks at 2-weekly intervals between 8 and 26 weeks of age. Plasma sodium, potassium and zinc concentrations were measured in an additional 50 chicks between 2 and 6 months of age. With the exception of calcium, blood constituents did not change significantly with age. Overall, haematocrit was lower and phosphorus and magnesium were slightly higher than previously measured for adults, which is consistent with previous measurements for chicks.","975":"Information on the incidence of eye disease in dogs, presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital, was extracted from the records of the ophthalmology clinic for the 5 years 1990-1995. The German shepherd dog and maltese each accounted for more than twice as many patients as any other breed. The most important diseases according to breed incidence were cataracts, glaucoma, corneal ulcers, progressive retinal atrophy, iris prolapse, pannus\/pigmentation and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Problem areas in private practice were clearly identifiable and arose for different reasons.","976":"","977":"","978":"","979":"","980":"","981":"Mortality in young chickens was associated with blister beetle consumption. Two species of these insects, Cyaneolytta sp. and Cylindrothorax sp., were found in the chickens' crops, and erosive lesions in the gastrointestinal tract were compatible with blister beetle poisoning (cantharidiasis).","982":"Ataxia associated with myelopathy and low liver copper concentrations is described in a blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi) and black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou) from the Karoo Nature Reserve, Graaff-Reinet. This syndrome, which occurs in neonatal and delayed forms, has been described in sheep, goats, pigs and domesticated red deer, but reports in other ungulates, including antelope, are very rare and generally unconfirmed by histopathological examination. The 2 animals examined exhibited a typical pattern of Wallerian degeneration in selected tracts of the spinal cord. Many blesbok in the reserve are markedly pale in colour. Fading of the hair is also associated with copper deficiency in ungulates. High lamb mortality occurs as a result of the ataxia and threatens the survival of the blesbok herd in the reserve. Confirmation of low liver copper concentrations in affected animals offers direction towards the solution of the problem.","983":"Phaeohyphomycosis is a rare fungal disease of animals and man, generally thought to occur in compromised or debilitated hosts, although in man the majority of infections have occurred in otherwise healthy patients. To investigate the possible role of immune suppression in systemic phaeohyphomycosis, certain aspects of the immune system of 2 dogs with systemic Xylohypha bantiana infection were investigated. White cell and differential cell counts, serum protein electrophoresis and serum immunoglobulin fractions were determined. The only consistent finding was lymphopaenia. Although there is no specific evidence for it, a lymphopaenic state might predispose to systemic phaeohyphomycosis.","984":"Higher levels of urinary met-haemoglobin were found in dogs with naturally occurring Babesia canis infection (n = 6) than in control subjects (n = 5). The urinary haemoglobin in the affected cases ranged from 1 to 4 g\/l of which 28-95% was met-haemoglobin. This was a significant finding in that met-haemoglobin has been shown to be nephrotoxic in the dog, especially in the presence of aciduria. Acidic urine was also demonstrated in those dogs with B. canis infection, which may aggravate the nephrotoxic effect of the met-haemoglobinuria. Thus naturally infected B. canis cases showing haemoglobinuria may in fact have significant met-haemoglobinaemia, which may predispose them to renal disease.","985":"The monitoring of a foot-and-mouth disease epizootic amongst impala (Aepyceros melampus) in the Kruger National Park is described. Infection rates of different sex and age classes of impala within the outbreak focus were determined. Seroprevalence rates in other clovenhoofed species were also determined. RNA sequencing of a portion of the 1D gene of viruses isolated from SAT-2 viruses obtained from diseased impala showed that they were unrelated to previous SAT-2 isolates made from animals in the Kruger National Park.","986":"It has been suggested that the antibabesial drug diminazene causes a rapid decline in haematocrit after treatment of dogs with high Babesia canis parasitaemias, compared with trypan blue. To test this, 19 dogs with clinically mild to moderate, uncomplicated babesiosis were placed in low, moderate or high parasitaemia groups, based on venous parasitaemias, and were allotted randomly to diminazene or trypan blue treatment groups. Haematocrit and parasitaemia were determined before treatment, and at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. The drugs were compared for effects on haematocrit and parasite clearance. Changes in haematocrit after treatment were analysed. There were no significant differences between diminazene and trypan blue for haematocrit or parasite clearance. There was no correlation between initial parasitaemia and initial or post-treatment haematocrit. In all dogs, haematocrit fell following treatment. The maximum mean reduction from the baseline (0 h) was 0.046 l\/l (range 0.02-0.07 l\/l); this most often occurred at 6 or 12 h. The 24 h haematocrit ranged from 70.5-113.6% of baseline (mean absolute haematocrit 0.019 l\/l below baseline). All dogs improved clinically during the study period. It was concluded that either diminazene or trypan blue can be safely used to treat dogs with clinically mild or moderate, uncomplicated babesiosis. Parasitaemia need not be taken into account when deciding which antibabesial drug to administer and does not appear to be related to the degree of anaemia.","987":"Over a period of 7 years the Toxicology Diagnostic Laboratory at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute investigated 370 suspected incidents of poisoning of wildlife. A diagnosis was made in 166 of the outbreaks. Synthetic organic pesticides were responsible for 82.5% of the poisonings. More than 90% of the poisonings were maliciously intended and monocrotophos was the chemical most often used. The data were derived from authenticated outbreaks of poisoning and indicate the chemicals most often incriminated in acute poisoning of wildlife. Of all wild animals, birds are the most frequent victims of poisoning. Uncommon toxicities such as ionophore, cardiac glycoside poisoning and chronic fluorosis are also described.","988":"","989":"The major plant poisonings and mycotoxicoses of southern Africa are discussed in relation to East Africa. As almost all the plant genera and most species responsible for intoxication in southern Africa are present in East Africa, it is postulated that the same intoxications probably also occur in the latter. There is a necessity to diagnose and control these conditions.","990":"","991":"The effect of oxytocin treatment on the ovulation rate of Merino ewes was investigated. Intravenous doses (0.1 IU) of oxytocin were administered to synchronised ewes (n = 54) every 30 min for a 24 h period beginning at the onset of oestrus. Laparoscopic examination of the ovaries of all ewes that had displayed overt oestrus following sponge withdrawal was performed 10 d after the beginning of oxytocin treatment to determine the number of corpora lutea per ewe. The ovulation rates of the treated and control groups were 174.5% and 144%, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). It would appear that a higher ovulation rate can be obtained by repeated low-dose intravenous injection of oxytocin during oestrus.","992":"","993":"The clinical signs and pathology in an outbreak of toxicity in feedlot cattle attributed to the ingestion of toxic levels of the ionophore antibiotic salinomycin over an extended period of 11 weeks are described. Thirty-nine out of 380 cattle developed signs consistent with cardiac failure and 8 of these died. Clinical signs included dyspnoea, tachypnoea, tachycardia and exercise intolerance. Two cattle were necropsied and in one there were macroscopic lesions suggestive of congestive heart failure, namely pulmonary oedema, hydrothorax and hepatomegaly. Histopathology revealed a chronic cardiomyopathy characterised principally by extensive myocardial fibre atrophy with multifocal hypertrophy and interstitial and replacement fibrosis. Hepatic and pulmonary lesions were consistent with those of congestive cardiac failure. The myocardial lesions in this outbreak were similar to those encountered in cases of a chronic toxicity associated with the ingestion of litter derived from poultry rations containing ionophores (ionophore-associated poultry litter toxicity). Hence, the clinical and pathological findings in this outbreak indicate that in cattle, the prolonged ingestion of ionophores over several weeks may result in the development of chronic myocardial lesions comparable to those of IAPLT but significantly different from those encountered in the more traditional acute outbreaks of ionophore toxicity as described in the literature.","994":"This is the first reported outbreak of paspalum staggers in cattle following ingestion of Paspalum distichum (L) infected by Claviceps paspali in South Africa. A day after starting to graze on an ergotised paspalum field, 43 animals exhibited various degrees of generalised tremors and ataxia. Four animals became paretic and went into sternal recumbency. All affected animals recovered. The condition was reproduced by feeding ergotised grass to a calf. Signs of intoxication were observed 48 h after ingestion of c. 30 g\/kg of the semi-dry plant material. The calf developed tremors and a slight ataxia, which became more pronounced following light exercise.","995":"Awareness of the importance and relevance of community-oriented medical education is increasing. Although a number of medical faculties have already adopted this approach for their undergraduate training, this idea does not appear to have received the same degree of acceptance within veterinary schools. This study attempts to provide evidence in support of the feasibility of a community-oriented curriculum. First-year veterinary science students at the Medical University of Southern Africa received a very short orientation course on the social determinants of disease; the Primary Health Care (PHC) philosophy and how PHC differs from the basic health service approach; how to shift the locus of control for health away from the health professional and back into the community; dependency theory; basic pet care; sociology (including systems and conflict theory); problems with the application of a technological imperative within a systems perspective; social research; basic statistical concepts; health care systems and their evolution; marketing principles in relation to health education; the importance of positioning and how to effectively use communication skills within a classroom setting. After this course the students successfully participated in an animal health education programme within the community.","996":"","997":"","998":"Several experimental effects due to wood-derived bedding have been reported. Female Sprague Dawley rats were kept on pine shavings, eucalyptus pulp, vermiculite and in wire-bottomed cages without bedding for 14 days whereafter normal values for the antioxidants ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione (G-SH) in rat heart lung and liver tissue were determined and compared. Statistically significant differences were observed for lung G-SH between pine shavings and eucalyptus pulp (p &lt; 0.0183), and heart G-SH between vermiculite and eucalyptus pulp (p &lt; 0.0948). The highest levels of liver G-SH were obtained using pine shavings compared to vermiculite (p &lt; 0.0001), eucalyptus pulp (p &lt; 0.0002) and wire floor (p &lt; 0.0001). Statistically significant differences in ascorbic acid concentrations could only be described between the wire-bottomed cages and eucalyptus pulp (p &lt; 0.0333) for lung tissue and between pine shavings and eucalyptus pulp for liver tissue (p &lt; 0.042). Although no statistically significant differences were observed in heart ascorbic acid levels between the different bedding applications, the concentration obtained using vermiculite was approximately 50% higher than that observed with the other materials. Pine shavings, eucalyptus pulp and wire floors demonstrated virtually the same heart tissue ascorbic acid levels. It was thus demonstrated that bedding material can alter the tissue antioxidant concentration of laboratory animals, limiting the comparison of this type of result between institutions to those using identical environmental conditions.","999":"The usefulness of whole-blood transfusion in normalising the blood-gas, acid-base, and arterial oxygen status in severe babesiosis was demonstrated in 6 severely affected Babesia canis infected dogs. These dogs all demonstrated a metabolic acidosis at admission and yet were not acidaemic. It is possible that this may reflect a mixed acid-base disorder (metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis). They all showed severe hypoxaemia at admission. A number of derived blood-gas and acid-base parameters as determined by the Oxygen Status Algorithm (OSA) were shown to be a superior way of assessing and monitoring the temporal response of severe babesiosis cases to blood transfusion. It was shown that fresh whole-blood transfusion is a safe and physiological way of reversing acid-base and blood-gas derangements associated with severe babesiosis in dogs. Intravenous alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of the metabolic acidosis of babesiosis is questioned.","1000":"","1001":"","1002":"Uveitis is a commonly misdiagnosed ophthalmic condition with a wide aetiological base and often the cause cannot be established. Uveitis can be associated with systemic diseases like feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus, lymphoma, toxoplasmosis and canine ehrlichiosis. The classification and general clinical signs of uveitis are discussed. Applicable clinical cases, manifestations and diagnostic methods of the selected diseases are mentioned, and a general approach to the treatment of uveitis is given.","1003":"This case report describes a young male German Shepherd dog that presented with bleeding from the lip 24 hours after being bitten by a boomslang (Dispholidus typus). Bites from this snake are infrequently encountered in dogs due to the shy habits of the snake. The boomslang venom is a potent procoagulant causing a consumption coagulopathy with resultant profuse haemorrhage. The only effective treatment is the administration of specific antiserum. Antiserum administration in this patient resulted in cessation of bleeding within one hour after administration. The article also discusses treatment options if antiserum is unavailable. This is the first recorded case of boomslang envenomation in the dog.","1004":"Three outbreaks of cyanobacterial (blue-green algae) poisoning involving cattle and sheep are described. In 2 of these acute mortality was followed by photodermatitis in some of the surviving animals. In all 3 outbreaks the hepatotoxicity of the water collected from the dams where the animals had been drinking was confirmed following the intraperitoneal administration to mice. Nodularia spumigena was the dominant cyanobacterium in the first 2 outbreaks, and Microcystis aeruginosa in the third. The presence of the heptapeptide toxin microcystin-LR in the third outbreak was demonstrated by high pressure liquid chromatography.","1005":"A bull terrier died after drinking water at the margin of Zeekoevlei near Cape Town. At the time, Zeekoevlei, a hypertrophic coastal lake, contained a bloom of the cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena and Microcystis aeruginosa. The circumstances of the incident, clinical signs of poisoning and histopathology, which mainly revealed extensive liver damage, were consistent with cyanobacterial poisoning. The cyanobacterial bloom material contained 3.47 micrograms mg-1 dry weight of the pentapeptide hepatotoxin nodularin. It is inferred that the dog died of cyanobacterial hepatotoxicosis due to the ingestion of nodularin.","1006":"A large thrombus was found at the ileal bifurcation on post mortem examination of a 6-year-old Jersey cow which presented clinically with a history of acute onset recumbency, hind limb paresis and skin necrosis over the sacral area. Other significant findings on post mortem were traumatic reticuloperitonitis accompanied by mural thrombosis of the left ventricle associated with a purulent sinus tract through the ventricular wall, fibrous adhesions between the pericardium, diaphragm and liver, and multiple infarcts in both kidneys.","1007":"The absolute and relative adrenal mass as well as histological sections of the adrenals of springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) (n = 76; 36 ewes and 39 rams) were studied over a period of 12 months. No significant difference was found in the absolute mass of the adrenals of rams and ewes. However, a significant difference (p &lt; 0.01) was found in the relative masses (adrenal mass in terms of carcass mass), in that relative masses in males were greater than females. The zona fasciculata was found to be enlarged during the dry season (February and March), and showed increased activity in both sexes. The zona fasciculata of the ewes showed an additional increase in activity during September (late pregnancy) and October (lactation). In rams increased activity of the zona fasciculata was seen during the mating season in April and May. It appears that stressful events during reproduction and during the dry season cause an increase in adrenal mass and activity.","1008":"The number of sick dogs with and without canine babesiosis, a potentially fatal tick-borne disease, presented to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital situated north of Pretoria is reported from counts extracted from the records of the Outpatients clinic for the 6 years 1988 to 1993. The average percentage of sick dogs diagnosed as positive for canine babesiosis is 11.69%, of which 31.4% were admitted to the small animal medicine clinic for more intensive treatment. The correlation between the number of monthly babesiosis cases and meteorological data is poor.","1009":"Stilesia globipunctata infections were found in sheep from the area east and south of Bredasdorp in the Overberg region of the southern Cape Province. The prevalence of infection on these farms ranged from 5.1 to 65%. In an abattoir survey 4 of the 6 lots of 4 to 5 year old sheep and only 1 of the 9 lots of sheep under the age of 1 year were infected with S. globipunctata. None of the sheep examined in the Overberg region were infected with Stilesia hepatica. A modified sedimentation technique proved to be the most reliable for the coprological diagnosis of S. globipunctata in sheep.","1010":"This study determined the maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) of Thoroughbred horses acclimatised to mild hypobaric conditions using a standard exercise test on a treadmill inclined at a 7% slope. The O2 uptake (VO2) versus speed relationship was linear below the exercise intensity required to attain VO2max. The VO2max of individual horses ranged from 143.5 to 172.6 ml\/kg\/min. The proportion of total variance for the VO2 versus speed relationship was greater than 0.992, and the coefficients of variation in repeated tests in individual horses ranged between 0.07 and 1.54%. The VO2 versus speed relationship attained a plateau at speeds above the VO2max, which ranged from 9.3 to 12.0 m\/s. When work intensity was increased above that of the VO2max, there was no further increase in VO2, thus showing that a maximum had been attained.","1011":"Five hundred and thirty-five calving records were analysed to determine the relationship and factors influencing calving date (CD) and calving interval (CI) so as to determine which of the two is the best measure of reproductive efficiency in beef cows mated during a restricted breeding season. Effects included in the model for the analysis of effects of CD and CI were: age of dam, year, previous sex of calf (PSex), previous calving date (PCD), previous calf birthmass (PBM) and previous calf weaning mass (PWM) and the interactions PBM x PSex and PWM x PSex. PCD and year had a highly significant influence on CD and CI. PCD had a significantly larger influence on calving interval than on calving date as evidenced by the larger mean square associated with calving interval. It was found that cows that calved earliest during the calving season had the longest calving intervals, whilst cows that calved latest had the shortest calving intervals. Calving interval was found to be reduced by 0.61 +\/- 0.05 days for each one day delay in PCD, whilst CD was delayed by 0.09 +\/- 0.07 days for each one day delay in PCD. It was concluded, since calving date was influenced to a smaller extent than calving interval by previous calving date, that calving date is a more reliable reproductive measure where restricted mating is practised.","1012":"A trial, which involved 917 ewes, was conducted to examine whether reproductive traits could be improved in an accelerated lambing system with 3 lambing seasons per year by subcutaneous melatonin treatment. Fertility (ewes lambed per ewes put to the ram), litter size and the interval between melatonin application date and lambing date were not affected by treatment. However, in the first lambing season (15 February to 15 March), fertility was 16% higher in melatonin-treated ewes compared to untreated ewes (P &gt; 0.05). Season or month of application therefore seems to be an important factor with regard to the response. It is concluded that melatonin treatment in accelerated lambing systems is further complicated by the presence of pregnant and lactating ewes, which makes the value of commercial use thereof doubtful.","1013":"Bacterial isolates (n = 38) previously cultured from sheep with Bolo disease were compared bacteriologically with known Corynebacterium spp. and Actinomyces spp. The isolates did not conform to any previously described species but closely resembled C. pseudodiptheriticum and C. urealyticum. More comprehensive tests are needed to classify this Corynebacterium sp. Bacterial cultures of this unclassified Corynebacterium sp. were used artificially to induce Bolo disease in Dohne Merino sheep (n = 20). Ten sheep were kept at Middelburg in the Cape Midlands (Northern Cape) under arid conditions and another 10 at Queenstown in the Eastern Cape in a more humid climate. Two suspensions containing 2.8 x 10(5) Corynebacterium sp. (inoculum A) and 2.8 x 10(9) Corynebacterium sp. (inoculum B) respectively were used to infect each sheep on 9 different sites on the skin. One sheep died during the course of the experiment. Corynebacterium sp. established itself on 81 out of 171 inoculation sites of the remaining sheep and caused typical lesions of Bolo disease, clinically and pathologically. Bolo disease lesions developed slowly over 175 days at Middelburg and 287 days at Queenstown. Weather conditions were unfavourable to the development of fleece-rot and mycotic dermatitis. No difference was seen in lesion development between rams and ewes or between sheep with 5 months' wool growth and those which were shorn before inoculation. More lesions developed with the higher concentration of inoculum B (49 sites positive) as compared to inoculum A (32 sites positive).","1014":"Venous blood was collected from clinically healthy (n = 5) and B. canis (n = 5) infected dogs. Parasitised red blood cells were not removed from blood samples prior to preparation. The erythrocytes were washed, lysed, the haem ring removed from the haemoglobin molecule and the globin chains denatured by breaking disulphide linkages between amino acids. These haemolysates were then subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing acid, urea and the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. In all 5 B. canis infected dogs a protein band was observed above the beta chain of haemoglobin. This band was absent in all 5 healthy dogs. It is postulated that this band represents a fragment of the globin chain that remains after proteolysis caused by the B. canis parasite. Further study is needed to exclude the possibility that the electrophoretic band might be of parasitic origin.","1015":"The blood-gas, acid-base, and arterial oxygen status of 6 healthy blood donor dogs was studied at an altitude of 1250 metres on 2 occasions 3 days apart. The values, and repeatability, of a number of derived variables that describe oxygen status, including oxygen extraction tension (Px), extractable oxygen concentration (Cx), and oxygen compensation factor (Qx) were established in clinically healthy dogs. The Oxygen Status Algorithm computer programme which was developed for use in humans was used to calculate these derived variables. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically and compared with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentrations calculated by the Oxygen Status Algorithm. This study revealed that there were no significant differences between the means of any of the variables used to describe oxygen status on the two occasions. The mean Px of 38.74 mmHg, Cx of 4.38 ml\/dl, and Qx of 1.2 were similar to those reported for man.","1016":"A 2-year study was conducted to determine the macromineral status of kikuyu grass pastures growing on representative soils in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Herbage samples were collected at 25 to 35 day intervals during the growing season from 12 rotationally-grazed camps located on 3 sites. Seasonal mean herbage Ca and P concentrations were within the ranges 0.22 to 0.33% and 0.27 to 0.39%, respectively, while seasonal mean Ca:P ratios ranged from 1.1:1 to 0.63:1. Calcium concentrations and the Ca:P ratios were lowest in the midsummer months, while P concentrations increased in midsummer. In terms of the requirements of various classes of sheep and cattle, Ca concentrations and Ca:P ratios were frequently well below published critical limits. This finding, coupled with reports of kikuyu containing high levels of oxalate which reduce Ca absorption by ruminants, implies a major Ca insufficiency for animals pastured on kikuyu. Herbage Mg concentrations (seasonal mean range: 0.25 to 0.35%) were adequate in terms of the requirements of most classes of ruminants; however, K concentrations (seasonal mean range: 2.64 to 4.46%) were well in excess of animal requirements, and Mg absorption could be severely inhibited by the oversupply of K. In most camps the K:Ca+Mg ratio exceeded the reported safety threshold for grazing animals of 2.2, suggesting a high hypomagnesaemic tetany potential for animals on kikuyu pastures. Sodium concentrations in kikuyu were found to be largely inadequate in terms of animal requirements.","1017":"Diarrhoea in the piglet can lead to stunted growth and neonatal death, with important implications for the pig farmer. During 1993, a pilot study was initiated to monitor the epidemiology of rotavirus infection in piglets with diarrhoea. Bimonthly diarrhoeal faecal specimens were collected from scouring piglets less than 6 weeks of age on a pig farm in the Northern Transvaal. The stool specimens were examined by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Rotavirus EIA, IDL, Jerusalem). In total, rotavirus antigen was detected in 24% of the litters by the ELISA, which is directed at the group A rotavirus antigen. Rotavirus was found to occur throughout the year and predominantly in piglets 4 weeks old. Polyacrylamide electrophoretic analysis of the viral RNA genomes showed the presence of four distinct strains of Group A rotaviruses circulating on this farm. This study highlights the natural diversity of rotavirus strains circulating on a single farm and may indicate the importance of rotavirus infection in piglets with diarrhoea in South Africa.","1018":"The bioavailability of a modified rafoxanide oral suspension was compared to the original innovator product and a generic formulation in a single dose, randomised, parallel design study in sheep (n = 30). The area under the rafoxanide plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), AUC extrapolated to infinity, and maximum plasma rafoxanide concentrations (Cmax), were used to compare the extent of absorption of the formulations. All 3 parameters were significantly (p &lt; or = 0.01) smaller for both the modified and generic formulations relative to the original product. There were no significant (p &gt; 0.05) differences between the modified and generic formulations. The mean point ratio % of the modified to original and modified to generic formulations for the 3 parameters were 36.4%, 35%, 45.9% and 70.9%, 70%, 79.7%, respectively. In terms of the calculated 90% confidence t-intervals of the mean % ratios, the modified and generic formulations were not bioequivalent to the original product, since they were substantially below the accepted range of 80-125%. No significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) were noted for the time to Cmax and Cmax\/AUC, both measurements of rate of absorption. A lag period before absorption of rafoxanide for all formulations of c 5 h was observed. The differences in oral bioavailability of rafoxanide and related anthelmintic formulations have implications for the efficacy and registration of generic products.","1019":"Veterinarians, biologists and administrators attended a workshop 'Veterinary science and wildlife utilisation for the benefit of community development' which was held during March 1995 as part of the Veterinary Science Research Programme of the Foundation for Research Development. The workshop was the first step in the establishment of a veterinary wildlife research forum which aims to integrate veterinary research with that of other disciplines in addressing issues that have an impact on wildlife. Initially, discussions covered a broad perspective of worldwide approaches towards the conservation of the environment and the upliftment of rural communities. Thereafter the dialogue focused upon the objectives of the workshop which were: (1) to identify areas in wildlife and nature conservation where veterinary research is needed; (2) to identify specific projects within these areas. Seven areas were identified in which veterinary research was needed: the promotion of the free flow of products and animals; extensive husbandry; intensive husbandry; pharmacology and toxicology; public health; ethical issues; forensic and diagnostic techniques. A steering committee was elected to coordinate veterinary wildlife research; establish relevant data bases; to facilitate cooperation between researchers; and to organise regular contact through annual workshops.","1020":"Uncomplicated canine babesiosis was diagnosed in 2 dogs based on the presence of trophozoites of Babesia canis in red blood cells on examination of a peripheral blood smear. The haemogram picture was that of a leukaemoid response with severe anaemia, high total white cell count and thrombocytopaenia. Treatment with babesiacidal drugs, together with blood transfusion, was successful in eliminating the Babesia parasites and reducing the leukaemoid response. The various leukograms of canine babesiosis and human malaria are compared and briefly discussed.","1021":"An outbreak of digital dermatitis in a dairy herd in the Gauteng province of South Africa is described in which 72% of the lactating herd was affected. Many of the affected cows showed a severe lameness and a drop in milk production. Other complications included heel horn erosion, under-running of heel horn and boxy claws. The diagnosis was made on the typical clinical appearance of the condition and the presence of spirochaetes on histopathological sections from biopsy material. The condition responded to spraying affected feet with an oxytetracycline mixture after cleaning with water using a high pressure hose. The prevalence was reduced to 28% after one month of therapy. A repeat outbreak occurred on the same farm 7 months later during which time 37% of the lactating herd was affected. Of the cows affected, 48% represented new cases, whereas the rest were reinfections.","1022":"This paper describes the case histories of two Thoroughbred horses, a 2-year-old colt in training and a 7-year-old broodmare, that were presented with histories of weight loss, exercise intolerance, intermittent fever, limb oedema and anaemia. Vegetative endocarditis of the mitral and tricuspid valves was diagnosed in the colt by means of echocardiography. Pseudomonas sp. endocarditis of the mitral valve was diagnosed in the mare using echocardiography and bacterial culture. The colt had secondary congestive heart failure and was euthanased on humane grounds. Pseudomonas cepacia was isolated from the vegetative lesions following the post mortem examination. The mare was sent home and treated with gentamicin at a dosage of 3.3 mg\/kg intra-muscularly twice daily for ten days. Her condition improved and she returned to stud.","1023":"In an attempt to identify the vectors of Babesia canis, ticks were collected over a period of 3 years from a total of 395 dogs diagnosed as infected with this protozoan parasite at the Veterinary Faculty, Onderstepoort. Haemaphysalis leachi was the only tick species recovered from 164 of these dogs, and it occurred in mixed infestation on a further 140 of the dogs. Rhipicephalus sanguineus was collected in pure infestation from 59 dogs with a further 87 harbouring mixed infestations. Sixteen dogs harboured only Rhipicephalus simus and 58 others carried this tick in mixed infestations. Because the incubation period of B. canis is thought to be longer than the time most ixodid ticks spend on their hosts, no conclusion can be made on the vector status of any of the tick species. However, the majority of dogs diagnosed with clinical canine babesiosis at Onderstepoort were concurrently infested with H. leachi.","1024":"The eyes of clinically healthy Simmentaler cattle and those affected by ophthalmia were sampled once a month over a continuous period of 12 months for bacterial, mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal infections. In total 478 eyes, representing from a clinical viewpoint 414 healthy and 64 affected eyes, were swabbed. Bacteria were isolated from 201 (48.6%) healthy eyes and 56 (87.5%) affected eyes. No bacteria were isolated from the remaining eyes. Eleven genera of bacteria were isolated from healthy eyes and 8 genera from affected eyes. The majority of isolates were classified in the genera Moraxella, Neisseria and Staphylococcus. Mycoplasmas were isolated from 247 (50.7%) healthy eyes and 27 (42.2%) affected eyes. No mycoplasmas were isolated from the remaining eyes. Ureaplasmas were not isolated from any animal. Eye-frequenting moths were collected on 3 occasions during the investigation and bacterial and mycoplasmal isolation techniques were performed on a total of 21 moths. Twelve different genera of bacteria, mostly Nocardia, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Moraxella, and mycoplasmas were isolated from various eye-frequenting moths. Scanning electron microscopical studies of the proboscis of the moths showed it to contain various sensillae and short triangular denticles that could possibly cause damage to the mucous membranes of the eyes and predispose to ophthalmia in cattle.","1025":"Babesia canis infections were apparently sterilised by a single dose of imidocarb at 7.5 mg kg-1, as well as by a single dose of diminazene at 3.5 mg kg-1, followed by a single dose of imidocarb at 6 mg kg-1 the following day. This was confirmed by subinoculation of blood from these dogs to splenectomised recipients. Sterilisation of the infection is not recommended in endemic areas; a more rational approach would be to allow a state of premunity to develop in dogs at risk to repeated infections.","1026":"The pharmacokinetics of gentamicin following single and multiple intravenous and intramuscular doses were compared in a two phase, randomised cross-over study in horses. Gentamicin was administered to 6 healthy, conditioned Thoroughbred mares at a dosage of 3.3 mg\/kg body weight every 12 hours for 5 intravenous or intramuscular consecutive treatments. Equal numbers of horses were treated by either route during each phase. There was a wash-out period of 5 days between phases. During each phase serial blood samples were collected from each mare immediately before treatment and at 16 intervals following the first and fifth administrations. Blood samples were also collected immediately before treatment and at 30 and 60 minutes following doses 2 through to 4. Gentamicin plasma concentrations were determined by fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. Plasma gentamicin concentration versus time data for both single and multiple doses by either route was best described by a 2 compartmental open model with first order rate constants. A distribution half-life (T1\/2 alpha) of 0.1 +\/- 0.1 hours, terminal half-life (T1\/2 beta) of 1.2 +\/- 0.2 hours, mean residence time (MRT) of 1.4 +\/- 0.1 hours and total body clearance (ClB) of 1.4 +\/- 0.2 ml\/kg\/min were observed following multidose gentamicin intravenous administration. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 117.6 +\/- 10.8 ml\/kg. No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were observed for any of the parameters between single or multiple doses for either route of administration. Except for AUC, significant (P &lt; or = 0.05) differences were observed between multiple intravenous and intramuscular treatments for all pharmacokinetic parameters determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1027":"","1028":"During May 1995, members of organisations with a vested interest in the socio-economic aspects of animal diseases in southern Africa met for a one-day workshop. This was the first activity of a proposed three-year Forum and programme in this area under discussion. The workshop was sponsored by the Foundation for Research Development, the Agricultural Research Council and the University of Pretoria. The individuals who attended were representatives of academic and government institutions and included veterinarians, veterinary scientists, animal health officers, administrators from the region and abroad, economists, sociologists and animal welfare experts. The aims of the workshop were fourfold: 1. to define what is meant by socio-economic aspects of animal diseases in southern Africa; 2. to identify the socio-economic factors which influence occurrence and consequences of animal diseases; 3. to learn of methods which are used to assess socio-economic needs, and 4. to initiate an ongoing network and research programme in this area. Two key questions were considered and discussed by the participants, and a consensus reached for each. The first question considered the link between community development and socio-economic aspects of animal diseases. This included the role of production animals, companion animals and game in developing communities and factors influencing these roles, as well as constraints to this development. The second question concerned the gaps in our understanding of the socio-economic aspects of animal diseases in southern Africa which would lead to research opportunities. Six areas identified were were the collection of disease information, education and communication, policy, economics, community needs and technology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1029":"","1030":"","1031":"","1032":"","1033":"Specific treatment of canine babesiosis consists of antibabesial drugs and, in severely anaemic animals, blood transfusion. Supportive therapy is also required, particularly in animals with complicated disease. Strategies for treatment of uncomplicated and complicated babesiosis are discussed. Definitive recommendations cannot be provided on the basis of available information, but suggestions are made, based on accepted therapeutic principles, pathophysiological mechanisms, therapy used in human malaria, and clinical experience. The problems of fluid therapy in complicated babesiosis, particularly in animals with oliguria, cerebral babesiosis and pulmonary oedema, are presented, with consideration given to the use of hypertonic fluids. The benefits of bicarbonate and alternative alkalinisers in life-threatening lactic acidaemia, a relatively common occurrence in complicated babesiosis, are debated, as are the benefits of oxygen therapy in anaemic hypoxia. Drug therapy and management of specific babesial complications are discussed. The rationale for supportive drugs commonly used in uncomplicated babesiosis, including lipotropic agents, haematinics and glucocorticoids, is examined. This review is designed to propose therapeutic guidelines and to stimulate interest in problematic aspects of supportive therapy for canine babesiosis.","1034":"Radiographic artifacts commonly occur, particularly with hand processing. The artifacts may originate between the X-ray tube and the cassette as extraneous material on the patient or contamination of positioning aids, or result from debris within the cassette, or damage to, or staining of the screens. These artifacts are white to grey, may have a constant or different position on follow-up radiographs, and their size and shape are reflective of the inciting cause. A number of artifacts may occur in the darkroom during handling, developing, fixing and drying of the film. White to shiny artifacts are caused by the contamination of films with fixer, inability of developer to reach parts of the film or loss of emulsion from the developed film. Black artifacts result from improper handling or storage of films, resulting in exposure to light, or from pressure marks or static electricity discharges. Dropped levels of hand-processing chemicals may result in a variety of tide-marks on films. Most radiographic artifacts can be prevented by proper storage and handling of films and by optimal darkroom technique.","1035":"A year after introduction of a lick known to contain a commercial phosphorous source intended for agronomical purposes, approximately 2% adult cattle, from a herd numbering 120 animals, were observed to show signs of lameness. Four years later, this prevalence had increased to 5%, but teeth abnormalities were evident in 70-80% of animals. The average fluoride concentration of 5 coccygeal bone samples from 4-year-old animals was 6.94 x 10(3) mg kg-1. A lick sample had a fluoride concentration of 1.4 x 10(3) mg kg-1. A water and pasture sample contained 0.03 ppm and 0.3 ppm fluoride respectively. These values suggested that the lick was responsible for the clinical signs of chronic fluororis in the herd.","1036":"Two outbreaks of botulism in sheep and goats are described; in one, 329 out of 900 sheep in a feedlot died within 9 d of the onset of the disease and in the other, 100 sheep and goats out of 330 succumbed over a period of about 3 weeks. Animals were found dead or died suddenly, without exhibiting clinical signs. Others stood with lowered heads and showed drooling of saliva or a stiff gait. Paresis and\/or paralysis were frequent signs in the terminal stages of the disease. Gross lesions such as the accumulation of fluids in body cavities, pulmonary oedema, foam in the trachea, epicardial haemorrhages and congestion of the mucosa of the small intestine, suggestive of heart failure, were present in animals from both outbreaks. Botulism was confirmed via the mouse toxicity test, by the demonstration of Type C and Type D toxins in the feed and intestinal contents of sheep from the first outbreak and Type D toxin in intestinal contents of sheep from the second. The clinical signs and macropathology in the outbreaks of botulism in sheep and goats in South Africa may resemble \"krimpsiekte\" and cardiac glycoside and ionophore poisoning, as well as other conditions causing heart failure.","1037":"The aim of this study was to determine the degree of subfertility of 2 Friesland bulls (Bulls 1 and 2) with poor sperm morphology. An Ayrshire (Bull 3) with good sperm morphology served as control. Bull 1 had a mean of 48% morphologically normal sperm, 36% sperm-head defects and 18% flagellar defects. Bull 2 had a mean of 28% normal sperm, 28% flagellar defects and 33% proximal cytoplasmic droplets. Bull 3 had a mean of 83% normal sperm. Each bull was exposed to 19 cyclic heifers. Heifers of Breeding Groups 1, 2 and 3 did not differ with respect to body mass, age and breed. Pregnancy was diagnosed by means of B-mode ultrasonography 25-50 d after service. Bulls 1, 2 and 3 served 13, 17 and 16 heifers, respectively, during one oestrous period each. Of these heifers 6 (46%), 2 (12%) and 12 (75%) respectively, conceived.","1038":"Melioidosis was diagnosed in an adult Boer goat ewe. The owner initially noticed swelling of one half of the udder. Several firm nodules developed in the affected part of the udder 2 weeks later. At necropsy, abscesses containing a creamy to yellowish-green exudate were found in the mammary gland and one of the kidneys. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas pseudomallei were isolated from the abscesses in the udder and inoculation of male guinea-pigs with the causative bacterium, produced a Shwartzman reaction in the testis and serositis as well as necrotic lesions, in parenchymatous organs. The isolate showed sensitivity to amoxycillin-clavulanate, but resistance to a number of other antimicrobials. This appears to be the first case of melioidosis in a domestic animal in South Africa.","1039":"Throughout a survey from 1991 to 1993 in the Highveld region of Eastern Transvaal, levamisole sales dominated in the sheep anthelmintic market. The macrocyclic lactone sales dominated in the cattle anthelmintic market, but were superseded by those of levamisole in 1993. The salicylanilides enjoyed the second highest demand in the sheep anthelmintic market. Anthelmintics were purchased throughout the year, but sales peaked in summer and autumn. When it rained in winter, sales increased during winter and peaked in spring. Eastern Transvaal Co-operative (OTK) sold 2,64 therapeutic doses per sheep during the driest year and 3,54 per sheep during the wettest year in the Highveld region. Only 24-29% of the cattle in the region could be treated with the anthelmintics sold by OTK for cattle. Total sales are estimated at double these figures.","1040":"The immune responses of 2 Beagles to live parasites of an isolated B. canis strain were tested. The dogs were infected with live parasites and were carefully treated to allow the parasites to remain in the dogs' bodies for long enough to evoke an immune response. Once recovered from the initial infections, both dogs received 2 separate homologous challenges with live parasites. During the second challenge, neither dog showed clinical signs of disease. An experimental vaccine was developed against the isolated B. canis strain by growing parasites in a micro-aerophilous stationary phase cell culture system to provide (a) antigen-containing supernatant material and (b) pellet material containing dead parasites. Two dogs each were inoculated with the different formulations of the vaccine on 2 separate occasions. Three weeks after the second inoculation, all 4 dogs were challenged with live parasites. Three of the 4 dogs recovered from the challenge without any anti-babesial treatment.","1041":"Fifteen Friesian oxen between 12 and 18 months of age with a mean body mass of 240.7 kg, were randomly assigned to diets containing 0.25% phosphorus (P) or less, to evaluate the acute effects of a dietary cation:anion balance (DCAB) of either -11.1, +16.5 or +25.6 mmol 100 g-1 diet dry matter calculated as (Na+K) - (Cl+S), on blood, bone and faecal P, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) for a period of 9 weeks. Bone and faecal P concentrations were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the anionic treatment group compared with the cationic and control treatment groups. The same was true for blood P, but significant (P &lt; 0.05) only when compared with the cationic treatment group. Bone Ca was lower (NS) and blood Ca was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the cationic compared to the anionic and control treatment groups, but faecal Ca was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the anionic compared to the cationic, and control treatments groups. There was little difference in blood and bone Mg content among treatment groups, but faecal Mg was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the anionic treatment group compared to the other 2 treatment groups. Whether this was due to the anionic nature of the diet or dietary concentration of Mg is unclear. Results from this research indicate a P sparing effect in which a low DCAB may improve the availability of P in animals where dietary P is limiting. In critical evaluations, weekly sampling of rib bone should be used to give a more accurate assessment of acute changes in bone mineral.","1042":"This retrospective study reports on the fertility of bitches (n = 40) that were inseminated into the fornix vaginae with frozen-thawed sperm from 9 sperm donors. In most bitches, the inseminations were repeated daily although, in 5 bitches, 1-2 d were skipped between some inseminations. All semen had been frozen by the same method and all prostatic fluid had been frozen at -18 degrees C prior to use. Sixteen Beagle bitches (Group 1) were inseminated with frozen-thawed semen to which 3-5 ml prostatic fluid had been added post-thaw. Ten German Shepherds and 4 other bitches of similar size (Group 2) were inseminated after adding 6-10 ml prostatic fluid to the frozen-thawed semen. Ten different German Shepherd bitches (Group 3) were inseminated without using prostatic fluid. The volumes of individual insemination doses were 3.5-6 ml, 7-12 ml and 1-3 ml for Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The number of progressively motile sperm per insemination varied from 9 x 10(6) to 300 x 10(6). Sixteen of 16, 13 of 14 and 6 of 10 bitches conceived in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean litter sizes were 4; 5.6 and 4 in Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The pregnancy rate of Groups 1 and 2 combined was higher than that of Group 3 (P &lt; 0.01). The mean number of foetuses per bitch bred was 5.2 (SD 3.2) for Group 2, which was higher than the 2.4 (SD 2.8) of Group 3 (P &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1043":"","1044":"","1045":"South African Mutton Merino wethers (n = 5) were each dosed with 2.5 g copper oxide needles. Three weeks later the sheep were placed on stainless steel metabolic crates to facilitate urine and faecal collection. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) (1.7 mg kg-1) was administered intravenously, blood samples were collected at intervals and different pharmacokinetic parameters for TTM were determined and are presented. Serum molybdenum concentration data were best described by a 2-compartmental open model with first order rate constants. An elimination half-life (T1\/2 beta) of 396.8 min, steady state volume of distribution (Vdss) of 0.8 e kg-1 and total body clearance (C1B) of 1.53 ml kg-1 min-1 were observed using non-linear compartmental analysis. A significant (p &lt; or = 0.05) increase in molybdenum excretion in the faeces occurred at 24 and 48 h following TTM administration. No increase in faecal and urinary copper excretion could be demonstrated, probably because the sheep were not copper-loaded. However, before a shorter dosage interval can be recommended for the treatment of sheep during the haemolytic crisis of chronic copper poisoning, further research in copper-loaded sheep is indicated.","1046":"Most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) have similar absorption and disposition characteristics. Absorption after oral administration is good, extensive plasma protein binding results in a small volume of distribution, and excretion of metabolites occurs mainly in the urine after hepatic biotransformation of the active drug. The main clinical indications for use of NSAID's are anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic, and an increasing list of new indications are continually being found. The disposition, pharmacokinetics and clinical indications of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in domestic animals are reviewed.","1047":"A 6-year-old male Boxer dog was presented with a history of acute blindness. Direct and consensual pupillary light reflexes were reduced. The fundus of both eyes appeared normal during ophthalmoscopic examination. Further diagnostic investigations included magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and electroretinography. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal, but the electroretinogram was extinguished. A diagnosis of sudden acquired retinal degeneration was made.","1048":"A 2-year-old dog was presented with a history of recurrent pain on opening its mouth. Clinical examination revealed conjunctivitis and chemosis of the left eye. Ultrasound examination of the eye revealed poor definition of the extra-ocular muscles. An orbitotomy was performed and a 50 mm-long silver of wood was removed from the retrobulbar tissues.","1049":"A survey was conducted in the Molopo district of the North West Province to determine the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in the cattle population of 57,000 grazing on communal and privately owned lands. Testing of cattle (n = 9,675) for tuberculosis was done by means of the comparative intradermal tuberculin test. The prevalence was found to be 0.062%. The significance of this result, when compared to the reported incidence of tuberculosis within the human population of the district, is discussed.","1050":"A preliminary survey to determine the seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis amongst adult beef cows in the Highveld veterinary region was conducted. Based on complement fixation tests, about 48.2% of seropositive beef herds and 4.47% of seropositive individual animals could be expected in the region. Since heifer calves on some farms apparently receive their doses of strain 19 vaccine later than the prescribed age of 4 to 8 months, more vaccination reactions than would normally occur, could be expected. The above figures should therefore be considered an over-estimation.","1051":"Many factors have been cited as possible reasons for the decline in the number of wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), but few studies have provided supportive data. Between 1990 and 1993, the dynamics of 10 wild dog packs in the southern district of the Kruger National Park in South Africa were monitored. Casual observations of the causes of disease and mortality in the entire population were also recorded. During the same period, 46 wild dogs were immobilised, weighed, and subjected to physical examination as well as the collection of blood and faecal specimens. External parasites were collected and blood smears were prepared. Serum specimens were subjected to routine blood chemistry analyses, hormone and serological assays and formalinised blood specimens and faeces were subjected to screening for endoparasites. The study population varied from 75 in 1990 to 123 in 1993 with a survival rate of 29.9% for pups, 64.3% for yearlings and 69% for adults. Eighty per cent or more of the population were under 4 years of age. The cause of death in all wild dogs in the Kruger National Park could be established only in a small number of cases. Lions were responsible for the death of 20\/62 wild dogs and disease caused the death of 6\/62 wild dogs. All immobilised dogs were in a good physical condition, but 85% of dogs had one or more skin lesions. Potential life-threatening lesions (bitewounds inflicted by other dogs and lesions inflicted by a snare) occurred in 4 dogs. One male dog had only one testicle in the scortum. Twenty-six (93%) blood smears were positive for gametocytes of Hepatozoon sp., presumably H. canis, and in 2 dogs trophozoites of Babesia canis were seen. Eighty-six per cent of the specimens were positive for Dipetalonema reconditum. All dogs were infested with ticks and Haemaphysalis leachi, Amblyomma hebraeum, A. marmoreum, Boophilus decoloratus, Rhipicephalus simus, R. evertsi, R. appendiculatus and R. zambesiensis were identified. Ctenocephalides sp. and Echidnophaga larina were also identified. Taenia sp., Toxascaris canis and Ancylostoma caninum were present in faecal specimens. Antibody titres to adenovirus (26\/31), B. canis (6\/15), canine para-influenza virus (21\/31), coronavirus (20\/31), Coxiella burnetti (8\/29), reovirus Type 3 (9\/31), Rickettsia conori\/africae (27\/29), rotavirus (16\/31) and Toxoplasma gondii (16\/16) were found. The average serum urea concentration was higher (16.4 mmol\/e) than that described for captive wild dogs, but other biochemical parameters were generally in agreement with values reported for captive wild dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1052":"Liver and kidney copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) concentrations were studied over a 7-month period after parenteral supplementation using Cu heptonate and barium (Ba) selenate in 44 8-month-old South African (SA) Mutton Merino wethers. Responses in plasma Cu and blood Se concentrations, as well as fecundity were also measured in a breeding flock of SA Mutton Merino ewes for 3 consecutive years. The effect of maternal supplementation with Cu and Se was assessed in terms of biochemical parameters and production responses in 654 lambs produced by these ewes. Parenteral treatments with Cu and Se raised liver and kidney concentrations (P &lt; or = 0.05) for up to 7 months in wethers under conditions where liver Cu and Se respectively declined to concentrations below 30 mg\/kg DM and 300 micrograms\/kg dry matter (DM) in spring. Plasma Cu concentrations of breeding ewes which received Cu heptonate were increased (P &lt; or = 0.05) by 18% relative to the control group in which concentrations declined to 91 micrograms\/dl during late pregnancy. Blood Se concentrations of control ewes exceeded 200 ng\/ml, and were unaffected by parenteral Se supplementation. Survival of progeny of Cu heptonate treated ewes tended (P &lt; or = 0.10) to be improved by 13% (0.68 vs 0.60). This tendency was accompanied by generally higher (P &lt; or = 0.10) plasma Cu concentrations of these lambs relative to control lambs at 10 - 20 and 45 - 55 d of age. Lambs of Cu supplemented ewes that died prior to weaning, had higher (P &lt; or = 0.05) liver Cu concentrations than control group contemporaries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1053":"A Bearded Collie was presented with clinical signs of intermittent weakness, intermittent pain in the back legs and a bilateral absence of the femoral pulse. Further diagnostic investigations revealed proteinuria, hypoproteinaemia, hyperlipidaemia and azotaemia. A quantitative estimation of the proteinuria using a protein\/creatinine ratio indicated a loss of 483 mg kg-1 of protein per day. A large caudal aortic thrombosis was demonstrated by means of non-selective angiography and ultrasonographic examination. Autopsy confirmed an extensive aortic thrombus extending from the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra to include both iliac and femoral arteries at the level of the stifle joints. A large thrombus, 4 cm in length, was also found in the pulmonary artery. Histopathological examination of the kidneys revealed a subacute to chronic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.","1054":"A neurological syndrome in a herd of Friesland cows (n = 100) on a diet including sorghum beer residues is described. Over a period of 8 months, 76 cows developed weakness of the hindquarters, progressively worsening ataxia and, eventually, paralysis and permanent recumbency. The course of the disease varied from 2 to 8 weeks. The lesions were significant in the 2 cows necropsied and included extensive, bilaterally symmetrical dilation of myelin sheaths, axonal swelling and loss with Wallerian degeneration, and depletion of myelin in both ascending and descending tracts at all levels of the spinal cord. Focal neuronal degeneration in the spinal cord grey matter and dorsal root ganglia, and focal loss of axons and ovoid formation in the spinal nerve roots and ischiatic nerves were also evident. The pathogenesis of the spinal lesions appears to involve a primary axonopathy with secondary myelin loss. The epidemiology, clinical signs and pathology suggest that the disease was associated with the fungus Aspergillus clavatus.","1055":"Three cases of nasal mycotic granuloma containing fungal cells and hyphae in cattle are described. In 2 animals a mucopurulent or purulent nasal discharge was seen clinically, and epistaxis in the third. Histologically, ulceration of the nasal mucosa and a severe granulomatous inflammation of the nasal submucosa with eosinophils as the predominant cell type were evident in the cattle. Non-pigmented fungal cells identified as chlamydospores and short septate hyphae were demonstrated in giant cells and extracellularly within the granulomatous reactions. In one case, the fungal elements were frequently surrounded by homogeneous eosinophilic (Splendore-Hoeppli) material. Dematiaceous fungi, Bipolaris sp. and Drechslera sp., were isolated from 2 cases. Mycology was not performed on the third animal.","1056":"An 8-year-old, Maltese-cross bitch presented with chronic neck and back pain and an acute onset of circling, hyperaesthesia and constant crying. Clinical examination revealed temporal muscle atrophy, an abnormal hanging reflex, cervical rigidity and severe hepatomegaly. Ultrasonography of the liver showed several disseminated, poorly demarcated, hypoechoic areas which on fine needle aspirates, contained large numbers of pigmented fungal hyphae. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed fungal hyphae and numerous Ehrlichia canis morulae. A diagnosis of systemic phaeohyphomycosis secondary to ehrlichiosis was proposed. Treatment was unsuccessful and the dog was euthanased. At necropsy, multiple yellowish-green to black, necro-granulomatous foci were found throughout the liver parenchyma and similar foci were present in the spleen, renal cortices and adrenal glands. Irregular, multifocal, grey to black foci of malacia were present in both the grey and the white matter of the brain. On histopathological examination pigmented fungal hyphae were demonstrated in the liver, spleen, kidneys, portal lymph node and adrenals, as well as in the brain. Cultures of various organs yielded a fungal organism identified as Xylohypha bantiana.","1057":"Two young (&lt; 2 years old) elephants (Loxodonta africana) died suddenly and simultaneously at Ongava Game Reserve bordering on the Etosha National Park, Namibia. Both elephants showed lung congestion, epi- and endocardial haemorrhages and hyperaemic areas in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine. Histopathology of the myocardium showed multifocal degeneration and necrosis of muscle fibres accompanied by haemorrhages. Parts of the leaves of the alien plant Cryptostegia grandiflora (Asclepiadaceae) were found in the intestinal tracts of the elephants. These findings suggested that the elephants died from heart failure after ingesting this plant which contains cardiac glycosides.","1058":"The effects of a progestagen treatment regimen on the calving-to-conception period and number of inseminations per conception in a Holstein-Friesland herd [n = 60] were investigated. No significant (P &gt; 0.05) differences were observed in days from calving to conception (80.5 vs. 82.3) and inseminations per conception (1.52 vs. 1.41) between the treatment and the control groups, although the treatment possibly contributed to an improved oestrus detection rate.","1059":"Determination of the residual anthelmintic efficacy in sheep of an oral formulation of moxidectin at a dosage rate of 0.2 mg kg-1 was evaluated 27-29 (mean: 28) d after dosing and that of the injectable formulation of moxidectin at a dosage rate of 0.2 mg kg-1 at 27-29 (mean: 28) and 34-36 (mean: 35) d post-treatment. The injectable formulation was more than 80% effective in more than 80% of treated sheep against a third larval stage challenge of Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta, Gaigeria pachyscelis and Oesophagostomum columbianum at both 28 and 35 d post-treatment. The oral formulation on the other hand was equally effective against a third larval stage challenge of G. pachysce1is at 28 d post-treatment and more than 60% effective in more than 60% of treated sheep against a third larval stage challenge at 28 d post-treatment of H. contortus, T. circumcincta and O. columbianum.","1060":"Faecal specimens from 1- to 7-week-old piglets (n = 251) with acute diarrhoeal illness were examined by direct negative staining electron microscopy for the presence of viral agents. Rotaviruses were observed in almost 40% of cases while adenoviruses and astroviruses were also observed in 3 specimens each. The majority of the rotaviruses reacted with a commercial Group A rotavirus ELISA although in 11 specimens they did not react with the Group A antigen and could represent atypical rotaviruses. This is the first report of adenoviruses and astroviruses in diarrhoeal faecal specimens from pigs in South Africa.","1061":"The effects of salinomycin (20 mg kg-1 feed), monensin (33 mg kg-1 feed) and a daily rotation of these ionophores, on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) were investigated in 60 steers (273 kg) over an 84-day feedlot period. Individual feed intakes and weight gains were recorded. The data were fitted to linear regressions with individual animals as replicates, from which ADGs, ADFIs and FCEs were calculated. Means of parameters of the control, salinomycin, monensin and rotation treatments were respectively ADG (kg): 1.56, 1.74, 1.58 and 1.66; FCE (kg DM\/kg): 5.83, 5.43, 5.53 and 5.38; ADFI (kg): 9.10, 9.43, 8.83 and 8.90; final weight (kg): 402, 419, 407 and 413. Salinomycin showed the greatest improvement in gain, whereas monensin did not affect gain and tended to decrease feed intake. The rotation programme did not result in added benefits above those that could be obtained with a single ionophore (salinomycin), although feed efficiency tended to increase.","1062":"During June 1994, members of numerous organisations with a vested interest in animal traction in South Africa met for a one-day workshop, the initial activity of a Forum on Working Animals. The workshop was sponsored by the Foundation for Research Development in South Africa. The individuals who attended were representatives of academic and government institutions, farmer and civic organisations, and included veterinarians and veterinary scientists, administrators, traction experts from the region and from abroad, agricultural engineers, sociologist, anthropologists and animal welfare experts. The objectives of the workshop were twofold: to address research priorities in veterinary science for traction animals and to identify future actions. Since it was a one-day workshop only, there was insufficient time to address issues in depth. However, problems were identified and appropriate actions were suggested. These actions were then delegated to a number of participants, to be refined and reported on at a subsequent workshop. Two key questions were considered and discussed by the participants, and a consensus reached for each. The first was to consider which species of traction animals are best suited to South African conditions. It was agreed that, in order of suitability, these are donkeys, cattle, mules and horses. The second question concerned the criteria which determine the usefulness of traction animals to South African communities. Two recommendations were made by the participants. The first recommendation was to design a questionnaire which would address the role of traction animals in the South African community and to identify communities in which the questionnaire would be implemented. At present, no information exists on the demographics of traction animals and their users. A list of questions was suggested and a working group from 6 institutions was identified to address this action. The second recommendation was to develop a research programme to study the 4 species which are most suitable for animal traction in South Africa.","1063":"","1064":"","1065":"Little information exists concerning the presence of nematode parasites of horses in South Africa. Limited studies are available which compare the parasites in horses originating from differing management schemes. The aim of the present study was to compare the nematode parasites of 2 groups of horses which had been managed differently. Group 1, chiefly Nooitgedacht adult ponies, consisted of cycling or early pregnancy mares. They were maintained chiefly on zero grazing, given supplemental feed and treated 4 times a year with antiparasitic remedies. The horses in Group 2 were mostly Thoroughbred adults which grazed on irrigated pastures daily and received antiparasitic remedies twice a year. The 2 groups were each divided into conventional and selective subgroups. The horses in the conventional subgroup were treated with antiparasitic remedies as they had been previously under the relevant management. The horses in the selective subgroup were treated with an antiparasiticide if the nematode egg count was greater than or equal to 300 eggs per gram of faeces. Faecal samples, collected monthly from all horses, were analysed for quantitative nematode egg counts and larval cultures for each of the 4 subgroups. Nematode eggs recovered included those of Parascaris equorum, Strongyloides and predominantly, strongyles. Faecal samples of foals were also examined for oocysts of coccidian parasites, but were negative. Differentiation of third-stage larvae (L3) from cultures, distinguished between cyathostome (or small strongyles) and Strongylus spp. Statistical analyses were performed on the total mean nematode egg counts for conventional and selective subgroups within each group of horses and subgroups for each month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1066":"The diagnostic phase of an interactive veterinary research evaluation model was used in the investigation into the potential veterinary needs of a low-income, semi-rural community. The economic status of households was estimated according to an economic situation score (ESSCORE) and a subjective nutritional score (SNS). Data were gathered by means of structured interviews and direct observations. Sixty-one per cent of the households (n = 190) owned animals. Dogs were the animal most frequently owned. However on the basis of total numbers, chickens were the most numerous and the second most frequent animal kept. The relative frequency of cattle and goats, was also considerably higher than that of dogs. Few sheep were owned by respondents, although they were an animal species that people desired to own. The finding that respondents saw more disadvantages than benefits in their neighbour's animals, indicated that increased animal ownership could lead to friction. Better fencing might decrease the damage caused by goats and donkeys. A considerable excess of consumption over production of animal products, was discovered. Meat and milk were seen as the main benefits by those who did not own animals. This indicated a possible market for animal products if production were increased. It was considered that subsidised veterinary extension might be the most cost-effective solution for those who cannot afford to pay for curative interventions.","1067":"The haemoprotozoan parasite, Babesia canis, is the cause of an economically important and potentially life-threatening disease of dogs in South Africa, the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. Available literature is reviewed, with emphasis on the pathophysiology of the anaemia and complications of babesiosis. The remainder of the review explores the possibility that pathophysiological mechanisms currently being investigated in human malaria and bovine babesiosis (in which, as in canine babesiosis, an intra-erythrocytic parasite causes multi-systemic pathology) might also be active in B. canis infections. The entity referred to as the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is discussed as a proposed mechanism within which apparently unrelated aspects of babesiosis form a predictable pattern. The molecular mediators of multiple organ dysfunction, including cytokines, nitric oxide and free oxygen radicals, are generated by host tissues, and are now under active study to help elucidate the pathophysiology of malaria. The similarities between the manifestations of different diseases in different host species can be explained by the concept that the disease process is largely mediated by these molecules, generated by the host in response to the parasite, rather than arising directly from the parasite itself. The current direction of malaria research provides a basis for future research into the pathophysiology of canine babesiosis.","1068":"Rotavirus particles were detected in the stools of 8 out of 12 Saanen kids with either diarrhoea or an increased rectal temperature. No other pathogenic organisms could be recovered from these kids. This is believed to be the first report of rotavirus infection in goats in southern Africa.","1069":"A 6-month-old Miniature Doberman Pinscher was presented with inappetance and cerebellar signs. Babesia canis organisms were found on a capillary bloodsmear. The cerebellar signs resolved rapidly following treatment with diminazene aceturate. A 7-month-old Siberian Husky developed cerebellar signs, blindness and quadriparesis 9 d after presentation with clinical signs typical of uncomplicated canine babesiosis. The dog responded favourably to treatment with prednisolone. Both acute and delayed cerebellar ataxia have been associated with malaria in humans. The clinical signs shown by these dogs were similar to those reported for malaria in humans. Cerebellar ataxia should be considered a possible complication of canine babesiosis.","1070":"Primary hypoadrenocorticism in dogs may be poorly responsive to oral fluorocortisone treatment. Desoxycorticosterone pivalate is a suggested alternative treatment in these and all other cases of hypoadrenocorticism. Primary hypoadrenocorticism was diagnosed in a 3-year-old Cocker Spaniel bitch. Treatment with oral fluorocortisone at a dose rate of 0.13 mg 5 kg-1 d-1 was ineffective at maintaining serum electrolyte concentrations within normal limits. Administration of DOCP at a dose of 1.6-2.2 mg kg-1 intramuscularly every 28 d over a 5-year period, successfully maintained normal serum sodium and potassium concentrations. Side-effects encountered were minimal and were dose- or disease-related.","1071":"A field outbreak of poisoning of cattle by ganskweek (Lasiospermum bipinnatum [Thunb.] Druce) in the Molteno district is described. In addition to the typical histopathological lesion of zonal hepatic necrosis and haemorrhage, pulmonary lesions of interstitial pneumonia, emphysema and bronchial epithelial changes similar to those described in experimental ganskweek poisoning in sheep are reported.","1072":"Extensive brain pathology attributed to Sarcocystis is described in a heifer and a 2- to 4-month-old calf. These appear to be the first recorded cases of naturally occurring acute sarcocystosis in cattle in sub-Saharan Africa. The heifer became recumbent and had convulsions before dying, while clinical signs in the calf included loss of body mass, diarrhoea, nervousness and opisthotonus. Disseminated haemorrhages were noted in the brains of both animals at necropsy. Microscopically, the grey and white matter contained multiple areas of necrosis associated with haemorrhage, fibrinoid vasculitis, perivascular cuffing and gliosis. A multifocal meningitis was also present. First-generation Sarcocystis schizonts were evident in, or adjacent to endothelial cells of several arterioles and small arteries. The association of first- (as opposed to second-) generation schizogony with overt and fatal bovine sarcocystosis, has not previously been reported.","1073":"Nine out of 120 ostriches died from congestive heart failure within 96 h of ingesting avocado leaves and immature fruit in an avocado orchard containing Hass and Fuerte cultivars. Foliage and immature fruit from both cultivars dosed to ostriches (n = 4) and domestic hens (n = 8) resulted in severe cardiomyopathy in all the ostriches. In the hens, which had received a lower dose, milder lesions occurred. Macroscopically the intoxication in ostriches resulted in a severe anasarca of the neck and ventral body. The cardiomyopathy was characterised by degeneration and necrosis of myocytes, a marked infiltration of heterophils and in one case, early fibroplasia.","1074":"Results of a first-stage larval reduction test (L1RT) were compared with those of a controlled anthelmintic test (CAT) done on naturally infected sheep which grazed on spray-irrigated grass\/legume pastures at Tygerhoek Experimental Farm near Riviersonderend in the southern Cape Province. The 3 anthelmintics used were morantel, ivermectin and levamisole. According to the L1RT, treatments reduced the geometric means of Strongyloides by 74.2 to 95.2% and those of the adults of all the other genera (Haemonchus, Nematodirus, Oesophagostomum, Teladorsagia, Trichostrongylus and Trichuris) by 99.4 to 99.75%. By contrast the results of the CAT were more variable, placing the reliability of the L1RT in doubt. In addition, the CAT could also evaluate the effect against fourth larval stage Teladorsagia.","1075":"Three dogs experimentally infected with Ehrlichia canis developed thrombocytopaenia and high antibody titres to E. canis in indirect fluorescent antibody tests. One dog also became leukopaenic. At Weeks 6 and 8 post-infection, the dogs were treated with imidocarb dipropionate (5 mg kg-1 subcutaneously) and a further dose was administered at Week 12 (5 mg kg-1 intramuscularly). Twelve weeks after the last treatment (post-treatment), all dogs had normal platelet counts which persisted for a further 10 weeks until the end of the experiment. The leukopaenia resolved 20 weeks post-treatment. Although antibody titres (&lt; 1\/5) to E. canis could not be detected prior to infection, titres of 1\/2 560 to 1\/5 120 developed by Week 6. By Week 8 post-treatment titres began to decline and by the end of the experiment were 5- to 6-fold serum dilutions lower (1\/80 to 1\/320). Sub-inoculation experiments 18 weeks post-treatment, failed to cause disease or stimulate antibody responses in susceptible dogs. Serology and sub-inoculation studies on 2 dogs experimentally infected with E. canis but not treated with imidocarb dipropionate, showed that these animals remained infected for the duration of the experiment. The results of these experiments confirm that imidocarb dipropionate is effective in the treatment of canine ehrlichiosis.","1076":"To identify the current South African practising veterinarians' profile, a survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire in 1992. The list of registered veterinarians according to the South African Veterinary Board was used as a frame for the sample. Five hundred questionnaires were processed. The general profile of a practising veterinarian in South Africa was male, between 30-40 years of age, city-dweller, English speaking and working in a mixed practice.","1077":null,"1078":"A necropsy conducted on an emaciated 8-year-old female African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park, revealed gross pathological changes compatible with generalised bovine tuberculosis. Macroscopic lesions in the lungs and associated lymph nodes were of a caseous necrotic nature with liquefied foci. Mycobacterium bovis was cultured from pulmonary lesions. The distribution and the characteristics of the lesions are described and the conclusion is made that the initial route of infection was aerogenous with secondary bacterial metastasis to the intestine. It would also appear that the spread of infection within the animal was extremely rapid. The conjecture is made that due to the cavernous state of the pulmonary lesions, the animal was probably highly infective at the time of death. Environmental factors that may have had an influence on the pathogenesis of the disease are seasonal rainfall fluctuations, extreme temperature variations and harsh ultra-violet exposure.","1079":"Holstein calves (n = 47) with a dwarf-like appearance, joint laxity, superior brachygnathism and domed foreheads were born to heifers on natural grazing on the same farm. Six calves, between one week and 3 months of age, were euthanased. Marginally low concentrations of manganese were found in the livers, while high strontium concentrations were confirmed in soil, plants and grass specimens from the pasture, as well as in the bone ash of the ribs of 2 calves. Microscopical lesions in growth plates included irregularly aligned and shorter columns of chondrocytes and a reduction in width of the zone of hypertrophy when compared to a normal calf. This syndrome closely resembled a previously described chondrodystrophy in neonatal calves, attributed to a maternal manganese deficiency. Seepage from sea water evaporation pans on an adjacent farm was believed to have resulted in leaching of manganese from the soil and to be the source of the high levels of strontium. The cause of the skeletal defects is believed to be maternal manganese deficiency, complicated by an unknown factor.","1080":"A survey conducted in 1992, using a standardised, stratified sample was used to determine companion animal numbers in South Africa as a single geographical entity. The results indicated that there were 3.93 million dogs, 0.97 million cats, 0.98 million birds, 0.22 million other companion animals and 0.1 million horses in South African households. Thirty-seven per cent of households keeping companion animals, kept dogs; cats (13.4%); birds (4.8%); other companion animals (1.1%) and horses (2%). These results may provide information about possible markets in terms of numbers of species kept.","1081":"Rabbit hyperimmune serum prepared against a donkey alphaherpesvirus isolate (M7\/91), and against EHV-1 and EHV-4 was used to characterise the antigenic relationship between these 3 viruses. Serum from immunised rabbits was always more specific for homologous virus and showed different cross reactivity for heterologous virus. It was concluded that the immunologic relationship between the M7\/91 isolate and EHV-1, was closer than that between this isolate and EHV-4. A serological survey of donkeys (n = 116) and horses (n = 57) revealed evidence of the presence of neutralising antibody to M7\/91 in their sera. The titres of antibody to M7\/91 in donkeys, ranged from 1:32-1 &gt; or = 256 and was significantly higher than antibody titres to EHV-1 and EHV-4, while in horses, titres were lower but comparable to equine herpesvirus 1 and 4.","1082":"Two trials were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods of reducing the liver copper (Cu) concentration of sheep whose livers had been loaded with Cu, in order to protect the sheep from Cu toxicity, after dietary Cu had been withdrawn. In the first trial 0, 75, 150 and 300 mg zinc (Zn) kg-1 feed were added to a basic diet low in Cu and fed to hypercuprotic sheep (n = 32) for 88 d. At the end of the trial, liver Cu concentrations (c 800 mg Cu kg-1 DM) in all 4 treatments did not differ significantly from the Cu concentrations of the liver biopsy samples taken at the onset of the trial. From other measurements taken, none of the sheep appeared to be close to the haemolytic phase of chronic Cu toxicity. In the second trial, lasting 79 d, 40 hypercuprotic sheep were allocated to 4 treatments, viz. a control, a group receiving a parenteral treatment of Zn, amounting to approximately 7 mg Zn d-1 and 2 further groups receiving molybdenum (Mo) (15 and 30 mg Mo sheep-1 d-1), added to the basic diet high in sulphur (4,06 g kg-1 DM). The parenteral Zn treatment did not change liver Cu concentrations. The 15 mg and 30 mg Mo treatments reduced the Cu in the livers significantly by 24% and 42% respectively. It is suggested that both oral and parenteral Zn supplementation are ineffective in reducing liver Cu concentration once dietary Cu has been withdrawn from the diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1083":null,"1084":"The toxicity of 2 parenteral copper (Cu) supplements was investigated. Di-sodium copper ethylene diamino tetra acetate (Cu EDTA) and Cu heptonate were administered to sheep (n = 9) by a single subcutaneous injection at a concentration of 0,2, 1 and 2 mg Cu\/kg each (Trial 1.) Nine sheep were untreated and served as controls. The same treatments were applied to 2 sheep each (Trial 2) with the addition of 3 mg Cu\/kg live body mass as Cu heptonate, and Cu heptonate administered intravenously at rates of 0,2, 0,4 and 0,6 mg Cu\/kg live body mass. In Trial 1, 67% of the sheep treated with Cu EDTA at 2 mg Cu\/kg live body mass died within 3 to 17 d after treatment, while no mortalities occurred in sheep where Cu heptonate was administered at the same dosage rate and even at 3 mg Cu\/kg live body mass (P &lt; or = 0,01). Post-mortem examination suggested acute Cu toxicity in all cases. Liver Cu concentrations were markedly increased (P &lt; or = 0,05) by both supplements in groups of 3 treated sheep slaughtered over a 3-month period compared to control animals. The liver Cu concentrations of sheep that succumbed to Cu toxicity were within the normal range of 100 to 450 mg\/kg DM. Results from Trial 2 suggested that the 2 sheep treated with 2 mg Cu\/kg live body mass as Cu EDTA, experienced a haemolytic crisis between 5 and 11 d after treatment, resulting in the death of one of these sheep. The haemolytic crisis was characterised by a severe decrease in haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1085":"Blood was obtained at an abattoir from 4 groups of cattle. The first group was slaughtered in a conventional way, the second and third were subjected to shechita slaughter with or without the application of the captive bolt immediately after the cutting of the throat, and the fourth group of cattle was subjected to a period of recumbency prior to conventional slaughter. Blood samples were analysed for concentrations of catecholamines, cortisol, glucose, lactate and total lipids. The haematocrit and osmolarity was also determined. There were no major differences in the blood variables of cattle subjected to conventional slaughter and those of cattle which had been subjected to a period of recumbency prior to conventional slaughter. Plasma catecholamine concentrations in cattle subjected to shechita slaughter without the application of a stun, were significantly elevated when compared to any of the other groups. It was concluded that postural changes have very little effect on the blood variables, but that the application of a stun after the throat has been cut in shechita slaughter abolishes the increases in blood variables associated with shechita in the absence of stunning.","1086":"","1087":"","1088":"Ostriches (Struthio camelus) (n=90) were dissected and the musculature of part of the proximal pelvic limb examined. Graphical representation of these muscles are presented. It is evident that the anatomy of the hip and thigh of the ostrich is typically avian, but with only the M. iliofemoralis present. The M. iliotrochantericus medius is not found in ostriches, but both the M. iliofemoralis externus and M. iliofemoralis internus, as well as both parts of the M. flexor cruris lateralis and the M. ambiens are presnet in ostriches. The ambiens muscle, responsible for the automatic grasping action in birds, originates from the preacetabular lateral surface of the ilium. The insertion of this muscle is, as in other birds, via a long tendon on the head of the M. flexor digitorum magnus. A pectineus muscle is present in ostriches. The Mm. femorotibiales consists of 4 muscles, inclusive of the M. femorotibialis accessorius.","1089":"","1090":"This paper describes similar congenital cardiac anomalies in 2 half sibling Jersey calves. Both calves had ventricular septal defects with dextraposition of the aorta and hypertrophy of the right ventricle, consistent with Eisenmenger's complex. One of the calves also had patent foramen ovale. The 2 calves had been sired by the same bull, and collateral relationships existed between the sire and the 2 dams.","1091":"","1092":"An adult male German Shepherd dog presented with a chronic non-painful, non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb. On clinical examination a contracted sarotorius muscle was palpable. Histopathology of the affected muscle confirmed replacement fibrosis and muscle contracture. Surgical excision of the muscle resulted in complete recovery.","1093":"A natural non-fatal case of sheep-associated malignant catarrhal fever in a cow is reported. Viral DNA confirmed by nucleic acid hybridisation and polymerase chain reaction persisted in peripheral blood leukocytes for at least 3 months after the clinical onset of the disease. Concultivation of leukocytes with various cell cultures failed to result in isolation of the virus either by cytopathic effect or by nucleic acid hybridisation.","1094":"Nodular cutaneous and diphtheric oral lesions, resembling avian pox were observed in 2 flocks of young ostrich chicks. Typical eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were seen in histological sections and a pox virus was isolated from the lesions. A commercial fowl pox vaccine was used to protect young ostriches in the field.","1095":"An investigation into the cause of acute mortality in farmed hatchling crocodiles Crocodylus niloticus led to the isolation of chlamydia from the livers of affected animals. Prominent pathological finds were acute hepatitis with intracellular chlamydial colonies and generalized oedema. A chlamydia presumed to be C. psittaci was isolated from livers of affected hatchlings. Mortality subsided after treatment with oxytetracycline. This disease is now recognized as being a major problem on crocodile farms in Zimbabwe.","1096":"","1097":"Faecal nematode egg counts performed on one captive and 49 free-ranging wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) revealed the presence of eggs of Ancylostoma spp. in 12 (24%) of the animals. The captive wild dog pup showed anorexia, general malaise, pale mucous membranes and black stools. Adult male and female Ancylostoma caninum were recovered from an approximately 3-month-old pup which died of distemper-like disease and a 9-year-old severely debilitated captive wild dog. A single adult A. caninum was also recovered from the intestines of a free-ranging wild dog in the Kruger National Park. These findings confirm the wild dog to be a host for A. caninum.","1098":"Live mass, reproduction and pelvic dimensions (determined mainly by radiographic pelvimetry at more than 4 years of age) were obtained for ewes of the Langgewens Merino flock (n = 102), ewes of the Tygerhoek Merino flock (n = 434) and ewes of the Elsenburg SA Mutton Merino (n = 130) and Dormer flocks (n = 130). Ewes were classified as \"good\" or \"poor\" according to their rearing ability (ewes rearing\/ewes lambed--Er\/El) and rearing performance (lambs reared\/lambs born--Lr\/Lb) averaged over at least 4 lambings in 4 to 5 lambing opportunities. Good ewes tended to be lighter than poor ewes at 18 months (Merino) or weaning (SA Mutton Merino and Dormer). This tendency was also reflected in live mass at the time of radiography, being significant (P &lt; or = 0.01) in Tygerhoek Merinos. Good and poor ewes were similar with regard to fecundity (lambs born\/ewes lambed) and lambing percentage (lambs born\/ewes joined), but differed (P &lt; or = 0.01) markedly with regard to rearing percentage (lambs reared\/ewes joined), Er\/El and Lr\/Lb. Poor ewes constituted 6.9 to 21.7% of the available ewes in the respective flocks, and were involved in 38.9 to 56.9% of all cases of rearing failure. Good ewes had smaller (P &lt; or = 0.07) transverse pelvic diameters than poor ewes in the Langgewens Merino and Elsenburg Dormer flocks, while rearing performance was independent of transverse diameter in the other two flocks. Good ewes generally had larger conjugate pelvic diameters than poor ewes, significantly (P &lt; or = 0.05) so in the case of the 2 Merino flocks.","1099":"Five Holstein Friesian calves varying in age from 7 to 9 weeks old, were suspected of suffering from an inherited granulocytopathy known as bovine leucocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD). Four of them were examined clinically and at necropsy. The most significant clinical findings were fever, depression, weakness, emaciation, diarrhoea, pseudomembranous gingivitis, loose teeth, respiratory infection and occult blood in the faeces. Significant clinicopathological findings were marked leucocytosis, mainly due to a neutrophilia, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, increased alpha- and beta-globulins, elevated alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity, hypoglycaemia, and decreased blood urea concentrations. The necropsy revealed emaciated carcasses, granulomatous to necrotising gingivitis, pseudomembranous to necrotising enteritis with perforations, bronchopneumonia, splenic atrophy, and hypoplasia of the thymus. Histopathological examination supported the macroscopic findings.","1100":"Three 10- to 16-day-old Boer goat kids died and one kid was euthanased after showing depression, abdominal pain and refusal to suckle. Gross lesions in 2 kids comprised ulcerative and necrotic lesions in the ileum, colon and caecum. Microscopically, the mucosal lesions in the ileum of one kid were associated with necrosis of lymphoid follicles and acidophilic intranuclear inclusions in epithelial cells and in what appeared to be macrophages and dendritic reticular cells. Foci of necrosis and intranuclear inclusions were also present in the mesenteric lymph node, kidney and lung. Electron microscopy of sections of the intestine demonstrated the presence of intranuclear virus-like particles, morphologically compatible with a herpesvirus.","1101":"Two outbreaks of fluorosis in cattle and sheep were investigated in the Northern Transvaal. The animals exhibited severe dental lesions, lameness and exostoses. Plasma fluoride concentrations were high and there was an inversion of the albumin\/globulin ratio. Alkaline phosphatase activity was elevated. Drinking water from boreholes contained excessive amounts of fluoride and upon irrigation, pastures were also contaminated with fluoride.","1102":"Emphysematous cystitis in man and domestic animals is reviewed. A case of emphysematous cystitis occurring 5 d after standard therapy for urethral obstruction in a non-diabetic male Siamese-cross cat is described. Escherichia coli was isolated, and the cystitis resolved after antibiotic therapy.","1103":"Abnormal lateral tibiotarsal rotation has been reported as one of many abnormalities affecting the pelvic appendicular skeleton of birds. In this study, lateral rotation of the tibiotarsus affected 89 out of 1,407 ostrich chicks between 2 weeks and 6 months of age raised at the Oudtshoorn Experimental Farm. There was no sexual preference, but the lesion affected the right pelvic limb almost exclusively and very rarely the left limb. Pelvic appendicular skeletal abnormalities make a significant contribution to mortalities in ostrich chicks.","1104":"The incidence of cloacal prolapse in ostrich chicks hatched and raised on the Oudtshoorn Experimental Farm during the 1992-1993 breeding season was investigated. The condition which occurred primarily in male chicks, affected 14.65% of the total number of chicks hatched. The mortality rate amongst chicks with cloacal prolapse was very high. Although the pathogenesis and aetiology of the condition is unknown, a species of Cryptosporidium was present in large numbers in affected cloacas. Treatment with systemic antibiotics was found to be effective in some cases.","1105":"A serological investigation was carried out in the Molopo district of Bophuthatswana to determine the prevalence of brucellosis titre in heifers and cows (n = 9,675) over 24 months of age, which were grazing on communal tribal and privately owned land. The Rose Bengal, micro serum agglutination and complement fixation (CFT) tests were used. Two hundred and two (2.1%) animals tested positive with a CFT titre of 30 (IU ml-1) or higher. Factors that could have contributed to the relatively low prevalence are discussed.","1106":"Stables housing more than 20 horses in training were surveyed in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging area of South Africa. Most racehorses were kept in loose boxes, bedded on straw or sawdust and remained indoors while the stables were cleaned. The average floor area was 13 m2 and airspace was 55 m3 per animal. The average predicted minimum air change rate by natural convection in calm winds was 7.0 air changes per hour, which was reduced to 2.2 when the doors and shutters were closed. The survey showed that many of the stables had been built without due consideration to factors that might have adverse effects on the occupants.","1107":"The different bedding and nesting materials used for small laboratory animals (mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits) by different institutions (n = 27) in South Africa were investigated by making use of questionnaires. A response of 81.5% was obtained. Twenty-two per cent of the respondents made exclusive use of direct (contact) bedding materials, whilst the rest used both direct (breeding) and indirect (nonbreeding) bedding methods. Three institutions did not use bedding materials for indirect bedding applications. Ten different bedding and nesting materials were identified. Non-sterile materials were used by 57% (indirect bedding), 44% (direct bedding), and 42% (nesting material) of the respondents. Between 7 and 22% of the respondents did however use both sterile and non-sterile materials for the different applications.","1108":"Samples of blood from normal healthy (n = 7) and Babesia canis-infected dogs (n = 7) were subjected to varying oxygen tensions in a tonometer, after which the samples were subjected to blood gas analysis and haemoximetry. This data was used to plot haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curves (ODC) for both groups of dogs. States of acidosis and hypercapnia were then simulated by modelling, and the response of the 2 haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curves compared. The ODC of the B. canis-infected group showed a decreased ability to shift to the right when compared to that of the normal, healthy ODC. This decreased Bohr effect probably exacerbates the severe tissue hypoxia associated with this disease by impairing the ability of haemoglobin to off-load oxygen at the tissue level.","1109":"","1110":"A 6-year-old Doberman bitch was presented for an acute onset of circling, hemiparesis and depression. Clinical examination revealed conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, anaemia, decreased facial sensation, decreased jaw, tongue and pharyngeal tone, decreased conscious proprioception, decreased flexor withdrawal reflexes, and abnormal hemiwalking and hemistanding. Pancytopaenia was evident on haematological evaluation. Bone marrow cytology revealed a bacterial infection. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Despite antibiotic treatment, the dog died. On autopsy, widespread multifocal inflammatory lesions were found to be present in the lungs, liver, spleen, meninges, lymph nodes, adrenal glands and kidneys. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated in pure culture from these organs and tissues. Histopathological examination showed numerous gram-positive intracellular rod-shaped bacteria seen in all the above-mentioned organs.","1111":"Virus was isolated from the blood of horses (n = 5) showing fever and jaundice and was identified as equine encephalosis virus. In cross neutralisation tests, the isolates were shown to belong to a new serotype related to Gamil, one of the 6 known serotypes of equine encephalosis virus. The name Potchefstroom has been proposed for this new serotype.","1112":"Foci of necrosis with formation of heterophilic granulomas in the medullary region of the thymus were found in apparently normal slaughtered crocodiles from 4 South African crocodile farms. The comparative pathology of these lesions is discussed. From these preliminary results it may be assumed that thymic necrosis occurs commonly in intensively reared slaughter crocodiles. The cause of this condition, however, remains obscure.","1113":"Bonsmara bulls (n = 10) were castrated at 410 d of age. Their scrotal circumference varied between 31.0 and 42.0 cm (mean: 36.0; SD: 1.7). Bulls were divided into above average (&gt; 36 cm) and below average (&lt; 36 cm) groups. Significant correlations were reported for scrotal circumference with seminiferous tubules diameter (r = 0.84), percentage vacuolisation (r = -0.74) and epididymal sperm reserves (r = 0.79). A significant linear relationship (Y = 3.9 X = 105.3) was reported between scrotal circumference and epididymal sperm reserves.","1114":"Perinatal lamb deaths were investigated in Dormer (n = 290) and SA Mutton Merino (n = 306) progeny born to 166 and 147 ewes respectively. Causes of mortality were investigated by autopsy in 30 Dormer and 61 SA Mutton Merino lambs that died during the perinatal period. Perinatal lamb deaths were higher (P &lt; or = 0.01) in SA Mutton Merino lambs than in Dormers (0.199 vs 0.103). Anteparturient deaths (APD) were confined almost exclusively to triplet lambs, and contributed 10-12% of the overall perinatal lamb mortalities in both breeds. This category was closely associated with prolonged parturition, with 86% of the 7 ewes involved needing assistance after more than 4 h. The majority of parturient deaths (PD) were associated with stressful births, which contributed a higher (P &lt; or = 0.05) proportion of total perinatal deaths in SA Mutton Merino lambs than in Dormers (0.508 vs 0.267). Ewes giving birth to litters consisting of one or more lambs in the birth stressed PD or birth stressed post parturient death (PPD) categories (also including APD deaths because of their obvious relationship to prolonged births), furthermore had longer (P &lt; or = 0.05) parturitions than contemporaries that lost one or more lambs as a result of other causes, or ewes that reared all lambs born through the perinatal period (214 vs 98 and 74 min respectively). Uncomplicated starvation\/mismothering\/exposure (SME) syndromes mostly contributed to the PPD category, and constituted 21-27% of perinatal lamb deaths in the 2 breeds. Deaths with clinical signs of SME could mainly be related to udder malfunction, which was observed in nearly 60% of the cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1115":"The tissue damage and subsequent healing of skin, linea alba and intestinal wall incisions made with a CO2-laser and a stainless steel surgical blade were evaluated clinically and histologically in dogs (n = 10). The amount of blood lost in each type of skin incision was measured by taking the pre- and postoperative mass of surgical swabs. The tissues were sutured and the skin incisions examined every day. The animals were subsequently euthanased (Day 12) and all incisions examined histologically. A delay in the healing process was observed in the laser incisions of the skin during the first 4 d, but there was no difference in the healing rate of the intestinal wounds or of the linea alba. The blood loss due to the laser incisions was significantly less than that caused by the surgical blade. It was concluded that the CO2-laser can be used with confidence when incising the skin and intestine and that, due to its precision, the surgical blade is by far a more accurate method to incise the linea alba.","1116":"Sera were collected from apparently healthy dogs in 3 major centres in Zimbabwe to establish the prevalence of antibodies reactive with Ehrlichia canis by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing at titres of 1\/20 or greater. The overall seroprevalence was 42% (39\/93) with dogs from Mutare (40%) and Harare (33%) having similar rates which were lower than those for Bulawayo (68%). The majority of the IFA positive dogs from Harare (67%) had no haematological or biochemical evidence of canine ehrlichiosis. Total protein, albumin and globulin values were determined in sera from blood collected from Bulawayo and Mutare and all values were within normal reference ranges. Western blot profiles of sera from dogs with IFA titres of greater than 1\/160 were similar to those using sera from dogs experimentally infected with E. canis Oklahoma strain. Our results indicate that an organism which is antigenically very similar or identical to E. canis is present in Zimbabwe and that dogs are commonly exposed to this organism.","1117":"","1118":"A complaint of poor productivity was investigated in a herd of Jersey cattle and a small flock of Dorper sheep that had been fed cabbage for 5 to 6 months per year, over a number of years. During that time a number of lambs were lost as a result of swayback, some cows aborted, milk production was down, and although the farmer was an experienced inseminator, the conception rate in the Jerseys was low. After rectal examination and consulting the records, 26% of the cows were found to have been open for more than 150 d and 28% had been inseminated more than 3 times. The body condition of the cows ranged from poor to moderate, the hair coats were dull and some cows were anaemia. The young lambs had visibly enlarged thyroids. Haematological investigations revealed a typical Heinz body type haemolytic anaemic. In the cattle the anaemia appeared to be macrocytic, hypochromic and associated with thrombocytosis, while in the sheep it seemed to be normochromic and slightly microcytic. Plasma copper concentrations were severely depressed in all cases. Most thyroxine concentrations were within the normal range, although some were on the low side. Analysis of cabbage revealed a high sulphur content and marginally low copper and zinc levels. The main factor in cabbage which is responsible for poor animal performance, is the high sulphur content. High levels of this mineral exert detrimental effects, in order of priority, by elevating s-methyl cystine sulphoxide, diminishing the availability of copper and raising the glucosinolate content of the plant.","1119":"Besnoitiosis was confirmed in a pony which presented with inspiratory dyspnoea, scleroderma and ventral oedema. Numerous cysts were visible in the sclerae. Histological examination of the skin confirmed the presence of numerous cysts. The parasite could not be transmitted by subcutaneous injection of homogenised skin from the infected horse to rabbits and a horse. Ultrastructural morphology of the crescent-shaped bradyzoites was not compatable with Besnoitia besnoiti or B. jellisoni and it is proposed that the infection was caused by B. bennetti.","1120":"The sites of attachment of female Karoo paralysis ticks (Ixodes rubicundus) were determined on Friesian, Bonsmara and Nguni cattle in the south-western Orange Free State. The largest proportion of the ticks (&gt; 30%) attached to the forelegs and shoulders of the cattle. Contrary to the findings on small stock, no significant differences in the preferred sites of attachment were evident between the breeds of cattle.","1121":"The histological and ultrastructural lesions of sheep (n = 5) with experimentally-induced vermeersiekte (Geigeria ornativa O. Hoffm. poisoning) were studied. Histological changes in the muscles of the skeletal system, diaphragm and oesophagus comprised hypertrophy and vacuolation of myofibres. In 2 sheep, foci of myocardial degeneration and necrosis were present. No microscopical changes were detected in the central nervous system and in peripheral nerves of the oesophagus and the hind limb. Ultrastructural alterations in the myocardium, semimembranosus muscle and oesophagus were characterised by concurrent myofibrillar degeneration and mitochondrial swelling. The earliest myofibrillar change appeared to be loss of the thick filaments followed by fragmentation and disorganisation and eventually by lysis of central myofibrils. Focal thickening, fragmentation and clumping of Z-band material and dissociation and fragmentation of intercalated discs accompanied the myofibrillar and mitochondrial alterations.","1122":"Dried milled Geigeria ornativa, which had been stored at room temperature for 4 years, was fed in rations to sheep. The usefulness of contrast radiography of the oesophagus, biopsies of oesophageal and skeletal muscles, electrocardiography, and clinical pathological parameters for diagnosing vermeersiekte were evaluated. Ethoxyquin was evaluated as a preventive agent. All the sheep developed signs of vermeersiekte but regurgitation was observed in only one animal. Contrast radiography and the examination of tissue biopsies were of diagnostic value in 8 out of 13 and 6 out of 6 sheep respectively. Electrocardiography did not aid in antemortal diagnosis of the condition and selected chemical parameters were non-specific. The inclusion of ethoxyquin in the diet of experimental animals (n = 3) prior to and during feeding of G. ornativa did not prevent the development of vermeersiekte. This study confirmed that dried stored G. ornativa retains its toxicity and that regurgitation is not a consistent clinical sign in sheep with vermeersiekte. The diagnostic value of contrast radiography of the oesophagus and examination of oesophageal and muscle biopsies is reported for the first time.","1123":"Controlled anthelmintic tests and faecal egg count reduction tests were carried out on natural infections of nematode parasites in sheep on 4 farms in the southern Cape Province. Albendazole, fenbendazole, ivermectin, levamisole, morantel citrate and a combination of albendazole and closantel sodium were tested. Every farm harboured anthelmintic resistant nematode parasites. Adult as well as immature Teladorsagia spp. were resistant to albendazole and fenbendazole, immature Teladorsagia spp. to albendazole\/closantel, adult and immature Nematodirus spp. to albendazole\/closantel and adult Nematodirus spp. to fenbendazole.","1124":"The pharmacokinetics of rafoxanide administered orally at 15 mg kg-1 were compared in suckling lambs (n = 8), aged 5-8 weeks and weaned lambs (n = 8), aged 21-22 weeks. A significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001) in area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were observed between the different age groups. The bioavailability, as measured by AUC and Cmax, was 2.5-3 times greater in the suckling lambs compared to the weaned lambs. No significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) in time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax), distribution half-life (T1\/2 alpha), elimination half-life (T1\/2 beta) and mean residence time (MRT) were observed. It was concluded that the pharmacokinetic differences observed between suckling and weaned lambs may result in an increased susceptibility of suckling lambs to the toxic effects of rafoxanide. Lambs younger than 8 weeks, should preferably not be treated with rafoxanide, or the dose must be reduced.","1125":"","1126":"","1127":"","1128":"","1129":"Pruritus associated with allergic skin diseases is an important reason for consultation in feline medicine. The pathophysiology of pruritus is poorly understood in the cat, but histamine and eicosanoids appear to be important mediators. The medical management of allergic pruritus in cats, especially those with atopy, using glucocorticoids, antihistamines, omega-3\/omega-6 fatty acid-containing products, and combinations thereof is discussed.","1130":"Neospora caninum was detected in the brains of twin aborted calves by means of a specific immunohistochemical test on formalin-fixed, wax-embedded tissues. Microscopic lesions associated with this infection included multifocal necrosis and gliosis in the brain accompanied by a mononuclear, perivascular inflammatory reaction and meningitis; and severe, diffuse epicarditis and subepicardial myocarditis characterised by infiltration of macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells. This report documents the first diagnosis of this parasite as a cause of bovine abortion in South Africa.","1131":"The efficacy of moxidectin at 0.2 mg kg-1 live body mass against the multiple anthelmintic resistant White River Krtz strain of H. contortus was determined and compared to that of ivermectin, a benzimidazole, a salicylanilide and levamisole. Moxidectin and levamisole were effective against this strain of H. contortus and reduced the arithmetic mean burdens of this parasite in the sheep by 99.98% and 99.59%, respectively, while the efficacy of ivermectin, albendazole and closantel was only 29.1%, 33.75% and 78.3%, respectively.","1132":"Pruritus associated with allergic skin diseases is an important reason for consultation in canine medicine. The pathophysiology of pruritus is poorly understood in the dog, but histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins appear to be important mediators. The medical management of allergic pruritus in dogs with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is discussed. Antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, and omega-3\/omega-6 fatty acid-containing products are often useful, either as single agents, in combinations, or for reducing glucocorticoid requirements.","1133":"Neospora caninum is a recently identified protozoan parasite which was previously confused with Toxoplasma gondii. Neosporosis in puppies commonly causes signs referable to parasitic encephalomyelitis and myositis. The parasite was identified in tissues from 3 9-week-old Labrador littermates which showed signs of progressive hind limb hyperextension and paralysis. The diagnosis was confirmed, utilising a specific avidin-biotin immunohistochemical technique. Attempts to treat the pups with clindamycin were unsuccessful. One case was additionally treated with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, but showed no improvement. Two pups were euthanased and necropsied. The predominant lesions were polymyositis and multifocal encephalomyelitis. Large clusters of tachyzoites were seen in the myofibres and thick-walled parasitic tissue cysts were found in the grey and white matter of the brain and spinal cord.","1134":"An outbreak of narasin poisoning in swine is described. Forty nine out of 108 lactating sows died over a period of one month after being fed a ration accidentally contaminated with narasin. Clinical signs included anorexia, respiratory distress, lethargy and posterior paresis, progressing to lateral recumbency and death. Necropsy examination in 3 pigs revealed extensive myocardial and skeletal muscle damage. Analysis of the feed confirmed the presence of high concentrations of narasin.","1135":"Feedlot oxen (n = 15) were herded and subjected to venepuncture on a daily basis for 2 weeks. Plasma glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, total lipids, total protein, cortisol, catecholamines, osmolarity and haematocrit were compared between Days 1 and 14. Plasma glucose concentration and haematocrit decreased significantly while total plasma lipid and free fatty acid concentrations increased significantly over the 14 d. Thereafter, food was withdrawn for 72 h from the experimental group (n = 10) and the same blood variables were compared in the control and the experimental groups. Plasma free fatty acid concentrations rose, while glucose concentrations declined in the experimental group during the fasting period. It is concluded that food deprivation for 72 h in cattle cannot be regarded as a major stressor.","1136":"Canine serum samples (n = 400) from the Pretoria area were tested for Leptospira antibodies, using the microscopic agglutination test. The prevalence of antibodies (inconclusive and positive titres) was 1.5%. Reactions were only against Leptospira interrogans serovars tarassovi and pyrogens. Leptospirosis does not appear to be an important canine disease in the Pretoria area.","1137":"The concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, albumin, inorganic phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, aspartate and alanine transaminases (AST and ALT), creatine kinase (CK), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LD), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin in the serum of a captive population of the mountain tortoise (Geochelone pardalis) (n = 13) were determined. Results varied considerably, particularly for most enzymes such as AST (11-113 U\/l,ALT (1-72 U\/l), CK (12-242 U\/l), LD (147-2641 U\/l) and ALP (56-168 U\/l).","1138":"Worm-free lambs (n = 6) were infected with 5,000 L3 of an ivermectin\/benzimidazole\/closantel resistant strain of Haemonchus contortus. On Day 21 post infection animals were allocated, according to worm egg counts, to 2 groups of 3 animals each and on Day 29 one group was treated with albendazole at 3.8 mg kg-1, while animals in the other group remained untreated as controls. All animals were slaughtered on Day 44 when the treated group was found to have 2,083 +\/- 1,718 worms and the controls 2,783 +\/- 633, a reduction of 25.2% in worm burdens. The pattern of egg output was monitored and it was found that 2 d after dosing, worm egg counts had been suppressed by 89% in the treated group; thereafter the egg counts increased, but never returned to the pretreatment levels and by Day 15 post treatment, they were still 41.1% lower in the treated group than in the controls.","1139":"The efficacy of injectable and oral formulations of moxidectin, at a dosage of 0.2 mg kg -1 live mass was evaluated by the non-parametric method (NPM) against the most common internal parasites of sheep in 9 trials involving a total of 201 sheep. Both formulations obtained an A classification (more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the treated animals) against the third (L3) and fourth (L4) larval and adult stages of Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcineta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Gaigeria pachyscelis, Chabertia ovina, Oesophagostomum columbianum and Dictyocaulus filaria, and L3 Nematodirus spathiger. The injectable formulation was similarly effective against L4 Strongyloides papillosus and the oral formulation against L4 N. spathiger and adult S. papillosus and N. spathiger. In contrast, a B classification (more than 60% effective in more than 60% of the treated animals) was obtained by the oral formulation against L4 of S. papillosus and by the injectable formulation against L4 and adult N. spathigher. Both formulations were ineffective against L3 S. papillosus, and the oral formulation also against the adults of this species.","1140":"Bone healing was assessed after stabilisation of transverse tibial osteotomies in adult Beagles (n = 6) with intramedullary pins, in conjunction with modified Mennen clamp-on plates to counteract rotation. Post-operative return to full limb function was compared to that after use of a two-pin, uniplanar (Type I) external skeletal fixator and an intramedullary pin combination (n = 6). Additional external splinting was not used. The dogs were graded weekly after exercise, according to a functional performance grading scale. All of the clamp-on plates were well tolerated. Bony periosteal callus incorporated the crimp arms and the mean time required for full limb function was 7 weeks. The clinical performance of the dogs, with the external skeletal fixators and intramedullary pins, was consistently lower during the initial 4 weeks. Soft tissue swellings with pin-tract drainage occurred, but resolved following removal of the transcortical fixation pins. These dogs returned to full limb function with bony bridging callus after 8 to 9 weeks. Quantitative assessment of the bone activity, using sequential scintigraphy at weekly intervals, suggested consolidation of the callus 6 weeks after the operation for the clamp-on plate and pin combination, and at 7 weeks for the external skeletal fixator and pin combination.","1141":"","1142":"The renal and faecal routes of water and electrolyte excretion in sheep were compared and changes in kidney function assessed when similar amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) were dosed in free and fixed ratios in water. Sheep (n = 6) either had free access to fresh drinking water (control phase) or 0.9% saline drinking water, or NaCl was dosed intraruminally with free access to fresh drinking water. In the final phase of the investigation, sheep were dosed intraruminally with NaCl while water intake was restricted. Variables monitored included fresh or saline water intake, water, sodium and potassium loss via the urine and faeces, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), fractional excretions of sodium (FENa) and potassium (FEK) and solute free water clearance (CH2O). Results indicated that where NaCl intake was high, sodium excretion via the urine was of far greater importance than that via the faeces and that changes in kidney function which occurred in order to excrete excess sodium, included increases in GFR and FENa, and declines in FEK and CH2O. Where significant differences were obtained in variables between the phases of high salt intake, these were attributed to differences in sodium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It was concluded that when NaCl intake is high, sodium homeostasis is chiefly maintained by increasing the amount of sodium made available to the nephron tubule (increased GFR), by decreased tubular reabsorption of this sodium and by increasing solute free water reabsorption.","1143":"The separation of young dogs from their mother at the age of 6 weeks had a negative effect on the physical condition and weight gain of separated pups compared to that of pups with maternal contact till 12 weeks. Disease susceptibility and mortality was higher in pups with a shorter maternal contact period. These factors were related to behavioural measurements of separation stress. However, early separation had no significant advantage to socialisation with humans, provided that separated and nonseparated pups had daily human contact. Early separation therefore did not improve dog\/human bonding processes but lowered condition and increased mortality in separated pups.","1144":"","1145":"","1146":"","1147":"","1148":"To further the study of human-companion animal interactions in black developing communities, the clients (n = 94) of a university-based animal hospital, serving primarily a developing community, were interviewed. The interviews covered demographics, socio-economic aspects, perceptions, values and attitudes of clients towards their dogs. Regular and new clients were compared. A profile of the hospital's black clientele was also constructed. The study showed that the majority of black clients value their dogs for the sake of security and protection. Attitudes towards pets parallelled improvements in socio-economic status. Most clients felt positive towards existing veterinary services. The results of this study support and highlight the value of a previous observational study and could prove to be invaluable in designing, implementing and planning socially relevant animal health services.","1149":"A practical test for evaluating the sweating response to various concentrations of the specific beta 2 agonist, salbutamol sulphate, is described. The results of performing this test on horses (n = 54) considered to be \"free sweaters\", horses (n = 6) that showed signs of heat stress following exercise, and horses with complete anhidrosis (n = 2) are presented. The results indicate that intradermal injections of 0.1 ml of salbutamol sulphate at dilutions of 10(-7) or less are suitable stimuli to elicit a visually detectable local sweating in horses with a normal sweating response. Horses that only sweated at the sites where salbutamol solutions with dilutions of between 10(-4) and 10(-6) were injected, probably had a reduced sweating response and could be considered to be suffering from partial anhidrosis. Horses with severe anhidrosis of long duration did not sweat, even in response to salbutamol solutions with dilutions of 2 x 10(-3).","1150":"Blood samples were collected from sheep on 24 farms in the Natal Midlands to ascertain the selenium, copper and zinc status of sheep kept under intensive grazing conditions on cultivated pastures in this region. The mean erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity was 34.1 enzyme units (EU: nmol NADPH oxidised min-1 mg-1 haemoglobin). A total of 59.4% of the samples contained less than 30 EU, a level below which a marginal deficiency may exist. The mean selenium concentration in whole blood was 0.57 mumol l-1. Sixty four per cent of the samples contained less than 0.63 mumol l-1, a level below which the animals were considered to be marginally deficient. The mean copper concentration in plasma was 16.1 mumol l-1 and that of zinc 15.0 mumol l-1. On none of the farms was the copper concentration in plasma below the concentrations accepted to represent a marginal deficiency, and ewes on only one farm had relatively low plasma zinc concentrations. It is concluded that many sheep grazing cultivated pastures in the Natal Midlands may be marginally deficient in selenium. However, the selenium status in sheep should be determined on individual farms before supplementation is recommended, as external sources of selenium are often supplied, mostly unintentionally. Seasonal variations in blood selenium concentrations did not follow a specific trend, probably because the sheep were grazing cultivated pastures for most of the year and feeding practices differed from farm to farm. It is therefore suggested that the selenium status of sheep be determined at the pre-mating and pre-lambing stages rather than in a specific season of the year.","1151":"The response to selenium supplementation of sheep grazing cultivated pastures was investigated on different farms in the Natal Midlands, Republic of South Africa. Over a period of one year, a significant (P &lt; 0.01) improvement of 18.2% in live mass gain and of 13.7 and 15.8% (P &lt; 0.05) in greasy and clean wool production, respectively, was measured in response to selenium supplementation in young ewes at the Cedara Research Station. In ewes injected with a long-acting barium selenate product, the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in the erythrocytes was maintained at elevated levels, above that of the control group, for almost 2 years. On 6 private farms, mature ewes were dosed approximately 6 weeks before mating, with a long-acting intraruminal selenium pellet. On 2 of the farms, a significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) in fertility of ewes was observed with no response to supplementation in the birth mass, lamb growth rate, or in lamb mortality. The long-acting pellets maintained elevated erythrocyte GSH-Px activity in the ewes for approximately one year. Although sheep on some farms in the Natal Midlands responded to selenium supplementation, it seems advisable to establish the selenium status of a flock before embarking on a supplementation programme. The risk of an excessive selenium intake, through the inadvertent supplying of selenium in different feed sources, has been demonstrated and should be guarded against.","1152":"This paper is apparently the first report of resistance of helminths of equids to anthelmintics in South Africa. While a strain of Cyathostominae from an Arab horse stud near Pretoria showed greatly reduced susceptibility to benzimidazoles in faecal egg reduction tests, ivermectin was apparently still unaffected. It is suggested that integrated methods of control such as alternation of horses and ruminants on pasture and mechanical removal of faeces should be used in addition to anthelmintics.","1153":"Incisions were made in the skin, linea alba and intestine of dogs (n = 5) with a CO2-laser and a stainless steel scalpel blade. The procedures were carried out on Day 0, 8, 10 and 11 in order to produce 1, 2, 4 and 12-day old samples. On Day 12 the dogs were euthanized, the incisions harvested and the breaking strength of each sample recorded. No significant difference in the strength developed in the skin and intestinal wounds could be observed, whereas the incisions made with the scalpel blade in the linea alba were significantly stronger.","1154":"Ostriches (Struthio camelus) (n = 20) were immobilised from a helicopter by darting with a total dose of 3 mg carfentanil and 150 mg xylazine. An initial excitement phase was displayed, commencing on average at 2.67 min (S.D. 0.72) after darting, and the average time to recumbency was 4.97 min (S.D. 1.05). The average heart and respiration rates prior to reversal were 121.2 (S.D. 19.96) and 13.7 (S.D. 5.96) min-1 respectively. Reversal was achieved by the intravenous injection of yohimbine at approximately 0.125 mg kg-1 and 300 mg of naltrexone, and was uneventful. Further investigations need to be done to establish the most appropriate dosage rates for these preparations in ostriches.","1155":"Three cases of horses with nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism (NSH) are described. The horses showed typical thickening of the maxillae and mandibular bones with or without lameness. Laboratory findings included elevated concentrations of parathyroid hormone (carboxy-terminal and mid-molecule fractions), alkaline phosphatase and an increase in the fractional excretion rate of serum inorganic phosphorus.","1156":"A cat with primary intratracheal squamous cell carcinoma presented with severe dyspnoea and a dry cough. Radiographic changes included pulmonary hyperinflation and tracheal thickening at the thoracic inlet. On post mortem examination, proliferative, white, granular nodules in the trachea were confirmed to be an anaplastic squamous cell carcinoma.","1157":"An outbreak of granular vulvitis and ulcerative posthitis in 24-month-old virgin Bonsmara heifers and bulls is reported. Ureaplasma was isolated locally from all the clinically infected cattle. There was marked clinical improvement within 3 d of the commencement of a 5 d course of tylosin administered intramuscularly at 10 mg kg-1. Ureaplasma could not be cultured from the external genitalia of either heifers or bulls following clinical recovery. Details of the Ureaplasma culture media are given.","1158":"Cattle were treated for tick infestation using 1% flumethrin pour-on applied through a self-medicating device known as the Duncan Applicator, in 4 situations in Zimbabwe. Moderate to heavy tick infestations were successfully controlled on cattle.","1159":"A university-based hospital serving mainly a developing community readily appreciated that its clientele was from a very different sociological and cultural background than that of the professional staff and that developed and developing communities and their pets exhibit different patterns in their health status, with most diseases being predominantly related to socio-economic predicament. The need for a community-orientated service was recognised. From 1987 to 1988, the small animal outpatient clinic was used for an informal, unstructured sociological observation and interview-based study of the clientele and their pets. During this period, an informal educational programme was implemented to teach basic pet health care, and the efficacy of this programme was empirically gauged by comparing the knowledge and attitudes of first-time clients with those of regular clients. Regular clients appeared to become increasingly concerned about the health and management of their pets and the condition of their animals appeared to improve, with a corresponding decline in the degree of parasitism. The majority of clients however, still regarded the main reason for keeping dogs as the provision of some form of security. It also appeared as if improved attitudes towards household pets paralleled improvements in socio-economic status.","1160":"This study investigates the functional anatomy of the flipper of the jackass penguin (Speniscus demersus). The flippers of birds (n = 15) were dissected and described. Several adaptations from the typical avian wing were noted and reasons were proposed for these. The conclusion is that the osteological and myological adaptations of the flipper are designed to enable the penguin to progress very effectively through water, while the vascular adaptations provide a highly efficient mechanism for thermoregulation.","1161":"In a series of in virtro experiments (n = 64) using the mature flowers or seeds and pappus hairs of Karoo bushes Chrysocoma ciliata, Dimorphotheca cuneata, Eriocephalus ericoides, Gazania krebsiana and Gnidia polycephala, small phytobezoars were formed from material of E. ericoides, G. krebsiana and G. polycephala either alone or in combinations. The ratio of fibre to liquid used was found to be optimal around 1: 7 and milling of material enhanced bezoar formation. Time and pH did not appear to significantly affect the formation of bezoars. Other factors were either standardised or not studied. In a small in vivo trial, 4 groups of one sheep and one goat each were fed 10% of either C. ciliata, E. ericoides, G. polycephala seeds and pappus hairs, or a mixture of all 3, added to a basal diet of milled lucerne fed for up to 31 d. Small phytobezoars were formed in the goats but not the sheep receiving C. ciliata, and G. polycephala material. It was concluded that phytobezoars could form in goats or sheep eating large quantities of mature flowers or seeds of several Karoo bushes.","1162":"The diameters of fibres from phytobezoars varied between 2 and 30 microns, with an average 58% measuring less than &lt; 15 microns, 36% between 15 and 23 microns, and 6% greater than 23 microns. These diameters were very similar to those of the pappus hairs surrounding the seeds of the Karoo bushes Chrysocoma ciliata, Eriocephalus ericoides and Gnidia polycephala (means of 6.06 microns, 16.67 microns and 22.73 microns respectively). The microscopic structure and ultrastructure of these pappus hairs moreover closely resembled the fibres of bezoars but were quite distinct from that of hair or wool. Of particular interest was the presence of annular thickenings as well as terminal hooks on both bezoar fibres and pappus hairs, both of which structures are believed to be involved in the formation of bezoars. This close similarity between the fibres in bezoars and those of pappus hairs in the 3 plant species studied, leads to the conclusion that the bezoars consisted largely of pappus hairs of these and possibly other species. The chemical composition of bezoars found in goats and sheep, resembled that of pappus hairs and stems of the Karoo bushes Eriocephalus ericoides and Gnidia polycephala more closely than that of mohair. Ash, nitrogen, phosphorus and zinc concentrations in both bezoars and plant material were similar, but very different to that of mohair; however, the calcium, magnesium, potassium and manganese levels of bezoars were more similar to mohair than plant matter. This may have been due to a leaching effect.","1163":"","1164":"","1165":"","1166":"","1167":"","1168":"","1169":"","1170":"","1171":"A case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in a sheep from the Eastern Transvaal is described. The pinna of one ear was swollen and the overlying skin thickened and diffusely encrusted. Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy revealed a diffuse dermal infiltration of macrophages, plasma cells and lesser numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils, as well as a few multinucleated giant cells. Macrophages, particularly in the superficial dermis, contained large numbers of small basophilic bodies morphologically compatible with the amastigote stage of Leishmania spp. Changes in the overlying epidermis included orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with a focal erosion and crust formation. No attempts were made to culture the organism.","1172":"A case of diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in a 7-week-old puppy is reported. The puppy presented with a recurrent abdominal effusion. An exploratory laparotomy revealed extensive adhesions. Necropsy findings included pleural thickening, and enlargement of the renal and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes. The microscopic features were typical of primary desmoplastic diffuse mesothelioma of the peritoneum and pleura with secondary lymph node metastasis (renal and anterior mediastinal). The tumour was classified as epithelial in type. The extent of the tumour and the distant metastasis were considered to reflect a high degree of malignancy. A congenital origin was suspected.","1173":"Ponies (n = 8) approximately 18 months old, were infected with 20,000 to 30,000 infective larvae of Strongylus equinus with less than 10% contamination with Strongylus edentatus larvae and necropsied 7 months post-infection. Lesions were present in the omentum, liver, pancreas, ventral colon, caecum and occasionally in the lungs. There were numerous intraabdominal adhesions and severe multiple granulomatous omentitis. Pancreatic damage, which characterises S. equinus, was exceptionally mild and was manifested mainly by slight periductular infiltration of eosinophils. Granulomas associated with larvae were found in the connective tissue associated with the pancreas. Larvae were recovered from the flanks, the peritoneum, the caecum and the kidney. Larval recovery was low, with a high percentage of the total number of larvae recovered in some of the carcasses being S. edentatus.","1174":"The anaesthetic effects of Zoletil, a 1:1 combination of tiletamine and zolazepam, was evaluated in 10 sheep. The optimum dose of this preparation was found to be 12 mg kg-1. It produced rapid induction, cataleptoid anaesthesia and smooth recovery with a minimal effect on blood pressure. Individual sheep, however, displayed variable reactions to the anaesthetic. Atropine premedication at 0.04 mg kg-1 did not have any significant effect on either heart rate or blood pressure when compared to Zoletil alone.","1175":"Albendazole intra-ruminal slow-release capsules (SRC) administered to sheep grazing on irrigated pastures in the southern Cape Province, controlled Trichostrongylus for 91 d and Haemonchus and Teladorsagia for 61 d. Treating sheep with the SRC at 47 to 61 d intervals over a period of 10 months, significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the infective potential of the pasture. Compared with sheep which received 2 disophenol and 3 broad spectrum anthelmintic treatments during the same period, the SRC reduced the infective potential of the pasture by 71.6%, while weekly drenching with albendazole over the same period, resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) increase (73.4%) in the infective potential of the pasture.","1176":"Acute deaths occurred in 47 out of a total of 131 imported psittacine birds whilst in quarantine. Few and non-specific clinical signs were seen during the course of the disease outbreak, but gross pathology revealed severe hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. A herpes virus was isolated from liver and spleen material taken from 2 birds, an Amazon (Amazona aestiva aestiva) and a Yellow-collared macaw (Ara auricollis). Identification procedures included virus neutralisation tests carried out in chicken embryo fibroblast cultures. Neutralisation of the virus was obtained by antisera to Psittacid herpesvirus type 1 (HV1) but not against HV2 or HV3.","1177":"Eland (Taurotragus oryx) and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Game Ranching Research Station at the Mushandike Sanctuary in Zimbabwe were treated with 1% flumethrin pour-on to control unacceptably high tick numbers. The pour-on was at first applied with a drenching gun and later by means of a Duncan Applicator. This device allows contact with a saturated treatment column while the animals consume a specially formulated attractant lick from the feed bin. Tick counts done over 3 summer seasons demonstrated the efficacy both of the pour-on acaricide and the method of application.","1178":"A natural, fatal case of cytauxzoonosis in a tsessebe is reported. The macroscopic and histologic pathology are described, the most significant lesion of which was severe, focal disseminate necrosis and haemorrhage in the liver. Similar but less severe lesions were present in the heart, skeletal muscles, kidneys and spleen in conjunction with a moderate interstitial pneumonia. Schizonts were found within mononuclear phagocytes and multi-nucleated syncytial cells in the liver, lungs, spleen and kidneys. Parasitised erythrocytes with up to 4 piroplasms per cell were seen. The ultrastructural features of the parasite are consistent with those of Cytauxzoon spp.","1179":"A four-month-old German Shepherd Dog was presented with an atrial septal defect. An estimated pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in the range of 2,5 to 2,9:1 was determined by means of Doppler echocardiography. This technique allows for the non-invasive determination of the Qp:Qs ratio by calculating aortic versus pulmonary artery cardiac output or by determining mean trans-atrial septal velocities. In addition, the flow patterns across the valves are characterised and the direction of the shunt determined. Atrial septal defect is reviewed with special reference to the value of Doppler echocardiography.","1180":"Normovolaemic hypernatraemia as a result of a suspected congenital primary hypodipsia was diagnosed in a young male Miniature Schnauzer. Despite an elevated serum sodium concentration, the dog did not appear dehydrated on physical examination and the urine osmolality: plasma osmolality ratio was greater than 4; antidiuretic hormone deficiency was therefore not suspected. Basal serum cortisol and thyroxine concentrations were normal. Plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity (37 pmol l-1 and 1.55 ng dl-1 h-1 respectively) were within normal range. A defective central thirst regulation mechanism was suspected as the dog was totally disinterested in drinking water despite the chronically elevated serum sodium concentration. Excessive ingestion of water mixed with food, and milk resulted in hyponatraemia and associated cerebral oedema. On stabilisation of the dog's condition, a calculated fluid intake based on daily maintenance fluid requirements was prescribed to prevent recurrence of hypernatraemia and hyponatraemia, and associated signs of central nervous system disease. The dog was in apparent good health with controlled fluid intake when examined 230 d later.","1181":"Clinical examination of a 75-day-old captive juvenile wild dog suffering from lassitude revealed pale mucous membranes, icterus, laboured respiration, a \"water-hammer\" pulse and splenomegaly. A peripheral blood smear containing numerous Babesia-infected erythrocytes confirmed the diagnosis of babesiosis. Treatment was unsuccessful and the animal died shortly after receiving a blood transfusion. The findings at necropsy were typical for acute babesiosis and included anaemia, icterus, splenomegaly and haemoglobinuria. In addition, marked atrophy of the thymus and lymph nodes was evident. Microscopic and electron microscopic examination of selected tissues disclosed high parasitaemia with vascular stasis and injury to both endothelial and parenchymal components. It is speculated that vaccination-induced immune incompetence predisposed to development of clinical babesiosis.","1182":"Anomalous blood vessels at the base of the heart in a 6-month-old German Shepherd Dog are described. On the right side, the thoracic vertebral artery was absent and the dorsal intercostal arteries to the first 2 ribs arose directly from the deep cervical artery. The right bronchoesophageal artery was exceptionally large and arose from the right costocervical trunk. An anastomosis was present between the fifth dorsal intercostal artery and the left bronchoesophageal artery. On the left side the left bronchoesophageal artery arose from the left pulmonary artery close to the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk. Anastomoses were present between the third dorsal intercostal artery and the paraconal interventricular branch of the left coronary artery and between the third dorsal intercostal artery and the left bronchoesophageal artery. Radiographically the anastomoses between the dorsal intercostal artery and the left pulmonary artery via the left bronchoesophageal artery could be confused with a patent ductus arteriosus.","1183":"A dog suspected of having ingested minute quantities of plastic explosive type 4 (PE4 containing cyclonite) was presented with congested mucous membranes, a fever, an increased pulse rate, hyperventilation, hypersensitivity and mild convulsions. Experimental poisoning of a dog confirmed the neurotoxic properties of PE4 and proved to be fatal at 14 mg kg-1 within 18 h after ingestion. The clinical signs and post mortem findings closely resembled strychnine poisoning in dogs.","1184":"A commercial dog breeding unit experienced problems with acute diarrhoea, often haemorrhagic, in young German Shepherd Dog litters. No aetiologic diagnosis had been made. In order to determine whether coccidial infections were implicated, a survey was conducted to ascertain shedding of oocysts by dams, acquisition of coccidial infection by neonatal pups and to determine whether bouts of diarrhoea were associated with peak oocyst production. Oocysts of Isospora canis and I. burrowsi\/I. ohioenis were recovered from 26.0% of faecal specimens from bitches and from 51.7% of similar specimens from litters. No association between shedding of oocysts by bitches and their litters could be demonstrated, nor was there consistent association between bouts of diarrhoea and peaks of oocyst shedding.","1185":"A progesterone\/estradiol ear implant was tested over a 84 d feedlot period on 96 young Bonsmara steers which were randomly allocated to implant and control groups. Animals were adapted over 5 d to a complete feed formulated to South African feedlot standards. Health aberrations were observed and feed intake, mass gain and slaughter data were recorded. The implant group elicited a 23.2 kg gain per animal (P less than 0.01). Mean treatment feed intakes varied marginally but the implant group showed a 14.91% feed to gain improvement over controls. Warm carcass dressing percentage showed an overall improvement of 4.96% for both groups. Bloat incidence was calculated at 0.98% over 8,064 cattle feedlot days. Mortality was 2.08% and 12 animals were considered to be chronic bloaters. This may have been due to the high proportion of fine particles in the diet. A composite feed sample revealed that 62.48% consisted of particle lengths of 0.5-4mm. The effect of this on ruminal health is briefly discussed. It is concluded that the progesterone\/estradiol implant provided greater mass gain and improved feed to gain ratios for treated steers over a control group.","1186":"The health status of canine populations within developed and those within developing communities was studied in a retrospective survey and compared. There were significant differences in the prevalence of disease amongst the hospitalised dogs from the 2 communities. Dogs from developing communities were mainly young cross-bred dogs which suffered from infectious diseases (44%), trauma (22%) and parasitic diseases (11%). There was a high mortality rate (30%) and 82% of these patients suffered from diseases that could have been prevented. The dogs from developed communities were mainly adult or old pure-bred dogs that suffered mainly from organ diseases (57%). There was a low mortality rate (10%) while only 31% suffered from diseases that could have been prevented. Based on the epidemiological findings, it was evident that owners of dogs in the developing communities required education in primary and secondary prevention of disease.","1187":"Halofuginone was administered to both sexes of 2 broiler strains, Ross and Hubbard, in 4 dietary treatments, 0, 1.5, 3 and 6mg kg-1. Controls received dietary monensin at 100 mg kg-1. Group feed intake and body mass were recorded weekly. Skin tensile strength was monitored on Days 28, 35, 42 and 49 using a standardised cut of breast skin from carcasses randomly drawn from each treatment, strain and sex combination. Halofuginone inclusion level was inversely correlated (r = -0.36) with skin tensile strength and affected both sexes of the 2 strains (P less than 0.01). Between sexes, the skins of cockerels were consistently stronger than those of hens (P less than 0.01). The effect of age (P less than 0.07) and that of strain (P less than 0.06) tended towards significance at the 5% level. The singular effect of halofuginone on skin tensile strength was masked by the interactions treatment and sex (P less than 0.01); treatment and age (P less than 0.02); treatment and strain (P less than 0.06); age and strain (P less than 0.01). An inclusion level of 6mg kg-1, double the recommended level, could reduce growth and skin tensile strength significantly.","1188":"The effect of continuous administration, weekly 24 h administration, phased withdrawal and phased inclusion of dietary halofuginone at 3 mg kg-1 on skin tensile strength was tested in Ross I broiler pullets. Controls received monensin continuously at 100 mg kg-1. A total of 2,592 birds were used in 2 lots of 1,296 in 2 separate programmes. Continuous dietary administration of halofuginone affected skin tensile strength negatively (P less than 0.05), with an equally significant recovery following a 7 d withdrawal period. A polynomial regression analysis indicates that skin strength may undergo a slight compensatory overstrengthening reaction within 7 d of withdrawal of halofuginone. Weekly 24 h administration of halofuginone reduced differences in skin strength between treatment and controls to non-significant levels. Differences in skin strengths between controls and the halofuginone phased inclusion programme decreased as the birds aged, being significant (P less than 0.05) on Days 14 and 28 and non-significant on Days 21, 35, 42 and 49. A weakening of skin tensile strength of broiler carcasses, as far as it may be influenced by halofuginone, can be alleviated through different shuttle programmes involving halofuginone. Such programmes would include intermittent dosing, a withdrawal period, administration to older birds or a combination of these programmes.","1189":"Gene frequencies at 10 blood polymorphic loci have been used to compare Karakuls from Uzbekistan, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with South African Karakuls and to evaluate the influence of local Blackhead Persian sheep on the genetic composition of South African Karakuls. The data clearly show that genetic difference between the 2 populations of Karakuls is significant. The proportion of Blackhead Persian genes in South African Karakuls is estimated to be 0.2745, to which a certain degree of gene flow from other fat-tailed sheep has possibly to be added.","1190":"The CO2-laser is currently used as a scalpel by a large number of medical surgeons, but in the field of veterinary surgery, relatively little has been published on the subject. A review of the origin of medical lasers, the basic physics of laser energy production and the characteristics of laser light was therefore considered necessary. This review includes a discussion on how the optical radiation generated by the different lasers is absorbed, the cutting power of the CO2-laser, and the effect on healing, tensile strength and haemostasis when used in the skin, linea alba and gastrointestinal tract.","1191":"Three dogs which ingested part of the stem of a Japanese cycad (Cycas revoluta) vomited repeatedly within hours after ingestion, showed marked depression, severely congested mucous membranes, increased thirst and profuse salivation. Subsequent hematological and blood chemical investigation revealed elevated serum concentrations of alanine transaminase, an initial mild lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and a leucocytosis. The dogs recovered uneventfully.","1192":"A herd of 15 Cameroon goats was suspected of having been poisoned by eating leaves of the Fuerte variety of avocado pear (Persea americana). Two of the affected goats were examined clinically, while necropsies were carried out on 3 of the 4 that had died. The most significant clinical findings were tachycardia, hyperpnoea and evidence of lung oedema. At necropsy severe lung oedema, hydrothorax and hydropericardium were present. Severe myocardial degeneration, necrosis and fibrosis were the major histopathological findings.","1193":"A practical method of diagnosing Stilesia hepatica in live sheep is described. Intestinal contents and faeces were sieved through a sieve with apertures of 1.0 mm onto a sieve with apertures of 100 microns to reduce volume and turbidity. The residue on the fine sieve was examined microscopically. Gravid proglottids passed through the intestine without being digested. Intact proglottids were recovered from the intestine and faeces of infected sheep. Used purely on faeces, the technique is simple and reliable as a diagnostic method. Its application could facilitate basic research into the biology and epidemiology of the parasite.","1194":"The anthelmintic efficacy of albendazole intra-ruminal slow-release capsules (SRC) and albendazole drench against field strains of 5 genera of nematode parasites of sheep, where compared. The SRC reduced the number of L4 and adult Nematodirus by 64.1% and 58.3% and the albendazole drench by 98.1% and 99.1%, respectively. Neither formulation was more than 89.5% effective against either the L4 or adult stage of Teladorsagia. The efficacy of both formulations against the adult stages of Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus and Oesophagostomum ranged from 95.9 to 99.9%.","1195":"Two surveys conducted in pre-schools (n = 156) located in advantaged areas and disadvantaged areas in Pretoria, indicated that animals had social and psychological as well as educational value for pre-school children. All schools (n = 156) utilised animals in some way for the education of pre-school children. Nineteen of the pre-schools in advantaged areas kept animals permanently at the school. All of these schools utilised the zoo. Only 3 of the schools in disadvantaged areas (n = 106) were able to keep animals permanently on the premises although 69 would have liked to keep animals and 77 of the schools visited the zoo at least once a year. Limiting factors included lack of finances and facilities, lack of knowledge on animal management and anxiety about zoonoses. No cases of zoonotic disease in children were recorded. The species of animals utilised at the pre-schools differed from those found most commonly as household pets. Pre-schools favoured rodents, fish and birds rather than carnivores. The role of the veterinarian may include clinical treatment of the animals from the pre-school, advice on management and zoonosis prevention, pet-care counselling, communication with children and their parents in the consulting room, public health aspects and promotion of environmental education.","1196":"A veld ram performance testing unit consists of an association of stud or commercial ram breeders, who compare the performance of selected rams under field conditions on common pastures. The best performers are subsequently auctioned at public sales. To date, at least 10 Merino veld ram clubs have been established in various centres in South Africa. A strain of Haemonchus contortus, which was isolated from the pastures of one of these performance testing units, was found to be resistant to ivermectin, oxfendazole and rafoxanide. Closantel, levamisole and disophenol were more than 99% effective. The wide dispersal of the rams after testing, constitutes a potential danger for dissemination of helminths with resistant genes. Precautionary methods should include careful routine monitoring of drug susceptibility on the communal pastures, on the farms of individual members and thorough deworming of rams before they leave the testing unit. The prevention and control of resistance in such testing units are discussed, but it is emphasised that this is difficult, particularly if the worm strains on the communal grazing have become resistant to some of the anthelmintic groups.","1197":"A sample of informal consultations based on letters which were sent to a radio programme in which the theme was informal veterinary consultations were analysed. The animal-owner profile, the identification of animals involved and the need which motivated owners to seek such consultations were investigated. The results indicated that the most typical animal owner to participate in programmes of this nature was an adult woman living in the country and the most common animal involved was an intact male dog. The most common area of concern was ethological of nature. Behavioural problems were the most common ethological problem, followed by management and care. The significance of this study for the veterinarian is probably that it recognises the role and importance of informal consultations, that deficiencies in formal consultations are indicated and that it emphasises the need of readily available knowledge of ethology, that informal consultations are unsuitable for serious cases, and that informal consultations give further insight into human-animal interaction from a veterinary perspective.","1198":"Mitral valve E point to septal separation (EPSS) was measured (mean = 3.27 +\/- 1.29 mm) in healthy non-anaesthetised Beagle and German Shepherd dogs (n = 50). The minimum and maximum values recorded were 1 and 6mm respectively. Breed, age, sex, mass and heart-rate had no significant effect on the EPSS value.","1199":"The health status of a population of dogs (n = 220) from a rural southern African town is described. A cross sectional survey was done to collect the necessary information. All animals examined were mongrels with a mean condition score of 1.93. The oldest dog found in the population was 8 years old. Rhipicephalus sanguineus was the dominant tick species encountered on the dogs, Echidnophaga gallinacea the dominant flea species, while Cordylobia anthropophaga and Demodex canis also affected the health status of the population. Fourty five per cent of the population were found to have nematode eggs in the faeces. On clinical examination, 5% of the population were judged to be acutely ill and 27% to be chronically ill. Based on the clinical examination, bloodsmears and laboratory results, 51% of the population had one or more serious clinical conditions at the time of examination. The conditions with the highest point prevalence rate in the community were canine ehrlichiosis (17.2%), transmissible veneral tumour (6.8%), canine distemper (5%), Cordylobia infestation (5.5%), trauma (4.1%), and severe malnutrition (4.1%). It was concluded that a significant section of this population was in a chronic state of starvation and malnutrition. There was also a heavy infestation of internal and external parasites and the prevalence of serious diseases in this population was high.","1200":"","1201":"Carboxyhaemoglobin fractions were found to be significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in dogs (n = 5) with severe babesiosis than in control subjects (n = 5). The enzymatic conversion of haem to biliverdin by haem oxygenase is the only known source of endogenous carbon monoxide. We propose that the increased production of endogenous carbon monoxide following the haemolysis associated with babesiosis, results in the carboxyhaemoglobinaemia observed in this study. The superimposition of carboxyhaemoglobinaemia on severe anaemia results in further compromise of the oxygen status of dogs with severe babesiosis, and probably plays a role in the pathogenesis of the hypoxic tissue damage associated with this condition.","1202":"Two trials were conducted to determine the effect of monensin in broiler litter on sheep receiving the broiler litter in their diets. Broiler litter from chickens fed monensin as a coccidiostat, and from chickens receiving no coccidiostat, was included at a level of 30% in 2 sheep diets. In a further 2 treatments, monensin (15 mg kg-1) was added to each of the 2 diets to give a 2x2 factorial experimental design. In the first trial, copper (20 mg kg-1 feed) was added to the diets. These lambs were fed individually at a slightly restricted level of intake. No differences between treatments were observed in feed intake, average daily gain or efficiency of feed utilisation or in the concentrations of zinc, iron and manganese in the liver, glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes and creatine kinase concentrations in the plasma. Hepatic copper content and copper retention in the livers of the sheep receiving the added monensin were significantly higher (P less than 0.05 and less than 0.01 respectively) than in those not receiving added monensin. The aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations in the plasma of these sheep were also higher (P less than 0.05) than in those not consuming added monensin. In the second trial, the lambs were group-fed according to treatment and received the diets on an ad lib basis. The mean intakes of the groups receiving the diets with the added monensin, were lower than the intakes by the other groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1203":"The literature is reviewed regarding existing specifications and requirements for laboratory animal bedding. The lack of comprehensive specifications in the guidelines of laboratory animal governing bodies, and the introduction of external variables by unsuitable bedding into experimental design, are discussed on the basis of examples from the literature.","1204":"Two cases of lithium toxicity are reported on in dogs having had lithium hypochlorite chlorinated water as their sole source of drinking water. Clinical signs in one dog included polyuria, polydipsia, loss of body mass; dehydration, diarrhoea and general weakness and in the other case, polyuria, polydipsia, loss of body mass and seizures. Withdrawal of the water resulted in complete recovery.","1205":"Erythema multiforme is reported for the first time in 2 South African horses. Both horses displayed a sudden, fulminant outbreak of raised, non-alopecic and non-pruritic plaques over the dorsolateral aspects of the neck and trunk. In both cases the distribution of the lesions was bilaterally symmetrical. Histopathological findings included hydropic degeneration of basal epidermal cells, eosinophilic necrosis of individual or groups of keratinocytes, intra-epidermal and sub-epidermal cleft formation and mixed, dermal, perivascular infiltrates. An initiating cause could not be identified in either case. Both horses underwent gradual spontaneous remission within 3 months.","1206":"A stud Clydesdale foal was still-born near full term. Macroscopic examination revealed a normal placenta, pulmonary atelectasis and faint white mottling of the kidneys. Microscopically there was severe lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis. Numerous organisms resembling Encephalitozoon cuniculi were present in the affected kidneys. The organisms occurred in the areas of inflammation as well as in the renal glomeruli and intracellular cysts in the renal tubular epithelial cells and exhibited Gram positive staining. Ultrastructurally the organisms possessed a polar vacuole and a spiral filament typical of Microsporidia. The organisms were not detected in sections of the other organs examined.","1207":"The time which elapses before cessation of breathing, and blood pressure and blood gas changes after the intramuscular administration of suxamethonium, or a mixture of suxamethonium and hexamethonium, is compared in immobilised African elephants (Loxodonta africana) and buffaloes (Syncerus caffer). In addition, the respiratory responses of elephants and other animals to intravenous administration of suxamethonium and succinylmonocholine are reported on, as are the effects of darting animals with succinylmonocholine. The results show that respiration is affected in a similar fashion in all species investigated. However, the characteristic gradual decrease in respiratory rate seen in elephants during culling, using suxamethonium, resembles the effects observed when succinylmonocholine is administered. It is suggested that elephants are killed by this first breakdown product of suxamethonium during culling and\/or that unique acetylcholine receptors may be involved.","1208":"The effect of premedication on the induction dose of propofol was determined in 15 cats and 25 dogs undergoing elective surgical procedures. The induction dose of propofol in dogs younger than 8 years old was 6.9 +\/- 0.9 mg kg-1 (n = 4) without premedication and 4.3 +\/- 1.4 mg kg-1 (n = 12) with premedication with acetylpromazine maleate. The induction dose in cats younger than 3 years old was 7.8 +\/- 1.1 mg kg-1 (n = 8) with atropine alone and 7.1 +\/- 0.9 mg kg-1 (n = 7) with the inclusion of acetylpromazine maleate. The reduction in the induction dose of propofol was statistically significant in dogs, but not in cats. When atropine was used together with a fentanyl-droperidol combination or pethidine and acetylpromazine maleate in dogs, the mean induction dose of propofol was reduced to 2.1 +\/- 0.1 mg kg-1 (n = 4) and 2.4 +\/- 0.3 mg kg-1 (n = 5), respectively. Propofol was also evaluated as an induction agent in patients undergoing non-elective surgical procedures.","1209":"Two ultrasonic pest controllers, a pet-collar unit and a large unit for household use, were tested for their efficacy in repelling fleas and ticks in a choice chamber. Neither unit had any affect on the distribution of fleas or ticks in the choice chamber up to 24 h exposure, and activity of fleas, ticks and cockroaches was unimpaired. The study extends and supports previous findings that ultrasound is ineffective as a means of controlling common pests of households and pets.","1210":"Joints obtained from 192 pig carcases were examined by means of standard microbiological and macro- and histopathological procedures. Approximately 32% of the joints were considered normal; 35.5% showed lesions consistent with osteochondrosis and a non-specific synovitis was present in 24.4%. Only 6.1% of joints were arthritic and yielded either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus spp. The remainder (2.3%) had periarticular lesions such as abscesses. The study emphasises that an accurate diagnosis and correct evaluation of pig carcases showing joint lesions, is absolutely essential if a high standard of meat inspection is to be obtained and unnecessary economic losses are to be avoided.","1211":"Adult ixodid ticks were collected at 2-weekly intervals for a period of 23 consecutive months from 15 to 20 Angora goats on a farm in the south western Orange Free State. A total of 6 ixodid tick species were recovered. Rhipicephalus punctatus was the most abundant and prevalent tick. It was present from spring to late summer. Ixodes rubicundus was the next most abundant tick and was present mainly from March or April to July with peak numbers present in April or May. The onset of this tick's activity appeared to be stimulated by low atmospheric temperatures.","1212":"Nematode parasite burdens of ewes grazing on grass\/lucerne pasture, increased 58-fold after the first autumn rains in the southern Cape Province. Lambs were infected before the age of 8 weeks and harboured large burdens of nematode parasites before the age of 14 weeks. Oestrus ovis infections were present in 96% of the ewes, while 92% of the lambs above the age of 3 weeks were infected. Anthelmintic treatments in autumn, winter and spring are recommended for controlling parasites of sheep in this region.","1213":"Ostrich chicks (n = 34) were successfully immobilised with intramuscular injections of a tiletamine\/zolazepam mixture at dosages of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg kg-1; with metomidate at dosages of 15 and 20 mg kg-1 and with a metomidate\/azaperone combination at respectively 20 and 6.6 mg kg-1, and 10 and 3.3 mg kg-1. Unsatisfactory immobilisation with violent body movements and self traumatisation were observed in an adult ostrich after the intramuscular administration of a tiletamine\/zolezepam mixture. Anaesthesia was achieved by the administration of metomidate in combination with azaperone. Medetomidine administered at a dosage rate of 0.1 mg kg-1 did not result in immobilisation of ostrich chicks (n = 4). Findings in ostrich chicks should not necessarily be extrapolated to adult birds.","1214":"Light grey macules developed on the skin and in the mouths of juvenile caimans, (Caiman crocodilus fuscus) (n = 8), kept in the quarantine section of the reptile park at the National Zoological Gardens, Pretoria, Republic of South Africa. The gross, histopathological and ultrastructural features of the lesions were commensurate with pox virus infection. This outbreak closely resembled the disease described elsewhere in 3 juvenile captive caimans.","1215":"Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) (n = 40) were tested by means of an immunofluorescent test (IFT) for the presence of antibodies to the feline coronavirus group. All cheetahs tested negatively and this was further confirmed by virus serum neutralisation.","1216":"Methods of investigating perinatal loss in grazing sheep flocks are reviewed and evaluated. The \"wet-dry\" method is the simplest method for assessing minimal prevalence, whereas the differences between the numbers of single and twin foetuses present at ultrasonic determination of litter size during pregnancy, and the numbers of single and twin lambs present at lamb-marking, is the most precise. The veterinary investigation of field mortality involves full autopsy of a representative sample of dead lambs, a history of prenatal nutrition, disease and husbandry, as well as a qualitative estimate of weather conditions over the period of lamb collection. Pathological processes may be identified in over 95% of deaths and the specific cause determined in about 75% of deaths. The identification of the specific causes in the remainder of deaths, all classified as the starvation-mismothering-exposure (SME) complex, requires intensive, costly, on-site observation, and physiological and biochemical assessment. The probable causes of these deaths include prenatal physiological handicaps resulting from placental insufficiency, aberrant parent-offspring behaviour, management-induced mismothering, misadventure, inadequate milk supply or teat and udder abnormalities, and cold-induced starvation. The gross pathology and pathophysiology of birth stress and the SME complex, which are associated with at least 80% of mortality, are summarised. Birth injury to the foetal central nervous system, characterised by cranial and spinal meningeal haemorrhage is exclusive to parturient deaths and the SME complex. Observed flock prevalences range from 81% to 100% in parturient deaths, and 20% to 57% in the SME complex. The high total prevalence and experimental evidence, indicate the major causal role of birth stress in the pathogenesis of these entities. Lethal congenital malformations, infections (both congenital and acquired after birth), trace element deficiencies and predation are reviewed as minor causes. The new understanding of the pathogenesis of perinatal lamb mortality, recognises the heritable nature of birth mass, maternal pelvic dimensions, parent-offspring behaviour, and the resistance of neonates to cold. Control measures need to incorporate selection for maternal rearing ability, further refinement of prenatal nutritional management of twin-bearing ewes, disease control, provision of shelter for lambing flocks, and avoidance of husbandry practices which frustrate innate parent-offspring behaviour. A selection programme is summarised.","1217":"Annually recurrent illthrift and mortalities in a small flock of pastured sheep at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory, Stellenbosch were cured by the supplementation of cobalt. The similarities between acute cobalt deficiency and ovine white liver disease are discussed.","1218":"Chylothorax with collapse of the lungs was found on postmortem examination of a 2-week-old Siamese kitten. The chylothorax was probably due to a lack of continuity of the thoracic duct.","1219":"An adult stallion presented with a severe papular dermatitis of especially the neck, chest and genitalia. A marked scrotal oedema was present. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies, revealed the presence of numerous intracytoplasmic molluscum bodies in areas of focal epidermal hyperplasia. Electron microscopical examination showed the presence of typical pox virions in affected epidermal cells. Attempts at viral isolation were unsuccessful. This is believed to be the first reported case of molluscum contagiosum in a horse in the Republic of South Africa.","1220":"Suspected molluscum contagiosum was diagnosed in 3 horses in the Chingola district of Zambia. The horses were found to be suffering from a slow progressive skin disease with lesions on the chest, shoulders, inner and lateral aspects of the fore- and hindlimbs, the face, fetlocks, pasterns and on the lateral surfaces of the body. The lesions varied from 4 to 20mm in diameter, were hairless but covered by soft keratin projections which, when removed, left a raw elevated base tightly adherent to the epidermis. These lesions bled profusely when the animals were groomed. Older lesions were well circumscribed, raised above the surface, devoid of hair and after removal of grey-white keratin flakes, had a depigmented waxy appearance. Microscopically cytoplasmic inclusions containing many pox virions were found. Attempts at culturing the virus were unsuccessful.","1221":"A seven-year-old male Border Collie was presented with a history of lethargy, episodic circling, incoordination and polydypsia. Physical examination revealed depression, obesity and bradycardia. A neurological examination indicated the possible presence of a space-occupying lesion in the brain. Results of the clinical investigation revealed hyposthenuria, sinus bradycardia and increased concentration of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. A computerised axial tomography scan revealed a mass in the region of the hypophysis. The dog was euthanased and a post mortem examination confirmed the presence of a craniopharyngioma.","1222":"The clinical signs and radiological findings of a rare laminitis-like condition in Jersey calves (n = 6) are described. Regular hoof-trimming proved very beneficial. Pedigree studies of the affected calves strongly suggest a recessive autosomal inheritance.","1223":"Dimetridazole was given intraruminally alone, and in conjunction with oxytetracycline to healthy, 10-11 month-old Hereford cross-bred steers (n = 6). Intraruminal treatment with dimetridazole was given through a fistula at 75 mg kg-1 daily for 5 d, while the oxytetracycline was injected intramuscularly at 10 mg kg-1 on Days 1 and 3 of the dimetridazole treatment. The animals were observed at various intervals throughout the trial period for adverse reactions, including effects on ruminal activity and motility, changes in live-mass, venous acid-base balance, haematology and ruminal and serum ammonia concentrations. Dimetridazole, either when used alone or in conjunction with oxytetracycline, had a marked effect on ruminal function. Within 6 h of dosing, the ruminal pH fell to below 5, but then returned to pretreatment values over the next 24-48 h. This was followed by the eradication of the ruminal protozoal population in all animals tested and an increase in the methylene blue reduction time to more than 6 min. Ruminal motility remained unaffected throughout this period. During the week of treatment, the mean live-mass of the animals dropped by 20 +\/- 9.9 kg in the dimetridazole treated group and by 13.3 +\/- 2.8 kg in the animals treated with both dimetridazole and oxytetracycline. A mild to severe watery diarrhoea, which continued for 1 to 2 d, occurred in 4 animals after the first dimetridazole treatment. A compensated metabolic acidosis and an increase in haematocrit were observed. An initial transient rapid rise in rumen ammonia concentrations did not result in a concurrent rise in serum ammonia concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1224":"The macroscopic, microscopic and clinical pathology and the serology of 2 clinically normal Staffordshire Bull Terrier bitches, both of whom produced pups with confirmed encephalitozoonosis, is described. Mild histopathological changes, similar to those seen in the infected pups, were observed. The spores of Encephalitozoon cuniculi were seen in the renal tubules of the kidney of one of the bitches. The serum urea concentrations of one of the bitches was elevated. A positive titre against E. cuniculi was obtained in both of the bitches. A 10-year-old girl who had had close contact with one of the infected litters of pups, seroconverted to E. cuniculi. Her two siblings were serologically negative.","1225":"Clinically normal horses (n = 8) with ages ranging from 5 to 8 years, were starved for 12 h and their plasma ammonia concentrations were measured. The mean fasting plasma ammonia concentration was 17.8 +\/- 3.8 mumol l-1. After dosing ammonium chloride at a dose rate of 0.02 g kg-1, there was a significant increase in plasma ammonia concentration, with a maximum rise after 20 min (P less than 0.05). To investigate the influence of temperature on plasma ammonia concentrations of stored samples, 8 plasma samples were stored at -20 degrees C and 4 degrees C respectively. The plasma ammonia concentrations were measured after 6, 12 and 24 h in each of the stored samples. Plasma ammonia concentrations increased significantly after 12 and 24 h when stored at 4 degrees C (P less than 0.05). When plasma was stored at -20 degrees C there was no significant increase from baseline concentrations during 24h (P greater than 0.05).","1226":"The ratio of the cardiopulmonary blood volume to stroke volume is called the cardiopulmonary flow index (CPFI). The CPFI can be determined indirectly from the simultaneous recording of a radiocardiogram and an electrocardiogram. The CPFI and cardiac output were measured simultaneously in horses (n = 10) that were diagnosed as having cardiac disease. The diseased subjects were probably all exposed to feed contaminated with the ionophore, salinomycin, and all showed clinical signs indicative of chronic toxic myocarditis. The results obtained from these subjects were compared with those from control animals and significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found between the mean CPFI of the control horses and those with macroscopically visible myocardial fibrosis on post mortem examination. No significant differences were found between the means of the cardiac output measured in either of the groups of horses. The effect of pharmacological acceleration of the heart rate on the CPFI was also studied. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found between the mean CPFI and the slopes of the regression lines of CPFI on heart rate of the control and principal groups of horses. These differences were greatest at heart rates near to the resting heart rates of the individuals. The CPFI was found to be a more sensitive measure of cardiac function than cardiac output, in the horses.","1227":"This investigation was designed to determine whether or not the technique of intrauterine insemination affects the length of the subsequent oestrous cycle. Dorper ewes (n = 31) were divided into treatment and control groups. All the ewes were synchronised using 40 mg fluorogestone acetate intravaginal sponges for 14 d and 300 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin on the day of sponge removal. A standard semen diluent was deposited laparoscopically in each uterine horn of ewes in the treatment group. Teaser rams were used to detect oestrus. Progesterone profiles were used to confirm oestrus. The mean oestrous cycle length of 17.83 +\/- 0.69 d for the group in which the diluent was deposited by laparoscopy did not differ significantly (P less than 0.1) from the 18.36 +\/- 2.11 d of the control group. The technique of laparoscopic insemination did not influence the length of subsequent oestrous cycles.","1228":"The microscopic uterine involutionary changes were studied in Boer goats (n = 16) from 2 h to 34 d post partum. The endometrial epithelium showed a linear decrease in thickness with time post partum. A highly significant negative correlation (r = -0.94; P less than 0.01) was found between the endometrial epithelium layer thickness and time post partum. The lamina propria layer showed a rapid decrease during the first 20 d post partum and then tended to level out. According to the statistical model (y = AeBt + Ct2) fitted by 25.2 d post partum, the thickness of the lamina propria layer was static. The myometrium decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) in thickness from Day 24 to Day 34 post partum. The thickness of the serosa followed a linear-type decrease during the observation period, while in the glandular epithelium the decrease was rapid during the first 12 d following parturition. The uterine glands reached normal size 22.1 d after parturition. The involution process of the uterus was microscopically complete by Day 28 post partum, the main indicator being the degree of recovery of the endometrial epithelium over the caruncular areas.","1229":"A large number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, of different chemical groups are available for veterinary use. These drugs act mainly by inhibiting the formation of endoperoxides (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) through the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase in the eicosanoid pathway. A wide range of pharmacological effects, including analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects occur as a result of this inhibition. The classification, mechanism of action and pharmacological effects of these drugs are reviewed.","1230":"A dog imported from Australia had microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis in its blood. This is the second report of these microfilariae in dogs imported into the Republic of South Africa. The treatment of this dog is described. Other filarial worms which are known to occur in the RSA are discussed.","1231":"A complete necropsy performed on 2 sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), revealed lesions concomitant with a massive haemolytic crisis. These included widespread oedema and anaemia of the carcass, severe oedema of the lungs, petechiae and echymoses of the epicardium, a moderate splenomegaly and a severe haemoglobinuria. The histopathological lesions included a moderate alveolar oedema, the presence of haemosiderin in the spleen and lymph nodes, and mild degenerative changes of the renal tubular epithelium. Peripheral blood and brain smears contained numerous parasitised red blood cells. The parasites were round or oval in shape containing a single or double area of purple-staining chromatin along a portion of the margin of the organism. It was identified as Babesia irvinesmithi Martinaglia, 1936, which is unique to sable. Seven sable antelope were subsequently treated with imidocarb diproprionate at a dose of 1.2 mg kg-1. No adverse side-effects have been noted in these animals.","1232":"","1233":"The therapeutic and managemental steps taken to bring a severe outbreak of salmonellosis in Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) under control are described. All the crocodiles were initially given intramuscular injections with kanamycin on alternating days for 8 d, coupled with adjustment of the ambient temperature to 29 degrees C. The holding pens were cleaned and disinfected with 2% formalin at the onset of treatment. Daily scrubbing and disinfection was continued throughout the treatment period. Severely affected crocodiles were separated and force-fed a liquid diet. All crocodiles were vaccinated with an inactivated calf paratyphoid vaccine 10 d after the onset of treatment and again one month later. The initial treatment was followed by a 30-week period of in-feed medication with oxytetracycline. Response to the initial treatment was dramatic, although some mortalities still occurred in the force-fed group for one month. The following year's hatchlings were fed heat-treated meat from first feeding onwards to avoid the possibility of introducing Salmonella spp. via the feed.","1234":"Six of 21 goats feeding on fresh avocado (Persea americana) leaves from pruned trees, showed clinical signs of cardiac distress. Some sheep subsequently dosed experimentally at different dosage rates with the same and other avocado varieties, showed clinical signs of respiratory or cardiac distress and myocardial lesions at autopsy.","1235":"Xylazine and fentanyl are commonly used in combinations for immobilisation of wild antelope. In order to ascertain the effects of the combination of these drugs on certain metabolites and hormones in ruminants, blood was sampled from 8 karakul sheep (4 experimental and 4 control) and one tame blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas phillipsii) for 30 min before and after immobilisation. The samples were assayed for glucose, free fatty acids, insulin, thyroxine, triidothyronine, progesterone and oestrogen. Significant changes, after the administration of xylazine and fentanyl, were recorded in circulating concentrations of glucose, which increased, and free fatty acids and insulin, which decreased. The other hormones tested were not affected within the sampling period. It is suggested that the combination of xylazine and fentanyl may act directly on pancreatic Beta cells to inhibit the secretion of insulin, which will consequently affect circulating concentrations of glucose and free fatty acids.","1236":"Some aspects of the life cycle of the tick Ixodes pilosus were studied under laboratory conditions. The preoviposition period was 7,2 +\/- 0,6 d. Maximum egg production was on Day 4 after oviposition commenced, with total egg production of 2,395 +\/- 128,7 eggs per female. The mean feeding time of larvae was 3,3 +\/- 0,1 d. The life cycle could not be completed due to the specific requirements of this species.","1237":"The prevalence of the larval stage of Taenia ovis and the origin of the animals were recorded for a period of 39 days at the Port Elizabeth abattoir. Cysticercosis was more frequently found in the M. triceps brachii of sheep, but the actual cysticerci were fewer than those found in the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, adductor, biceps femoris, vastus, rectus femoris and gracilis group of muscles of the hind limb (leg muscles). Most animals originated from farms in the Oudtshoorn district.","1238":"The 3 most abundant tick species on indigenous goats on a northern Transvaal farm were found to be Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Amblyomma hebraeum. Three other tick species were present in small numbers. The economical and ecological importance of the ticks found on the goats, mainly in rural areas where chemical control of ticks is practically non-existant, is discussed. The high number of goats in the study area and the shift towards alternative methods of tick control, such as the use of resistant hosts, are important factors in the livestock industry of southern Africa.","1239":"","1240":"A field outbreak of pox virus infection in juvenile Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), in which high morbidity and negligible mortality occurred, is described. Histopathological examination of the skin lesions revealed numerous large intracytoplasmic inclusions in the dermis and a very mild dermal inflammatory reaction. Scanning electron microscopical examination of the skin revealed the presence of large numbers of virus particles in the inclusions. Skin lesions persisted for 5 to 6 months.","1241":"","1242":"","1243":"Nursing care of long-term recumbent small animals, with emphasis on the neurological patient, is described.

A diagnosis of polycythaemia vera was made and the clinical signs ascribed to the hyperviscosity associated with this condition. Treatment by phlebotomy was initiated before the dog died.","1247":"A case of lead poisoning caused by ingestion of a lead roof-washer is described in a one-year-old, spayed Fox Terrier bitch, presented with nervous signs, and basophilic stippling of red blood cells. Blood concentrations of lead were in the low toxic range. Radiography of the abdomen revealed radio-dense objects in the stomach, which on gastrotomy included a lead roof-washer. Prior to removal of the foreign bodies, the dog showed remarkable improvement on non-specific symptomatic treatment alone, and recovered well after surgery, only to die unexpectedly several hours later. Concentrations of lead in the liver and kidneys were extremely high, and histology revealed typical intracellular inclusions and organ degeneration. In the light of these findings, it is suggested that all cases of suspected or confirmed lead poisoning be given specific chelation therapy.","1248":"The influence of a growth promoter on preweaning growth of beef steer calves in the Kalahari thornveld and shrub bushveld was investigated. Calves (n = 40) implanted with a testosterone propionate-oestradiolbenzoate compound at an average age of 120 d, attained a higher (P &lt; 0,005) weaning mass (256,7 vs 239,1 kg) and superior gains (93,9 vs 79,9 kg) over the trial period than the control group (n = 40).","1249":"Serum samples (n = 184) from 3 conventional laboratory mouse colonies were tested for antibodies with an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and reovirus Type 3. The percentage of mice with antibodies to reovirus Type 3, were comparable in all 3 groups, namely 40, 46 and 60%. Antibodies to TMEV showed the greatest variation, namely 0, 10 and 31%, whereas antibodies to EMCV were confirmed in only one colony (7%). In addition, 98 serum samples from 2 other colonies yielded 69% animals positive for rotavirus with the IFA test.","1250":"Serum samples (n = 860) from cattle in the Volksrust district were tested for Leptospira antibody titres. Seventeen (2%) of the animals were positive for leptospirosis, while 9(1%) animals showed suspect reactions. Titres against L. hardjo, L. pomona, and L. tarassovi were the most prevalent.","1251":"Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was found to be the causal organism of high mortality in a colony of Little Swifts (Apus affinis (Gray), occupying the vertical walls of high-rise buildings. The mortality continued for a period of about 4 weeks. Negative post-mortem findings necessitated a diagnosis based on bacterial examination during which the causal organism was isolated in pure culture from the liver, spleen and heart blood of affected birds.","1252":"Serum antibody titres to bovine respiratory syncytial virus were determined in cattle (n = 282). Samples were obtained at various feedlots and were collected in the 1989 and 1990 winter seasons, during the course of investigations into outbreaks of respiratory tract infections in feedlot cattle. Results of the survey revealed an antibody prevalence of 43% to bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Titres ranged from 1:10 to 1:1280 as determined by the indirect fluorescent antibody test. The results also indicate that bovine respiratory syncytial virus is probably widespread in feedlot cattle in South Africa, and that this virus may be a contributing factor in the bovine respiratory complex.","1253":"Suckling Merino lambs on lucerne pasture, demonstrated no appreciable mass gain when compared with untreated controls, despite regular treatment with anthelmintics. This was ascribed to severe parasitic challenge. After weaning and transfer to wheat stubble fields with no parasitic challenge, however, the live mass of the untreated lambs, still harbouring a residual burden of nematodes, was depressed. Control sheep produced 1.2 kg less wool than regularly-treated sheep, but produced finer wool which had a higher market value. Regularly-treated ewes (F1) produced 12.1% more lambs, but their mean live mass was 2.6 kg lower than that of ewes treated less frequently. The overall financial benefit was in favour of the group which received fewer anthelmintic treatments and was due mainly to the higher market value of the finer wool produced by these apparently stressed animals.","1254":"In the Swellendam area, benzimidazoles held 34.5% of the market for sheep and goat nematocides in 1988, ivermectin 30.1%, levamisole 13.7%, combination products 13.5%, salicylanilides 6.8% and morantel 1.4%, while products containing benzimidazole accounted for 48.1% of sheep and goat nematocide sales. The sheep and goat nematocide and cestocide markets in the Swellendam area totalled 1,386,280 and 94,080 therapeutic doses respectively, costing R448 887,10 and R79 242,02, while the cattle anthelmintic market totalled 12,209 therapeutic doses, costing R30 520,22. A mean of 3.45 therapeutic doses of nematocide were purchased for sheep and goats during 1988 at a per capita cost of R1.12 at December 1988 prices. Furthermore, the mean per capita expenditure on anthelmintics against both the nematodes and cestodes of these animals, amounted to R1.31. Nematocides used for sheep and goats in this market segment, cost 36 cents per dose. The mean escalation of anthelmintic prices between January and December 1988 was 10%, ranging from -6 to 30%.","1255":"Selected haematological, blood chemical and serological variables were investigated in healthy Thoroughbreds (n = 45) in training.

Vit B12 concentrations exceeded 1400 pmol l-1. Blood lead concentrations in all animals were below 15 ug l-1. Fifteen (33.3%) of the horses were carriers of babesiosis. Laboratory findings concerning these horses did not differ from those of the other horses.","1256":"Comprehensive blood typing (17 factors) and electrophoretic protein markers (haemoglobins, transferrins and albumins) were determined on S.A. Mutton Merino sheep (n = 275). The frequencies of these genetic markers were compared between ram lambs with normal and ram lambs with bent-legs and in a second trial between non-affected ewes and their lambs and ewes and lambs which were considered to be carriers of genetic factors resulting in the bent-leg syndrome. The presence of blood factors 2, 3 and 13 and the absence of factors 8, 10 and 17 is possibly linked to the bent-leg syndrome. Although the frequencies of TFA and TFD alleles were higher in the suspected carrier animals than non-affected animals, no definite linkage to the bent-leg syndrome was found. Haemoglobin and albumin type showed no correlation with the bent-let syndrome.","1257":"","1258":"A total of 718 sheep, 381 severely and 190 mildly affected with Bolo disease as well as 147 visibly unaffected animals emanating from 15 farms in the Stutterheim and Cathcart districts in the eastern Cape were subjected to bacteriological examination of skin surfaces and wool specimens. Altogether, 1,168 specimens were examined. These included skin swabs, skin scrapings and wool samples. Corynebacterium spp represented 94.4% of the primary isolates in cultures prepared from all specimens and 97.2% in those derived from skin swabs only, while a variety of other bacteria collectively constituted the remainder of primary isolates. In all, Corynebacterium spp was isolated from specimens of 94.2% of sheep severely affected with Bolo disease and from 83.7% of those mildly affected, whereas it could only be isolated from 1.36% clinically unaffected sheep. In a comparative study, swabs taken directly from the skin surface, proved to be the method of choice for the collection of specimens for bacteriological examination of Bolo disease. Using this method, Corynebacterium spp. was isolated from 98.7% of severely, and 85.3% of mildly affected sheep as well as 4% of sheep apparently unaffected by Bolo disease. The isolation of Corynebacterium spp. from skin scrapings collected from the 3 categories of affection (73.3%, 57.3% and 4% respectively) and from wool samples (52%, 41.3% and 1.3% respectively) proved these 2 methods of sampling to be less reliable.

Trough serum concentrations were determined on Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21. The drug was administered to the dogs on an empty stomach, except on Day 24, when it was given with food, in order to assess the influence of food on its absorption. Drug serum concentrations were described by a one-compartmental open model with first order absorption and elimination. An average steady-state trough serum level of phenobarbitone of 52,96 +\/- 8.40 mmol l-1 was achieved after 3 weeks of daily dosing. The mean elimination half-lives for Day 1 and Day 22 were 46.3 +\/- 11.3 h and 29.3 +\/- 4.6 h respectively.

In each case the wethers had been implanted several weeks previously with a growth promoting product containing progesterone and oestradiol. The affected wethers presented with dorsal retroflexion of a markedly distended bladder which caused persistent straining, bulging of the perineal muscles and rectal prolapse. Enlargement of the bulbo-urethral glands and seminal vesicles, with an increase in the volume and viscosity of the secretion of the bulbourethral glands was evident on gross examination. Histopathological examination of the prostate and bulbourethral glands revealed cystic dilation of the glands and hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the glandular epithelium. Desquamated cells and eesinophilic-staining material were present in many of the dilated lumens. In the seminal vesicles, interstitial fibrosis had resulted in the obliteration of large areas of glandular tissue. The enlargement of the prostate and bulbo-urethral glands, and particularly the increased viscosity of the gland secretions, probably hindered urination, resulting in only partial evacuation of the bladder. Attempts to urinate by active contraction of the abdominal muscles may have accounted for the dorsal retroflexion of the distended bladder. The oestrogenic influence of the growth implants is thought to be responsible for these changes.","1268":"An extracapsular lentectomy was performed on an adult black-shouldered kite (Elanus caeruleus) presented with a history of head trauma resulting in a unilateral cataract and ventro-medial synechia of the right eye. One week post-operatively, the eye contents were clear and the iris appeared normal. The bird was released into a flight cage 3.5 weeks post-operatively. Two weeks later it was presented with a ruptured right cornea as a result of trauma and enucleation was recommended.","1269":"The effect of age of the ewe and pregnancy on concentrations of plasma calcium, phosphorus and magnesium and its relationship to the bent-leg syndrome in lambs, were investigated. This study included Merino ewes (n = 74), Dohne Merino ewes (n = 127), S A Mutton Merino ewes (n = 123) and S A Mutton Merino lambs (n = 145). Over a period of 8 years, 52 S A Mutton Merino ram lambs out of a total of 602 ram lambs weaned (8,6%), developed the bent-leg syndrome compared to the 2 ewe lambs out of 591 ewe lambs (0,3%) weaned. It was found that both the age of the ewe and pregnancy had no contributing effect in the development of this syndrome. The ewes of which the offspring developed the bent-leg syndrome, had an inverse plasma Ca:P ratio. Approximately 15% of the S A Mutton Merino ewes which gave birth to offspring which developed the bent-leg syndrome, had more than one lamb which developed this condition over the past 8 years. It is suggested that these ewes are carriers of certain genetic factors which can cause excessive phosphorus absorption. No differences in the concentration of plasma calcium, phosphorus and magnesium were found between ewe and ram lambs.","1270":"Blood constituent responses of elephants and buffaloes culled in the Kruger National Park, using a mixture of succinyldicholine and hexamethonium, were compared to those of animals culled with succinyldicholine only. The results show a decreased physiological response in the animals culled with the mixture, characterised by lower total catecholamine, cortisol and glucose concentrations. Neither a delay of up to 30 min in obtaining blood samples from culled animals, nor a delay of up to 30 min in processing samples obtained immediately after cessation of respiration, gave any significant difference in the blood constituents which were measured.","1271":"Angora goat kids and yearlings grazing irrigated Kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) grass pastures in the eastern Cape Province, became heavily infected with Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus rugatus, leading to high mortality in both age groups. Peak burdens of the former were recorded during March and May, and of the latter during May and June. Larger numbers of the cestode Moniezia expanza, occurred in the kids than in the yearlings. Despite the stress of high helminth burdens, no clinical cases of coccidiosis were seen. Both groups of goats were infested with small numbers of immature stages of the tortoise tick, Amblyomma marmoreum, and the yellow dog tick, Haemaphysalis leachi. Infestation with the biting louse, Damalinia limbata, occurred within 2 d of birth, but never reached very large numbers. Larvae of the nasal botfly, Oestrus ovis, were present only from January to July.","1272":"A serological investigation was undertaken to determine the prevalence of brucellosis titres in buffalo in the Kruger National park. A total of 406 samples were collected over a period of one year. The rose bengal and the complement fixation tests were used in the investigation as these tests are routinely used for cattle sera and have proved to be reliable. In the females, 12.6% adult, 10.7% sub-adult and 3% juvenile animals reacted positively to the tests. In the males, 15.1% adults, 10.6% sub-adults and 5.3% juveniles were recorded as positive.","1273":"In the Bredasdorp anthelmintic market segment with its 327,764 sheep and goats and 19,818 cattle, 1,323,770 therapeutic doses of anthelmintic for sheep and goats and 6,622 therapeutic doses for cattle, worth R456,800.46 and R22,548.31, respectively, were sold during 1988. Fewer than 4 market segment therapeutic doses of nematocide, with an annual total average cost of R1.40 per animal, were sold for sheep and goats, while only an estimated 33 1\/3% of the cattle received an anthelmintic, at an annual average cost of R3.41 per animal. Anthelmintic prices fluctuated by -12 to +42% in 16 months. Benzimidazoles were responsible for 38.5%, ivermectins for 22.1% and combination products for 19.4% of sales. The injectable formulation of ivermectin was responsible for 38.5% of ivermectin sales and probably used primarily in the control of sheep scab.","1274":"Auriculotherapy (ear-point acupuncture) was used in dogs (n = 30) suffering from thoracolumbar disc disease, Types I-IV, with a duration of 1 to (47 means = 8) d. During auriculotherapy treatment, no analgaesics or antiinflammatory medications were used. Pressure-sensitive and electrically detectable points on the concave aspect of the external auricle were stimulated by insertion of stainless steel acupuncture needles for 20 min. One to 6 needles were used on each occasion in a maximum of 3 treatments. Fifty per cent of dogs recovered completely and 23% improved. Dogs with backpain only (Type I) and dogs with paresis (Type II) responded best with mean recovery times of 1.7 and 3.2 d respectively. The analgaesic effects were especially impressive. Auriculotherapy failed in 3 (50%) paralysed dogs (Types III and IV) in which post-mortem examinations confirmed focal myelitis and myelomalacia. Four of 12 dogs (33%) recorded relapsed in 1.4 to 26 weeks after successful treatment.","1275":"","1276":"Insulin is the primary short-term hormonal regulator of metabolism in the resting ruminant. The concentration of plasma insulin is positively correlated with energy intake. Diets producing hyperinsulinaemia, direct the balance towards body gain (anabolic). However, in lactating animals, the postprandial rise in insulin is reduced, thereby favouring movement of nutrients to the mammary gland and promoting gluconeogenesis. Similar mechanisms balance the demands of foetal and maternal growth. Glucagon, on the other hand, stimulates both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver from glucogenic amino acids, thereby indirectly diminishing protein synthesis in muscle. Homeorhetic hormones from both the pituitary and reproductive glands, play a major role in the long-term control of nutrient partitioning. Oestrogens appear to affect feed intake, promote RNA and protein synthesis and inhibit gluconeogenesis in the liver, thereby promoting the metabolic adaptations necessary for pregnancy. Progesterone, on the other hand, appears to block the action of the oestrogens at cellular level, and may actually increase feed intake. The pituitary hormones, prolactin and somatotropin, bring about significant improvements in production, especially in milk yield. The action of the somatomedins appears to be responsible for the paradoxical spectrum of effects attributed to somatotropin.","1277":"A three-year-old, castrated, male, domestic cat presented with an antibiotic-resistant rhinitis, generalised lymphadenopathy, and skin nodules distributed over the neck, thorax and abdomen. Cryptococcus neoformans was identified on cytology and histopathology specimens, and cultured from all the specimens submitted. The cat died without antimicrobial therapy being instituted. Systemic cryptococcosis was confirmed on necropsy. Lesions were found in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, skin, subcutis, skeletal musculature, lymph nodes, kidney, eye and brain. This report details a case of systemic cryptococcosis in a cat and gives a review of feline cryptococcosis.","1278":"Supernumerary ectopic limbs growing from the withers of a calf, were successfully removed by surgical excision. The anatomy of the limbs is described and a possible embryological basis for the abnormal development is suggested.","1279":"An outbreak of diarrhoea occurred in a Jersey herd after the introduction of new stock. One of the cows was examined and treated unsuccessfully. Clinical findings included depression, fever, dehydration, congestion, signs of colic and a severe diarrhoea. The post mortem examination revealed emaciation, pseudomembranous enteritis, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and focal disseminated hepatic necrosis. Salmonella typhimurium was isolated from the faeces, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver.","1280":"Two groups of 40 S A Mutton merino ewes were used to determine the effect of body mass and condition score on the response of immunisation against androstenedione. The effect of immunisation was significant (P less than 0.05) on ovulation rate (1.64 for non-immunised and 2.08 for immunised ewes) and higher body mass and condition scores acted complimentary to the effect of immunisation. The ovulation rate in control ewes was more closely related to condition score (r = 0.511) and body mass (r = 0.600) at the end of the experimental period than in the immunised ewe group (r = 0.302 and 0.235).","1281":"Formalin-fixed samples (n = 75) of commercial boerewors (traditional farm style sausage) were examined for total nitrogen (N) and hydroxyproline (Hypro) N to assess their collagen content. Hypo N\/total N x 10(3) (unaffected by residual fat) varied from 8.23 to 16.50; 3\/75 (5%) of samples had ratios equal to or less than the control (8.38) i.e. sausage home-made from meat without addition of scraps or collagen-rich trimmings. About 95% of samples had ratios greater than 10, and 5% had ratios greater than double the control. In 75% of the surveyed samples, the ratios were more than 1.5 times greater than those of the control. To ensure boerewors of good compositional quality, it is advocated that formalin-fixed samples of the product be subjected to both histological examination and collagen determinations. Promulgation of legislation to limit the collagen content of boerewors is proposed; a maximum of 12 in the ratio of Hypro N\/total N x 10(3) is considered reasonable and attainable in the light of the results of this survey.","1282":"Investigations into ovine pelvic size and its relationship to repetitive rearing failure require accurate estimation of pelvic dimensions in live animals. Radiographic pelvimetry was used to estimate pelvic dimensions of 84 Merino, 21 Dormer and 20 S A Mutton Merino ewes. Transverse diameter and conjugate diameter were estimated; the area of the pelvic inlet was defined as the product of transverse and conjugate diameters. Dissected measurements obtained from all ewes after slaughter were regressed on estimated dimensions to obtain prediction equations for the correction of radiographic estimates. Prediction equations for the estimation of dissected pelvic dimensions from radiographs were accurate (r greater than or equal to 0.87), irrespective of dimension estimated or breed. Derived equations for estimation of dissected pelvic dimensions for the 3 breeds were not statistically different. It was concluded that pelvic dimensions of ewes could accurately be predicted by radiographic pelvimetry.","1283":"The free fatty acid (FFA) content of milk from the paired normal (N) and septic (Staphylococcus aureus or S. agalactiae) subclinically mastitic (SSM) quarters of dairy cows was determined by thin layer chromatography. Within-cow comparisons showed the FFA content of milk from the SSM quarters to be consistently significantly higher than that of the opposing N quarters: initially and after warm agitation and both rapid and slow cooling prior to storage at 4 degrees C for 48 h. No correlation existed between initial and post-treatment FFA levels in milk from N quarters, but a significant positive correlation in the case of SSM milks suggests their greater susceptibility to both spontaneous and induced lipolysis. There was no correlation between the somatic cell content and FFA levels of either freshly-drawn or processed SSM milk. The study emphasises the importance of healthy udders in the production of milk of acceptable flavour and aroma.","1284":"","1285":"The activity of gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was measured in sheep urine using a method developed for the routine assay of serum. Despite variation in urine pH and specific gravity, this method gave reproducible results. Serial dilutions of urine samples to which bovine GGT extract was added, showed a linear relationship for GGT values between 48 U l-1 and 373 U l-1. When a saline solution of GGT was added to urine and serum to compare the behaviour of GGT in the two fluid mediums, no difference could be demonstrated. The presence of non-specific enzyme inhibitors for GGT in sheep urine could not be established, eliminating the need for urine dialysis before the assessment of GGT activity. GGT activity remained the same in urine samples that were stored at 4, 25 and -20 degrees C for 12 and 24 hours. Serial urine samples from 16 sheep were collected for 24 hours and the activity of GGT and the creatinine concentration were measured. Although there was significant variation in the measured GGT and creatinine values, the ratio of GGT:creatinine remained constant. The mean urine GGT:creatinine ratio was found to be 29.1 with a standard deviation of 7.0. A population reference value for urine GGT: urine creatinine ratio in clinically normal sheep was calculated to be 43.1.","1286":"DNA isolated from blood samples of Afrikander cattle (n = 66) were screened by blot-hybridisation analysis to determine the frequency of carriers of the goitre mutation. No carriers were found, suggesting that the frequency of the goitre mutation is less than 0.01.","1287":"Dietary levels of cations and anions are shown to have an effect on concentrations of phosphorus (P) in blood, bone and faeces of dairy calves between 9 and 19 weeks of age. Calves fed diets high in anions, demonstrated higher concentrations of P in blood and faeces than calves whose diets were high in cations, and at the same time demonstrated lower concentrations of P in bone. Compared to diets with high cation levels, diets high in anions produced significantly (p less than 0.05) higher concentrations of total P in the faeces at different stages in the experiment, higher serum inorganic phosphorus (SiP) concentrations and lower P concentrations in the bone, which were significant at the end of the trial (P less than 0.06). When the diet was low in P (0.22%), the cation-anion balance of the diet seemed to have the greatest effect, so that the interaction of dietary P and dietary cation-anion balance (DCAB) was responsible for changes in blood, bone and faeces.","1288":"An unusual form of vulvitis occurred in outbreak form affecting at least 18 of a group of 35 to 40 heifers soon after their introduction to a feedlot in the western Transvaal area of the Republic of South Africa. Initially, affected animals showed a knob-like swelling of the ventral commissure of the vulva. This grew in size up to approximately 6 cm in diameter and then appeared to burst open and give rise to a granulomatous lesion. Bovine herpesvirus type-1, Moraxella bovis, Mycoplasma bovigenitalium and Mycoplasma bovis were isolated from 2 affected heifers referred for diagnostic investigation. Mycoplasma canadense was isolated from one of the heifers. Attempts to reproduce the disease by transferring an excised portion of the lesion to unaffected animals, resulted only in lesions typical of uncomplicated infectious pustular vulvovaginitis. It is proposed that that multifactorial aetiology, including synergistic pathogenic action between the organisms isolated, was responsible for this outbreak. Administration of oxytetracycline to affected animals was followed by prompt resolution of symptoms. No further outbreaks have been reported.","1289":"An outbreak of suspected Phalaris staggers in South Africa is described. Approximately 40 out of 600 sheep that had been grazing for 3 weeks on a wheat stubble land heavily infested with Phalaris grass, were affected. Clinical signs included nervous tremors, ataxia and convulsions. New cases occurred even after removal from the affected pasture. The most prominent microscopic lesion seen in the 2 sheep autopsied, was an accumulation of intracytoplasmic brown pigment in the neurons of the brain.","1290":"A lioness was accidentally poisoned by consumption of meat of a horse euthanased with pentobarbital. The post mortem examination was negative but thin-layer gas-chromatographic and mass-spectrometric methods revealed a pentobarbitone concentration of 1, 14 mg kg-1 in the chloroform extracts of the liver of the animal.","1291":"A case of amoebic meningoencephalitis in a sheep, suspected of being caused by Acanthamoeba sp., is described. An adult ewe was necropsied 5 days after it had developed anorexia and nervous signs, which included ataxia and walking in circles. Significant gross lesions were restricted to the central nervous system and consisted of thickening of the meninges and extensive necrosis of the cerebrum and cerebellum. The cerebral changes were characterised microscopically by a multifocal to coalescent necrotising granulomatous meningoencephalitis as well as choroid plexitis, ventriculitis and diffuse vasculitis. Numerous amoebic trophozoites and a few encysted forms morphologically compatible with Acanthamoeba sp. were present in the affected areas, particularly in the walls of blood vessels and perivascular spaces.","1292":"A number of young Friesian oxen were slaughtered (one at a time) for parasite recovery for 12 consecutive months, from April 1987 to March 1988, on a farm in the Fauresmith district of the south western Orange Free State. A total of 5 ixodid and one argasid tick species, 2 lice species, plus one nematode species and one cestode species, were recovered. Peak numbers of adult Hyalomma marginatum rufipes were present from November 1987 to February 1988, while the largest numbers of Hyalomma truncatum were recovered during September 1987 and from November 1987 to January 1988. Adult Ixodes rubicundus were recovered only during April and June 1987. Adult ticks of a Rhipicephalus sp. near R. punctatus were present during April and from September to November 1987 and in January 1988. No pattern of seasonal abundance was evident for the other tick species, the lice or the helminths.","1293":"Sheep (n = 14) with coenuriosis were treated with praziquantel in single or divided doses at total dosage rates of 50 to 500 mg kg-1 live mass. Nine of the sheep also received corticosteroid, diuretic and analgesic supportive therapy. Stress was avoided as far as practically possible. Treatment of one sheep with acute coenuriosis at a total dosage rate of 500 mg kg-1 praziquantel, was unsuccessful. Eight sheep were successfully treated at total dosages ranging from 100 to 500 mg kg-1 live mass, whereas dosages of 50 mg kg-1 were successful in 2 sheep only. Dosages of 50 mg kg-1 in 2 other sheep with multiple cerebral coenuri, were unsuccessful or only partially successful in killing parasites.","1294":"The arteries supplying the ileocaecal junctions of 7 horses were injected with latex via the A. ileocolica and dissected macroscopically. The same basic pattern emerged whereby a single papillary artery arising from the R. ilei mesenterialis, supplied all aspects of the ileocaecal papilla. In one instance, the papillary artery arose directly from the ileocolic artery. No collateral arterial supply to the ileocaecal junction was present in any of the specimens dissected.","1295":"A questionnaire, based on 14 years' private practice experience and psychological principles, was compiled to establish the reasons why veterinary clients are involved with their pets. Questionnaires were sent to South African veterinarians country-wide and only clients visiting veterinarians were requested to complete the questionnaires anonymously. Questionnaires (n = 612) were returned and the data was processed by computer. The results indicated that clients are involved with their companion animals for emotional, social and relaxational reasons, which all have psychological implications. They are, however, also involved with their animals by caring for them, and they keep them for utility or economical reasons and also due to their general interest in nature. The latter reasons could be seen as natural reasons for keeping pets. The same relationship between clients and their pets continue during veterinary consultations. Because of this continuing involvement, some clients may consult veterinarians mainly for psychological reasons and others mainly for clinical reasons. There is a constant interaction between these motivations for veterinary consultations. Client consultations of veterinarians could thus be categorised into psychological consultations which are predominantly human\/client orientated and clinical consultations which are predominantly animal\/patient orientated.","1296":"Three dogs showed signs of intravascular haemolysis, spherocytosis and peripheral neuropathy following severe bee envenomation. These effects were ascribed to the constituents of bee venom, especially melittin and phospholipase A. All 3 cases recovered and were discharged subsequent to prednisolone and supportive therapy.","1297":"Of 392 heifers vaccinated between 4 and 9.5 months of age and tested at 22 months or older, 3 (0.77%) had titres in the complement fixation test of between 30 and 98 international units per millilitre. The results confirm that persistent serological reactions can be a problem even in brucellosis-free herds. To reduce the incidence of these problem reactors, it is suggested that: in clean herds the age of inoculation be reduced to 3 months of age; the age at first testing be delayed as long as possible, but be done before the heifers are 4 months pregnant, c) consideration be given to reducing the vaccine dose for all heifers from the present 4 to 12 x 10(10) to between 3 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(9) and syringes used for strain 19 vaccination be exclusively reserved for this purpose to prevent the possibility of antigenic residues acting as a booster when used for other vaccinations.","1298":"Two Arabian horse stallions with behavioural problems were treated with long-acting neuroleptics in order to facilitate corrective training. Perphenazine enanthate, administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 had an effect for 30 d. Pipothiazine palmitate (1 mg kg-1) induced tranquilization of 30 d duration as well as extra-pyramidal clinical signs, ataxia and aphagia. Neither horse showed prolapse of the penis or haemolysis.","1299":"The long-acting neuroleptics perphenazine enanthate and pipothiazine palmitate were found to be effective for the long-term tranquilization of newly-captured and captive impala (Aepyceros melampus). Perphenazine enanthate (1.5 to 5.7 mg kg-1) produced a favourable state of tranquilization with a maximum effect lasting up to 7 d. Pipothiazine palmitate (4.5 mg kg-1) produced tranquilization lasting 16 d. The animals accepted humans inside their pens, at a distance of 0.5 to 4 m, without showing any excitement. No untoward side-effects were observed.","1300":"A bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the lungs of a horse which was euthanased after protracted respiratory disease and radiological evidence of pulmonary neoplasia. Multifocal, large, firm neoplasms occurred throughout both lungs. Neoplastic lesions were not found elsewhere. Histologically the bronchiolar and alveolar architecture was retained. The cuboidal cells lining neoplastic alveoli had very vacuolated cytoplasm, while some were ciliated. Electron microscopy identified the cells as Type II pneumocytes. Numerous distended myelinoid bodies in the tumour cells accounted for the vacuolated appearance seen by light microscopy. Special stains for fat, mucin, mucopolysaccharides and glycogen failed to elucidate the nature of the substance in these vacuoles.","1301":"An outbreak of mortality in Friesland dairy calves in which 7 out of 25 calves died in the western Cape Province, Republic of South Africa is described. Clinical signs included a loss in body mass, staring hair coat, diarrhoea and rectal prolapse. Histopathological changes in the liver were characterised by severe portal fibrosis with bile duct proliferation and mild portal round cell infiltration. The calves were fed a ration containing locally-produced maize. The implicated maize was infested with Aspergillus flavus and contained aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 with total aflatoxin levels as high as 11,790 ng g-1. This is the first report of a field outbreak of bovine aflatoxicosis in South Africa.","1302":"The efficiency of metabolisable energy utilisation, for growth and fattening, is dependent upon the relative VFA proportions produced in the rumen. Sufficient propionate is required to meet glucose demand for producing NADPH, glycerol and nucleic acid synthesis. Since diet has the greatest effect on the pattern of VFA fermentation, it will play a major role in controlling the supply of VFA to the animal. Magnitude of the acetate supply determines the proportion of acetate supplied to oxidation or to fatty acid synthesis, which is also dependent upon the extracellular supply of glucose, NADPH and ATP. Since the optimal levels of acetate and glucose for lipogenesis appear to vary with glucose concentration, a diet that decreases the supply of glucogenic precursors, but increases the acetate supply, may suppress fatty acid synthesis. An increased supply of propionate may suppress glucose synthesis from other sources. The isoenergetic replacement of roughage by concentrate, appears to increase the glucose entry rate, due to both an increase in propionate, and glucose absorbed from the small intestine. Dietary nitrogen source also affects the rate of gluconeogenesis. An optimum dietary energy-protein ratio exists for maximum efficiency of utilisation of both dietary energy and protein. In dairy cows, for example, the energy is most effectively metabolised when protein content of the diet is 15-25% of net energy.","1303":"An extremely pleomorphic virus was isolated from broilers with swollen head syndrome. This virus seems to be related to the virus causing turkey rhinotracheitis.","1304":"Blood was obtained over a period of 20 minutes by remote controlled procedures from cattle while they were herded. Samples were analysed for catecholamines, cortisol, haematocrit, total lipid, glucose and lactate. The results show that the response to a given stressor is specific and suggest that multiple stressors may not necessarily result in additive effects.","1305":"Anomalous origins of the right subclavian and common carotid arteries in a 6-month old Alsatian bitch are described. The first vessel to branch from the aortic arch was a short bicarotid trunk which divided into left and right common carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery was partially occluded at its origin and its function and area of supply was taken over by the right vertebral artery. The right subclavian artery branched directly from the aortic arch and passed dorsally to the oesophagus, forming an incomplete vascular ring around the oesophagus. Although the oesophagus was constricted between the vessel dorsally and the trachea ventrally, it did not cause obstruction or dysphagia. The right vertebral artery was exceptionally large.","1306":"The results of a study conducted to determine the clinico-pathological changes in 4 experimentally-induced cases of endotoxaemia in the horse are reported on. Endotoxaemia was induced by injecting commercially available E. coli 055:B5 lipopolysaccharide intravenously at a dose of 1 microgram kg-1. The haematocrit, red cell count, total and differential white cell counts, thrombocyte count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, level of fibrin degradation products, arterial acid-base status, serum lactate and blood glucose were determined repeatedly. Changes that occurred, include increases in the haematocrit and red cell count, a leucopaenia followed by a leucocytosis caused mainly by changes in the number of neutrophils, the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, minor changes in the arterial acid base parameters, hyperglycaemia followed by hypoglycaemia and an increase in serum lactate.","1307":"The results of a study conducted to determine the clinical changes in 4 experimentally-induced cases of endotoxaemia in the horse are reported on. Endotoxaemia was induced by injecting commercially available E. coli 055:B5 lipopolysaccharide intravenously at a dose of 1 microgram kg-1. The parameters that were monitored include general behaviour, rectal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and quality, pulse quality, mucous membrane colour, capillary refill time, appearance of the faeces and the presence of laminitis. Increases in rectal temperature, respiratory and heart rate, capillary refill time, the development of a bounding peripheral pulse, dyspnoea and congestion of mucous membranes, decrease in faecal consistency and behavioural changes were recorded.","1308":"The use of flumethrin pour-on in 1.0% and 0.5% concentrations for the purpose of de-ticking black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) prior to translocation is reported. Both formulations achieved a high level of efficacy within 8 to 12 h following treatment. The 0.5% formulation was found to be more suitable than the 1.0% for use on the dry, hairless skin of the rhinoceros because the increased dose volume resulted in more rapid spreading.","1309":"In preliminary investigation of the pharmacokinetics of aspirin in dogs it became apparent that the drug was well absorbed following oral ingestion with food. Multiple dosing appeared to lead to a substantial increase in half-life; a twice daily dosage regimen would, therefore, be adequate for maintenance of therapeutic levels in dogs. The marked variation in pharmacokinetic parameters observed suggested that therapeutic drug monitoring would be benefit in the control of canine inflammatory conditions using aspirin. Therapeutic monitoring of dogs (n = 20) showed that clinical improvement paralleled plasma salicylate concentrations and the therapeutic concentrations so determined were within the range considered therapeutic in humans. No overt gastric irritation was noted in this study over a period of a year which suggests that aspirin can be successfully used to treat canine inflammatory disorders, routine monitoring of plasma salicylate being recommended to ensure therapeutic success.","1310":null,"1311":"Total differential warm counts were done on sheep slaughtered from 7 May 1987 to 19 May 1988 at Boontjieskraal Estate in the Overberg, Republic of South Africa. It was found that winter lambs became infested with Nematodirus spathiger at 5 to 7 weeks of age. At weaning in October 1987 this species was superseded by Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus rugatus. Small numbers of Trichuris skrjabini and Oesophagostomum venulosum were also present. From July to October, 3rd and 4th stage larvae exceeded adult Teladorsagia in ewes, and from July to December 1987 and in May 1988 in lambs and weaners. Juveniles exceeded adult Nematodirus in ewes from July to October 1987 and in suckling lambs in July 1987 and May 1988. Infective larvae aestivate in the faeces or in the soil of the lucerne pastures in the dry, hot summer months and migrate on to the herbage during the cool, wet autumn. Grazing in summer on wheat stubble and even newly sprouted lucerne is safe, in paddocks ranging from 40 to 60 ha in extent, despite massive daily contamination by weaners with more than 60 million worm eggs. Previously infected weaners underwent spontaneous cure within 6 weeks to 6 months of starting to graze safe pastures, Teladorsagia being reduced by 77 to 98%, Nematodirus by 9 to 94% and Trichostrongylus by 34 to 40%.","1312":"","1313":"","1314":"A chronological review is given of the most important people, publications, scientific gatherings and societies which have contributed to the development and recognition of human-animal interactions as a field of study. Lorenz is recognised as the founder of this new field of study. His contribution was to emphasise the role of humans who have to have a thorough knowledge of animal behaviour and he also pointed out the fact that modern man needs to keep contact with nature. Other pioneers were Levinson who pointed out the therapeutic benefits of companion animals and the Corsons who used animals in hospital settings. The explosion of knowledge in this particular field took place during the 1980's. The first world congress on the subject was held in 1980 in London. Societies involved in this new study field, were established in the United Kingdom, Europe, United States of America, Australia, Canada and South Africa. In South Africa the interest in this field emerged during the 1980's with articles published in veterinary periodicals. It has since developed into a multi-disciplinary approach. A new chair was furthermore inaugurated to teach human-animal-interactions as part of the veterinary curriculum. There is no doubt that the new study field has important implications for the veterinary profession.","1315":"Routine bacteriological diagnosis of bovine mastitis does not provide an index to the obligate anaerobic flora involved. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent facultative anaerobic or aerobic udder infections as diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Dairy Federation. Simultaneous isolation of anaerobic bacteria from udder quarter abscesses and mastitic milk from the same quarter occur in some lactating dairy cows. In most dairy herds there are cows with anaerobic udder infections. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from lactating as well as from dry cows. Most anaerobic bacteria were isolated concurrently with facultative anaerobic bacteria except in aseptic mastitis cases. The polymicrobial nature of udder infections shows that multiple anaerobic as well as facultative anaerobic species colonise and act together. In spite of antibiotic therapy, anaerobic bacteria were still isolated from mastitic quarters. Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but most of the Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were resistant and some Bacteroides fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. Nearly all the aminoglycosides display consistently poor activity against anaerobic bacteria. A high degree of resistance against tetracyclines was also demonstrated. Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and rods were sensitive to common antibiotics. The pathogenicity of several pure cultures of anaerobic bacteria has been demonstrated by their ability to induce clinical mastitis in healthy lactating udders. Anaerobic bacteria may act as mastitis pathogens probably in a primary and\/or secondary role because clinical mastitis could be induced in normal quarters under experimental conditions. Their high prevalence of anaerobic bacteria in mastitic quarters and the ability of some strains to produce heparinase also suggests a pathogenic role. The handling of udder abscesses and the therapy of mastitis where anaerobic bacteria may be involved, is fully discussed.","1316":"Lyme disease is a recently-described zoonotic disease occurring widely in the U.S.A., Europe and Asia. The causative organism, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted predominantly by ticks of the genus Ixodes and infects a wide host range. The infection in humans causes the human disease syndrome erythema chronicum migrans resulting in arthritis, neurological symptoms and\/or cardiac abnormalities. Similar clinical signs have been described in domestic animals. The status of Lyme disease in southern Africa is presently unknown but preliminary evidence indicates that the disease may occur in humans in the Republic of South Africa. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favour the establishment of the infection in Africa.","1317":"Narcolepsy was diagnosed in a three-month old, longhaired Dachshund presented with a history of sudden onset of episodes of complete collapse. Littermates or immediate ancestors were not affected. Numerous daily cataplectic attacks as well as excessive sleepiness were the main clinical features. The dog did not respond to treatment with methylphenidate and imipramine. The clinical signs of the disease disappeared after treatment with dexamphetamine. This report describes a case presentation, findings of cerebrospinal fluid assay for catecholamines after various treatment regimens and the response of the patient to treatment.","1318":"The first known case of an odontoma in an African elephant (Loxodonta africana) is described. The tumour was fused with the coronal cementum of the sixth right mandibular molar tooth, thus preventing its eruption.","1319":"The clinical, radiological and anatomical changes in a yearling foal with kyphoscoliosis are described. The lesion was due to a primary malformation of the eleventh, twelfth, fourteenth and fifteenth thoracic vertebral bodies resulting in hemivertebrae. Secondary changes occurred in the laminae, pedicles, spinous and articular processes of the affected vertebrae and the adjacent vertebrae. The possible pathogenesis and differential diagnosis are discussed.","1320":"Autotransplantation of the ovary to the portal vein drainage area was performed in 1,130 bitches over a period of 5 years. Complications of this procedure occurred in 41 bitches and included gastric ulceration, recurring pro-oestrus and neoplastic transformation of the transplant.","1321":"Afrikaner bulls (n = 30) between 9,5 and 15 months old, were allocated to 2 dietary treatments fed ad libitum. Diet 1 consisted of 70% concentrate and 30% Eragrostis curvula hay (11,4 MJ ME kg-1 DM) and Diet 2 of 40% concentrate and 60% E. curvula hay (9,3 MJ ME kg-1 DM). Five libido tests were conducted per bull between the ages of 16 and 28 months. Bulls were pre-stimulated for 10 min by close contact with previously synchronised oestrous heifers. Three bulls were then simultaneously allowed a period of 15 min with 6 heifers. Manifestations of libido were indexed as follows: 1. smelling heifer and definite signs of interest; 2. attempt to mount without erection; 3. mount with erection but no intromission; 4. successful service. Libido values fluctuated highly both within and between bulls. Libido did not improve over the 16 to 28-month age period nor with experience as successive tests were conducted. Bulls on Diet 1 grew significantly faster during the first 7,5 months of the trial, but demonstrated non-significantly higher libido scores. It was concluded that maturation over the 16 to 28-month age period, learning experience and level of feeding had no effect on libido.","1322":"The helminths found in 1,502 necropsied cats were examined. The findings indicated that 65% of the cats were infested. The most prevalent helminths encountered were Ancylostoma tubaeforme (41%), Ancylostoma braziliense (25%), Dipylidium caninum (23%), Toxocara cati (11%), Taenia taeniaeformis (7.7%), Ancylostoma caninum (3.3%), Joyeuxiella fuhrmanni (2.5%), Ancylostoma ceylanicum (1.4%), and Physaloptera praeputialis (1.3%). The following helminths were recorded in fewer than 1% of the cats: Centrorhynchus spp., Pterygodermatites spp., Toxocara canis, Aleurostrongylus abstrusus and Vogeloides spp., This is the first record of the lungworms, A. abstrusus and Vogeloides spp. in cats in the Republic of South Africa. The helminths in adult and juvenile cats are compared. Of the cestodes, Joyeuxiella fuhrmanni (4%) and Taenia taeniaeformis (12%) are more prevalent in adult cats. Dipylidium caninum is marginally more common in adults (24%), and is the most common helminth in juvenile cats, being present in 21% of cases. More adult cats have Ancylostoma tubaeforme (58%), Ancylostoma braziliense (36%), Ancylostoma ceylanicum (2.4%) and Physaloptera praeputialis (1.9%) than do juvenile cats. However, juvenile cats were found to harbour more Toxocara cati (41%), Toxocara canis (0.5%) and Ancylostoma caninum (5.2%). Juvenile cats harbour appreciable numbers of both cestodes and nematodes, thus any treatment should be aimed at the elimination of both, with a broad spectrum anthelmintic.","1323":"Investigation into an outbreak of suspected photosensitivity in Boer goats grazing green oats (Avena sativa) led to the finding of microscopical parenchymal crystaloid material and biliary microliths in the livers of 3 ewes that were killed for necropsy. Neither Tribulus terrestris nor Panicum spp. occurred on the farm. Further investigation resulted in the isolation, from leaf spots on the oat leaves, of the fungus Drechslera campanulata, cultures of which have been shown to be highly toxic to sheep, goats and calves. The hepatic parenchymal crystalloid material, which did not invoke any inflammatory reaction, occurred intracellularly in hepatocytes and extracellulary in sinusoids and central veins. Histochemically, this material reacted positively for calcium and free fatty acids and ranged from nonbirefringent, grey spicules to birefringent, glass-like sheaved crystals. A distinctive feature in the livers of the 3 goats was the presence of periductal concentric fibrosis and cast-like biliary microliths which occasionally contained a core of birefringent crystalloid material morphologically and histochemically different from that seen in the parenchyma. An aetiological relationship between the presence of highly toxic D. campanulata isolates on green oats and the hepatopathy with biliary microliths and calcium-free fatty acid crystalloids is possible.","1324":"A survey of erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was undertaken in a herd of crossbred cattle after 3 cases of white muscle disease had been diagnosed. All animals examined, appeared to be deficient in selenium, relative to control animals sampled. Oral administration of sodium selenite or sodium biselenite was followed within 30 d by an increase in erythrocyte GPx activity. Despite an apparent improvement in the selenium status of cows after supplementation with selenium, no difference was seen in the conception rate after artificial insemination.","1325":"","1326":"","1327":"A review is given of available literature on a new antimicrobial agent, enrofloxacin. The chemical is a quinolone carboxylic acid derivative, and has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as against Mycoplasma spp. in various animals. Several formulations and routes of administration have been tested, and equally good absorption and efficacy have been demonstrated after oral and parenteral administration. In South Africa, a 10% solution for use in the drinking water of poultry, has been registered, while different formulations for other species are still under development.","1328":"The number of ticks collected over a period of one year from cattle at 4 altitude levels in Natal, Republic of South Africa, are plotted against meteorological and seasonal data. Collections were made from both traditional and commercial cattle at each altitude. Most of the economically important tick species show clear seasonal patterns of activity. This suggests that strategic dipping could be used as a means of control.","1329":"Virulence assays in guinea-pigs, mice and sheep with a Rev. I mutant strain (FSA) demonstrated that the latter had increased virulence in comparison with a reference strain. The mutant showed slower clearance in guinea-pigs and mice when compared with standard Rev. I strains and horizontal transmission was achieved in 2 sheep.","1330":"Physiological haematological and blood biochemical parameters were studied in Canaan dogs (n = 8) as possible indices of fitness. These parameters were then used to distinguish between fit and unfit dogs and to monitor the changes in these parameters during training and detraining periods. Fitness was defined as the ability to run for one hour on a motorised treadmill (speed 8.65 km h-1, inclination 10 degrees) while maintaining rectal temperature and heart rate below 41 degrees C and 250 beats min-1 respectively. Fit dogs showed consistently lower values of heart rate and rectal temperature during exercise and recovery, and significantly lower increases for post exercise plasma creatine kinase activity and plasma lactate concentration. Significantly higher values for haemoglobin concentration were found immediately post exercise. There were no significant differences between fit and unfit dogs for post exercise plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, white blood cell count or total protein, although the unfit dogs showed a tendency towards higher values. Similarly, unfit dogs tended to have lower values for plasma glucose concentration, haematocrit and red cell count. Values for heart rate and rectal temperature during exercise differed significantly between various dogs until numbers fell, due to the inability of certain dogs to complete the exercise test. Dogs were consistent according to whether their values lay above or below the mean value for all dogs. These differences disappeared after 8 weeks of training. Fitness deteriorated after 3 to 5 weeks of detraining. According to these results, heart rate and rectal temperature appear to be the most suitable and sensitive indicators of fitness in tracking dogs. The haematological and blood biochemical parameters tested were found to be of limited use. It is suggested that apparent inherent superiority of dogs should be accounted for in prospective breeding programmes.","1331":"Monthly samples of the testes of the vespertilionid bat, Scotophilus borbonicus were collected, sectioned and examined by light microscopy. Spermatogenesis was prolonged and extended over 8 months, coinciding with spring, summer and autumn. During any particular month only certain spermatogenic cells are present in the seminiferous tubules. The mediastinum is, unlike that of most other mammals, situated towards the caudal border of the testis. This species is eminently suited for the study of the process of spermatocytogenesis.","1332":"The efficacy of 3 kinds of alphamethrin-impregnated ear tags was tested against natural Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi infestations of cattle. One type of ear tag was also tested in combination with a tail band of similar material. Ticks were counted macroscopically on their predilection sites. Counts of B. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus, and R. e. evertsi on all trial animals diminished steadily during the first 7d after application of the devices. Counts on untreated control cattle had returned to their pre-treatment levels by Day 14 in the case of B. decoloratus, and by Day 21 for R. appendiculatus. R. e. evertsi did not regain their pre-treatment numbers during the trial period on the controls, but did so on one of the treated groups. This temporary drop could be interpreted as being the result of pyrethroid contamination from the hands of the investigators at the time of applying the ear tags, but did not interfere with the assessment of the effect of the tags. None of the forms of treatment showed acceptable efficacy against B. decoloratus. Ear tags alone were not very effective against R. e. evertsi, but the numbers of these ticks on the perineum were diminished by the use of tail bands. Two kinds of ear tags showed superior efficacy against R. appendiculatus, and in the case of these, one ear tag appeared to be as effective as two. The effect against A. hebraeum was evidently influenced by the distribution of the impregnated devices. Two types of ear tags were used alone and had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1333":"Angora goat kids from the eastern Cape Province with natural infestations of Ostertagia circumcincta, Nematodirus spathiger, and Trichostrongylus rugatus were treated with albendazole, fenbendazole or morantel citrate, while a fourth group remained an untreated control group. The benzimidazoles were less than or equal to 50% effective against O. circumcincta, and approximately 50% effective against possibly resistant fourth larval stage N. spathiger. To confirm the diagnosis of anthelmintic resistance in the O. circumcincta, infective larvae (L3) were cultured from the faeces of the kids prior to treatment, and passaged through a donor sheep. Thereafter 2 groups each of sheep and goats were infested artificially with these parasites, and one group of each animal species was drenched with albendazole at 4.75 mg kg-1 in a second trial. The remaining groups were kept as untreated controls. This treatment was less than 5% effective in both sheep and goats, confirming the resistance of this isolate of O. circumcincta to benzimidazoles in both host species.","1334":"","1335":"The clinical, radiological and anatomical changes in a 6 1\/2-month-old Fox Terrier bitch with congenital malformation and variation of the lumbar vertebrae are described. The dog has 5 lumbar vertebrae and the first lumbar vertebra was malformed resulting in a dorsal hemivertebra, kyphosis and spinal cord compression. The possible pathogenesis of the dorsal hemivertebra is mentioned.","1336":"The clinical findings, treatment and pathological changes are described in a case of suspected vetch (Vicia benghalensis L.) poisoning in a Friesland cow in the Clanwilliam district, Republic of South Africa. These were characterised by a severe pruritic dermatitis, granulomatous myocarditis and a nephritis.","1337":"Persistent truncus arteriosus is a relatively rare cardiac anomaly which is associated with a single large artery arising from the ventricles. An interventricular septal defect is invariably present. The vessel gives origin to the pulmonary trunk, aorta and coronary arteries. A description of the angiocardiographic diagnosis of this condition is given as well as a general review of the relative developmental anatomy.","1338":"A fifteen-year-old thoroughbred gelding with exophthalmos of the left eye, was found at necropsy to have an adenocarcinoma of the left frontal sinus. The tumour extended caudally through the cribriform plate into the orbit, displacing the eyeball anteriorly.","1339":"The effects of nutrition, breed and sex on the incidence of mortalities and of skin tears on broiler carcasses were studied. Both sexes of 2 breeds, Hubbard and Ross, were given 4 dietary treatments consisting of a normal level of vitamin and mineral premix plus 300 ppm furazolidone, twice normal premix inclusion level plus 300 ppm furazolidone, a normal level of vitamin and mineral premix, and twice normal mineral premix inclusion level. A coccidiostat containing the active ingredient halofuginone was included at 6 ppm, twice the recommended dosage. Starter, grower and finisher diets were fed respectively up to Day 20, Day 30 and Day 48. Group growth performances, mortalities and the incidence of torn skin were monitored on both the live birds and carcasses. The effect of the different nutritional treatments on skin tears was not significant (P = 0.9533), as was the breed effect (P = 0.0547). However, the effect of sex was significant (P = 0.0044), the incidence in hens being higher. Mortalities among the Hubbard were significantly greater than among the Ross (P = 0.0001). Hens showed a slightly higher mortality rate than roosters, tending towards significance at the 5% level (P = 0.0554).","1340":"A 5-year-old mixed breed dog was presented with a history of depression and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a pharyngeal tumour and a neurological examination indicated the presence of a possible space-occupying lesion in the brain. Investigative procedures included a bloodsmear, impression smears and cytology of the pharyngeal tumour, haematology, chemical pathology, faecal analysis, urinalysis, electrocardiography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, hormone assays and a computerised axial tomography scan. Results of these investigations revealed a round cell tumour in the pharynx, hypergammaglobulinaemia (34 g l-1), azotaemia (urea 8.6 mmol l-1 and creatinine 170 mumol l-1), hypoalbuminaemia (20 g l-1), proteinuria, sinus bradycardia (heart rate 60 beats per min), increased concentration of protein in the CSF (1.1 g l-1), hypoadrenocorticism (base line cortisol less than 55 nmol l-1) and hypothyroidism (T4 less than 13 nmol l-1). The computerised axial tomography scan revealed a brain tumour in the region of the hypophysis. The dog was euthanased and a post mortem examination confirmed the presence of a pharyngeal tumour with apparent direct extension of the tumour into the brain. Both tumours were confirmed histologically as mastocytomas.","1341":"In bulls (n = 2,437) examined by preputial sheath washes, 7.1% were found to be positive for trichomoniasis. The incidence varied from one area to the other, as well as between breeds.","1342":"Brucellosis testing was carried out in the Moretele and Odi districts of Bophuthatswana. The cattle tested were heifers and cows over 18 months of age (n = 3,374) which grazed on communal tribal lands under extensive ranching conditions. Fifty (1.48%) animals were tested positive with a CFT titre of 30iu ml-1 or higher.","1343":"A short description of the chromosome analysis of the lion, Panthera leo, is given. The chromosome number was found to be 38. The chromosomes can be divided into six groups, which consist of submetacentric, metacentric and acrocentric chromosomes.","1344":"A case of sustained supraventricular tachycardia of unknown aetiology in a two-year-old Thoroughbred filly is reported. The cardiac dysrhythm was successfully treated by the oral administration of quinidine sulphate. Conversion of the dysrhythm to sinus rhythm occurred approximately 80 min after the initial dose of 5 g of quinidine sulphate. The horse returned to training approximately 2 months after treatment and has since successfully returned to racing.","1345":"Plasma calcium, phosphorus and magnesium concentrations were determined in ewes and their single and twin lambs from birth for 120 days in Merino, Dohne Merino and South African Mutton Merino sheep. Mineral concentrations as well as the plasma calcium: phosphorus ratio were compared between breeds. Throughout the experimental period, plasma calcium and phosphorus concentrations were higher in both single and twin lambs than in the ewes of all 3 breeds. No breed differences in plasma calcium concentrations were found. Animals of the S.A. Mutton Merino breed had significantly higher (P less than 0.05) plasma phosphorus concentrations than the other 2 breeds. The plasma Ca:P ratio in the Merino and Dohne Merino ram lambs was approximately 1.1:1 and in the S.A. Mutton Merino 0.9:1. This converse plasma Ca:P ratio found in both the S.A. Mutton Merino ewes and lambs is believed to result in an induced plasma ionised calcium deficiency which leads to improper calcification of bone. This is believed to be a contributing factor in the bent-leg syndrome. No difference was recorded in body mass between ram lambs suffering from the bent-leg syndrome and unaffected ram lambs. Plasma magnesium concentrations were not affected by breed or age of the animals.","1346":"The macro- and microscopic changes of the testes caused by molybdenum as well as a molybdenum plus sulphate induced copper deficiency were investigated in S.A. Mutton Merino rams. Judged on testes measurements, the testes development of rams suffering from a severe copper deficiency was slower (P less than or equal to 0.05) when compared with rams in the control group. Histological examinations of the testes of the rams which suffered from a severe copper deficiency revealed that the seminiferous tubules were less developed and less active than those of the control group. This was mainly due to the inactivity of the Sertoli cells. Where rams suffered from a copper deficiency, the Sertoli cells contained only a small volume of cytoplasm. The typical fingerlike cytoplasmic evaginations of the Sertoli cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules were absent while the nuclei of these cells were darkly stained, in some cases even pycnotic. Spermatocytogenesis was normal because primary spermatocytes with dark stained thread-like chromatin were observed in most of the seminiferous tubules. The process of spermiogenesis (metamorphic phase) did not take place. This can be accounted for by the inactivity of the Sertoli cells.","1347":"","1348":"The influence of molybdenum and molybdenum plus sulphate-induced copper deficiencies on semen quality and peripheral plasma testosterone concentrations in South African Mutton Merino rams was investigated. All animals received an identical ration, supplemented with molybdenum in one group (M) and molybdenum plus sulphate in another (MS) while the control group (C) received additional copper supplementation. After almost a year on these rations, rams in Group MS produced ejaculates of lower volume, lower sperm concentration, poorer sperm motility and morphology than rams of the other 2 groups. The fructose concentration in the ejaculates of group MS rams was also lower than that of rams in the other groups. Peripheral plasma testosterone concentrations in Group MS were lower than in Groups C or M. Liver copper concentrations and clinical signs were consistent with a severe copper deficiency in Group MS and a mild deficiency in Group M. After the copper deficiency was reversed, the above parameters reverted to normal. It was concluded that an experimentally induced copper deficiency produced reversible impairment of testicular function in rams.","1349":"The aim of the study was to gather demographic information from consulting clients, to compile a profile of the typical companion animal client in South Africa. This method differed from other studies in that information was collected from actual clients and not from pet owners. Completed questionnaires (n = 612) were received back from veterinary practices (n = 120) in South Africa. The data was processed by a computer. Questionnaires were completed on a voluntary basis and were anonymous. The typical client in this survey was a young married woman, with one or two children, living in a suburban home, with an average income and 2 companion animals. The most common companion animal presented, proved to be a miniature breed of dog. The advantage of this study is that veterinarians may use it to prepare themselves in terms of the most common type of client as well as of a variety of other types. The client profile also gives an indication of the level at which consultations should be conducted, and may aid the veterinarian in developing a specific sensitivity towards certain clients.","1350":"Antibiograms are only as reliable as is permitted by the quality of the specimen, the reliability or reproducibility of the method used and the ability of the clinician to interpret the results. Non-standardised methods may give erroneous results. Some of these procedural effects were investigated by means of statistical analysis of variance to determine the effect on the reliability of the test. To ensure reliable and reproducible test results with antibiograms, it is imperative that the type of sensitivity test medium as well as the density of the inoculum of the test organisms be standardised.","1351":"","1352":"","1353":"From the literature it has been established that pets can fulfill specific functions with regard to their owners. The purpose of this investigation is to highlight the interaction which takes place between pet owners and their pets as observed during consultations with veterinarians. The emphasis is however on the meaning of the emotional content of the interaction rather than on the actual functioning of the interaction. The interactions were monitored by means of natural observation, information gained through the completion of questionnaires, information about the client obtained from the veterinarian and content analysis of taped conversations which took place during consultations. The results indicate that the interaction between a pet owner and a pet is one of need fulfillment. Content analysis indicated that the owners attempt to fulfill certain needs through their pets, or conversely attempt to project their own emotions onto their pets. Loneliness and aggression are typical examples of this. A veterinarian who is able to identify his client's emotional needs, can alleviate his problems by giving unconditional support, referring the client with serious emotional problems to a psychologist or consulting a psychologist on behalf of the client.","1354":"Digoxin was administered to dogs (n = 10) in congestive heart failure, at an oral dosage rate of 0.01 mg kg-1 lean body mass twice daily. Lean body mass was determined by reducing gross mass by the estimated degree of ascites and body fat. The dose was further adjusted for factors such as renal and hepatic function, the bioavailability of different formulations, and the size of the patient. Trough and peak serum digoxin concentrations were determined after 10 days of digitalisation, or when signs of toxicity became apparent. Serum digoxin concentrations in 6 of the 10 dogs were found to be partially or completely in the toxic or subtherapeutic range. This indicates that an oral digoxin dosage rate of 0.01 mg kg-1 lean body mass administered twice daily, even when adjusted appropriately for factors that affect digoxin pharmacokinetics, provides no more than a rough approximation of the precise dose required to provide serum digoxin concentrations within the therapeutic range. The observations also lend support to a recent recommendation that the digoxin dosage rate should be based on body surface area, although even when administered on this basis, serum digoxin concentrations outside of the therapeutic range could be anticipated.","1355":"This paper contains a review of the formal research being done on the diseases and parasitic infestations of wild animals by universities and the state as well as other institutions in this part of the African continent. It is clear that most information obtained in this research is of an epidemiological or ecological nature and that ungulates, which form the bulk of the game-farming industry, are receiving the most attention. An analysis of the 20 most important diseases, which cover 6 disciplines, revealed that most of the research is being done for the benefit of livestock rather than wildlife. Seventeen of these diseases can be regarded as indigenous and 3 as being exotic to this part of Africa. Arguments are provided in favour of the concept that our game is genetically endowed, by virtue of centuries of adaptation, to handle the indigenous diseases, if their resistance is not compromised. None of the indigenous diseases constitute a threat to game populations, and hence no research on them is justified from an economic point of view. What is, however, absolutely essential, is research on game management with particular reference to those ecological factors which enable game on game-fenced farms to lead the sort of lives to which they are adapted. If this approach is not followed, further destruction of the habitat and deterioration of genetic disease resistance seem inevitable.","1356":"The biochemical reactions leading to the formation of eicosanoid compounds are reviewed. Arachidonic acid and similar homologous polyunsaturated acids are shown to be important precursors of these compounds. The partitioning of precursors between the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase enzyme systems leads to the prostanoid\/thromboxane\/prostacyclin and leukotriene families groups are reviewed. The mechanism of action of the prostacyclin group is briefly discussed.","1357":"The post-weaning diarrhoea syndrome (PWDS) in piglets is multi-factorial in origin. Numerous managemental, environmental, housing, nutritional, immunological and physiological factors are discussed, being primary factors in the cause of the PWDS. Infectious agents especially Escherichia coli are often incriminated as causes of PWDS but are more likely to be opportunistic elements due to faulty management of stressed animals.","1358":"Haemophilus (Actinobacillus) pleuropneumoniae is a primary and specific pathogen of the respiratory tract and is an economically important pathogen of pigs. The disease is starting to cause peracute deaths in South Africa and the chronic form leads to deteriorating heard performance. This review highlights various aspects of the taxonomic, antigenic, and drug sensitivity characteristics of the bacterium and the epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, serology and immunology, detection and diagnosis, differential diagnosis, prevention and control of the disease.","1359":"Daily fractional water turnover rate (i.e. that proportion of total body water which is exchanged daily) was determined in S.A. Mutton Merino sheep (n = 6) under thermoneutral conditions by direct measurement of total water intake and by the tritiated water dilution technique. No significant difference between direct and indirect methods was observed in any of the animals. Tritiated water space estimated from a plasma sample taken at 6 h after tritium administration in general overestimated this compartment when compared with values derived from the zero time intercept of the linear regression analysis obtained for each animal.","1360":"","1361":"Resorantel at a dosage rate of 130 mg kg-1 live body mass was found to be highly effective against Houttuynia struthionis in ostriches when dosed alone or in combination with fenbendazole or levamisole.","1362":"Amitraz at a concentration of 2 ml litre-1 of water successfully induced detachment of Amblyomma marmoreum and Amblyomma hebraeum ticks from the mountain tortoise, Geochelone pardalis. Detached ticks died without reattaching. At the strength used, amitraz had no apparent adverse effects on the tortoises.","1363":"The anthelmintic efficacy of resorantel against Thysaniezia giardi and Avitellina spp. was tested in sheep at a dosage rate of 65 mg kg-1 live mass. The reduction obtained was 100% in at least 80% of the treated flock.","1364":"While fenbendazole at 15 mg kg-1 either alone or in combination with resorantel reduced the total burden of Libyostrongylus douglassi by more than 98%, levamisole alone at 30 mg kg-1 was only 28% effective, and in combination with resorantel its efficacy was 67%. These results with levamisole do not correspond with the registered rate of efficacy which is given as at least 80% in South Africa. This is apparently the first reported case of anthelmintic resistance in ostriches.","1365":"Merino ewe lambs (n = 500) were used in a trial to assess the efficacy of cypermethrin in preventing blowfly strike on sheep. Three hundred of these lambs were treated with 300 mg cypermethrin each and run as a separate flock. One hundred lambs were used as untreated controls and a further 100 lambs were treated topically with a larval growth regulator as treated control animals. It was found that the synthetic pyrethroid afforded total protection for 3 weeks against strike by Lucilia cuprina. The blowfly challenge was heavy, and 26% of the untreated control animals were struck in the 4 week trial period.","1366":"Ill-thrift in sheep in the coastal region of the Eastern Cape is described. It is shown to be a complex problem attributable to many causes, most of which can be eliminated by supplementary feeding, drenching, vaccination, dipping and management. However, studies on the aetiology of ill-thrift in young sheep indicate that arthropod-borne anaemia-producing pathogens are an important contributing factor, which cannot readily be diagnosed and controlled. Experiments were conducted on various farms to determine whether Eperythrozoon ovis occurred in sheep in the coastal areas of the Eastern Cape and to what extent infection affected these animals. Other blood parasites found in sheep in the Eastern Cape included Borrelia theileri, Anaplasma ovis, Ehrlichia ovina, Cytoecetes phagocytophila and Theileria ovis. E. ovis, either alone or in combination with one or more of these parasites, caused a severe prolonged anaemia accompanied by the development of ill-thrift.","1367":"With the exception of October, when no collections were made, adult ticks were collected at weekly intervals from February 1986 to January 1987 from 20 randomly selected sheep out of a flock of 60. Ixodes rubicundus was the most abundant tick and was present from April to September with a peak during May. Hyalomma marginatum rufipes was the next most numerous tick. It was recovered throughout the year with peak burdens being recorded from November to April. Small numbers of a Rhipicephalus sp. (near R. pravus) were also collected. These exhibited a major peak during February and a minor peak during August. A dipping programme to prevent the paralysis caused by I. rubicundus and the Rhipicephalus sp. (near R. pravus) is suggested.","1368":"Farmers who regularly experience wet carcass syndrome tend to farm on a more extensive scale and apply insufficient management practices evidenced by poor recordkeeping, lower sheep handling frequency and inefficient grazing management. Overgrazing and deterioration of natural pastures are aggravated by drought conditions. Feeding of supplements or the provision of a salt lick is unrelated to wet carcass syndrome. Nor can any connection between transport to and distance from the abattoir, type of feeding in the holding pens, withholding of drinking and overhydration before slaughter to the incidence of wet carcass syndrome be demonstrated. The susceptibility for the development of this condition most probably occurs while the live animal is still on the farm.","1369":"Specimens from parotid salivary glands of full-grown elephant (Loxodonta africana) a (n=6) and saliva aspirated from their main excretory ducts were examined macroscopically and microscopically and analyzed biochemically. The composition of the saliva was compared to that of the blood. The parotids (n=12; mean = 7.4 kg) are homocrine and of a seromucous nature. Myoepithelial cells are well-developed along intercalated ducts and their processes extend to proximal portions of allied acini. The saliva is hypotonic and contains relatively low concentrations of sodium and glucose and high concentrations of potassium, urea, calcium and phosphorus. Absence of detectable levels of alpha-amylase negates a digestive role and the voluminous secrete evidently aids swallowing by moisturising and lubricating the large mass of ingested leaves, grass and bark.","1370":"","1371":"","1372":"","1373":"","1374":"","1375":"The effects of age, training, racing and endurance riding on serum enzyme profiles in the horse are reviewed and discussed.","1376":"Blood samples were collected on a random basis from 2 canine populations. A selection of serum enzymes, serum electrolytes, serum protein fractions and serum concentrations of iron, creatinine and urea were investigated in a population of kennelled dogs and a population of dogs from a rural township in a developing country. Significant differences between the 2 populations were found for 16 of the 26 constituents evaluated, although differences in variance and distribution made comparisons difficult for some of the tests. The dogs from the rural township had a low mean serum iron, a very low mean serum albumin and a very high mean serum gammaglobulin concentration compared to that of the kennelled dogs. It is postulated that these differences were caused by environmental factors of a biological, physical and social nature.","1377":"Venous whole-blood samples for the determination of lead concentrations were obtained from hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibius) (n = 26) during a population control programme on the banks of the Sabie River. A mean blood lead concentration of 26.3 micrograms l-1 was lower than the mean concentration of 34.0 micrograms l-1 cited for a group of young people living in a remote area where lead pollution was considered to be negligible. These concentrations indicate that lead pollution in this area of the Kruger National Park is at present low.","1378":"The effect of different pre-slaughter rest periods at the abattoir before slaughter on the blood biochemical parameters and meat pH of a number of cattle were studied on 2 occasions, once in summer and once in winter. In the first trial, 42 out of a consignment of 50 and in the second trial, 45 out of a consignment of 54 feedlot-finished oxen were randomly selected and divided into 3 groups each. One group was slaughtered on arrival at the abattoir, a second group 3 h after arrival and the third group was rested in the lairage prior to slaughter the following day. Carcasses were subjected to low voltage electrical stimulation at slaughter. Significant differences between the values obtained at the feedlot and those at the abattoir were found in respect of haematocrit, total plasma protein concentration, plasma glucose, plasma creatine kinase, plasma lipid and cortisol concentration in both the trials. In general, however, no great differences were found between the 3 groups in either of the trials. If any, results in respect of some of the blood parameters were in favour of the groups slaughtered as soon as possible after arrival at the abattoir. No significant differences were found in the initial (35-45 min) and ultimate (24 h) pH of the meat between the 6 groups of slaughtered animals in the 2 trials. Exsanguination appeared to be satisfactory in all groups and no differences between groups were found. It was concluded that feedlot cattle transported to an abattoir over a relatively short distance, need not necessarily be rested in the lairage overnight before slaughter.","1379":"The first cynological study in South Africa was done in 1976. To establish possible new tendencies in dog ownership, the study was repeated a decade later. The questionnaire included questions on breed, nutrition, care, reproduction, behaviour, training and replacement, and the information was gathered by door to door visits. External factors such as the need for specific breeds for specific situations (security, economics) in the country, availability of reading matter about dogs, the convenience of commercial dog foods, the growing tendency for mothers to enter into fixed employment, campaigns against undesired breeding, improved veterinary services, reports on canine heroism in the media, could all have influenced the patterns of dog ownership. The awareness of these tendencies could be of importance to the companion animal veterinarian.","1380":"Trichomonas foetus was demonstrated in 23\/87 (26.4%) and Campylobacter fetus in 25\/87 (28.7%) of bulls tested in Transkei. A total of 16\/87 (18.39%) of bulls tested were positive for both Trichomonas foetus and Campylobacter fetus. Bulls from 14 sites in Transkei were tested and Trichomonas foetus was isolated at 9 of these sites. Campylobacter fetus was isolated at 10 of the 14 sites. The results indicate that both Trichomonas foetus and Campylobacter fetus are widespread throughout the cattle population in the Republic of Transkei and may account for infertility problems.","1381":"The veins draining the ileocaecal junctions of horses (n = 19), donkeys (n = 3) and a plains zebra, (Equus burchelli antiquorum) were injected with latex via the ileocolic vein, and dissected. In all specimens the ileocaecal papilla was drained by 2 major papillary veins: one cranial and one caudal to the papilla. A smaller dorsal vein drained either into the cranial or into the caudal vein. The submucosal veins seemed to increase in number in the ileocaeacal junction to form a venous plexus. This plexus, together with veins from the caecum and the distal ileum immediately bordering the ileocaecal junction, drained either into the cranial or the caudal veins of the papilla. In 14 specimens both the cranial and caudal veins drained into a common vein, which opened into the V. caecalis lateralis in 10 specimens or into the R. ilei mesenterialis in 4 specimens. In 3 specimens the 2 veins opened separately into the V. caecalis lateralis. In 2 specimens the cranial vein opened into the V. caecalis lateralis, while the caudal vein drained into the R. ilei mesenterialis.","1382":"Bacterial infection is often overlooked as an aetiological factor in small animal dermatology. The misuse of glucocorticoids may result in immunosuppression in the patient. Pyoderma may then become refractory to all forms of therapy. The impression smear is a simple technique to confirm a pyoderma. Empirical selection of antimicrobial agents is acceptable for initial therapy of uncomplicated pyoderma. Appropriate antibiotics must be used at therapeutic doses for extended periods. Primary pyoderma is caused by pathogenic bacteria alone. The underlying cause in secondary pyodermas must be eliminated in order to prevent recurrence.","1383":"Various forms of clinical and subclinical mastitis occur in the bovine, and intramammary therapy alone or in combination with parenteral therapy must be implemented with due consideration of udder pathology and the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs used for the treatment of mastitis. Supportive therapy for cows with acute or peracute mastitis and optimal animal husbandry are of the utmost importance for a relatively good prognosis. The withholding period of milk for human consumption after the last intramammary antibiotic treatment as well as minimum intervals between antibiotic dry cow treatment and calving are given. The main reasons for mastitis therapy failure are udder pathology caused by the inflammatory process, the pharmacokinetic properties of mastitis drugs under those conditions, inadequate supportive therapy and poor animal husbandry.","1384":"The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a reservoir host of Theileria parva lawrencei the causative organism of Corridor or buffalo disease of cattle. This organism can apparently transform its behaviour when tick-passaged through cattle to resemble that of Theileria parva parva, causing classic East Coast fever (ECF). These are major considerations for the strict quarantine measures imposed on buffaloes from Corridor disease endemic areas in South Africa. Results of continuing studies on diagnosis, chemotherapy, transmission and attempts to transform the behaviour of T.p. lawrencei in the laboratory, are discussed.","1385":"The use of Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) and other essential fatty acid (EFA) metabolites in malignant cancer treatment in vitro and in vivo is briefly reviewed. Treatment of two dogs with multicentric lymphoma with large empirical daily doses of a combination of 40 mg gamma linolenic acid, 350 mg linoleic acid and 10 mg natural vitamin E per capsule resulted, after approximately one week, in slight to marked reduction in size of enlarged peripheral lymph nodes, spleen, skin nodules and tonsils. Both animals showed transient improved habitus and appetite, but deteriorated due to complications, apparently unrelated to therapy.","1386":"","1387":"","1388":"A female lion cub about 5 months old from a litter raised artificially in a lion park, was euthanased and necropsied. The history was one of poor growth, lameness, a reluctance to move and skeletal malformations with disproportionately large head and feet. The cub had been fed meat and milk supplemented with calcium and vitamins. All the bones in the body were exceptionally soft and flexible. The long bones, vertebrae and ribs were easily split in half with a knife. The scapulae were deformed and medially curved. The long bones were shorter and thicker in diameter than normal, with very thin cortices. Numerous pathological fractures exhibiting minimal callus formation were present. The ribs were rounded, abnormally curved and very short in comparison to the length of costal cartilages. Radiographically, a marked osteoporosis was observed. Histopathological examination revealed a severe diffuse fibrous osteodystrophy with very little bone present. The osteoid was improperly mineralised and tissue sections for microscopy were cut without any need for prior decalcification. Little space for haemopoietic tissue remained. The lesions were considered consistent with those in animals raised on a diet containing excessive phosphates and low calcium.","1389":"An adult female lion (Panthera leo) with hind- and forequarter paresis and inco-ordination was examined. An initial diagnosis of a vitamin A deficiency was made, but treatment proved ineffective. A radiological examination showed mild pressure on the spinal cord. A tentative diagnosis of trauma to the cervical vertebrae was made. Response to conservative therapy suggested an aetiology of traumatic origin.","1390":"A trial was conducted in an area where organophosphate resistance to the green blowfly of sheep, Lucilia curpina WIED had been reported. Three formulations containing Propetamphos, namely an oil based pour-on, a grease based smear-on, and an emulsifiable concentrate were applied to 300 sheep in an attempt to compare the protection that this insecticide afforded, in preventing progressive blowfly strike. One hundred sheep were furthermore treated with an insecticide growth regulator, Cyromazine as a treated control group and a further 300 sheep were exposed as an untreated control group in order to monitor the level of blowfly strike in the area. It was found that the grease-based formulation protected the animals for 2 weeks against blowfly strike, both the pour-on and the emulsifiable concentrate formulation for 3 weeks, while the insect growth regulator afforded 4 weeks protection. It was concluded that if organophosphate resistant blowfly were present, the length of protection might be dosage related and that blowfly strike in sheep was almost equally controlled by Cyromazine and Propetamphos.","1391":"Gross and microscopical examinations were done in 12 sheep infested with Lucilia cuprina larvae. All the sheep became hyperammonaemic and alkalotic. Six sheep died and 6 survived, one being moribund before euthanasia. Necropsy revealed severe acute dermatitis and congestion of the liver, heart, kidney, spleen and lungs. Ecchymotic haemorrhages were present in the heart, kidneys and adrenal glands of severely infested sheep. Microscopical examination showed mild to severe vacuolation of the central nervous system in all sheep. In severely infested sheep, skin, lung, heart, kidney, and liver tissues were infiltrated by mononuclear cells, neutrophiles or lymphocytes. Fibrin thrombi were present in vessels. Elevated concentrations of lipid soluble ammonia in blood were positively correlated with tissue abnormality and early death.","1392":"The muscle layers of the ileocaecal junctions of horses (n = 18), plains zebras (Equus burchelli antiquorum) (n = 3), mountain zebras (Equus zebra zebra) (n = 2), and a donkey were examined macroscopically and microscopically. The muscular tunic of the ileocaecal papilla was made up of 3 layers: an innermost circular layer which was a continuation of the circular muscle of the ileum, a central longitudinal layer which was a continuation of one part of the longitudinal layer of the ileum and an outermost layer, composed of two collateral semicircular lips, formed by the circular layer of the caecum. The other part of the longitudinal ileal muscle layer contributed to the dorsal caecal taenia. The circular and semicircular muscle layers contributed by the ileum and caecum respectively represented what could be termed as a M. sphincter ilei, which did not exist as a separate annular muscle confined only to the papilla as the name would suggest. The amount of intermuscular connective tissue increased in both these layers towards the tip of the papilla, while at the same time the layers decreased in thickness. This finding supports the view that their sphincteroid action would be less efficient and that an additional closing mechanism of vascular origin may be required at the ileocaecal papilla of the horse.","1393":"Endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides-LPS) and anti-endotoxin IgG antibodies were measured in racehorses before and after races of 1,000, 2,000 and 2,800 m. Results show that the mean plasma concentration of endotoxin increased significantly (p less than 0.02) while the anti-LPS IgG concentration decreased significantly (p less than 0.005) in all horses following the races. Pre-race and post-race anti-LPS IgG levels in racing-fit racehorses were significantly higher than in untrained horses (p less than 0.05). The possibility therefore exists that training-induced stress leads to leakage of LPS into the systemic circulation which results in self-immunisation against LPS. The effects of plasma LPS and anti-LPS IgG concentrations on performance of racehorses require further studies.","1394":"The latest research findings published on the energy and amino acid requirements of dogs and cats are reviewed. Special attention was paid to research results, applicable to working dogs, which have not as yet been incorporated into the recommended requirement standards of the National Research Council.","1395":"In early December 1986 A-equi-2 influenza virus was isolated for the first time in the Republic of South Africa. All horses were susceptible to the highly contagious aerosol-borne orthomyxovirus resulting in widespread outbreaks of equine influenza with typical primary respiratory symptoms. Treatment consisted of rest, anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and good nursing. Future protection can be obtained by vaccination.","1396":"The efficacy of sustained-release ivermectin was evaluated against challenge infestations of gastro-intestinal nematodes in a laboratory study involving 12 treated and 12 untreated control cattle. A weighted, orally administered osmotically activated device designed to lodge in the rumeno-reticulum and to deliver ivermectin at a dosage rate of approximately 8 mg\/day for a 120-day period, was administered to treated cattle. Animals were challenged with infective larvae of Bunostomum phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum approximately 4 weeks, and with Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi, Trichostrongylus axei and Cooperia pectinata approximately 4 and 6 weeks after bolus administration. No parasites were recovered from ivermectin-treated animals, representing 100% efficacy (p less than 0.01) against challenge infestations with larvae of all of the above species. Efficacy against an incidental infestation of Trichuris spp was 92% (p less than 0.01).","1397":"","1398":"","1399":"The approach to the evaluation of a small animal patient with a dermatological condition is discussed with emphasis on systematic methods. The importance of obtaining an adequate history is stressed and the correct performance of screening tests is emphasised. Evidence of the body's reaction to disease or injurious agents is described since it must be recognised. Pruritus and alopecia are two common presenting clinical signs and systematic approaches to eliciting the aetiology of these are proposed.","1400":"Six baboons (Papio ursinus) males were immobilised on five occasions at intervals of two weeks using a combination of ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine. The animals were subsequently successfully electro-ejaculated. No semen was obtained from animals when azaperone was used instead of xylazine, despite the use of a successful standardised method of electrical stimulation.","1401":null,"1402":"","1403":"Paralysis of Angora goat kids caused by adult ticks, which most probably belong to an undescribed species of the Rhipicephalus pravus group, is described. Confirmed cases of paralysis occurred in the south-western Orange Free State between the second half of September and the first half of November as well as during the first half of February. The mean female tick burdens (mean = 21.4) of paralysed Angora kids were significantly higher than those of healthy kids (mean = 4.4). The predilection attachment site of the adult ticks was the ears of the goats. The elephant shrew Elephantulus myurus is a preferred host of the immature stages whereas the scrub hare Lepus saxatilis serves as an important host for the adult ticks.","1404":"A diagnosis of dermatosparaxis in a lamb with clinical signs of extreme skin fragility was based on the gross changes as well as on light and scanning electron microscopical observations. Similar cases had occurred on the same farm during the previous year.","1405":"This paper describes a pilot trial carried out, to investigate the use of progesterone releasing intravaginal device(PRID) in controlled breeding in heifers under South African conditions. PRID's containing progesterone and oestradiol benzoate were employed for oestrus synchronization and reproductive management in ten 18-month-old, well-managed, heifers in a commercial Transvaal highveld dairy herd. PRID's were inserted into the vagina of each animal and removed after 12 days. Oestrus observation was done continuously and on the first observed oestrus the heifers were artificially inseminated once. Oestrus detection continued normally for returns to oestrus. Pregnancy was confirmed by rectal palpation eight weeks after breeding if no return to oestrus had occurred. The incidence of clinical oestrus within 3 days after removal of the PRID's (defined as the oestrus response) was 90%. The conception or pregnancy rate following the first artificial insemination was 77.8%.","1406":"Chlamydiosis was diagnosed in a 3-month-old springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) on a farm where 46 out of 65 springbok died over a period of 3 months. Nervous signs, which included circling, opisthotonus, loss of balance, recumbency and intermittent paddling movements of the legs were seen in lambs and adult animals. Gross lesions consisted of a fibrinous peri- and epicarditis and interstitial nephritis, while the microscopical lesions were characterised by multifocal encephalomyelitis and meningitis, interstitial pneumonia, and vasculitis in the brain, spinal cord and myocardium. Colonies of suspected chlamydial organisms were seen in a few mononuclear cells and tubular epithelium in the kidneys. Ultrastructurally the colonies were composed of 3 morphological types of particles, consistent with the different stages in the life cycle of the chlamydiae.","1407":"A Hansen type I cervical intervertebral disc prolapse was diagnosed in a 16-year-old American Saddler showing clinical signs of paresis and ataxia. An ante-mortem diagnosis was made by means of plain radiographs and a myelogram. The horse was euthanased and the diagnosis confirmed on a post-mortem examination.","1408":"","1409":"The effects of chemical immobilisation on impala (Aepyceros melampus) were investigated. The results indicate that etorphine HCl or Carfentanil should not be used in isolation but that xylazine should be included in the immobilisation \"cocktail\". The highest dose possible, commensurate with safety, should be used in order to minimise time and distance to recumbency. Body temperature should be monitored and if cooling measures are not effective the animal should be aroused. Either diprenorphine HCl alone or in combination with yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine should be used as antidote\/s.","1410":"Bulk tank milk samples which were collected twice with an interval of 2 months from 2103 herds were tested for brucellosis by employing the brucella ring test. Farmers involved were all supplying industrial milk to the National Co-operative Dairies. A questionnaire was circulated to these farmers in which they were asked to indicate how heifer calf vaccination with strain 19 vaccine was practised on their properties. Of the herds tested, 18.1% could be regarded as infected. This figure varied from 8.9% in the Potchefstroom area to 30.9% in the northern districts of the Hoopstad area. An important cause of this rate of infection should be sought in improper calfhood vaccination. At least 9% of the respondents did not practice heifer calf vaccination whilst another 8.1% only commenced with vaccination during 1985 or later. About 12.4% of farmers commenced heifer calf vaccination prior to 1970.","1411":"An examination of the sera of 329 horses for L. pneumophila antibodies revealed a much lower exposure rate than that reported in the United States of America. Further serological investigations of persons closely associated with a sero-positive horse indicated that the horse could not be considered to be a source of infection but that both humans and animals were probably exposed to a common source of infection. The results showed that 192\/329 (58.4%) of the sera tested negative, 114\/329 (34.7%) had end-point titres of 1\/2, 22\/329 (6.7%) end-points of 1\/16 and one an end point of 1\/256 (0.3%). Serological testing of the people closely associated with horses showed that out of 22 people, 3 had a positive end-point titre of 1:64 and only one person showed an end-point titre of 1:256.","1412":"Fifty-two serum samples from dogs with primary renal failure were tested for antibodies to Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Twelve were positive as compared to two positive samples from a control group of 42 dogs. There was a statistically significant difference between these two groups which suggests an association between infection with E. cuniculi and the development of chronic renal disease.","1413":"Ten per cent of a flock of 481 Merino sheep died from suspected lymphosarcoma in the Caledon district, during a period of one year. In 9 sheep the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the tumours. All the sheep and the cattle on the farm were tested for enzootic bovine leukosis using a Bovine Leukemia Glycoprotein Immunodiffusion kit. At the first test 20.5% of the sheep had antibodies to enzootic bovine leukosis. A control programme resulted in a drop in infection rate (3%) within 17 months.","1414":"The structure and function of the canine and feline skin is reviewed. Comparisons in tubular form have been made of certain aspects where confusion may arise.","1415":"Post mortem examination of a dog that died after a spell of respiratory distress revealed about 20 randomly distributed cystic lesions in the lungs. Those examined each harboured 2 light-brownish conical flukes approximately 10 mm in length. Histopathological examination of such a lesion revealed the presence of Paragonimus (lung fluke) embedded in it. The parasite had a typical spiny integument as well as other characteristics typical for the genus. Typical pigmented operculated eggs were embedded in the surrounding tissues. The life cycle of the parasite is briefly discussed.","1416":"Laboratory findings in an adult bull terrier presented with a history of anorexia and weight loss included the following: severe anaemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, Ehrlichia canis morulae in monocytes, hypergammaglo-bulinaemia, a bleeding tendency, icterus and proteinuria. In addition, a high Haemobartonella canis parasitaemia, non-encapsulated yeasts on urinalysis and a localised Demodex canis infestation were present. Treatment for ehrlichiosis was initiated but the dog died. Lesions found were a severe cryptococcal granulomatous pneumonia and cryptococcal colonies in the lungs, bronchial lymph nodes, kidneys, liver, spleen, heart, meninges, eyes and thoracic cavity. In addition, hyphal forms resembling Filobasidiella neoformans, the teleomorph of Cryptococcus neoformans, were seen in lung fine needle aspiration smears, impression smears and lung sections. C. neoformans was cultured from urine, lung and liver. Lung and kidney also yielded Salmonella typhimureum. Cortical atrophy with T-cell depletion of lymph nodes as well as splenic lymphoid follicular atrophy, typical of chronic ehrlichiosis-induced cell mediated immunosuppression, could have predisposed to the fatal disseminated cryptococcis.","1417":"A single vascular connection between the corpus cavernosum penis and the superficial penile vasculature was diagnosed in an 18-month old Holstein bull with a history of acquired failure to maintain penile erection. Previously normal serving ability had been documented. Multiple penile fibropapillomata were also found. The vascular shunt was identified by contrast cavernosography and ligated, and the fibropapillomata excised. The bull returned to normal function within three months after surgery, and no recurrence of either problem had been experienced by 12 months after surgery.","1418":"The Brilliant Black Reduction Test Kit (BR Test), which is widely used to detect antimicrobial residues in milk, was adapted to detect residues in the meat and tissues of slaughter stock. The adaptation consisted of placing kidney and muscle tissue samples into 2.5ml diffusion cups containing 0.4ml media plus Bacillus stearothermophilus spores and brilliant black indicator. A preliminary trial undertaken to test the lower limits of sensitivity of the adapted BR Test to a number of the more common antibiotics used in food animals, was followed by a survey involving 943 pigs slaughtered at one abattoir. Samples were tested from 87 suppliers of which 11 regularly marketed pigs with detectable antimicrobial residues. Most of these pigs came from large pig producing units. Three suppliers marketed pigs with suspicious reactions. No residues could be detected in pigs from the remaining 73 suppliers. The BR Test was found to be a quick, inexpensive, practical screening test which could be utilized for the routine detection of antimicrobial residues in slaughter stock at all South African abattoirs.","1419":"Blood samples were collected on a random basis from two canine populations. The haemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte count, haematocrit, leucocyte count and differential leukocyte count were investigated in a population of kennelled dogs and a population of dogs of a rural township in a developing country. The means of five of the nine haematological parameters evaluated were found to be statistically significantly different between the two groups. It is postulated that these differences were due to the difference in diet, type and severity of disease, parasites present in the population, and to a lesser extent to breed and age differences.","1420":"An outbreak of acute Lantana camara poisoning in cattle is described in which 10 out of 91 animals died. The affected cattle became icteric and voided soft, black faeces. Necropsies were performed on three steers, and the macro- and microscopical changes in their livers and kidneys were compatible with those of L. camara poisoning. Changes were similar in two steers that developed typical signs after being dosed with fresh L. camara collected in the toxic camp.

The seasonal abundance of fleas, lice and ixodid ticks on their hosts is given and the role played by both small and large mammals and some birds in the maintenance of tick populations is described. Factors contributing to severe parasitism of wild animals are listed and the chemical and biological control of ectoparasites of wild animals are discussed.","1432":"A nine-year-old mixed breed dog was presented with a history of mild generalized seizures, weakness, and muscle fasciculations, following periods of excitement and exercise. Investigative procedures included haematology, chemical pathology, faecal analysis, urinalysis, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, hormone assays, computerized axial tomography and scintigraphic imaging. Results of these investigations revealed hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 1.9 mmol l-1, hyperinsulinism (111 muu ml-1) and an amended insulin-glucose ratio of 2643. The glucagon tolerance test was typical for an insulin producing pancreatic islet cell tumour and pancreas scintigraphic imaging revealed focal lesions in the pancreas and liver. Seizures were initially controlled by dietary means and by limiting exercise. Eventual control was obtained by treatment with prednisolone (1 mg kg-1 on alternate days) and diazoxide (10 mg kg-1 in divided doses daily). Post mortem examination confirmed the presence of a pancreatic islet cell adenocarcinoma with hepatic metastasis.","1433":"","1434":"","1435":"","1436":"Serum concentrations of total proteins, albumin, glucose, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, urea, creatinine, total calcium, ionised calcium, total magnesium, sodium chloride, potassium, phosphorus, cortisol, parathormone, 25-hydroxy-VitD3 and insulin as well as the results of haematological investigations in Cape vultures (n = 10) are presented.","1437":"Ketamine hydrochloride was successfully used at a dosage rate ranging from 7.5-28.8 mg kg-1 to immobilise Cape vultures Gyps coprotheres (n = 7).","1438":"Concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, inorganic phosphorus, total calcium, total magnesium, albumin, total protein, cholesterol, urea, creatinine, cortisol as well as the activities of alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were determined in serum specimens collected from 100 free-ranging warthogs Phacochoerus aethiopicus within five minutes after they were killed with a shotgun. Average concentrations for the following chemical constituents were found: sodium (145 mmol l-1), potassium (8.6 mmol l-1), chloride (102.5 mmol l-1), phosphorus (2.31 mmol l-1), calcium (2.93 mmol l-1), magnesium (1.23 mmol l-1), albumin (26.4 g l-1), serum proteins (62.2 g l-1), cholesterol (1.82 mmol l-1) and urea (8.74 mmol l-1).

Considerable variations in the concentrations of the enzymes ALP, LDH, CK, GGT and AST were found as well as in the concentrations of creatinine, bilirubin and iron. This wide variation in results seriously questions the usefulness of similar blood investigations on heterogenous groups of mechanically restrained animals.","1440":"In two consecutive years a total of 3810 calves were inoculated with the Onderstepoort redwater live-blood vaccine, containing attenuated strains of Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis. Twenty calves died 8-13 days later due to B. bigemina-infection. Necropsies were performed on 19 of these animals. In 11 calves the spleen was distinctly smaller than normal and its morphology was distorted, and showed changes of chronic splenitis. Histological lesions in the spleens of 6 of the 11 calves are described. The potentiating effect of the splenic lesions to reduce the ability to contain the vaccine reaction, is discussed.","1441":"Four groups of 12 baboons each were sedated for a period of 3 hours by means of one of 4 anaesthetic treatments. The treatments involved repeated administration of either ketamine or phencyclidine, or initial sedation with one of these followed by pentobarbitone. A number of plasma metabolites were measured at 30 min intervals. With one exception, there were no significant differences between the 4 individual anaesthetic treatments; there was a small, but significant, decrease in plasma calcium (3.4%) in the group receiving phencyclidine followed by pentobarbitone. There were, however, significant changes with time. Plasma inorganic phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in all the groups rose similarly, reaching mean respective increases of 21.8% and 7.7% after 3 hours. In a number of cases divergent time trends were observed between the pair of groups given pentobarbitone and the pair receiving only ketamine or phencyclidine. Pooling the results from each of these pairs of treatment groups doubled the overall group sizes to 24 animals each and enabled significant differences between the divergent time trends to be detected. In the former pair plasma zinc increased (by a maximum of 16.1%) and protein decreased (by a maximum of 4.0%), while in the latter pair alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol levels both increased (up to maximums of 7.8% and 5.2%, respectively). No significant changes with time were found to be attributable to diurnal variation. Some of the changes in plasma metabolite concentrations following anaesthesia are such that due care should be exercised in their determination and interpretation in anaesthetised baboons.","1442":"Teat canal infection (TCI) or colonization, subclinical mastitis (SCM) cases and other forms of intramammary infections (IMI) may persist despite regular post-milking teat disinfection. Spontaneous healing of TCI can occur and this points to the dynamic state of the reactions of TCI etc. Disinfecting teat dipping does not necessarily prevent new TCI and IMI. Teat dipping may, however, be applied with good effect in the prevention of new udder and teat canal infections. Several factors predispose to TCI e.g. poor management, hygiene and animal husbandry.","1443":"The seasonal prevalence of foot abscess affecting Angora and Boer goats in Valley Bushveld in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa was significantly related to the seasonal abundance of adult Amblyomma hebraeum and adult Rhipicephalus glabroscutatum. Angora goats harboured more ticks than Boer goats and also had a greater number of abscessed feet. Larger numbers of ticks and abscesses were recorded on hind feet than on fore feet. There was no significant correlation between rainfall and the occurrence of foot abscess. The seasonal abundance of adult A. hebraeum and adult R. glabroscutatum on several ruminant species at various localities in the Cape Province is described.","1444":"Six cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation in the horse are reported. They were characterised clinically by severe subcutaneous oedema of the head and neck, and clinocopathologically by abnormal partial thromboplastin and prothrombin times, a thrombocytopaenia and an increase in fibrin degradation product concentrations. Various aetiologies played a role in the pathogenesis of the condition including African horsesickness, babesiosis, lymphosarcoma and verminosis.","1445":"","1446":"","1447":"The occurrence, transmission, clinical appearance, histological findings, chromosome studies, immunity, different methods of treatment and the prevention of canine transmissible venereal tumour are reviewed.","1448":"","1449":"The pathological features of biliary atresia in a foal are described. A 4-week-old American Saddler foal was presented for autopsy following an illness characterised by clinical features indicative of hepatic failure. The significant macroscopical lesions occurred in the liver which was extremely enlarged, mottled in appearance and indurated. Bile stasis was evident. Lobular distinction was absent and on sectioning, large bile ducts were absent. A moderate ascites, hydrothorax and hydropericardium and a mild anasarca and intermuscular oedema accompanied the hepatic lesion. The diagnosis of biliary atresia was determined by the histo-pathological features of bile duct proliferation and extensive replacement fibrosis. The condition is compared to extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary atresia of man and evidence is presented for regarding this case to be one of extrahepatic origin.","1450":"Horses receiving a pelleted or cubed dietary supplementation with roughage, have serum inorganic phosphate (SIP) concentrations consistently below an accepted mean of 1,032 mmol l-1 or 3, 1 mg dl-1. Further, it has been reported that the best eight, two-year-old Irish Thoroughbred track performers of 51 horses tested over a 10 month period, had significantly lower SIP concentrations than the worst eight track performers. In an endeavour to assess any nutritive effect on SIP concentrations and also to assess any effect of SIP concentrations on track performance, metabolic blood profiles from 303 horses in training at the Summerveld Training centre in Natal, were evaluated for various blood parameters over a two year period. Of these 303 profiles, 264 were analysed for SIP concentrations. These horses were on three known feeding regimes viz. Feed 1--cube feeding plus hay; Feed 2--oats, wheaten bran and greens plus hay; Feed 3--Mixed feeding regime of feeds 1 and 2; Feed 4--unknown regime. Dry matter intake varied between 2 and 2.5% of estimated bodymass and in the Feed 1 regime, the proportion of cubed supplement in the diet was increased from 30 to 70% as the training programme progressed. Statistical analysis of SIP concentrations showed that horses on the Feed 1 regime had significantly lower SIP concentrations than horses on the other feed regimes. Of the 303 profiles, 224 could be identified with actual races.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1451":"Although the incidence of false negative rose bengal plate test (RBPT) results on sera which were delayed in transit for one to 17 days was greater than 0.65%, up to 7.2% of such reactions occurred in one infected herd. Since no correlation between the incidence of false negative RBPT results and delay in sera in transit could be found, it was postulated that this type of reaction should be attributed to animals in the early incubation stage of the disease or to individual variation in the rate of response to the RBPT; a problem which should resolve itself during consecutive tests. Blood samples taken from herds to be sold at sales or public auctions, however, should all be tested by the complement fixation test. No correlation between the serum agglutination test and complement fixation test results were noted except where serum agglutination test titres exceeded 134 IU ml-1.","1452":"The serum bactericidal activity test was carried out in two groups of 7 calves each suspected to be suffering from pneumonic pasteurellosis. The diagnosis was based on clinical signs, endoscopic examination and bacteriological investigations. The first group of seven calves received oxytetracycline at a dosage rate of 10 mg kg-1 once a day. A second similar group received penicillin at 30,000 IU kg-1 once a day. Results showed that the correlation between antibiograms, serum bactericidal activity and clinical response may be good for oxytetracyclines and poor for penicillin. The serum bactericidal activity test may be a good method to establish effective dosages for certain antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonic pasteurellosis.","1453":"A general introduction detailing background information concerning the term \"disaster\" is presented. A discussion of pertinent legal guidelines and an overview of the possible role of the veterinarian, firstly as a paramedical assistant and secondly as a veterinary public health official, is presented.","1454":"","1455":"","1456":"Adult animals from a known negative and an infected herd were vaccinated with reduced-dose Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine. Since some of these animals developed elevated post-vaccinal blood titres, it is suggested that, when adult vaccination is decided on, such herds should be bled and tested about 4 months after vaccination and thereafter at 2 month intervals. Reactions with complement fixation titres of 392 IU ml-1 or higher on the first test should be taken as positive. During the 2nd and 3rd tests, positive reactions should be taken as less than 98 IU ml-1 and 49 IU ml-1, respectively. After vaccination, an overkill of up to 5%, due to vaccination reactions could be expected. Positive cases might occur up to 9 months after vaccinating an infected herd. On farms selected for adult vaccination suitable calving facilities in isolation, largely facilitate eradication. Lochia samples for the early diagnosis of brucellosis should be collected. Adult vaccination with a reduced dose S 19 vaccine, should be practised on selected, problem herds only, where the owner is fully aware of the consequences of this procedure.","1457":"The International Dairy Federation's (IDF) criteria for classification of subclinical bovine health conditions does not provide a true picture of the health status of the udder. When combining these criteria with the serum albumin levels of milk samples, the IDF's classification of sub-clinical mastitis could be extended to include 8 possible conditions such as normal quarters, septic mastitis, aseptic mastitis, relevant and irrelevant teat canal infection, specific and unspecific hyperalbumingalactia and unspecific cellular reaction. When the bacteriological results of teat canal swab samples were combined with the IDF's standards, these conditions could be scaled down to 4 diagnoses which included normal quarters, aseptic mastitis, teat canal infections, subclinical mastitis and a combination of the latter 2 conditions. When applying the teat canal swabbing technique, up to 16% of quarters classified as normal and 10% as cases of aseptic mastitis according to the IDF's criteria in fact, have TCI. Since classification of the health status of quarters according to the IDF's criteria and with due regard to the bovine serum albumin values of milk, did not include the bacteriological results of the teat canal swab samples, further research must be done to clarify the existence of conditions in the IDF classification. Teat canal infections may result in damage to the udder parenchyma as manifested by the elevated bovine serum albumin content of milk.","1458":"Aspects of professional secrecy as applied to the veterinary profession are examined. The origin and the modern basis of this precept are referred to. Consideration is given to its application in the Veterinary and Paraveterinary Professions Act, the common law liability of the veterinarian employed in industry, the veterinarian negotiating the purchase of a practice, and its application to moral, ethical and contractual obligations. The need to dispense with professional secrecy in emergency situations is examined, as well as an approach for the discussion of clinical cases amongst colleagues, publication of such cases in scientific journals and the application in a situation where a veterinarian is being sued by a client. Professional secrecy is also examined where the veterinarian is employed in the Public Service and where an obligation arises to give evidence in civil and criminal court proceedings.","1459":"","1460":"The importance of essential fatty acids and their supplementation in the diets of obligate carnivores should be an area of concern amongst veterinarians. Certain species of the Felinae have been shown to be obligate carnivores as a result of fatty acid desaturase enzyme deficiencies. Modern dietary practices of processing and pelleting foods can destroy the essential fatty acid (EFA) potency of these foods. Supplementation of the diet with oils high in EFA should be considered, and the possibility of EFA deficiency amongst domestic carnivores should not be overlooked.","1461":"The outline and motivation for a new subject in the veterinary curriculum is given. The pregraduate curriculum is divided into ethology, handling, management and care, breeding, behaviour, nutrition, knowledge of breeds, shows, obedience and training of companion animals, the possible clinical implications of normal breed characteristics, the companion animal market, practice management, the study of the human to animal contact and the specialised application of such contacts.","1462":"A case of bursitis calcarea in a Border Collie showing lameness without acute pain in the right hind leg, is reported. A diagnosis of bursitis calcarea was made on radiological examination. Treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory drugs and rest as far as it was practically possible. After initial improvement, full recovery only took place 2 months after treatment had commenced. Bursitis calcarea is a rare disease which seldom shows clinical signs. As far as could be ascertained, this is the first report of the condition in South Africa.","1463":"The efficacy of a single subcutaneous dose of ivermectin at 300 micrograms\/kg was evaluated against Sarcoptes scabiei in a commercial herd of 146 pigs of which more than 80% were naturally clinically affected with mange. All pigs, except 6 control animals, were treated with ivermectin on Day 0. Scrapings for mite recovery were made from 12 treated animals and 6 controls at the time of treatment and 28 and 42 days later. No mites were recovered from pigs after treatment while live mites were present in scrapings from all control animals. No treated pigs had active lesions at examination on Day 42. The results are discussed in relation to recommendations for a control program for Sarcoptes scabiei in pigs.","1464":"The host preferences of immature and adult Hyalomma marginatum rufipes, Hyalomma marginatum turanicum and Hyalomma truncatum were studied at various localities in the Cape Province. The immature stages of all 3 ticks preferred scrub hares (Lepus saxatilis) as hosts and were recovered from these animals even when few adult ticks were present on large herbivores in the locality. Ground-frequenting birds were also infested, but only with immature H. marginatum rufipes and H. marginatum turanicum. Some small rodents were also infested but only with the immature stages of H. truncatum. The adult ticks preferred Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra), eland (Taurotragus oryx) and cattle. The immature stages of H. marginatum rufipes were most abundant on scrub hares from February to August. Too few adult ticks of this species were recovered to determine their seasonal abundance. The immature stages of H. marginatum turanicum were most abundant on scrub hares during the winter months and the adults were most abundant on scrub hares during the winter months and the adults were most abundant on Cape mountain zebra and eland during summer. Immature H. truncatum were most abundant on scrub hares during February and May, while peak adult burdens were found on zebra and eland during February, August, November and December.","1465":"Response of Dorper sheep to treatment with FSH and PMSG and fertilisation after natural service, natural service following application of PGF2 alpha-containing gel on the posterior os cervix and surgical insemination with fresh semen were evaluated. FSH gave a significantly (P greater than 0.05) better response than PMSG. No significant differences between the different methods of fertilisation were observed.","1466":"The effect of lateral and dorsal recumbency on cardiopulmonary function in six anaesthetised horses were compared. Cardiac output\/kg, stroke volume\/kg, alveolar ventilation, venous admixture, pulmonary shunt and blood-gas values were determined. From lateral to dorsal recumbency cardiac output\/kg decreased non-significantly. A significant increase in pulmonary shunt occurred. A positive correlation between body mass and pulmonary shunt in dorsal recumbency was found. Alveolar ventilation increased significantly in dorsal recumbency when breathing air compared to oxygen.","1467":"","1468":"","1469":"Three dogs with fractures of the body of the axis showing moderate to severe displacement were presented for treatment.

Epidemiological analyses were carried out on all rabies cases reported for the period 1980-1984, with emphasis on the frequency and distribution in domestic and wild animals. A significant increase in reported rabies cases since 1982 was noted, with a greater prevalence in domestic animals contributing to the total increase. Rabies in domestic animals was of major importance in Natal, Gazankulu, KwaZulu, Lebowa, Qwa Qwa and Kangwane. Of all the domestic animal rabies cases reported, canines and bovines accounted for 54.5% and 33% of the cases, respectively. The genus Cynictis accounted for 69% of all the wild animal rabies cases reported. The greatest number of rabies cases were reported in the winter months. A definite seasonal trend was demonstrated with domestic animal rabies reaching a peak during August.","1471":"Live specimens of Bunostomum phlebotomum were collected from the small intestine of a calf and processed for scanning electron microscopy using standard methods. This paper describes the surface morphology of adult worms. All these hookworms showed a dorsally bent anterior end with its buccal capsule, which opens antero-dorsally with a pair of chitinous cutting plates on the ventral margin. Prominent cervical papillae and a well developed male bursa with a dorsal and 2 lateral lobes, were observed. The female tail is slender and pointed with the anal opening close to the tip. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate morphological differences from other hookworms and to obtain more detail of the male bursa and female tail.","1472":"A combination of ketamine at 8.0 mg\/kg and xylazine at 3.2 mg\/kg was found effective in immobilising lions (Panthera leo) for 4 hours. Ataxia and immobilisation were rapidly induced, with stable respiratory rate, heart rate and body temperature recorded. Tolazoline effectively antagonised xylazine via intravenous or intramuscular injection, resulting in a return to mobility within approximately 20 and 60 minutes, respectively. Tolazoline also elevated the respiratory rate. No mortalities occurred during 97 immobilisations of 76 lions.","1473":"In the 427 heifers vaccinated at 12 to 14 months of age with the reduced dose (3 X 10(8) to 1 X 10(9) viable organisms per dose) 3 had antibody titres in the complement fixation test of 196, 688 and 748 IU ml-1, respectively, at 5 months post-inoculation. At 23 to 25 months of age 8\/128 (6.3%) of these heifers had rose bengal test (RBT) reactions, at least 6\/128 (4.7%) a serum agglutination test (SAT) antibody titre in excess of 30 IU ml-1 and 1\/128 had a suspicious reaction in the complement fixation test (CFT) of 30 to 49 IU ml-1. In the 116 heifers inoculated with the standard dose (4 to 12 X 10(10) viable organisms) at 5 to 7 months of age and tested at 22 to 24 months of age, a reactor rate of 37\/116 (31.9%) in the RBT was seen. At least 34\/116 (29.3%) had antibody titres in excess of 30 IU ml-1 in the SAT. Only 1 animal had a suspicious reaction in the CFT of 18 to 24 IU ml-1. No abortions could be attributed to the vaccine strain and no other isolates of the vaccine strain were made. The possible role of vaccine residues in syringes as a cause of persistent reactions is discussed. The use of disposable syringes is recommended. On serological grounds there appears to be little advantage in using the reduced dose vaccine in yearling heifers as opposed to the standard dose vaccination of 5 to 7 month old heifers.","1474":"Fifty ml of a 0.2% iodine solution were instilled into the uteri of six mares selected for culling. Biopsy specimens were taken for microscopic examination before the commencement of the experiment and at various times over the course of a year after the single instillation. Severe oedema and haemorrhage was present in the lamina propria of all the post-instillation biopsy specimens. The epithelium showed vacuolisation and necrosis, as well as focal areas of epithelial loss. In some cases hyperplasia or metaplasia was seen. Cell infiltration was characterized by the presence of neutrophils, eosinophils and mild lymphocyte infiltration around the blood vessels. Leukostasis was present around the blood vessels in some specimens. Blood vessel changes were characterized in the early stages by oedema of the tunica media of the medium-sized arteries and later by arteriosclerosis with the complete obliteration of the lumen of the particular vessels in some cases. The endometrial glands showed hyperplasia and mitotic figures were more often seen in these glands than normal. The most pronounced lesion in the later stage of the experiment was fibrosis of the lamina propria with the resultant collapse of the stratum compactum and contraction of the stratum spongiosum. The severe fibrosis of the endometrium is the most probable reason for infertility in mares treated with iodine.","1475":"Acaricidal treatment of cattle, sheep and goats on a farm in Valley Bushveld in the Grahamstown district resulted in a reduction in the numbers of certain tick species on kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), scrub hares (Lepus saxatilis) and crowned guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) on the same farm. The tick species most severely affected was Amblyomma hebraeum, while Haemaphysalis silacea, Hyalomma marginatum rufipes and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus were affected to a lesser extent. Rhipicephalus glabroscutatum and Rhipicephalus oculatus appeared to be unaffected.","1476":"The diagnostic reliability of techniques for determining the prevalence of teat canal infections varies: bacteriological results obtained by examination of teat canal swabs were 20% higher on average than those of foremilk samples (FMS) examined and classified according to the criteria of the International Dairy Federation (IDF). Since they are based exclusively on the bacterio-cytological results of the FMS, the IDF criteria for the classification of the various forms of subclinical udder conditions do not permit an accurate classification of the health status of the udder.","1477":"","1478":"The physical and chemical properties, administration, biotransformation, pharmacological effects, clinical applications, side-effects, toxicity and contraindications of glyceryl guaiacolate ether in the horse are reviewed.","1479":"The article reviews aspects of the immune system of the piglet from birth to weaning which may have practical application for the veterinarian.

Ten other rams served as untreated controls. Semen samples were collected serially before and after each treatment, and evaluated for volume, density, colour, motility, pH, percentage live sperm and sperm morphology. One testis was removed from each ram 9d after the last treatment, and histological examinations were performed on testicular sections. The semen of the 2 groups was similar before the first and after the last treatments. The seminal pH of treated rams was lower during the periods following the first 5 treatments. The volume of ejaculates of treated rams was generally higher during the periods following the first 5 treatments, but not consistently so. No histological differences were observed in the testicular tissue of treated and control animals 9 days after the sixth treatment. It was concluded that repeated treatment with ivermectin at the recommended dosage of 200 micrograms\/kg will not impair the reproductive potential of rams.","1481":"The standard technique for diagnosing bovine brucellosis is the serological examination of blood samples. As affected females may excrete large numbers of the Brucella organism in the lochia, the bacteriological and smear examination of such material appeared to be a suitable alternative for early diagnosis. Of the lochia samples collected from 210 cows and heifers within 12-24 h after parturition or abortion, 10.9% were bacteriologically positive. Only 70% of these could be diagnosed correctly as positive by microscopic examination. This technique also resulted in 3.3% false negative and 1.4% false positive diagnoses. Results of the serological examinations of blood, collected simultaneously with the lochia samples, correlated fairly well with those obtained microscopically. Culture of lochia samples on a suitable medium appears to be the method of choice, when dealing with the early diagnosis of bovine brucellosis.","1482":"","1483":"","1484":"The clinical signs of osteomalacia in year old crocodiles were kyphoscoliosis, \"glassy teath\", \"rubber jaws\" and extreme weakness.

Within the Republic of South Africa, foci of infection occurred in the Johannesburg, Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Rustenburg, Upington, Lichtenburg, Kroonstad, Louis Trichardt, Middelburg (Cape) and Mossel Bay state veterinary districts. In Bophuthatswana, Transkei, Lesotho, South West Africa and Swaziland, positive cases were also recorded. Anti-complementary activity of horse sera does not present a problem. In donkey and mule sera, however, sera show anticomplementary activity in approximately 50% of cases. This can be reduced by diluting the sera 1\/2 before inactivating at 63 degrees C for 1 h.","1486":"Lentiginosis profusa was diagnosed in 3 pedigree Pugs namely two unrelated parents and their female offspring. Macroscopically the lentigines appeared as black macules up to 10 mm in diameter and occurred especially in the skin of the ventral parts of the body. Skin biopsies revealed localised acanthosis and hyperkeratosis with prominent rete ridges and epidermal hyperpigmentation in the absence of any other significant dermal pathology.","1487":"In order to find a parameter that could be used to differentiate between a pedigreed dog and a mongrel the symmetry of the hard palate ridge pattern was examined in 239 pedigreed dogs representing 30 breeds and 334 mongrels. A symmetrical pattern was found in 148 pedigreed dogs and in 15 mongrels. This difference according to the Chi-square test is very highly significant. Thus the symmetry of the pattern is a valuable parameter to be used to distinguish between pedigreed dogs and mongrels.","1488":"Dairy cows on high and controlled feed levels were observed to determine the duration of the parturition process and the incidence of dystocia. Maternal and foetal mass ratio at calving were recorded. The duration of parturition in cows on high level feeding was significantly prolonged to 5.2 +\/- 2.8 hours as compared to 1.34 +\/- 0.89 hours in cows on controlled feeding. The incidence of dystocia was significantly higher in over-fed cows. While maternal mass on high level feeding increased by 27.3%, foetal mass increased by only 5.4%.","1489":"The loss of a companion animal can be of intense importance to the owner of such an animal. The attitude of the veterinarian who often finds himself in the centre of the emotions experienced by the owner therefore becomes critical. His respectful and responsible handling of the animal, his empathy with the owner, and the realisation of his own sensitive position, are discussed. The veterinarian is led along practical guidelines to expand his professional role and enhance his image as caregiver.","1490":"This comparison of results from parallel investigations, conducted on the small herd model already discussed, has made it abundantly clear that during lactation, udder health as such depends on the 3 major determinants of intramammary epithelial integrity, somatic cellular defence and bacterial challenge. Different subclinical health states and related dynamic fluctuations indicate that each of these conditions and changes depends on the type of major determinant of udder health as well as on the nature and magnitude of factors challenging that determinant, either singly or in combination with another of the main determinants. Because of the involvement of 3 important determinants, diagnostic techniques must of necessity facilitate the concurrent monitoring of each of the determinants and the integrated interpretation of results generated. Such an approach to investigations into subclinical mastitis is not feasible by means of either single- or double-parameter techniques. In contrast, triple-parameter determinations capable of monitoring each of the 3 major determinants of udder health and performed during this investigation by means of the IDF\/BSA (International Dairy Federation\/bovine serum albumin) criteria, clearly have facilitated the interpretation of results at unprecedented levels of diagnostic differentiations. In the light of this clearer insight into a comparatively extensive range of udder health states at the subclinical level and corresponding dynamic balances and pathogenetic developments, it is apparent that appropriately designed and standardized triple-parameter techniques of high diagnostic sensitivity and reliability, would make the diagnosis of udder health states far more specific, and the control and prevention of subclinical mastitis far more cost-effective, than generally thought possible under present conditions. Further progress in research and practical work on subclinical mastitis may well depend on efficient triple-parameter techniques for determinations on persisting, deteriorating and improving states of bovine udder health.","1491":"Review of the normal anatomy of the coxofemoral joint in broiler chickens aged seven weeks and comparison with cases of so-called \"hip-dislocation\" revealed that the lesion is essentially an avulsion of the articular cartilage of the femoral head, traumatically caused by the manner of catching and handling of birds. No direct relationship to dyschondroplasia (osteochondrosis) was established.","1492":"","1493":"Chemicals have become indispensible for the maintenance of health in animals and man. The route of administration of each medicament is decided by factors such as site of desired action, chemistry of the active ingredient, age and species of the patient, and frequency of administration (or desired duration of activity). In situations where the oral and hypodermic routes, which are used most frequently, are inadequate or unsatisfactory, dermal application can provide a valuable alternative method to achieve systemic activity. Examples of formulations currently available for dermal application contain diverse chemicals and are intended for a variety of purposes, such as crufomate against cattle grubs, fenthion against cattle lice, levamisole against gastrointestinal nematodes, nitroglycerine for angina pectoris, and scopolamine for motion sickness. The skin acts as a barrier to penetration by chemicals and micro-organisms by virtue of its morphology and chemical composition. Chemicals which do penetrate, do not necessarily pass through the appendages (hair follicles and gland ducts), but mostly penetrate through the interjacent epidermis, either through the cells, or via the intracellular spaces. These spaces have recently been shown by electron microscopy to be filled by an amorphous substance which exudes on the skin surface in convex ridges. This substance has a lipid nature, but is not hydrophobic as is often accepted. For a chemical to be able to penetrate the skin, it must be partially water and lipid soluble, polar, and weakly ionizing. A variety of factors can possibly affect the permeability of skin for a chemical. These include species differences in morphology (skin thickness, tightness of intercellular junctions, density of hair follicles and other appendages), biochemistry, and physiology; seasonal and climatic variations; and differences between breeds and genders. Species differences in skin permeability are largely unpredictable and inconsistent. An observed difference between two species for one chemical cannot necessarily be extrapolated to another.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1494":"From this investigation, it is apparent that owing to the superior diagnostic differentiating of udder conditions by means of the IDF\/BSA criteria, a range of detailed data has become available which facilitates an unprecedented insight in the dynamic balancing during normal lactation of several health states determinable at subclinical levels. The findings therefore from different points of view augment the corresponding results generated during the preceding investigation by means of the IDF criteria of acknowledged diagnostic limitations. In general, the data suggests that regardless of the diagnostic technique used for determinations during normal lactation on bovine udder conditions, udder health as such depends on 3 major determinants, namely intramammary epithelial integrity, intramammary somatic cellular defence and intramammary bacterial challenge. Subclinical septic mastitis, clearly, develops through different types of gradually escalating deteriorations of health states which depend on several pathways of pathogenetic development. These are subject on the one hand to the 3 major determinants of udder health, and on the other hand to the nature and magnitude of their single and combined challenging. The deterioration of udder health in some quarters is opposed by the improvement of that in others which in the light of data on the rather transient persistence of health states implies, that deterioration of condition is at all levels of its development opposed directly but, possibly, somewhat delayed by the cow's efforts at restoring udder health as such to its completely normal level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1495":"This investigation, conducted on a small herd milked by machine without disinfectant teat dipping, shows that a limited population of 21 normally lactating dairy cows regularly examined at 24 h intervals during 22 consecutive days, may be used for monitoring dynamic fluctuations of udder conditions. From the results it is apparent that, on subclinical levels, udder health of dairy cows depends in principle on a variety of conditions, variability in dynamic fluctuations and the balance between persistent, deteriorating and improving health states. As health states, especially active and intermediate to the mastitic and normal condition at the opposing extremes of udder health, aseptic mastitis (AM) and latent infection (LI) cross-reacting with each other and with each of the other health states, are of particular practical interest. From the dynamic fluctuations of AM and LI it seems conceivable that the strategy of mastitis control proposed by several workers and found lacking in several respects during this investigation, may promote the shifting of abnormal udder conditions from those associated with mastitogenic infections to others of a non-bacterial, i.e. unspecific nature. In general, the data suggest that further work on the dynamics of different health states is necessary, and that it may be advantageous also to use the small herd model described for determinations on representative populations of cows selected at random from large dairy herds otherwise unsuitable for investigations on daily and other dynamic changes of udder health.","1496":"The pathology of pulmonary aspergillosis in a piglet is described. The dominant feature is the pneumonic process which is acute, focal, disseminated and necrotising to purulent in character. Fungal hyphae typical of the aspergilli are present within the lesions.

A 4-week-old American Saddler foal was presented for autopsy following an illness characterised by clinical features indicative of hepatic failure. The significant macroscopical lesions occurred in the liver which was extremely enlarged, mottled in appearance and indurated. Bile stasis was evident. Lobular distinction was absent and on sectioning, large bile ducts were absent. A moderate ascites, hydrothorax and hydropericardium and a mild anasarca and intermuscular oedema accompanied the hepatic lesion. The diagnosis of biliary atresia was determined by the histopathological features of bile duct proliferation and extensive replacement fibrosis.

A dose of 75 X 10(6) sperm\/ml was found to be suitable for intra-uterine insemination of Angora does.","1501":"Non-commercial, endotoxin positive, intravenous fluids as well as a commercially available intravenous fluid were given to clinically normal horses. Endotoxin-positive fluids caused clinical signs attributable to endotoxaemia. Leukopenia, preceded by a fluctuating white cell count, was observed in horses showing clinical signs. The commercial intravenous fluid had no effect on the white cell count or on the clinical state. Precautions to be taken and recommendations are made with regard to the monitoring of horses in which one might be forced to use non-commercial intravenous fluids.","1502":"The concentration of oxytetracycline in plasma and semen of mature rams was determined after intravenous administration. Therapeutic concentrations were attained in semen but were not maintained for as long as in the plasma.","1503":"Nearly 80% of 87 cattle suffering for the first time from pododermatitis circumspecta were cured by each of the three drugs under test. Sixty and 73% of those cured by sulphamonomethoxine and penicillin, respectively, and 29% of those cured by the tarantula poison (Theranekron), showed relapses within 6 months. Of the 92 cattle with previous records of pododermatitis circumspecta, sulphamonomethoxine cured 44%, penicillin 73% and Theranekron 32%. Of the latter three groups 72-80% showed relapses within the subsequent 6 months. The results of surgical treatments were, possibly, improved by the prior administration of Theranekron. In addition, in a pilot trial, the demarcation of a gangreneous udder half of a goat suffering from blue-bag, appeared to be accelerated by the parenteral administration of Theranekron.","1504":"Canine encephalitozoonosis can be responsible for a severe renal disease in dogs which may develop into progressive, irreversible kidney failure. Three pure-bred Boxer littermates with confirmed encephalitozoonosis were subjected to sequential clinical pathological tests and renal biopsies. The endogenous serum creatinine and urea levels showed an initial temporary reduction but later increased steadily. The phenolsulphonphthalein retention test confirmed this end-stage renal disease. Initial hyper-gamma globulinaemia showed a rapid decline. Urinalysis was an indicator of chronic renal disease and the kidney biopsies confirmed progressive irreversible kidney lesions. Evaluation of sequential tests are advocated for the setting of a prognosis. The radiopharmaceutical techniques employed proved to be sensitive indicators of renal dysfunction and a means of evaluating the function of the left and right kidney separately.","1505":"A purulent bacterial myocarditis, secondary to parvovirus enteritis was diagnosed in a 3-month-old St Bernard puppy. The clinical course was of 2 days duration and was characterized by pyrexia, severe vomition, haemorrhagic diarrhoea and dehydration. Post mortem examination revealed a haemorrhagic enteritis and multifocal purulent myocarditis. Histopathological examination proved that the latter was of bacterial origin. It is postulated that this resulted from a bacteraemia secondary to the intestinal lesions caused by parvovirus infection.","1506":"","1507":"","1508":"Integrated gynaecological programmes play an extremely important role in total herd health control by ensuring the maintenance of optimal reproduction and production. The economic implications of reduced breeding efficiency manifest in, and are reflected by total lifetime milk production, the size of the calf drop, the availability of replacement animals and increased involuntary culling rate. Measured against production costs (feed, labour and veterinary expenses), lowered reproductive efficiency erodes the margin of profitability of the farming enterprise. Herd health programmes must be well planned, stringently implemented and regularly evaluated to ensure their effectiveness. To this end they must be based on simple and practical guidelines which can be adapted as required to cope with varied farming and management conditions. This paper outlines the setting of clear objectives, factors to consider during the introductory phasing in of an integrated gynaecological programme and details of each subsequent routine visit. Ideal objectives are presented and discussed in terms of the individual animal as well as the herd. Suggested figures for each parameter are given. The significance of oestrus observation is stressed as cardinal to the attainment of many of the set objectives. The significance of calf management as the nucleus of the production of a healthy heifer replacement herd is discussed. During the introductory phase, which can be a protracted period, the foundation for routine visits is laid. Herd structure is defined, facilities are evaluated, record systems are set up and the farmer is groomed as to his role in the successful implementation of the planned programme. The value of a control questionnaire is highlighted, and factors considered are set out. The method of the routine gynaecological programme is discussed in detail. The necessity for a standard examination list is set out and the various categories of cows to be examined on each routine visit is clearly outlined, with important factors relating to each being highlighted. Examples of the various forms used are given. Evaluation of the acquired data should be done immediately, and discussed with the farmer during the current visit. Findings can be compared with those of previous visits, analysed, and recommendations may be considered immediately in consultation with the farmer. Dairy farming is a highly complex farming enterprise involving large capital outlays, intensification of labour and astute management for optimal and economic production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1509":"A retrospective study on surgical cases of colic in horses (n = 216) revealed that 42 (19.4%) developed post-surgical diarrhoea. Salmonella spp. were isolated in 6 (16.2%) of the cases (n = 37) exhibiting diarrhoea. In 35.7% of the cases (n = 42) recovery from surgery was disturbed by other complications; 23.8% (10\/42) died, 2 of which from primary acute diarrhoea due to salmonellosis. Most of the outbreaks of diarrhoea occurred in winter and spring. From the associated variables examined, the duration of colic signs revealed a significant difference between the cases which developed acute postoperative diarrhoea and the other surgical cases.","1510":"Twenty ostrich chicks (Struthio camelus) up to 8 weeks of age were fed isocaloric diets containing protein levels of 14%, 16%, 18% and 20%. The highest mean body weight gain was obtained from feeding the 20% protein diet; however, this result was not significantly different at the 0.05 level of probability. Feed conversion favoured the 18% protein group. During the seventh and eighth week of the experimental period some chicks developed leg deformities. Clinical signs, radiological findings and response to calcium supplementation suggested an insufficient amount of calcium in the experimental diets.","1511":"The incidence, methods of diagnosis and treatment of lung lobe torsion in dogs are briefly reviewed. A case of chylothorax with subsequent right cardiac lobe torsion in a young male Afghan hound is described.","1512":"A case of unilateral perinephric pseudocyst formation as a result of extravasation of urine is reported. The main presenting signs and the initial clinical examination did not directly indicate severe renal involvement. The subsequent development of pseudocysts as a result of chronic extravasation of urine was positively diagnosed by laboratory investigations and ancillary procedures. Treatment consisted of surgical removal of the affected kidney.","1513":"A map showing the prevalence and geographical distribution of the wet carcass syndrome in sheep is presented. Although isolated cases of this syndrome are sporadically reported throughout all the sheep-producing areas of the country, the incidence of this phenomenon is epidemic in the districts of Gordonia, Kuruman, Postmasburg, Hay and Prieska. Some areas within a certain district tend to have a higher prevalence of wet carcasses especially those round the Orange, Kuruman and Molopo rivers. Vegetation type may be involved in the development of this condition in the live animal and should be investigated.","1514":"","1515":"Aspects of the biology and life-cycle of the flea which are important to the practising veterinarian are discussed. The \"cat flea\", Ctenocephalides files is the most prevalent species on dogs and cats in those parts of the world where it has been surveyed. Whether the flea is a temporary or permanent obligatory parasite is still a controversy. The insecticides and product formulations available for flea control in South Africa are reviewed with emphasis on the systematic agent, fenthion. Practical protocols for flea control on dogs and cats are proposed.","1516":"The effect of abnormal body position on cardiovascular and pulmonary function in the awake and anaesthetised horse is reviewed. Parameters such as pulmonary shunt, lung volumes, blood gases and alveolar-arterial oxygen partial pressure differences are discussed. Withholding food for 24 hours and mechanical ventilation may be used to improve blood gas values associated with abnormal recumbency during anaesthesia. During prolonged recovery, horses should be encouraged to adopt sternal recumbency.","1517":"Experimental transmission of canine encephalitozoonosis was effected by oral dosing of urine obtained from naturally diseased animals. Per os, intraperitoneal and intravenous routes were used to induce infection with tissue culture-grown Encephalitozoon spores which were initially isolated from the kidney of a dog with terminal disease. The infection was confirmed by a rise in the indirect immunofluorescent antibody titres, the lesions found in infected dogs and isolation of the parasite in tissue culture from an infected and immunosuppressed dog. The experimentally induced disease was invariably subclinical but the histopathological changes were similar although milder than those found in fatal natural disease. The kidney appears to be the target organ and chronic interstitial nephritis develops regularly.","1518":"Conscious rabbits were exposed to environments with low oxygen and\/or high carbon dioxide. The electroencephalogram and arterial blood pressure were recorded. Arterial blood samples were taken sequentially. Rabbits became 'unconscious' at an arterial blood PO2 of 25 +\/- 1 mm Hg and PCO2 of 99 +\/- 27 mm Hg, when simultaneously the environmental oxygen was decreased and carbon dioxide increased. Brain death occurred at a PO2 of 23 +\/- 1 mm Hg and PCO2 of 113 +\/- 32 mm Hg. Cerebral perfusion was still adequate. In rabbits, the margin between 'unconsciousness' and 'death' is narrow so far as PO2 is concerned. If these results apply generally, animals culled with muscle relaxants may perceive stress involved until shortly before death.","1519":"The repair of a large defect in the abdominal wall of an American Saddlehorse by implantation of a polypropylene monofilament mesh.","1520":"","1521":"A commercially available program which integrates word processing, spreadsheet, data base, and graph facilities, is used on a microcomputer to write a proforma for an experimental file. The proforma file contains empty forms for all envisaged documentation collected during the experiment's duration. This includes an outline protocol, cost estimate, literature search, detailed protocol, data collection forms, project account, and final report. The program allows linking of spreadsheets, thus for instance enabling date and time information entered on the daily log of events to be automatically transferred to the labour cost form. Introduction of this concept has greatly reduced the amount of time spent on research documentation and the risk of data adulteration through repeated transcription. It has also improved control over research expenses and standardization of trial document formats.","1522":null,"1523":"A variety of non-sporulating anaerobic bacterial species were isolated from udder abscesses in 10 lactating dairy cows. Fifty percent of the abscesses yielded multiple anaerobic species and the other 50% only 1 species. The anaerobic bacteria, however, were always accompanied by classical facultative anaerobic mastitogenic bacteria. In four of the five cows also afflicted with mastitis in the quarters with abscesses, the anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were identical. Peptococcus indolicus was the most commonly isolated organism followed by Eubacterium and Bacteroides spp. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to penicillin, ampicillin and tetracycline.","1524":"Serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, total protein, albumin, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and alanine transaminase were determined in free-living white rhinoceroses Ceratotherium simum (n = 20). Single serum cortisol (n = 20), oestradiol-17 Beta (n = 14) and progesterone (n = 14) concentrations are also presented. Low serum sodium (129.6 +\/- 4.2 mmol\/l) chloride (94.2 +\/- 3.05 mmol\/l) and albumin (26.1 +\/- 3.71 mmol\/l) as well as high globulin (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta and gamma) concentrations were outstanding features.","1525":"The iodine content of fresh milk samples from bulk milk transport vehicles (tankers) and from bulk tanks on individual farms was determined. Approximately 75 percent of all the samples fell within the normal range of 25 to 300 micrograms iodine\/l of milk. The mean iodine concentration in the tanker samples was 257 micrograms\/l and in the farm tank samples 294 micrograms\/l, while the medians of the iodine concentrations in the surveys were 214 and 218 micrograms\/l respectively. A total of 1.75 percent of the tanker samples and 5.5 percent of the individual farm samples contained more than 1000 micrograms\/iodine\/l, a level which is considered to be undesirable for human consumption. Iodine containing teat dips (2000 mg available iodine\/l) increased the iodine concentration of the milk of cows treated with these teat dips by between 11 and 60 micrograms\/l.","1526":"","1527":"Plasma constituents were investigated at ninety minute intervals over a forty-eight hour period on four unrestrained Nguni cows (in small cubicles) in order to study the presence or absence of rhythms. No circadian, ultradian or diurnal rhythm was found for any of the parameters investigated. Basal values over a forty-eight hour period were obtained for certain plasma constituents. These values are of use for studies relating to the effects of stress in cattle.","1528":"The specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg\/0.25 ml and 14 mg\/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. Of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. By treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. Untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. Cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium bovis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.","1529":"","1530":"A dairy herd health programme may be defined as a planned and co-ordinated approach which aims at achieving and maintaining optimal herd health, production and reproduction, the implementation of which is governed by sound economic principles. The object of this article is to present and discuss some facets of the background philosophy of the concept of herd health, and look at some of the pitfalls and shortcomings of their application in practice. In terms of production levels achieved in other developed countries, South Africa lags behind. While factors such as climate, environment, feed quality, and basic livestock potential may play a role in this difference, the single most important factor is undoubtedly the managemental approach. Modern livestock production requires a shift in emphasis of veterinary involvement towards a herd approach which promotes increased cost-effective production. The veterinarian forms part of a production team which, apart from himself, includes the farmer, farm labour and the animal scientist. The veterinarian has a key role in this endeavour. Through his basic training he is well equipped to serve as a co-ordinator of the massive flow of information being generated. To do this effectively he must be able to work with, advise and communicate with people at various levels of management as well as with the labour force. While optimal co-operation of each team member is cardinal to the success of such a programme, no progress will be made unless the farmer is convinced of the viability of the undertaking, and indeed has the managerial skills to implement any directive or recommendation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1531":"A dog with vagally induced bradycardia was successfully treated and maintained with isoprenaline HCl.","1532":"","1533":"","1534":"Serum levels of cortisol, sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, phosphorus, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, iron, total magnesium, total calcium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase were determined in 11 short Cape Mountain Zebra Equus zebra zebra.","1535":"A subcutaneous growth developed on the left side of a zoo lion. The growth enlarged over a period of 3 months. A diagnosis of fibrosarcoma was made on account of the history, clinical and histological examinations. The lion was killed 3 weeks after surgical removal of the tumour. The autopsy showed no evidence of metastases. A foreign body (wire) was discovered in the abdominal cavity but no association was found between the lesion caused by the wire and the malignancy.","1536":"A case of a large cell anaplastic carcinoma of the giant cell type in the lungs of a 5 year-old crossbred male Labrador is discussed. The dog was weak, depressed, febrile and markedly dyspnoeic. An intermittent moist cough and auscultable crackling rales were evident. Radiographic examination was indicative of pneumonia and pulmonic neoplasia. The dog died 36 hours after admission despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. At autopsy, the neoplasm appeared as numerous firm greyish-white nodules of varying size throughout all the lung lobes whilst in the right intermediate and diaphragmatic lobes the neoplasm was completely confluent. The microscopic features included: intra-alveolar composites of cells exhibiting considerable nuclear and cytoplasmic pleomorphism; the presence of numerous giant cells scattered throughout the tumour; the occurrence of tumour emboli within both venous and lymphatic vessels; and, metastatic foci in the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. These features were considered to reflect a high degree of malignancy. Comparative and aetiological aspects of bronchogenic carcinomas in man and the dog are discussed.","1537":"A 2 year old Friesland heifer was presented in an advanced stage of pregnancy with a vulva showing only 2 small openings of 1,5 and 0,5 cm in diameter in the dorsal and ventral vulvar commissures, respectively. Normal vulvar skin covered a thick band of fibrous tissue between the two openings. From the vestibulum forward, the rest of the genital tract was normal. At calving, the fibrous tissue was resected under epidural anaesthesia, and the calf delivered with ease. The vulva was reconstructed by stitching the vestibular mucosa to the vulvar skin using simple interrupted sutures.","1538":"An 18-month-old Pekingese bitch aborted 7 foetuses at Day 55 of pregnancy.

The involved teeth have a bifid crown and 3 roots. The central root is abnormally wide and has 2 separate root canals. The anomalous tooth is the cause of malocclusion in the cat and of periodontitis in both cases. The difficulty in distinguishing gemination from fusion is discussed.","1540":"In seventeen adult Dorper ewes imported from South Africa into Israel and nine of their primiparous, first-generation daughters born in Israel, characteristics and indices of reproduction were determined during the period of April 1982 to April 1984. This study showed that, during the period from April 1982 to January 1984, three lambings occurred in the adult ewes; the lengths of the oestrous cycles for adult and primiparous ewes were 17.6 +\/- 1.1 and 16.6 +\/- 1.2 days, respectively; the number of services per ewe in oestrus were 3 +\/- 1 services; the average length of pregnancy was 146-147 days; the lambing intervals were 6.2 +\/- 0.46 and 7.7 +\/- 0.62 months from the first to second lambing and the second to third lambing, respectively; of 17 ewes, 3 had twins in all 3 lambings (17.6%) and 4 had twins in only the first 2 lambings (23.5%). The sex ratio recorded in 70 lambs of adult ewes (in three lambings) was 41 males to 29 females (41:29). A high percentage of fecundity (137.2%) and prolificity (149%), an unrestricted breeding seasons, a short lambing interval and a short postweaning anoestrus period, recommend this breed of sheep as commercially advantageous for arid zones.","1541":"Weekly blood serum samples from 20 yearling horses, divided into equal groups, receiving diets with total calcium to inorganic phosphorus ratios of 1,5\/1 and 0,2\/1, were analysed for calcium and phosphorus concentrations. This was done over a continuous 23 week period, divided into 2 sub-periods of 16 and 7 weeks each. During the first period complete diets were provided ad lib but were restricted during the second period to accentuate any effects of calcium deficiency and phosphorus excess. Falling calcium levels and rising phosphorus levels during period 1 and a reverse trend during period 2 indicated that this method can be used to detect progressive nutritional hyperparathyroidism in individual horses when a series of profiles are analysed over a period of time.","1542":"The agar sausage technique was used to make an assessment of the surface aerobic bacterial levels of refrigerated beef, mutton and pork carcases at Cato Ridge abattoir by taking agar imprints from selected sites on the surfaces of carcases.

The disease, which occurred almost exclusively in 2-4 month-old Dorper or Dorper cross-bred lambs, was characterized by protracted ataxia, paresis and high mortality. Microscopical changes were consistently found in the neurons and white matter along the entire length of the spinal cord, and rarely in the medulla oblongata. These changes included vacuolation and degeneration of neurons, mainly of the lateral and ventral horns in the spinal cord, and a status spongiosus which was most noticeable in the lateral and ventral tracts of the spinal cord. All affected lambs had access to the plant, Chrysocoma tenuifolia (bitterbos), but trials to reproduce the condition by dosing the plant, were not successful.","1548":"Non-surgical intra-uterine insemination was achieved in 70 of 97 ewes (72%).

Chrome cobalt alloy crowns were fabricated and cemented to the top two canine teeth. The lower canine tooth received a silver amalgam restoration.","1552":"Tyzzer's disease was diagnosed histologically in two foals, a 4-week-old Thoroughbred cross and a 6-week-old Arabian foal. Clinically both foals were in good health prior to a short illness lasting only a few hours. The liver lesions in both foals were characterized microscopically by multiple foci of necrosis. Variable numbers of elongated slender intracytoplasmic bacilli resembling Bacillus piliformis were demonstrated within hepatocytes bordering the necrotic foci.","1553":"A 2 1\/2-year-old Maltese poodle was examined for breeding soundness following a series of unsuccessful matings to fertile bitches. He was found to have only 8% normal sperm in his ejaculate when Spermac-stained smears were examined under the light microscope.

Transmission and scanning electron microscopy confirmed light microscopical findings.","1554":"An outbreak of a haemorrhagic syndrome involved recently weaned, mixed-breed pigs in a large piggery. The pigs were fed a pelleted complete ration containing antibacterial drugs. Affected pigs failed to grow, became pale and developed large, subcutaneous haematomas. Some pigs became lame and one had epistaxis. The monthly mortality rate in the weaner house, which was previously less than 2%, exceeded 6% during the outbreak. Coagulation time, activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were prolonged in blood from some of the pigs. The outbreak resolved promptly after supplementation of the diet with vitamin K3.","1555":"Experimental use of the standard dose (4-12 X 10(10) viable organisms per dose) Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine (S19) in adult cattle led to a serological response in the complement fixation test (CFT) within 2 weeks. The antibody titres recorded could not be distinguished from those arising from infection for a period of 6-11 months. This was in the absence of the booster effect of Brucella antigen from either field or vaccine strains. The illegal or unintentional use of S19 in adult cattle may be recognized by a sudden steep antibody titre response in the CFT which will decline to negative levels within 6-11 months provided no booster Brucella antigen is present.","1556":"","1557":"Bacteriophage typing was performed on 88 coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated during a survey of subclinical mastitis in Bloemfontein dairy herds. Phage typing was performed using two basic international phage typing sets, i.e. the human isolate phage set (HPS) and the bovine isolate phage set (BPS). The results clearly indicated that the BPS could be successfully applied for the phage typing of bovine mastitis S. aureus strains. The majority of the strains was typed as BPS phage group IV (78,4%) and HPS group III (47,7%). The high prevalence of BPS group IV strains is in agreement with other studies. The prevalence of non-typable strains was 3,4% for BPS and 28,4% for HPS. Phages 102, 117, 107, 81, 47, and 6 had high lytic activity. BPS group IV patterns (102\/107\/117 and 102\/117) dominated. The incidence of unique phage patterns was 12,5% for BPS and 26,0% for HPS. A relatively high proportion (71,3%) of the strains was typable with the HPS. As these strains were of possible human origin it indicated the possibility of mutual human-animal transfer of the pathogens. No relationship could be found between phage groups on the one hand and multiple antibiotic resistance on the other, and no phage groups dominated within herds.","1558":"","1559":"Clinical and pharmacological analyses showed a full immobilizing action of etorphine in adult sheep +\/- 7 min. after a deep i.m. injection of the drug at a dosage rate of 20 micrograms\/kg.

Three of 4 applications of a wash containing 0,025% amitraz, together with antimicrobial and antipruritic therapy where necessary, were sufficient to effect clinical cure in 25 out of 26 cases mildly to severely affected. In one case, very severely affected, 9 weekly applications, together with antimicrobial and antipruritic therapy, effected clinical and parasitological cure.","1564":"An apparently clinically normal ram with excellent semen quality, an intact pituitary-testicular axis and good libido displayed abnormal mounting behaviour when subjected to a mating test with 3 oestrus ewes. The ram adopted a peculiar mounting stance, he moved backwards several paces and then lunged forward becoming momentarily airborne in an attempt to mount. After a number of these airborne attempts at mounting the ram managed one successful service, striking the ewe with his sternum while airborne. At completion of the service the ram lost all sexual interest in the other two oestrous ewes. Radiographs revealed a chronic osteo-arthrosis of the right femero-tibial joint. It was concluded that the osteo-arthrosis caused the ram to suffer a great deal of pain interfering with his mounting ability which in turn affected his mating efficiency and serving capacity severely.","1565":"In a herd of 30 Boer goats, 3 young goats developed nervous signs including apparent blindness. In 2 of the goats a diagnosis of cerebrocortical necrosis was confirmed by the demonstration of lesions typical of the disease on histopathological examination. Lead concentrations in the renal cortex were well below the level regarded as indicative of lead poisoning in ruminants. The reason for the outbreak was not clear, but the feeding of concentrate and poor quality roughage may have been contributory factors. Cerebrocortical necrosis appears to be unusual in goats, compared to cattle and sheep, but it should be entertained in the differential diagnosis of caprine nervous diseases.","1566":"Two groups of 25 one-year-old Dorper rams were deprived of water for 52 h and then allowed free access to water for the last 18 h before they were slaughtered. One of these groups received a maize-meal and bone-meal lick containing 28,5% salt (sodium chloride) during the last 18 h period. A control group of 20 sheep received water throughout the experiment. The salt group had an average intake of 4,5 liters of water per animal in the 18 h rehydration period while the other water deprived group drank about 3,8 liters of water per animal. After being slaughtered, all the sheep in the salt group had typically wet and glistening carcasses, 18 of the other water deprived group had wet carcasses while none in the control group were affected. These results seem to indicate that the wet carcass syndrome is caused by overhydration after a period of dehydration and that salt intake during rehydration can exacerbate the condition.","1567":"After reviewing traditional and present day concepts of the mechanism by which the external orifice of the teat canal control the outflow of milk and the entry of bacteria etc. into the cavities of the mammary gland, this paper reports on the results of electron microscopic and other studies of the teat tip. This leads to the conclusion that the concept of a sphincter surrounding the teat canal should be substituted by one of a multi-spiralled, net-like integrated musculo-elastic system. This system may facilitate automatic closing and opening of the teat canal depending on the state of its major functional elements, namely (i) elastic fibres for passive closure under normal conditions (ii) smooth muscle fibres augmenting the former and (iii) the level of the intra-cisternal milk pressure. This closure is enhanced by soft teat canal keratin.","1568":"Three of four white rhinoceroses died within 3 months of introduction into a game reserve. Post-mortem examination of one of the animals revealed marked hepatomegaly with haemorrhage and severe necrosis of the liver as well as numerous ecchymoses and petechiae in the subcutaneous tissue and subserosa of the thorax, abdomen and diaphragm. Histologically, severe hepatic necrosis was the most significant finding. Algae recovered from the dam from which the animals drank were identified as Microcystis aeruginosa. A diagnosis of suspected Microcystis poisoning was made.","1569":"A 17-year-old Nooitgedacht mare was presented in mid-summer after failing to conceive during the previous 2 breeding seasons. The mare conceived to service during a PG-induced oestrus when synthetic GnRH was used to induce ovulation.","1570":"","1571":"The efficacy of various formulations of ivermectin administered at the recommended dose rate of 200 micrograms\/kg was evaluated in cattle infested with mange mites (Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis.), lice (Linognathus vituli and Damalinia bovis) and ticks (Boophilus decoloratus, Amblyomma hebraeum, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and Hyalomma spp.) in 8 trials conducted in South Africa. Mange mites (S. scabiei) were eliminated from animals treated subcutaneously, resulting in marked clinical recovery. Oral administration reduced the numbers of, but did not eliminate these mites. Sucking lice (L. vituli) were eliminated from animals treated orally or subcutaneously. Numbers of biting lice (D. bovis) were reduced but not eliminated, subcutaneous injection being more effective than oral drenching. Subcutaneous injection with ivermectin every 14 d over a period of 84 d significantly reduced numbers of engorged female R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum. Numbers of Boophilus spp. and Hyalomma spp. were also reduced. A single subcutaneous injection resulted in significantly fewer engorged female B. decoloratus on treated animals for up to 28 d after treatment. In one trial significantly fewer A. hebraeum males occurred on treated animals for up to 28 d after treatment. Too few R. evertsi were present in these trials to evaluate the effect of ivermectin against this parasite.","1572":"The efficacy of ivermectin administered at 200 micrograms\/kg was evaluated against induced infestations of 5 gastrointestinal nematode species in cattle. Results were analysed by the modified non-parametric method and a \"A\" class (more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the treated animals) was achieved with an oral drench and subcutaneous injection against the third and fourth larval and adult stages of Bunostomum phlebotomum, Cooperia spp. (C. pectinata and C. punctata), Haemonchus placei, Oesophagostomum radiatum and Ostertagia ostertagi. Ivermectin was 77,5-100% effective against naturally acquired infestations of Trichuris spp.","1573":"In addition to the routine sero-epidemiological surveillance for arthropod-borne viral zoonoses in the Cape Province carried out by the Department of Medical Microbiology and State Health Department of Virology laboratory, we conducted a prospective serological investigation for virus activity during 1981 in two districts of the Province, namely the Beaufort West and Middelburg districts, which experienced heavy rainfall during the first two months of that year. The approach used was to obtain paired serum samples from identified domestic stock representative of several species from 2-5 months apart and to test them for haemagglutination inhibition antibodies to Rift Valley fever, Wesselsbron and Middelburg virus antigen preparations in order to ascertain, as an indication of viral activity, whether changes in antibody levels occurred between the collection dates. The results indicated that there was probable activity of Rift Valley fever virus and activity of Wesselsbron virus (or related flaviviruses) and Middelburg virus (or related alphaviruses) in the Karoo between the middle of February and the end of July 1981. Despite this activity and heavy rainfall registered at meteorological stations in both the Beaufort West and Middelburg districts as well as general reports of heavy rainfall and considerable mosquito activity over widespread areas of the Karoo, Eastern and S.W. Cape Province, there were no epizootics or epidemics of overt arthropod-borne zoonotic viral disease in the province during 1981.","1574":"Ivermectin in an oral formulation was evaluated by the non-parametric method against a wide range of endoparasites of sheep in 15 trials involving a total of 297 sheep. Ivermectin at 200 micrograms\/kg was more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the treated animals (i.e. Class A) against induced infestations of 3rd and 4th stage larvae and adults of Chabertia ovina, Dictyocaulus filaria, Haemonchus contortus (including a benzimidazole-resistant strain), Nematodirus spathiger, Oesophagostomum columbianum, Ostertagia circumcincta (including a benzimidazole-resistant isolate), and Trichostrongylus colubriformis; an \"A\" class was also obtained against the 4th stage larvae and adults of Gaigeria pachyscelis and Strongyloides papillosis and natural infestations of adult Trichuris spp. Efficacy against the 3rd stage larvae of G. pachyscelis and S. papillosus fell to Class B (i.e. more than 60% effective in more than 60% of the treated animals). Ivermectin completely eliminated Oestrus ovis larvae (all 3 instars). In 2 additional trials the efficacy of concurrent oral treatment with ivermectin at 200 micrograms\/kg and rafoxanide suspension at 7,5 mg\/kg was evaluated against the 3rd stage larvae of N. spathiger, O. columbianum and S. papillosus and 56 day-old Fasciola gigantica. Concurrent medication did not adversely affect the individual efficacies of either ivermectin or rafoxanide.","1575":"Facial eczema is known to occur in the Humansdorp district of the Cape Province. During June 1982-January 1984, 5 outbreaks of hepatogenous photosensitivity occurred in sheep in central districts of the Orange Free State. In one of these outbreaks a diagnosis of suspected facial eczema was made histologically.","1576":"","1577":"The diagnosis, surgery and results of a case of patent ductus arteriosus in a dog are presented. The case was treated successfully in a private practice.","1578":"The successful radiotherapy of malignant epulis in a 12 year-old Dachshund is discussed. Regrowth of the tumour, which was first removed by surgery, was treated with radiotherapy over a period of 36 days in 3 fractions. The total dose was 1800 rads. The lesion healed uneventfully. After 600 days, there was still no new growth but only scar tissue to be seen.","1579":"Three wild caught littermate cheetahs succumbed to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) after being in captivity for approximately 9 weeks. A necropsy and histopathological examination on one revealed typical signs of FIP as well as histopathological lesions in the liver and brain of concomitant toxoplasmosis. Hypochromic anaemia, neutrophilia, lymphopaenia, eosinopaenia and elevations of alpha 2-globulin and gamma-globulin fractions of the blood were present in the one animal examined. These findings together with some clinical signs are reported.","1580":"Twenty beef biltong samples from various commercial sources were investigated chemically and microbiologically. The biltong contained 5-10% NaCl, little sugar and nitrite but 10-860 ppm nitrate. The addition of nitrate apparently did not ensure stability, since spoiled biltong often contained much residual nitrate. Biltong was stable at the barrier combination of aw less than or equal to 0.77 and pH less than or equal to 5.5 because such samples did not spontaneously become mouldy. A high degree of contamination with moulds and yeasts was found indicating a real health hazard to which consumers might be exposed. Better control measures must be imposed to ensure a better product to the consumer.","1581":"Out of a litter of 7 two-week old Landrace piglets, 6 developed cutaneous haemorrhages especially on the limbs and ears. Two of these piglets died within 24 hours of the haemorrhages appearing whilst the other 4 recovered following penicillin therapy. The histopathological lesions were centred around the smaller vessels of the dermis and hypodermis. These included hyperaemia, leukostasis and intravascular fibrin coagulation or thrombosis. Bacterial emboli were present within the vessels of the skin, spleen, liver and kidney and loose in the areolar tissue of the dermis and hypodermis. Other lesions included scattered but extensive dermal and hypodermal haemorrhages and a mild cellular infiltration of the dermis and hypodermis.","1582":"An acute outbreak of C. orbiculata L. poisoning in a flock of 16 Angora Goat rams is described. Typical signs of acute bufadienolide cardiac glycoside toxicity were manifested and 6 animals died. In the 2 animals examined histopathologically multiple foci of myocardial degeneration and necrosis were present. Treatment consisted, inter alia, of drenching with a mixture of activated charcoal, potassium chloride and a commercial preparation, Universal Antidote (Centaur) and parenteral administration of atropine sulphate.","1583":"Scrotal palpation, microscopical examination of semen smears and the application of bacteriological techniques, revealed the incidence of Actinobacillus seminis and Brucella ovis infection of rams in the central and southern districts of the Orange Free State to be 2,9% and 4,3%, respectively. More Dorper than Merino rams were affected. Although clinically detectable epididymitis was found in 5,9% of rams examined, infection with A. seminis and B. ovis, as measured by the presence of neutrophils in semen and positive semen cultures, could only be demonstrated in a small minority of affected cases. These organisms were found more regularly in clinically negative rams excreting neutrophils in their semen. Possible reasons for the high incidence of sheep brucellosis in rams in the particular area as well as the higher incidence of infection in Dorper rams are discussed.","1584":"Blood composition of succinyldicholine culled elephants and buffaloes was compared with that of undisturbed animals shot in the brain. The results show statistically significant differences in a number of variables including plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations. The observed changes are attributed to stress induced by a combination of herding and darting with succinyldicholine and asphyxia. Extrapolation from blood oxygen tensions suggests that this stress may be perceived for an undetermined period which is probably longer in elephants than buffaloes.","1585":"The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacteria associated with subclinical mastitis in Bloemfontein fresh milk dairy herds were determined. A total of 141 bacterial strains tested, consisted of Staphylococcus aureus (93 strains), coagulase negative staphylococci (17), streptococci (12), Corynebacterium bovis (8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7) and enterobacteria (4). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined qualitatively using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method and quantitatively by determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations using the agar dilution method. The utilization of commercial intramammary antibiotic preparations on the dairy farms is also discussed. The Gram-positive bacteria were generally not exceptionally resistant to the antibiotics tested. S. aureus susceptibility figures for penicillin G were 66% and for methicillin (or cloxacillin) 100%. The coagulase negative staphylocci in contrast were relatively more resistant than the coagulase positive staphylococci. The enterobacteria and particularly the P. aeruginosa strains, were extremely resistant to all antibiotics tested. In the latter case even carbenicillin and gentamicin susceptibility figures were low. A general mastitis control programme is discussed.","1586":"A total of 5059 sera were collected from adult female beef cattle at Cato Ridge Abattoir and tested for Brucella abortus antibody levels over the period November, 1981 to August, 1982. The sera were screened using the Rose Bengal Plate Test, and the Complement Fixation Test was used as the definitive test. Seventy-seven sera (1,5%) had titres of 30 IU complement fixing B. abortus antibody per ml serum or greater.","1587":"The immunological mechanisms including humoral, cellular and hypersensitivity reactions, involved in host resistance to ticks, their effects on the ticks, the factor affecting the level of resistance and possible consequences are reviewed.","1588":"Seventeen cows with prolapsed vaginas were treated by placing a purse-string suture cranial to the external urethral opening to retain the vagina. It was found to be a simple procedure with a high rate of success. Fifteen of the patients responded well to the procedure with a minimum of straining being evident in the post operative period.","1589":"Samples of whole blood of a Boergoat buck (60,XY), and ewe (54,XX) and her heterosexual twins were cytogenetically examined. The female offspring had hair and seemed to be a cross between the two animals. However, both twins possessed 54 chromosomes, including 6 large submetacentric autosomes, whose R- and G-banding patterns were identical to those of the ewe.","1590":"The shortcomings of faecal worm egg counts as a method of diagnosis are discussed. The best method of making a diagnosis of helminthosis is a necropsy. The equipment necessary and technique of carrying out an autopsy are described in detail. Emphasis is laid on the common nematodes which inhabit the gastro-intestinal tract and their relative sizes are illustrated. A brief description of the common nematodes, cestodes and trematodes of domestic ruminants adequate for a preliminary diagnosis is given in tabular form. Full host parasite lists and the number of worms of the most common species necessary to cause clinical signs and even death are tabulated. Emphasis is laid on microscopical examination to recover and diagnose helminths.","1591":"A 13-year-old male crossbred dog was presented with a unilateral swelling of the facial region, severe pain when the mouth was opened, and chronic otitis. Upon palpation it appeared that the right mandible had been fractured. At necropsy the head revealed a large tumour which had invaded the mandible and had caused areas of osteolysis. Histopathology revealed a solid highly anaplastic carcinoma of one of the serous salivary glands.","1592":"Three bovine carcases displaying inter- and intramuscular, intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic lesions attributable to Parafilaria bovicola infestations were selected for further inspection at Cato Ridge abattoir. The distribution of these lesions in the carcase is described. The condition was confirmed by the presence of eosinophils in scrapings and histological sections of the lesions and by the recovery of the parasite.","1593":"A case of primary volvulus of the small intestines in a dog is presented. This condition is described as rare in the dog. The surgical treatment and positive results are discussed.","1594":"A herd of Bonsmara bulls in the Eastern Transvaal was found to be suffering from mange. Scrapings were made and the mites that were collected was identified as Psorergates bos.","1595":"Variable results were obtained when the starch digestion test was carried out on a suspected case of malassimilation in a horse. In order to re-evaluate this test, 15 starch digestion tests were carried out using 4 horses. Results showed a marked variation in the increase in plasma glucose levels between individual horses and especially between poor and good condition horses when the dose of starch was based on body mass. Results also suggest that a fixed dose of starch may give more consistent results.","1596":"Bovine semen, diluted with a skimmed milk, 10% egg yolk, 7% glycerol extender and frozen in 0,25 ml French straws, was thawed in water at 5 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 35 degrees C for 20 seconds and then incubated at 37 degrees C. Specimens were examined periodically for motility. Semen thawed at 35 degrees C maintained motility for longer than that thawed at lower temperatures. Attempts to duplicate these findings in vivo were inconclusive but tend to correlate in vitro findings.","1597":"Blood selenium levels of apparantly healthy, adult sheep from the Bultfontein area, as determined by neutron activation, varied between 0,165 and 0,500 micrograms\/ml. Due to the absence of anaemia, a symptom which could be taken as one of the earliest signs of chronic selenosis, these values suggest the intake of high but non-toxic amounts of selenium.","1598":"Samples from 40 slaughter cattle were investigated over 10 weeks for determining macroscopic tissue reaction following intramuscular administration of Liquamycin\/LA (Pfizers) into the thigh and Terramycin\/LA (Pfizers) G 333 into the neck respectively. Antibiotic residues in the lesions were assessed under ultra violet light and by microbiological means. Antibiotic residues were still detected after 7 weeks in the thigh and 5 weeks in the neck. One week old lesions in the thigh consisted mainly of a local necrotic centre, up to 120 mm in diameter, with a haemorrhagic zone and surrounded by oedema and petechia in adjacent muscle. This was gradually replaced by mainly fibrotic tissue as the weeks went by and eventually by local abscess formation still apparent 10 weeks later. Much the same pattern was seen in the neck but of milder degree and shorter duration - 6 weeks. Alarming is the fact that only in one case out of 40, a lesion could be detected in the carcass on the slaughter line, the others could have passed fit for human consumption in an abattoir. Because the manufacturer suggests a 28 day withholding period before slaughter and after administration of the product, results of this investigation raise several questions on format, completeness and contents of such directions for use and their implications for meat inspection, meat hygiene and public health.","1599":"Fleece-rot is a disease of sheep manifested by a superficial dermatitis with seropurulent exudation and matting and, in some cases, pigmentation of wool which occurs following periods of excessive wetness. In Australia it is recognised as the most important predisposing factor to body blowfly strike, and as such represents a major loss to the Australian wool growing industry. This review of the literature suggests that there is no reason for the condition not to be intermittently a significant problem under South African conditions. A long term solution to the problem is achieved by the breeding of resistant sheep. Measurement of fleece wettability is possibly the best method of distinguishing resistant from susceptible sheep.","1600":"Ionized and total calcium levels were determined in 29 Friesian and 5 Drakensberger cows. One Friesian cow had parturient paresis and specimens were taken before and after treatment. It is suggested that due to the easy reliable way in which ionized calcium levels can now be determined this investigation should replace total calcium estimations in dairy cows presenting with parturient paresis. Ionized calcium levels serve as a valuable diagnostic aid but are also important to assess the effectivity of treatment for this condition.","1601":"","1602":"Myocardial pathology of ruminants in southern Africa, including lesions associated with toxic plants, other toxic agents, infectious agents and nutritional deficiency, is discussed with regard to recognition and to aetiological diagnosis. Findings are included which have not been published elsewhere. The importance and difficulties in recognition of myocardial lesions at an early stage are emphasized. Further research into the pathology of cardiac failure caused by toxic plants is clearly needed.","1603":"Previously used and sterilized fluid administration tubes, bottles and bags were utilized to replace expensive equipment. Urine output and central venous pressure can be readily monitored and thoracic or abdominal fluid can be easily drained using the equipment described.","1604":"A case of maduromycosis mycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis is reported. The horse presented with multiple subcutaneous swelling over the right scapula. There were no discharging fistulae present. Macroscopically the lesion contained a black granular material embedded in a granulomatous mass. Microscopically large numbers of microcolonies were present containing segmented hyphae. No typical chlamydospores were observed. Cultures yielded a fungus identified as Madurella mycetomatis. Treatment consisted of surgical excision and local treatment with thiabendazole powder.","1605":"Intussusception of the distal small intestine was observed in a 5-week old ostrich chick. The intussusception occurred at the point of attachment of the yolk sac and was speculated as being a predisposing cause to the problem, as a result of localised infection. Other predisposing causes seen in poultry such as enteritis, tumours, parasites and diet, were not evident in this case.","1606":"Opportunities have been taken to examine sundry game animals for parasites over the past 2 years. A host parasite check list is presented from which it may be noted that Oesophagostomum columbianum is recorded for the first time in the red hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus and Haemochus bedfordi for the first time in the eland Taurotragus oryx.","1607":"Bacteria associated with subclinical mastitis were isolated from machine-milked dairy herds in the Bloemfontein area supplying fresh milk during the period July to December 1980. The 151 quarter milk samples examined, were also subjected to somatic cell counts. Identification of the isolated bacterial strains showed that Staphylococcus aureus was the dominant mastitis-associated organism, constituting 66,4% of all bacteria isolated. Compared with other recent mastitis surveys a low prevalence of classical mastitis streptococci (0,7%) and of Gram-negative bacterial infections (6,3%) was encountered. The Gram-negative bacteria were almost invariably isolated from neglected herds in which the cows were generally in poor condition and the hygienic measures employed were totally inadequate. Other bacterial strains isolated included Corynebacterium bovis (6,3%) and the coagulase negative staphylococci (11,0%). The high somatic cell counts of the quarter milk samples yielding S. aureus, the mastitis streptococci and the Gram-negative bacteria suggested a major pathogenic role for these isolates. The frequent occurrence of C. bovis strains and coagulase negative staphylococci in samples with high somatic cell counts similarly suggested that these organisms were more pathogenic than is generally assumed.","1608":"An outbreak of listerial meningo-encephalitis involving sheep in the Western Cape Province is recorded. Poor management practices which are described were thought to be principal precipitating cause.","1609":"An adult Derby eland bull, Taurotragus derbianus (Grey) kept in captivity showed wasting over a period of 3 months. It died from acute inhalation pneumonia while being transported in an immobilized state. Post mortem examination revealed a chronic ulcerative abomasitis. Histopathologically it was established that the abomasitis resulted from penetration of the mucosa by awns of plant material.","1610":"50 dairy cows were alternately either given no perinatal treatment or were given an intramuscular injection of oxytetracycline in a 2-pyrrolidone base at a dosage rate of 20 mg\/kg body mass. The incidence of metritis in the untreated (control) group was 46 out of 120 cows (38,3%), while in the treated group there were 30 metritis cows out of 130 (23%)--a statistically significant difference.","1611":"Broiler chicken carcasses were injected with latex to determine the number and location of the air sacs and the presence of diverticula. The adverse affect of Escherichia coli air sacculitis spreading into the diverticula is discussed.","1612":"","1613":"","1614":"Two clinical cases of Johne's disease are reported. There was a total absence of diarrhoea in one case despite a clinical course of the disease of more than 18 months. Typical gut lesions found on necropsy were confined to the small intestine. The diagnosis was confirmed on histopathological examination, and the finding of acid fast staining organisms and a retrospective complement fixation test on stored serum. The result of an intravenous avian tuberculin test conducted on the second case was inconclusive. This was attributed to the animal's temperament.","1615":"The clinical signs, response to treatment and features of the spirochaete, Borrelia theileri as was found in a horse with suspected borreliasis are described.","1616":"Six 1 1\/2-month old ostrich chickens in the Upington district of the Cape Province developed lameness. Two died and pathological examination of one of them revealed lesions identical to those of white muscle disease in the larger muscle groups. Vitamin E-selenium therapy cured the other 4. The diet of the animals consisted mainly of lucerne (alfalfa).","1617":"A case of primary renal cell carcinoma in a 16-year-old mare is reported. The main presenting signs of chronic weight loss and diarrhoea as well as the initial laboratory examination did not directly indicate renal involvement. Follow-up investigations were strongly suggestive of avain tuberculosis. Further laboratory investigation revealed neoplasia, which was confirmed at autopsy.","1618":"Three cases of feminising syndrome are described in the male dog. All cases showed similar symptoms, alopecia being the most noticeable. Differential diagnosis is discussed. The beneficial effect of castration is recorded.","1619":"Carbon fibre implants were used on 52 knees to repair the torn cranial cruciate ligament. A surgical technique similar to the \"over-the-top\" method utilizing carbon fibre instead of fascia lata was used. The advantages and disadvantages of this technique are discussed. It is, however, necessary to do long term assessment of the results.","1620":"The severed cranial cruciate ligament of Beagles was replaced with a carbon fibre tow. Post-operatively the animals were evaluated clinically and radiographically. The animals were sacrificed and specimens collected for histology. There was marked infiltration of the implant by granulation tissue which matured into longitudinally orientated collagen fibres to form a new ligament. A foreign body reaction which occurred at about 12 weeks subsided after a few more weeks. Fracture of the implant was present in a high percentage of knees. The advantages and disadvantages are discussed and technical errors identified.","1621":"Studies on defence mechanisms in mice and farm animals are demonstrated. The results indicate that selective breeding might become a more important tool in disease control. But intensive research work is required before a \"General Disease Resistance Index\" can be used in animal breeding. More common efforts of research workers in veterinary medicine and animal breeding are necessary.","1622":"The efficacy of ivermectin, injected subcutaneously at a dosage rate of 200 mcg\/kg live mass, was determined against nematodes, ixodid ticks and lice infestations acquired by free-living impala, Aepyceros melampus, in the Kruger National Park. Although the parasite burdens of the untreated control animals varied considerably, ivermectin appeared to be highly effective against 7 nematode species and effective against 3 others. Of the 4 tick species recovered, only Boophilus decoloratus appeared to have been affected. In the case of the lice infestations, ivermectin was highly effective against 3 species of Linognathus, but ineffective against the 2 Damalinia species present.","1623":"The persistent anthelmintic effect of ivermectin given subcutaneously at 200 mcg\/kg was evaluated against induced infections of Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi, Cooperia spp. (C. pectinata and C. punctata), Bunostomum phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum in cattle. Forty-four Friesian bull calves raised under worm-free conditions were restrictively randomized to one untreated control group and 3 ivermectin treated groups of equal size according to mass. Animals in the different treated groups were treated either 9, 7 or 5 d before infestation, which was induced in all animals on the same day. The results are presented as percentage reduction and Non Parametric claims. Nine days after treatment the effect of ivermectin was virtually undiminished against O. ostertagi and B. phlebotomum and 7 d after treatment against Cooperia spp. Counts of all worms were reduced by 99% or more following the treatment given 5 d before infection. According to the Non Parametric Method, \"A\" claims (i.e. 80% effective in 80% of the treated animals) were achieved against all 5 worms up to 7 d after treatment and against O. ostertagi and B. phlebotomum up to 9 d after treatment.","1624":"","1625":"Three thoroughbred foals were treated with anti-endotoxin hyperimmune serum. The serum was injected into the affected joint spaces. Two of the foals made a complete recovery.","1626":"A 4-year-old Miniature Pinscher was presented with bilateral cataracts which were surgically successfully removed. Severe bilateral superficial corneal oedema developed within 6 days. A bilateral superficial keratectomy and membrana nictitans flaps cured the disease. It was found that after the lentectomy the owner had used a hypertonic salt solution as an eyewash.","1627":"The causes, electrocardiographic diagnosis and treatment of hyperkalaemia the dog and cat are briefly discussed.","1628":"pH changes were measured in vitro in rumenfluid obtained from a natural case of rumen acidosis after the addition of 8 different antacids. Results showed magnesium oxide to be very potent with the potential danger of causing severe rumen alkalosis. Calcium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate gave satisfactory results while the alkalinising ability of magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, calcium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate seemed both slow and ineffective.","1629":"A pilot trial with 2 sheep per group demonstrated that no protection is provided by cysteine, sulphur or sodium thiosulphate, when administered simultaneously with daily doses of Geigeria filifolia plant material. Treatment with piracetam of 4 sheep showing symptoms of vermeersiekte did not improve their recovery rate. Serum enzyme activity tests for creatine phosphokinase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase were of no diagnostic use.","1630":"Records indicate that Parafilaria bovicola-infested cattle slaughtered at the Cato Ridge abattoir originate from certain areas not previously recorded. Furthermore, moderate to severe infestations are diagnosed significantly more frequently in the entire male bovine than in female animals or oxen (castrated males). The data under review cover the period March 1981-August 1982, a period of 18 months.","1631":"","1632":"Three healthy lactating quarters of a Friesland cow were each experimentally infected with a pure culture of a strain of either Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum or a Peptostreptococcus sp. respectively. The onset and progression to clinical mastitis was monitored 12 hourly by examination for clinical signs of inflammation, bacterial culture, somatic cell counts and with a strip cup. All infected quarters developed clinical mastitis within 24 hours. The 2 quarters infected with B. fragilis and E. lentum respectively were treated 4 times consecutively at 12 hour intervals, commencing at 24 h by intramammary instillation of 10 ml of a mixture containing 200 mg lincomycin hydrochloride, 200 mg neomycin sulphate and 5 mg methylprednisolone (Lincocin Forte, Upjohn). Both quarters became clinically normal and no bacteria could be detected in the secretions 12 hours after the first treatment. At 36 hours the strip cup became negative, and the somatic cell count dropped to less than 500 X 10(3) at 72 hours after the initial treatment. The quarter infected with a Peptostreptococcus sp. was unable to overcome the infection by natural means when intramammary treatment was delayed for the first 36 hours after the onset of clinical mastitis. Subsequent treatment of this quarter gave results similar to those treated earlier.","1633":"A polyvinylpyrrolidone formulation of oxytetracycline was injected intramuscularly into 5 sheep at 2 different dosages of 10 mg and 20 mg\/kg body mass respectively. Plasma levels were determined. The higher dosage not only attained a higher peak value, but the concentration at 12 hours was 0.5 micrograms\/ml. At the lower dosage rate a level of 0,63 micrograms\/ml was recorded 32 hours after administration when that of the higher dosage rate was 1,5 micrograms\/ml.","1634":"A practical method was developed to remove the different permanent teeth of the dog as atraumatically as possible and with a minimal risk of complications. Emphasis is placed on the importance of completely loosening the root from its periodontal attachment and subsequently lifting the tooth out by means of a root elevator, instead of forceful extraction with an extraction forceps. Specific considerations for each tooth are given.","1635":"The study involves bilateral ovariectomy in bitches followed by the monitoring of oestradiol, thyroxine and total triiodothyronine levels in order to study control mechanism alterations. Levels of oestradiol dropped significantly following surgery to reach basal concentrations after 2 weeks. Serum total thyroxine, free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine decreased following ovariectomy to stabilize in a steady state within 3 weeks of surgery. Levels of thyroid-binding globulin initially increased as a result of oestrogen ablation, thereafter levels decreased steadily. Modification of the hypothalamo-thyroxine-releasing hormone receptor site and changes in androgens and thyroid-binding globulins are discussed as possible causes for the changes in circulating thyroid hormone concentrations.","1636":"A method using methotrexate for horse lymphocyte cell synchronization and thymidine for incorporation into DNA replication is described. This method provides a powerful technique for the study of chromosomal abnormalities and detailed analysis of chromosomal replication patterns. The determination of horse karyotypes with many similar chromosomes needs a special method which reveals the numerous and informative stages of the cell cycle. Horse lymphocyte cell cultures treated with colcemid (20 min) and harvested 6 hours after the release of the 17 hour-block with methotrexate show the best results for exact identification and analysis of horse chromosomes.","1637":"Simple methods are explained which enable private practitioners to organise and understand month-end financial information and consequently to react thereto.","1638":"A 10-month-old Great Dane dog was presented showing lameness in the left foreleg. Radiographic examination revealed a severe bony reaction of the left distal radius and ulna. The reaction together with associated soft tissue swelling increased dramatically over a 6 week period. A diagnosis of osteogenic sarcoma was confirmed histologically and the dog was euthanased. Metastases were found post mortem in the left prescapular lymph node and left lung.","1639":"A case of adenovirus pneumonia in a puppy is described. The emphasis is on histopathology where an alveolitis with typical Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions in macrophages, pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells were the most significant findings. The literature on the subject is briefly reviewed.","1640":"The presently available data on canine parvovirus is reviewed with particular emphasis on the degree of immunity provided by the various types of vaccines commercially available, the interference of active immunisation by maternally-derived antibody, and the recommendations as to age of vaccination.","1641":"The history, geographical distribution, clinical signs, pathology and virology of pigeon herpesvirus infection and pigeon herpesvirus encephalomyelitis are briefly reviewed. A case of pigeon herpesvirus infection was diagnosed on clinical, macro- and histopathological appearance and confirmed by isolation of the virus in embryonated eggs, its growth in tissue culture, and by electron microscopy.","1642":"Lymphosarcoma of the mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes with peritoneal and mediastinal implantations, as well as widespread intravascular metastases and thrombosis with haemorrhages was diagnosed in a spotted hyena.","1643":"","1644":"The clinical importance of S - T segment changes in the dog is briefly discussed and illustrated by cases with severe ventricular anoxia and haemopericardium.","1645":"","1646":"Fibrosarcoma in a cat was repeatedly treated unsuccessfully by surgery and chemotherapy, which included drugs such as amethopterin sodium at very high dosages, vincristine sulphate and doxyrubicine hydrochloride.","1647":"Ersipelas, a common disease of swine, is caused by Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The organism was isolated in a blood culture taken from an infected captive dolphin. The dolphin showed typical subacute symptoms of square- and diamond-shaped skin lesions as seen in swine. It was surmised, in retrospect, that the disease was secondary to a primary pneumonia. The symptoms, clinical pathology and other special examinations, treatment and response are discussed.","1648":"The clinical criteria used to establish a diagnosis of Spirocerca lupi infestation in dogs are discussed, with special emphasis on the radiographic feature that may be observed. Plain radiographs show a typical grey circumscribed area posterior to the heart. Following the administration of a barium meal this area takes on a dappled appearance due to barium accumulated in the crypts of the S. lupi granuloma. The granuloma itself may be outlined by the barium.","1649":"Blood selenium concentrations of clinically healthy sheep were determined using a neutron activation technique. Although the number of samples were relatively small, the selenium concentration in the blood of sheep in the Kroonstad district appeared to be fairly normal. In the Bethlehem and Fouriesburg districts on the other hand, the blood selenium levels indicated the possible appearance of selenium responsive diseases.","1650":"Seventeen Merino sheep in the Springbokfontein region of the Orange Free State were found to harbour Strobiloestrus sp. larvae in cutaneous nodules in the flank and rump regions of their bodies. The life cycle, however, could apparently not be completed in the sheep as the larvae left the nodules without developing further. Mountain reedbuck, running with the sheep, were also infested and were a probable source of infestation for the sheep.","1651":"Angora goats may develop a characteristic ventral oedema of the subcutaneous tissue which is not unlike the 'wet-carcass syndrome' of sheep. The plasma of oedematous goats shows a lower total protein concentration, a lower colloid osmotic pressure and a lower albumin: globulin ratio than that of normal goats. Similarly, interstitial fluid of oedematous goats has a lower protein concentration, osmolality and colloid osmotic pressure than the fluid from normal but a similar albumin:globulin ratio. These results suggest that, unlike the 'wet-carcass syndrome' of sheep, the most likely explanation for the oedema is hypoproteinaemia which leads to filtration of fluid and an increased capillary permeability.","1652":"Various surgical methods for the treatment of supracondylar femoral fractures involving the epiphyseal growth plates in young growing dogs and cats were studied. Some of the open reduction and fixation techniques are briefly reviewed with emphasis on some of the complications that may develop in the stifle joint. Good results were obtained with the single Steinmann pin method in cats and small breeds of dogs. The parallel Kirschner wire technique as well as the cross Rush pin method was easier to apply in medium and large dog breeds, and resulted in a rigid fixation of the distal femoral condyles.","1653":"Two native humpless types of Bos taurus cattle which are tolerant to trypanosomiasis were described in West Africa at the beginning of this century. In spite of the fact that they are small breeds, they already represent some 25% of all cattle present in the region. Their importation into the Congo basin countries has resulted in the development of a cattle industry. Some of the available data on these types are given and discussed. The possibility of satisfying the growing hunger for protein of Africa with trypanotolerant cattle is emphasized.","1654":"The complex trait \"productive adaptability\" is shown to be a useful parameter for selection work in tropical climates. Characters such as rectal temperature in poultry and hair colour and structure in cattle used as indicators of heat tolerance prove to be of little value. \"Productive adaptability\" is also genetically more suited for selection procedures. Our results confirm that body size is a significant indicator of an animal's productive adaptability and that it is a suitable criterion for use in improving the genetic potential of livestock in warm climates. The special use of major genes in breeding programmes to improve productive adaptability is demonstrated.","1655":"Non-pregnant Thoroughbred mares were stabled and subjected to 2 trials, each 24 h in duration, to establish their total consumption of a mixture of freshly cut, lush green perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) in approximately equal proportions; and to compare the total intake of crude protein, calcium, phosphorus and mass of the grass mixture on a dry matter basis with their daily nutritional requirements. The body mass of each mare was calculated at the commencement of each trial. In the first trial 2 lactating mares with foals at foot, 65 days and 8 days of age, and one mature non-lactating mare, consumed 75,5 kg, 61,0 kg and 39,5 kg of the grass mixture, cut in the early vegetative stage, respectively. The perennial ryegrasss (L. perenne) contained 79,63% moisture, 1,67% crude protein, 0,75% calcium, 0.057% phosphorus and 20.37% dry matter. The cocksfoot (D. glomerata) contained 79,52% moisture, 2,27% crude protein, 0,051% calcium, 0,061% phosphorus and 20,48% dry matter. The younger foal did not eat the grass mixture. The mass of grass mixture consumed by the older foal was not determined. In the second trial conducted 3 weeks later, when oat straw (Avena sativa) was also fed ad lib itum, the same lactating mares, but a different mature non-lactating mare, consumed 54.5 kg, 56.0 kg and 40.5 kg of the grass mixture, cut in the mid bloom stage, respectively. The perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) contained 70,03% moisture, 2,37% crude protein, 0,086% calcium 0,068% phosphorus and 29,97 dry matter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1656":"Afrikander cows rarely drop \"grey\" (very pale yellow) calves with or without goitre. These 2 defects have been recorded among calves in 2 herds. In one of these herds, all affected calves were the progeny of a particular bull when bred to its own daughters and closely related cows. The bull responsible on the other farm apparently inherited the pathogenic genes for goitre and grey colour also from his paternal and maternal ancestry respectively. Both sires are fairly closely related. Both bulls and the cows they sired must have been heterozygous for both abnormal genes to produce homozygous offspring. There is evidence that the factors concerned segregate according to Mendelian rules during the second generation. These anomalies appear to be simple (autosomal) recessive genes and when combined in the same animal, are usually lethal.","1657":"Newly weaned calves with no previous exposure to Homeria pallida were dosed with H. pallida material prepared as a broth, a suspension of charred leaves of leaves chopped into small shreds. Three hours later they were put into a camp where H. pallida constituted 50% of the grazing. Equal numbers of animals in each of the treated groups and in the untreated group subsequently developed H. pallida poisoning. By about the 4th day, both the treated and untreated animals appeared to have adapted to H. pallida and to avoid it while grazing.","1658":"Cattle mange causes economic losses in South Africa. Two full efficacy trials and 6 field trials with phoxim demonstrated good efficacy against 3 species of mites causing cattle mange.","1659":"Two field isolates of Ostertagia spp. of sheep from the Swellendam and Malmesbury districts in the south-western Cape were shown to be resistant to benzimidazole anthelmintics. At therapeutic dosage rates albendazole was 32,5%, thiabendazole 0%, oxfendazole 14,9% and morantel 91,4% effective against the adult stage of Ostertagia spp. in naturally infested lambs at Swellendam. Efficacy against the adult stage of the same isolate of Ostertagia spp. in artificially infested sheep in the laboratory was tested at dosage rates of albendazole 3,8% mg\/kg or 7,6 mg\/kg, mebendazole 15 mg\/kg, levamisole 7,5 mg\/kg and morantel 14,5 mg\/kg and varied from 0%, 0%, 1,9% 53,9% and 87,0% respectively. Albendazole, the only anthelmintic tested against the Malmesbury strain of Ostertagia spp. was 9,8% effective against the adult stage in naturally infested lambs. Trichostrongylus spp. and Nematodirus spp. simultaneously present in these animals were fully susceptible to all the anthelmintics tested.","1660":"Carcasses of sheep from various areas in South Africa and South West Africa (Namibia) show a wet glistening appearance immediately after slaughter. The subcutaneous interstitial fluid of these sheep has a significantly lower protein concentration and colloid osmotic pressure and a significantly higher albumin\/globulin ratio than that of normal sheep. These results imply the presence of an oedema and an increased capillary permeability to protein. They suggest that histamine, or an histamine-like substance, mediates the changes.","1661":"Serological evidence for the occurrence of L. pomona associated with abortions in cattle was supported by the successful isolation of the organism from the urine of a cow. Leptospirosis should be considered as a possible cause of abortion even in relatively dry regions.","1662":"A group of 26 cattle was shipped from Houston, Texas to Cape Town. Inadequate preparation of the cattle for the voyage, poor feed and poor crate construction resulted in stress-induced respiratory disease and mortality. Measures to avoid unnecessary stress when shipping cattle are discussed.","1663":"A description of the clinical signs and pathological changes is given of 2 outbreaks of suspected hybrid vetch poisoning in the Humansdorp district, Republic of South Africa. These were characterised by a severe dermatitis, high morbidity and mortality in older cows. Microscopically granulomatous lesions occurred in the kidneys, liver, myocardium, spleen and skin. Variable numbers of multinucleated giant cells and eosinophils were seen in these lesions. Acute multifocal hepatic necrosis was observed in 2 animals. Brief comparisons are made with outbreaks of vetch poisoning in other parts of the world.","1664":"","1665":"","1666":"Deaths occurred in cattle from poisoning after hand-spraying with arsenical dip used at incorrect concentration. Treatment with sodium thiosulphate was delayed, but partly successful.","1667":"A diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made in an approximately 3-year-old mongrel bitch based on physical, radiographic and electromyographic findings as well as on the response of the patient to an anticholinesterase drug. The patient responded favourably to parenteral treatment with an anticholinesterase drug but did not respond to oral administration of the drug. When the drug was given orally in combination with corticosteroids it had a long-lasting and favourable effect on the patient.","1668":"","1669":"A 1-month-old male Bulldog pup was presented with severe dyspnoea and was also unable to stand. Radiographs revealed a considerable dorsoventral flattening of the thoracic cavity, resulting in a reduced intrathoracic volume. The scapula of each foreleg was malpositioned on the thorax, resulting in the inability to adduct the legs and carry the body weight. The clinical signs are typical of an animal suffering from osteochondrodysplasia.","1670":"Two modifications are described whereby a closed circle anaesthetic system is converted to a semi-closed anaesthetic system for use in dogs and cats of less than 10 kg body mass.","1671":"Evidence presented shows a 585% increase in the compounded total carcase condemnations for parafilariasis at the Cato Ridge abattoir in the year July 1981\/June 1982 as compared with July 1979\/June 1980. There is also evidence which points to condemnations occurring in bi-annual cycles with peaks in November\/December and June.","1672":"The ovarian morphology of the springbok is described, using material of 1 290 ewes collected at the De Beers farm, Benfontein. A deep longitudinal recess in foetal ovaries. The right ovary was slightly larger than the left ovary according to its linear and mass measurements. Considerable distortion of the amygdaloidal ovarian shape occurred in the presence of a protruding corpus luteum. Ovaries were much flattened during advanced pregnancy. A description of the appearance of intra-ovarian corpora observed in macroscopical sections is given. No predilection for the site of ovulation was observed.","1673":"The effects of ovariectomy and autotransplantation of the ovaries to the portal vein drainage area (ATOPA) were studied in 45 bitches. Parameters obtained were thyroid function, oestradiol level, work performance and body mass. At 35 weeks post-operatively no change could be shown in work performance; at 55 weeks body mass was unchanged; at 55 weeks oestradiol level and thyroid function were reduced in ovariectomised subjects and normal in ATOPA subjects. It is concluded that ATOPA may prevent the development of the post-ovariectomy eunuchoid syndrome.","1674":"Parturition was induced in 6 mares between Day 327 and 346 of pregnancy using oxytocin (Group I) and in 6 mares between Day 315 and 330 of pregnancy with fluprostenol in combination with oxytocin (Group II). A third group of 4 mares which served as controls were allowed to go to full term (322-340 days) and foal down normally. Parturition occurred within 24-102 min (mean = 61,4; SD = 31,6) in 5 of the Group I mares and within 160-185 min (mean = 173; SD = 10,86) in the mares of Group II. Expulsion of the afterbirth took place between 7 and 206 min (mean = 79; SD = 76,38) and between 7 and 73 min (mean = 37,5; SD = 21,29) in Groups I and II respectively. Three of 6 mares in the oxytocin group showed foal heat, all 3 conceived and 2 carried foals to term. Of the remaining 3 mares, 2 showed heat approximately one month after parturition, and were served and conceived but one aborted due to babsesiosis and one resorbed while the third remained in anoestrus for 3-4 months. In the combined treatment group, 3 mares showed foal heat of which only 2 were served. Both conceived and one carried a foal to term. One of the remaining mares showed oestrus 2 months after parturition while the remaining 2 mares showed oestrus approximately one month after parturition. Both were served, one conceived but subsequently resorbed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1675":"Fenbendazole, dosed to experimentally infested sheep at 5 mg\/kg live mass, against immature Dictyocaulus filaria, was more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the animals.","1676":"Fenbendazole, dosed to artificially infested cattle at 5 mg\/kg live mass, was more than 60% effective in more than 60% of the treated animals against 1-7 day-old Dictyocaulus viviparus larvae reducing the worm load by 87%. It was more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the treated animals against 8-21 day-old worms and 21-34 day-old worms and reduced the worm burdens by 99% in both cases.","1677":"A case is presented of a dog with a lymphocytic lymphosarcoma of the rectum without systemic involvement. The dog showed bloody stools and rectal prolapse. The diagnosis and treatment is discussed.","1678":"Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen was detected in a cat from Cape Town which was subjected to euthanasia after a long history of upper respiratory infection and progressive emaciation. Based on the necropsy findings and subsequent histopathological examinations, a diagnosis of lymphosarcoma was made. It is regarded as likely that this tumour was caused by infection with FeLV.","1679":"Ten 6-toothed Boergoat does and 215 Boergoat kids were injected by the intravenous route with the Onderstepoort heartwater blood vaccine and then temperatured daily. On Day 10, all the does had rectal temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C and were treated with oxytetracycline intravenously, while the kids received an intramuscular injection of the antibiotic. One kid died from heartwater on Day 11. On Day 15, 7 does had a febrile reaction and all the does and kids were treated as before. Two does died of heartwater on Days 16 and 17 respectively, while 12 kids developed heartwater on Day 17 and 6 kids on Day 18. All were treated for heartwater. A total of 2 does (20%) and 16 kids (7.4%) died during the experiment.","1680":"Two thoroughbred mares bearing twins as diagnosed by rectal palpation, were subjected to nutritional stress by drastically reducing the daily ration. This resulted in a marked reduction in plasma progestagen levels and the death of either one or both of the twin embryos.","1681":"A lethal dose of succinyldicholine was administered to 3 unanaesthetised and 4 pentobarbitone-anaesthetised, non-ventilated sheep. When compared to the unanaesthetised sheep, the anaesthetised sheep had smaller increases in arterial and central venous blood pressure, blood glucose and plasma catecholamines. It was concluded that the difference in response between the groups could largely be ascribed to conscious perception of asphyxia in the awake group with resulting fear.","1682":"Paresis of the limbs of two 4-month-old ostriches fed a diet predominantly of crushed maize was investigated. Raised levels of serum aspartate transaminase and creatine kinase were demonstrated in both birds. The less severely affected ostrich recovered after a single intramuscular injection of a vitamin E-selenium preparation but the other died despite therapy. An autopsy of the latter revealed focal pale areas in the thigh muscle. Microscopically affected muscle fibres showed degeneration, necrosis and regenerative changes. Fibrinoid degeneration and necrosis of some arterioles was observed as well as varying degrees of interstitial fibrosis. The above findings suggest a diagnosis of vitamin E-selenium deficiency.","1683":"Isometamidium, amicarbalide and diminazene were used to treat experimentally induced canine babesiosis. Relapse parasitaemias developed after treatment in all groups of animals. The relapse interval, however, was shorter and more relapses occurred after treatment with amicarbalide than either of the other 2 drugs. Only half of the dogs treated with either isometamidium or diminazene relapsed to infection. Challenge with homologous parasites 62 days after initial infection resulted in severe babesiosis in all 3 animals which had not developed relapse infections. Of the 9 animals which had relapses after treatment only 1 developed severe babesiosis following homologous challenge.","1684":"Copper deficiency was diagnosed in piglets from a farm in the Transvaal. The mortality rate among 5 to 8-week-old piglets had been sporadic but considerably high over a 12 month period. Affected animals showed signs of ataxia, posterior paresis, horizontal nystagmus, inability to stand and front and hind limb paddling movements. Death ensued from 3-5 days after the onset of clinical signs. A paucity of myelin in the spinal cord and degenerative lesions involving elastic fibres of the aorta and pulmonary artery were detected. Tissue copper levels were low in both clinically affected and unaffected piglets on the farm, and the copper content of the diet fed to sows and growing piglets was considered inadequate. The lesions related to copper deficiency are described with emphasis on those in the spinal cord and great blood vessels, and the pathologic processes resulting in hypocupraemic lesions are considered.","1685":"Questionnaires were sent out to 68 registered female veterinary surgeons in South Africa to obtain career information essential to vocational guidance. The 46 respondents represent 51,7% of the 89 female BVSc graduates up to 1981; their average age was 33,3 years, 63% were married, 30,4% were from the Pretoria area, 60,9% were living in the Transvaal, 52,2% had had 6 and more years of veterinary experience. All the comparisons done indicated that the response group was representative of the women who had obtained the BVSc degree from the University of Pretoria. Some of the more important findings were the following: No less than 97,8% of the response group are at present actively engaged in veterinary work--73,9% on a full-time basis. Asked what they would choose now, 84,8% of the respondents declared that they would choose veterinary science once again; 67,4% would like to see their daughters enter the profession. The most important reason for this positive attraction towards veterinary practice was given as \"job satisfaction experienced\". Respondents indicated the things that they liked about veterinary practice: factors intrinsic to the job like surgery, pathology and research topped the list followed by the opportunity to work with and help animals and also the variety experienced in their work. The most important grievances were firstly the general attitude and actions of the public--callousness of animal-owners and inconsiderate behaviour towards practitioners. Long and irregular hours, administrative red tape and insufficient technical help were also complaints.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1686":"Three outbreaks of fatal cardiomyopathy in feedlot sheep are reported which were associated with the introduction of pelleted feed that contained greater than recommended concentrations of monensin. Gross and histopathological examination of some of these sheep revealed evidence of cardiomyopathy. Myocardial lesions which had a predominantly epicardial distribution are described. Lesions were also observed in skeletal muscle and in brain.","1687":"Renal, pulmonary and vascular calcification was observed in 2 suckling puppies. The lesions were similar to those associated with hypervitaminosis D and possibly hypervitaminosis A. It was suspected that high contents of vitamin D and A in the diet of the lactating bitch had elevated the activity of these vitamins in the milk to levels toxic for the suckling puppies.","1688":"The most common association of veterinarians in private practice is that of partnership. Some such relationships are not happy and may not endure. The concept of partnership is examined and suggestions are made which will minimise dissension.","1689":"The validity of goodwill payments when partners enter or leave practice is doubtful. The present situation in veterinary private practice in the Republic is described and compared with other professions. This profession is urged to review its attitude.","1690":"The South African Encephalartos species which are known or have been shown experimentally to be toxic and\/or carcinogenic are reviewed briefly. The kernel of E. lanatus, the toxic and carcinogenic principle of which is macrozamin, is a potent hepatotoxin and carcinogen when fed to rats. Renal mesenchymal tumours were the most common neoplasm to be induced but hepatocellular carcinoma also developed in one animal. The potential danger to man and animals of ingestion of the seeds of Encephalartos species is emphasized.","1691":"The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and\/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.","1692":"","1693":"","1694":"","1695":"The exact location of the urethral diverticulum of the bull was determined. It was found to lie 80-100 mm caudal to the colliculus seminalis, at the transition from the pelvic to the penile urethra. The presence of the diverticulum makes catheterization of the urinary bladder via the penile urethra very difficult.","1696":"","1697":"Semen obtained from a pure-bred Beagle was diluted 1:3 with a Tris (hydroxymethyl) - aminomethane buffered egg yolk diluent, centrifuged at 450 g for 10 minutes and the spermatozoa thus concentrated stored in 8 Cassou mini straws (0,25 ml) in liquid nitrogen. One month after collection, a single semen straw was thawed, rediluted with 4 ml of diluent containing no glycerol and inseminated into a Beagle in oestrus. This was repeated daily for 4 days. The vagina of the bitch was flushed with 4 ml of the diluent immediately prior to insemination on each occasion. The bitch whelped 7 pups 60 days after the first insemination.","1698":"The approximate minimal effective dose of activated charcoal, given to sheep 12 h after the administration of a lethal dose of Moreae polystachya, was found to be 2 g\/kg. Serum cation levels remained within normal limits throughout the experiment.","1699":"The occurrence of a urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma in a dog is reported. The spontaneous occurrence of such tumours is rare in dogs and in this case no aetiological or predisposing factors for the development of this tumour could be determined. Histologically, the tumour was classified as a papillary, invasive transitional cell carcinoma.","1700":"Tranquilization using 3 mg\/kg of ketamine by intramuscular injection followed by inhalation anaesthesia using halothane was performed on an adult Cape fur seal in order to perform a metatarsal amputation and ophthalmic examination. Ketamine was found to have little effect at the dosage used while halothane proved to be a rapid induction agent providing a safe, continued level of surgical anaesthesia. Variations in cardiac rate and body temperature were recorded during anesthasia and blood was sampled for haematology.","1701":"Five crocodiles kept in captivity for more than 4 years died within a period of 4 days. A post mortem examination of one showed that it had died from gastric impaction which had resulted from the feeding of guinea pigs. It was thought that the high ratio of hair to flesh in guinea pigs together with daily feeding cause the impaction.","1702":"Six out of 6 steers survived a lethal dose of Moraea polystachya (blue tulp) when treated with activated charcoal alone and 3 out of 4 wethers survived when treated with activated charcoal plus potassium chloride. Barbeque charcoal was not of therapeutic value. An increase in the level of serum potassium served as indicator of acute poisoning in only a third of the animals.","1703":"Serum cortisol levels were found to be higher in a group of captive untamed black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) than in a group of tame black-backed jackals. Repeated venipuncture of domestic dogs in an accustomed environment did not result in a rise in serum cortisol levels. Translocation of these dogs to a new environment resulted in a rapid but transient rise in serum cortisol levels.","1704":"A review of the literature concerning the role of selenium in livestock is presented. Selenium was originally known for its toxicity but in 1957 it was discovered that supplementation of this element prevented liver necrosis in rats. The occurrence of selenium in soils and uptake by plants is discussed, as well as the biochemistry, metabolism, interactions with other elements and nutrients, known functions, requirements of livestock and its toxicity.","1705":"Prostaglandin F 2 alpha THAM was administered to 6 bitches at various stages after service at dosages ranging from 30-250 micrograms\/kg for 2-6 days. Four bitches treated between Days 21-42 after second service did not produce pups irrespective of dosage and duration of administration. A bitch treated in the first trimester and another in the third trimester did not abort but gave birth to normal litters. Two unserved bitches were also treated in the first 20 days of metoestrus with no drop in plasma progesterone being evident. It would seem that prostaglandin F2 alpha THAM is useful as a luteolytic agent only in the second trimester. Although side effects of mild panting with occasional vomiting and\/or defecation were sometimes noted at all dosage levels, they were milder at the recommended lower dosage of 30 micrograms\/kg administered twice daily subcutaneously for 4 days.","1706":"Following concern about the recent publication indicating the possible ability of Brucella abortus to survive commercial pasteurisation of naturally contaminated milk, such milk was subjected to biological (BT), serological and bacteriological tests. The raw milk was Brucella Milk Ring Test positive and biotype I was isolated from 4\/5 BT guinea pigs, the one tested being seropositive to the Rose Bengal Test, and with serum agglutination and complement fixation titres of 160 and 36 international units respectively. After batch (63 degrees C\/30 min) and high temperature, short time (72 degrees C\/15 sec) pasteurisation, all 10 BT guinea pigs were bacteriologically and serologically negative, indicating that officially approved methods of commercial pasteurisation rendered naturally Brucella-contaminated raw milk safe for consumption.","1707":"","1708":"The present study is one of in vivo 99mTc-DTPA renography, successively involving conscious healthy dogs under acepromazine maleate sedation and dogs under the narcotic sodium thiopental. It was found that during the running of the renogram the animal had to be kept completely immobile and that constant infusion narcosis with sodium thiopental produced this immobility without affecting the renograms unduly. However administration of a thiopental bolus did have an adverse effect on the renogram. Sedation with acepromazine maleate significantly increased the time to peak and the excretion phase as presented by the slope. These effects are thought to be due to a decreased blood pressure with concomitant renal bloodpooling and retarded bloodflow. The radioisotope renogram appears to hold great promise for both clinical and research applications. The equipment required for this application however, is so costly that it would only be financially feasible for major centres.","1709":"An intravenous compound 5% calcium solution was subjected to three trials in S.A. Mutton Merino X Merino ewes to establish its safety and also to resultant levels of blood total and particularly ionized calcium. In the first trial, 10 animals each received 20 ml of the compound but the administration time progressively decreased from 90 seconds in the first to only 15 seconds in the last ewe. Plasma total calcium levels more than doubled in all the animals and, except for transient disorientation in the last ewe, nothing untoward was noted. In the second trial 4 ewes again received 20 ml of the compound while in the third trial 5 ewes received the compound at the rate of 0,5 ml\/kg. In both trials the administration time was about 30 seconds. Plasma total and ionized calcium levels more than doubled initially and, while there was a steady and parallel decline in both, they were still more than 60% higher than pre-injection levels after as long as 2 hours.","1710":"A simple modification of Shorr's stain for vaginal cytology is described.

Three species Cyathostomum catinatum, Cylicostephanus longibursatus and Cylicocylus nassatus, were found to be widely distributed. Although various modern anthelmintics with different effective components were used over the past 20 years, no remarkable change has been brought about in the composition of the parasitic species of the horses in the Federal Republic of Germany.","1717":"In a series of 5 trials, in which 115 artificially infected calves were used, larval anthelmintic tests were done to assess the activity of oxfendazole at 4, 5 mg\/kg against all 3 parasitic stages of 6 species of namatodes. An efficacy of over 98% was demonstrated against the 4th stage larvae (L4), 5th and adult stages of Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi, Cooperia pectinata, Bunostomum Phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum and the 3rd larval stage (L3) of H. placei and C. pectinata. Against the L3 of O. ostertagi, B. phlebotomum and O. radiatum efficacies of 81,7%, 92,4% and 97,3% respectively were shown. Against Dictyocaulus viviparus adult, 5th, L4 and L3 efficacies were recorded of 100%, 96,7%, 95,4% and 89,1% respectively. A test for ovicidal activity confirmed that cattle can be safely moved to clean pasture 8 hours after dosing. Complete removal of strobilia of Moniezia benedeni from 25 naturally infested calves followed a dose rate of oxfendazole at 4,5 mg\/kg, but of these each of 4 calves retained one scolex.","1718":"","1719":"Two helminth-free tracer calves were exposed to natural helminth infestation of a farm in the eastern Transvaal Lowveld for one month. On a nearby farm calves grazed with the herd for at least 3 months before slaughter so that the cumulative worm burden could be determined. The gastro-intestinal parasites increased markedly after rain. The major species and order or prevalence were: Cooperia pectinata, Cooperia punctata, Haemonchus placei and Oesophagostomum radiatum; minor species were Bunostomum phlebotomum, Trichostrongylus falculatus, Nematodirus helvetianus, Trichuris spp., Parafilaria bovicola and Paramphistomum spp. The highest worm burdens of Cooperia spp. on the first farm were between December and March and with the exception of O. radiatum, which had a peak in January, the other species reached peak worm burdens on the other farm in March.","1720":"The efficacy of Oncosphere Secretory Antigen (OSA) in protecting sheep against the larval stage of Taenia multiceps was assessed in 47 sheep in 2 trials. In the pilot trial no cerebral coenuri were found in 3 sheep which were treated with OSA 28 and 14 days before challenge with 6 000 eggs of T. multiceps. Cerebral coenuri were present in 3 untreated controls. In the second experiment 30 sheep were similarly treated with OSA and challenged with 5 000 eggs of T. multiceps, while 11 sheep served as untreated controls. At necropsy either developing coenuri or degenerate lesions were present in the brain of 5 (16,6%) of the 30 vaccinated animals while 8 out of 11 (72,7%) of the untreated animals had cerebral coenuri or degenerate lesions in the brain. It is concluded that OSA may be used to protect animals against cerebral coenuriosis.","1721":"","1722":"Molybdenum at levels of 2, 20, 40, and 60 mg\/kg dry matter was added to a sheep ration containing 82 copper and 3, 8 g sulphur per kg dry matter. At the 2 higher levels of molybdenum, a substantial accumulation of copper and molybdenum was observed in the kidney cortices of the South African Mutton Merinos (reported elsewhere). The effect of these treatments on the health of the sheep was investigated. Observations on the 3 molybdenum supplemented treatments were: Serum enzyme levels remained normal throughout the trial. No evidence of kidney damage due to treatment could be obtained from kidney clearance studies. No pronounced liver lesions were evident from histophathological evaluations. A significant increase in Periodic acid Shiff positive stained granules was observed in the cortical tubules of the kidneys at increased molybdenum intakes. However, this was considered to be of minimal physiological significance. It was concluded that molybdenum prevented liver damage due to excess copper and that copper and molybdenum which did accumulate in the kidneys were probably harmless and present in an unavailable form to the body or caused minimal morphological changes. No haemolytic crisis occurred in the sheep receiving no added molybdenum. However, their concentration of serum enzymes Aspartate transaminase and Lactate dehydrogenase increased throughout the 193 day trial. It is suggested that elevated levels of these enzymes may be unreliable indicators of an approaching haemolytic crisis in the Merino.","1723":"","1724":"","1725":"Two outbreaks of oak poisoning in cattle in the Republic of South Africa are described. In the first outbreak 22 out of 80 head of cattle were severely affected while 40 out of a herd of 135 cattle were affected in the second outbreak. Of these 40, only one survived after 9 months despite vigorous treatment. Only young cattle under 2 years were affected during both outbreaks in spite of an average herd age of approximately 6 years in the second group of cattle. Clinical signs included severe weakness with a swaying gait, diarrhoea and dehydration. Some were pot bellied while others were emaciated and remained stunted. The most prominent macroscopic and microscopic lesion present in 3 animals autopsied, was a non-suppurative interstitial nephritis which was accompanied by oedema and ulceration of the caecum and colon. Histochemical studies were carried out on pigment granules observed in kidney sections.","1726":"","1727":"","1728":"","1729":"","1730":"","1731":"","1732":"A study was conducted into the macroscopic and microscopic pathology of arthritic joints obtained from 37 freshly slaughtered pigs condemned for infectious polyarthritis. All the affected joints showed varying degrees of subacute to chronic serofibrinous to fibrino-purulent arthritis with or without pathology of the articular cartilage.","1733":"The efficacy of nitroxynil administered once by subcutaneous injection at a dosage regimen of 20 mg\/kg live mass was evaluated against natural infestations of parafilaria bovicola in cattle. Trial animals were slaughtered 14 weeks after treatment. Treatment reduced the number of bleeding points by 97,8%, eosinophil-positive carcass lesions by 85,7% and eosinophil-positive lesion area by 92,8%, compared with controls.","1734":"","1735":"","1736":"","1737":"The surgical repair of atresia ani accompanied by a large rectovaginal fistula was successfully performed in a 4-month old Dobermann bitch. As a young pup, the dog had been able to pass liquid stool through the vagina via a rectovaginal fistula, but the gradual change to a adult diet had resulted in considerable obstipation and tenesmus. The operation was performed experimentally, since the dog would have had to have been euthanased at this stage, and its success has allowed the dog to continue a satisfactory existence.","1738":"","1739":"","1740":"Five sheep were infested orally with 5,500 eggs of Taenia multiceps and were treated with praziquantel (Droncit, Bayer) when they showed typical nervous signs of coenuriasis. Two sheep were treated with praziquantel at 100 mg\/kg live mass per day for 5 days, 2 sheep at the same dosage for 2 days and one animal at 50 mg\/kg per day for 5 days. No viable coenuri were recovered from any of these animals. This is the only anthelmintic that is known to be effective against this parasite, but its cost is such (R200 at the lowest dose rate) that it can be economically used only for the treatment of valuable stud animals.","1741":"Raw milk quality in South Africa is poor and standard plate counts in the millions per ml are common. This is largely due to inefficient cleaning and sanitizing of dairy equipment. The basic constituents in milk are described and various soils are classified as soluble in water, alkali, acid, solvent or surfactant or as insoluble. The importance of water quality is highlighted and the influence of mineral salts on soil deposition described. Dairy detergents are broadly classified as alkaline or acid, the former being most effective against fatty and proteinaceous soils and the latter effective against mineral salts. Typical detergent ingredients and their properties are described. Chlorine is incorporated into alkaline detergents not as a sanitizing agent, but as a peptizing agent to aid in protein soil removal. At high pH values the antimicrobial activity of chlorine is greatly diminished. The use of a daily acidified rinse (pH 3,0-5,0) is preferred to the periodic acid wash, since the acid rinse prevents mineral deposition rather than removing accumulated milkstone. All cleaning programmes follow the same fundamental steps--Pre-rinse (40-50 degrees C), wash (60-70 degrees C), rinse (pH 3,0-5,0) and sanitize (25 ppm iodine and 100 ppm chlorine). Farms following such a programme are able to achieve Standard Plate Counts of less than 10,000\/ml and coliform counts of less than 10\/ml for raw milk.","1742":"","1743":"After isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from endometrial biopsies of 6 mares they were treated with amikacin sulphate. Three were treated by intra-uterine application of the drug, in one the drug was given by intramuscular injection, in another the intravenous route was used while in the last mare simultaneous local and intravenous treatment was applied. An intra-uterine Tris-EDTA instillation preceeded the uterine amikacin instillations to aid in the breakdown of the capsule around the bacterium. Serum concentrations of amikacin were determined after intravenous and intramuscular administration. The highest concentration of 15 microgram\/ml was reached 1 hour after intravenous injection. After 12 hours the blood concentration was below the therapeutic level. To maintain effective levels injection must be repeated 6-8 hourly. All mares treated by the intra-uterine or intravenous routes recovered. The importance of obtaining cultures from uterine biopsies is stressed as Pseudomonas was cultured only once from the conventional cervical swab while the other 5 mares had negative cervical swabs.","1744":"Arthritic joints obtained from 50 freshly slaughtered pig carcasses condemned for polyarthritis were studied microbiologically. A routine technique was developed for aseptically opening joints to obtain material for microbiological examination. A standard series of culture media for the primary isolation of arthritogenic agents were used in the examination of each affected joint. The microbiological study cultured for isolation of the following microorganisms: Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Chlamydia, and viruses.E. rhusiopathiae was found to be responsible for 48% of the cases of arthritis and Streptococcus spp., C. pyogenes and S. aureus for 20%, 4%, and 2% respectively; no microorganisms were cultured from 26% of the arthritic joints.","1745":"The avermectins are macrocyclic lactones produced by fermentation of the soil micro-organism Streptomyces avermitilis. They show activity against a broad range of nematodes and arthropod parasites of domestic animals at dose rates of 300 microgram\/kg or less. Unlike the macrolide or polyene antibiotics, they lack significant antibacterial or antifungal activity. By oral or parenteral administration, avermectins are active against gastrointestinal nematodes and lungworms, and important ectoparasites such as lice, mange mites, ticks and larval stages of flies. They show excellent activity against parasites resistant to existing anthelmintics or ectoparasiticides. The avermectins appear to cause paralysis of nematodes and arthropods by opening gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated chloride channels at the neuromuscular junction.","1746":"Ivermectin, described as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1, was the compound chosen from the avermectin group of compounds for development as an antiparasitic agent in horses. A review of the literature indicates that parenteral administration in horses at 200 microgram\/kg body mass is highly effective against the strongyles Strongylus vulgaris, Strongylus edentatus and triodontophorus spp., and adult and immature cyathostomes, including strains resistant to benzimidazole anthelmintics. Other nematodes controlled in horses include Oxyuris equi, Parascaris equorum, Trichostrongylus axei, and Habronema spp. Ivermectin is also highly effective against stomach bots (Gastrophilus spp.).","1747":"","1748":"The field of public health work covered by the Veterinary Branch of the Johannesburg City Health Department is described. This comprises meat hygiene, milk hygiene and the investigation of zoonoses. Meat hygiene embraces hygienic control of wholesale meat premises and inspection of meat imported into the municipal area. Results of the bacterial monitoring of premises and the mass of meat inspected and condemned are given. Inspection of dairy herds, diseases monitored by laboratory tests and other aspects of milk hygiene are discussed. Zoonosis control includes the investigation of unusual animal behaviour and mortality. In carrying out this work the Branch co-operates closely with the Laboratory and Technical Services and Environmental Health Branches of the City Health Department.","1749":"","1750":"A 61\/2-month-old Cairn Terrier, considered to be a bilateral cryptorchid male, was presented with dysuria and urinary incontinence. This was found to be due to a congenital communication between the urinary bladder and corpus uteri and resulted in distention of the uterus with urine which could not be voided. An ovariohysterectomy was performed. The dog was found to be a gentic female with what resembled external male genitalia, i.e. a female pseudohermaphrodite.","1751":"","1752":"A case of Brucella orchitis in a Brahman bull is described. Positive serological titres were detected 1 month before clinical symptoms became obvious, whereas the seminal plasma only contained detectable levels of antibody after the onset of orchitis. It is concluded that serological assays on the seminal plasma alone are inadequate to detect sub-clinically infected animals, and consequently particularly bulls that are intended for use in AI centres should be subjected to a full battery of serological tests as well, before they are certified to be free of brucellosis. The pathology seen in this case was an acute, necrotic orchitis characterized by the presence of numerous granulomas containing the Brucella organisms centrally.","1753":"To overcome the problems of restricted visibility and surgical mobility, as well as those posed by anatomical features oif the canine subfrontal sinus region and associated dura mater, aggravated by hazards of infection from potentially infected frontal sinuses, of uncontrollable haemorrhage and post-operative brain compression, a radical approach was devised, combining invasion of the frontal sinus with a lateral rostrotentorial craniotomy. This offers adequate surgical manoeuvring space, excellent visualisation of the rostral cranial fossa and its contents, proper asepsis, minimal haemorrhage and no untoward after-effects. The technique lends itself to diverse neurosurgical applications in the rostral cranial fossa of the dog. Particulars of instrumentation, and pre-operative, operative and post-operative procedures, done on 3 Beagles with excellent results, are described.","1754":"Thirty-two weaned steer calves were injected subcutaneously with rafoxanide solution to determine the lethal dosage. The recommended therapeutic dosage is 3 mg\/kg. Eight of 12 calves treated at 45 to 60 mg\/kg displayed signs of toxicity 24 hours to 8 days after treatment. These included recumbency, polypnoea, muscle tremors and clonic spasms, opisthotomus, paddling movements of the feet, and blindness with mydriasis and death. An easily detected histopathological lesion was status spongiosus of the central nervous system. This study demonstrated that injectable rafoxanide has a wide safety margin when used at the recommended therapeutic dosage.","1755":"An 80% survival rate was achieved when sheep which received lethal doses of Urginea sanguinea were treated with activated charcoal at 5 g\/kg and potassium chloride at 1 g\/kg body mass per os. A brief description of U. sanguinea poisoning and of the mechanism of cardiac glycoside action is given. Clinical examinations, ECG recordings and serum potassium levels were done to monitor developing signs of poisoning.","1756":"A ready-to-inject solution, containing 100 mg\/ml doxycycline was used. Artificially infected sheep were divided into 2 groups: a control group consisting of 10 animals, and a treated group consisting of 12 animals. Doxycycline was administered intramuscularly to the animals in the treated group at a dosage rate of 2 mg\/kg body mass. All the treated animals recovered. One control animal recovered spontaneously, the others all died.","1757":"In a retrospective study  on 120 natural cases of canine ehrlichiosis, it was found that cases were presented in all months of the year. The disease was diagnosed in 26 different breeds amongst which the German Shepherd was the best represented. Of the different breeds of dog, German Shepherds showed the highest incidence of chronic cases as well as the highest mortality rate. In a randomly selected sample of 50 dogs, the clinical signs of canine ehrlichiosis were found to be mainly non-specific. The terms acute, subacute and chronic are proposed to describe the different stages of disease. The total white cell count was found to be of prognostic value. Treatment with either doxycycline or oxytetracycline was found to be effective in most of the cases. Blood transfusion was the most important method of supportive therapy.","1758":"Urea was non-toxic to a 10 week-old pig in an acute dose as high as 16 g\/kg body mass. Ten % m\/m urea in pig food over a period of 5 days was also without apparent deleterious effect.","1759":"","1760":"An attempt was made to use polymorphic markers in the genetic taxonomy of springbok populations. Three independent free ranging springbok populations could be identified on the basis of albumin and transferrin gene frequencies. Even if most of the enzyme markers appeared to be monomorphic it can be stated that in any comparative study of this kind, cryptic genetic markers are of greater use than other environmentally sensitive taxonomic criteria. From the given data and others mentioned it can be stated that little support exists for the continued application of the subspecific status in the species Antidorcas marsupialis. It is shown that the use of environmentally sensitive parameters in the springbok are both misleading and highly unsatisfactory. Biochemical polymorphism can be utilized better than other parametres but here also there are several limitations. Basically, only the albumin and transferrin types can be used when blood samples are available and only IDH and 6-PGD polymorphisms are of value when liver samples can be utilized for the genetic differentiation.","1761":"Some reactions and their components at a microscopical level in myocardium are described using evidence obtained from natural and experimental cardiac conditions. Necrosis of different types, hypertrophy, mineralization, and other changes in myocytes, changes in myocarditis, and patterns involving conductive tissue are considered. A short summary of some collected values concerning the chronology of myocardial reactions is presented. The pathogenesis of myocardial reactions is complex and is influenced by diverse factors. Although certain patterns are recognizable, firm aetiological interpretation from the pattern alone is rarely justifiable.","1762":"Genetically controlled markers are ideal for the identification of individual animals, and throughout the world laboratories have been established whose chief function is to provide a blood-typing service for animals including horses. In order to achieve the aim of improved recording of foals almost all South African sires at stud were tested and their blood type identification completed. The genetic markers included in this survey were 14 blood group factors, transferrin, plasma esterase, haemoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase and phosphohexose isomerase. Gene frequency calculations were performed and comparisons made with similar surveys in Thoroughbreds overseas. The results indicate that the strict selection for speed in Thoroughbred racing horses has resulted in a high degree of genetic uniformity between South African and overseas racing Thoroughbreds.","1763":"","1764":"","1765":"","1766":"Much scientific information concerning animal behaviour has become available only recently and it continues to increase rapidly. There is evidence indicating that the behavioural needs of animals have sometimes been neglected when natural life-style are replaced by artificially contrived ones. More attention to and study of animals' social and other behavioural requirements would be mutually beneficial to both man and beast. If those needs can be met more adequately, animals will be easier to handle, stress will be reduced and productivity improved. Animal welfare legislation in different countries is mentioned and ethological research as basis for new legislation discussed. The development in this critical field of Ethology and Animal Welfare is advancing fast and the South African Veterinarian must be aware of the new movement from Animal Science to Animal Rights.","1767":"Several dogs died from African horsesickness which was contracted by the consumption of uncooked meat from the carcase of a horse that had died from the disease. Respiratory embarrassment was the main clinical sign, while marked hydrothorax and pulmonary congestion and oedema were the major post mortem findings. Serotype 6 horsesickness virus was isolated from 2 of these dogs.","1768":"A serious outbreak of rabies amongst kudus in South West Africa\/Namibia has accounted for the deaths of an estimated 10 000 of them since 1977. The disease has spread at a rate of 40-60 km per year although its progress in an easterly direction was checked for more than 2 years by a game fence. Although the fence restricted the movements of big game such as kudus, it did not prevent movement of the known vectors of rabies such as dogs and jackals. The outbreak coincided with a few years above average rainfall with a resultant improvement in vegetation and an increase in the population density of kudus and jackals. The incorporation of game especially kudus into the farming industry in South West Africa\/Namibia and the greater awareness of farmers of the need of protecting them contributed to the population increase of kudus. Circumstantial evidence is supplied to suggest a horizontal spread of the disease amongst kudus. Factors involved include their grooming habits, social behaviour, the restricted spread of the disease through the game fence and the absence of a corresponding increase in the number of cases of rabies in other species. Mouth lesions caused by the browsing of thorn-bush may be a contributory factor.","1769":"Anthelmintics provide the cattle farmer with a means of controlling worm infestations. Whether their use is economical depends upon how it is integrated with climatic changes, pasture management, and the immune state of the animals Preventive deworming based on a system which monitors worm burdens is idealistic and generally impractical. Monitoring systems which have been employed include faecal egg counts and cultures, haematological determinations, and worm recoveries post mortem. An efficient method of deworming beef cattle is the use of a strategic drenching programme, based upon seasonal variations in the incidence of the helminths. The economics of this approach can be improved by a tactical drenching programme in which the timing of drenches is dictated by factors which could lead to an outbreak of helmninthosis. The most efficient method is dosing which keeps pastures free from contamination over longer periods.","1770":"The similarities between arrested development in parasitic nematodes and diapause in insects are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the similarity between arrested development in Haemonchus contortus and diapause in Oestrus ovis in sheep. Factors inducing arrested development and influencing resumed development and measures to control arrested nematodes in ruminants are discussed.","1771":"After cannulation of the bile duct in anaesthetised dogs, clanobutin was injected intravenously. Samples were collected for periods of 15 min. Arterial and venous blood pressures as well as the electrocardiogram were recorded during the experiment. There was a slight increase in arterial and central venous pressure during the trial. Heart rate slightly decreased with a slight increase in ventricular ectopic beats. In the first 15 min after bile flow increased by 260%. The choleretic action lasted for 1,5 h. The concentration of sodium, potassium and magnesium in the bile followed a similar pattern to that of the volume. Bilirubin and calcium excretion showed a sharp increase within the first 15 min after administration. Thereafter there was a sharp drop and 30 min after administration the concentration was below the control value.","1772":"The efficacy of 10 drugs was tested against Babesia felis infection in domestic cats. Primaquine phosphate administered per os or as an intramuscular injection was found to be highly effective and the obvious drug of choice when compared with conventional babesicides. The recommended dosage is 0,5 mg\/kg body mass of primaquine base. Repeated treatments are well tolerated but single doses in excess of 1 mg\/kg are known to cause mortality in cats.","1773":"Succinyldicholine-induced asphyxia in awake calves led to massive catecholamine release by the adrenal medulla. Hypertension and bradyarrhythmias resulted. Electroencephalograms recorded during periods of succinyldicholine-induced apnoea indicated that calves were probably conscious and under psychic stress for at least 4 min after the onset of apnoea. Electroencephalographic signs indicative of decreased consciousness became evident in one calf only after 4,8 min of apnoea but were absent in 3 calves subjected to maximum periods of apnoea of 4,1; 3,2 and 4,4 min. The latter 3 calves all recovered with no apparent neurological deficit after intravenous injection of plasma pseudocholinesterase.","1774":"Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neum. occurs mainly in the eastern and southern parts of Africa and is the principal cause and vector of some very important stock diseases in these areas. The diseases include the theilerioses, brown tick toxicosis and Nairobi sheep disease. These are briefly discussed, and emphasis is laid on the role of R. appendiculatus in their epidemiology. R. appendiculatus is a 3-host tick particularly well adapted to survive where climate and vegetation are suitable. The basic requirements and breeding potential of this tick are also discussed.","1775":"Haloperidol (R1625, Serenace) a potent, long-acting butyrophenone neuroleptic, was shown to be very effective in game capture operations for the neuroleptization of several species of African wild herbivores, especially the medium and small antelopes. With a rapid onset of action following intravenous injection and a duration of action of 10-12 h in the majority of cases, haloperidol produced profound pyschomotor effects and remarkable tractability in red hartebeest, blesbok, springbok, duiker, steenbok and dik dik. Haloperidol suppressed the alarm reaction and facilitated the large-scale handling and translocation of captured animals. It also produced favourable sedation in Hartmann's zebra, Burchell's zebra, tsessebe and Black-faced impala. Extrapyramidal effects were observed in some species.","1776":"","1777":"A case of acute acidosis due to over-ingestion of maizemeal is reported. The cow was in sternal recumbancy, unable to rise and showed signs of severe dehydration, metabolic acidosis and rumen stasis. Examination of rumen contents revealed changes consistent with those of lactic acidosis. Treatment included correction of the metabolic acidosis, restoration of intravascular volume, manipulation of rumen contents including rumen lavage and other supportive treatment. Some pathophysiological aspects and the need for a systematic and vigorous treatment regime are discussed.","1778":"Intestinal cryptosporidiosis was detected at necropsy in a 2-week-old calf that had diarrhoea. Cryptosporidial organisms were embedded in the microvillous border of the epithelium of the distal small intestine. The most significant histological change was a mild enteritis characterized by decreased villus length and hypercellularity of the lamina propria.","1779":"A description is given of the history and neuropathology of a mongrel puppy which had suffered from cerebellar cortical atrophy. The condition was attended by intractable cerebellar ataxia and characterised by selective degeneration of the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. Cerebellar dysfunction is briefly reviewed. The lesion and possible aetiology are briefly discussed.","1780":"The clinical and pathological findings in 2 sibling Bloodhound pups with spastic paresis of the pelvic limbs due to toxoplasmosis are described. Macropathology consisted of bilateral atrophy of the musculature of the affected limbs. Histopathology revealed meningo-encephalitis involving the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, diffuse meningomyelitis, radiculoneuritis of the lumbar spinal nerves and polymyositis and atrophy of skeletal muscle. Epizootological investigations failed to determine the source of the infection. Dissemination of the infection by a route other than the haematogenous pathway is considered and discussed.","1781":"The steroidal anaesthetic agent Saffan (a 1,2% m\/v mixture of alphaxalone and alphadolone) induced a state of poikilothermia in cheetahs. On a warm day (maximum temperature 29 degrees C) rectal temperatures rose in 7 of 8 male cheetahs given Saffan. The highest rectal temperature recorded was 41 degrees C. On a cool day (minimum temperature 19,5 degrees C) rectal temperature fell in 6 of 6 male cheetahs. The lowest rectal temperatures recorded was 36,2 degrees C. Saffan at 3 mg\/kg intravenously in cheetahs is an excellent and safe hypnotic but should be used with caution on both hot and cold days.","1782":"Electrocardiograms were recorded on 19 cheetahs immobilized with the steroidal anaesthetic-hypnotic agent Saffan comprising 0,9% m\/v alphaxalone and 0,3% alphadolone. Sinus rhythm was recorded in all animals and heart rate was rapid averaging 173 +\/- SD 18 beats per minute. The average of mean electrical axes in the frontal plane was + 76 degrees +\/- SD 13 degrees. Mean +\/- SD durations in milliseconds on lead II were: P 47 +\/- 6,5; PR 93 +\/- 11,5; QRS 53 +\/- 7,5; QT 193 +\/- 19,7. The amplitude of limb lead electrocardiographic complexes were low, resembling those of the domestic cat more closely than those of the dog.","1783":"A number of calves and a two year-old heifer in the Middelburg District of the Transvaal were found to harbour Strobiloestrus sp. larvae in nodules along their sides. Each nodule contained a single larva and these larvae developed from the early second stage to the third stage during the 25 day period between the first and last visit to the district. A particular set of circumstances involving the presence of klipspringers, which are considered to be the normal hosts of Strobiloestrus clarkii, grazing practice, hair colour of the calves and tick control probably resulted in the cattle becoming infested. A pour-on formulation of an insecticide was highly effective against the larvae.","1784":"Two field cases of apparent inefficacy of albendazole against cestodes in lambs were investigated. In both farms Thysaniezia giardi was identified and 2 critical controlled trials were conducted to determine the efficacy of 5 anthelmintics against T. giardi. Albendazole dosed at 3,8 mg\/kg or 7,6 mg\/kg live mass, mebendazole at 15 mg\/kg were totally ineffective against T. giardi. Treatment with resorantel at 65 mg\/kg or niclosamide at 50 mg\/kg however, caused expulsion of the strobilae within 16--24 hours after treatment and at autopsy, lambs were free of scoleces of T. giardi.","1785":"The helminth parasites recovered from sheep, cattle, impala and blesbok during several surveys conducted in the Republic of South Africa are listed as definitive, occasional or accidental parasites of their respective hosts. Their distribution according to the various climatic zones of the Republic are also listed.","1786":"A subcutaneous injection of 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol (Disophenol) at 10 mg\/kg sheep leaves a residue bound to serum albumin which is lethal to Haemonchus contortus for 3 months after treatment. In the larval anthelmintic test, susceptible worm free sheep are dosed so that either third stage larvae (L3), or fourth stage larvae (L4) or 5th and adult stages are present on the day of treatment but slaughter is delayed to allow these larval stages to develop to adults because the larger worms are more easily seen, identified and counted. The larval anthelmintic test in sheep had to be altered and sheep killed within a few days of treatment, because the residues may be more effective against subsequent stages of development. Disophenol was greater than 60% effective against L3 of Oesophagostomum columbianum and L4 of H. contortus in greater than 60% of sheep (Class B). It rose to greater than 80% effective against adult H. contortus in greater than 80% of sheep (Class A). Against H. contortus it maintained Class A for 32 days, fell to Class B from 45--76 days and Class C (greater than 50% effective in greater than 50% of sheep) at 91 days after treatment respectively. In the RSA a treatment in December followed by another in March would protect sheep adequately against H. contortus for the entire season.","1787":"Plasma levels of oxytetracycline in dogs were compared in a cross-over study. A long-acting formulation and a polyvinylpyrrolidone formulation were injected intramuscularly. Symptoms of histamine release were recorded after the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone formulation. Higher peak plasma concentrations but shorter maintenance of therapeutic concentrations were recorded in the case of the polyvinylpyrrolidone formulation than with the long-acting formulation.","1788":"Plasma progesterone was determined in cattle with a competitive protein binding assay during the oestrous cycle, pregnancy and parturition. Peak luteal phase levels of 4--7 ng\/ml (12,7--22,2 nmol\/l) were found 12--16 days after clinical oestrus followed by a rapid decline to less than 0,5 ng\/ml (1,6 nmol\/l) on the day of oestrus. Levels of 3--7 ng\/ml (9,5--22,3 nmol\/l) were found 3 weeks after artificial insemination while levels of 3,8--6,5 ng\/ml (12,1--20,7 nmol\/l) and 3--7 ng\/ml (9,5--22,3 nmol\/l) were found at 6 and 7--8 weeks respectively. Between the second and third month of pregnancy levels of 3,5--6,5 ng\/ml (11,1--20,7 nmol\/l) were measured increasing to 3--8 ng\/ml (9,5--25,4 nmol\/l) from the fifth month until shortly before parturition. Levels of approximately 3--4 ng\/ml (9,5--12,7 nmol\/l) were found until 3 d before parturition with a drop to 2 ng\/ml (6,4 nmol\/l) 1 d before calving. Less than 1 ng\/ml (3,2 nmol\/l) was measured on the day of parturition and during the first 3 d after calving.","1789":"Plasma progesterone was determined with the aid of a competitive protein-binding assay in mares during the oestrous cycle, early pregnancy (45--60 days) and later pregnancy (2--10 months). Progesterone levels were low during oestrus (less than 1 ng per ml) (3,18 nmol\/l) and reached high levels (often in excess of 10 ng per ml) (31.8 nmol\/l) within 3--4 days after ovulation. The high luteal levels were maintained for approximately 5--8 days and then declined sharply over a period of approximately 24--48 hours to reach low levels at the subsequent oestrus period. In mares conceiving after service, the progesterone levels rose rapidly to 5--9 ng per ml (15,9--28,6 nmol\/l) 21 days after service. Levels of 4--10 ng per ml (12,7--31,8 nmol\/l) were found between 30 and 60 days after successful service with a tendency towards lower levels from 30--42 days and higher levels from 42--60 days. Progesterone levels remained between 7 and 10 ng per ml (22,3--31,8 nmol\/l) from 60--110 days and thereafter fell to a relatively constant level of 3--6 ng pe ml (9,5--19,1 nmol\/l) until the tenth month of pregnancy.","1790":"Six clinical and 10 experimentally-induced cases of canine ehrlichiosis were treated with imidocarb dipropionate. The treatment did not result in clinical cure and failed to sterilize the infection. The infection was successfully transmitted from treated dogs to splenectomized and non-splenectomized dogs.","1791":"The seasonal incidence of helminth infestation in sheep, cattle, impala and blesbok was determined from fluctuations in the worm burdens of these animals exposed to natural infestation at particular localities in the Transvaal and slaughtered at various fairly regular intervals. The nematodes considered to be of major importance were Haemonchus spp. and Trichostrongylus spp. in all four hosts, Ostertagia spp. in sheep, Longistrongylus spp. in impala, Cooperia spp. in sheep, cattle and impala, Cooperioides spp. in impala, Impalaia spp. in impala and blesbok and Oesophagostomum spp. in sheep, cattle and impala.","1792":"The influence of antimicrobial administration into the uterus of the cow are considered under 3 headings: (i) The influence on the oestrus cycle; (ii) The factors that may influence absorption through the endometrium; (iii) Contamination of milk with antimicrobial substances after intra-uterine administration.","1793":"Comprehensive bacteriological investigation indicates Shigellae as the probable aetiological bacteria in one endemic enteric disease situation. One species and four serotypes have been detected. In vitro antibiotic sensitivity spectra have been determined. Epidemiology, pathology and pathogenesis in relation to the experimental animal situation and experimental results are considered. A rationale for treatment and control is suggested.","1794":"All aspects, including aetiology, incidence, transmission, immunity, clinical signs, pathogenesis, pathology and diagnosis of feline leukaemia virus infection in domestic cats are considered with a bias towards the more clinical aspects for the benefit of private practitioners. Non-neoplastic disease and possible methods of control are also discussed.","1795":"During the last 2 years different equine herpesviruses serotype 1 strains have been isolated from cases of paretic or paralytic disease among horses in the Federal Republic of Germany. In this paper the available information is collated and briefly reviewed. A short description of the symptoms and the possible mechanism of the pathogenesis are given.","1796":"A brief summary is given of the structure of the cell membrane and the enzyme system which actively transports Na+ and K+ ions across it. The function of different ions in this process is discussed as well as the effect of cardiac glycosides on ion transport. The utilization of electrolytes to combat cardiac glycoside poisoning and an indirect method for demonstrating the presence of cardiac glycosides in the organs of ruminants, suspected of being poisoned by these toxins, is described.","1797":"","1798":"The numerous physiological and nutritional factors which influence the concentration of serum calcium are considered. The causes of hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia are briefly discussed, with particular reference to the clinical symptoms and pathology. The effect of the acid-base status on the serum-ionized calcium level is stressed. The causes of changes in the serum concentrations of phosphorus and magnesium are briefly reviewed, along with the abnormalities of lactate, pyruvate, and hydrogen ion concentrations. The kidney function tests, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and the renal clearance tests are discussed, with emphasis placed on correlating their results with the findings from repeated urinalyses. The important physiologic influences and pathological processes which result in changes in the concentrations of these parameters are delineated. The causes of increases in the serum enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, asparate transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, glutamic dehydrogenase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, creatinine phosphokinase, amylase and lipase are discussed. The changes in serum bilirubin concentration and its components are fully described, with emphasis placed on the correlation of the findings with urinalysis data and the complexities resulting from the numerous pathologic conditions causing jaundice. These conditions are listed for each of the domestic animals. The other liver function tests, bromosulphthalein dye retention or excretion, serum uric acid and blood ammonia concentration are briefly considered. All the tests described are very useful, and frequently essential, in aiding the veterinary practitioner to arrive at a diagnosis and prognosis, but they never replace clinical acumen.","1799":"","1800":"An elderly male Poodle was presented with haematuria, syncopy, a heart murmur and varying other symptoms which were all treated unsuccessfully. They were linked on post-mortem examination to a widely disseminated metastatic malignant haemangioendothelioma.","1801":"The history, clinical signs and pathological findings are described in a cross-bred Yorkshire Terrier which developed renal failure subsequent to the development of renal calculi. These calculi were found to consist of ammonium urate, a rare form of calculi in non-Dalmatian dogs.","1802":"In a sheep which was euthanased because of severe emaciation and weakness, slight thickening of the ileum was seen grossly. Microscopically there was a granulomatous ileitis with obliterative lymphangitis and lymphangiectasis. Granulomatous lesions were also present in the liver and some mesenteric lymph nodes. Large numbers of acid-fast bacilli were present within epithelioid macrophages in the lamina propria of the ileum. Although the identity of the Mycobacterium spp. involved was not established, the possibility of paratuberculosis is discussed. The apparent rarity of this disease in sheep in South Africa is considered. Particular attention is drawn to the absence of diarrhoea in this case, to the slightness of the gross changes and to the importance of submitting material for mycobacterial culture.","1803":"A single calculus from the bladder of a Beagle bitch has been analyzed by a multiple technique approach employing x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrophotometry and density gradient fractionation. The qualitative  and quantitative data obtained showed excellent agreement, lending confidence to such an approach for the evaluation and understanding of stone disease.","1804":"Three of the standard radiographic views of the navicular bone were assessed in normal horses and horses with navicular disease to determine the most effective radiographic positioning. Using the upright pedal view, a pastern angulation of 20 degrees from the vertical produced the optimum result when radiographs were taken using a grid. The best result using the high coronary view was obtained with an anode-film distance of 1 1000 mm, and a tube-head angle of 50 degrees from the vertical. When the special navicular view described by Morgan was examined, the most satisfactory projection was obtained using an anode-film distance of 900 mm, a tube-head angle of 55 degree and the primary beam centred between the bulbs of the heel, for the diagnosis of navicular disease, a combination of the upright pedal view and the special navicular view appears most effective.","1805":"A single oral dose of fenbendazole (FBZ) paste at 7,5 mg\/kg body mass was given to 5 horses. It was highly effective against adults of the following genera: Cyathostomum, Cylicostephanus, Cylicondontophorus, Poteriostomum, Cylicocyclus, Triodontophorus, Oesophagodontus (and other genera belonging to the subfamily Cyathostominae). Similarly, high efficacy was obtained against the adults of the following species: Oxyuris equi, Strongylus vulgaris, Strongylus equinus and Probstmayria vivipara. These results were confirmed in 12 horses and in addition FBZ at 7,5 mg\/kg was highly effective against Parascaris equorum, Craterostomum and Gyalocephalus.","1806":"Somatic cell counting combined with bacterial identification was successfully used as a method of reducing dairy-herd mastitis problems in Nata. Application of the recommended control measures resulted in an average increase in daily production of up to 2,8 l of milk per cow per day, improvement in quality and reduction in the prevalence of mastitis.","1807":"Canine parvovirus (CPV) myocarditis was diagnosed in 11 puppies during 1979. The diagnosis was made at histopathological examination on the basis of 2 characteristic lesions: a subacute to chronic fibrous myocarditis and the presence of large, basophilic intranuclear inclusions in the cardiac myofibres. The puppies varied from 31\/2 to 8 weeks of age and all died suddenly without prior symptoms except for 1 pup which developed a severe respiratory dyspnoea 12 h before death. The presence of white bands or streaks of fibrosis on the endocardial or epicardial surfaces of the ventricles was a characteristic gross finding in 65% of cases. In all cases the lungs revealed a pneumonitis noted as hypercellularity and thickening of the alveolar walls. Alveolar macrophages were present within the alveolar lumens. The latter lesion was regarded to be secondary to heart failure. The clinical symptoms and pathological lesions observed are discussed and compared to these noted by various other workers both in South African and in other countries.","1808":"In both Australia and New Zealand, the objective of clearance for registration and licensing is to ensure safe and efficient use of chemicals and to recognise the special needs of several different interests, namely 1. end-users concerned with efficacy and possible hazards; 2. the consumers of food products from treated animals; 3. stock owners and vendors who need protection from false claims from competitive products; 4. wildlife and other ecological considerations; 5. protection of overseas markets, with special reference to drug and chemical residues. In Australia the Technical Committee on Veterinary drugs is responsible for the preliminary clearance of products for mass-medication with respect to efficacy and safety and, in association with the National Health and Medical Research Council Committees, sets residue limits and establishes poison schedules. This committee, however, can only make recommendations to the individual States, who are responsible for administering regulations through relevant State departments. In New Zealand, the Animal Remedies Act (1967) is responsible for the control of manufacture and importation of animal remedies and for the licensing of these for specific purposes. The Animal Remedies Act is administered by an Animal Remedies Board which operates within the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and and Fisheries.","1809":"Six groups of 6 lambs each were treated orally with rafoxanide at dosages ranging from 0 to 37,5 mg\/kg live mass in multiples of 7,5 mg\/kg. The lambs were slaughtered 27 to 31 d after treatment for post mortem examination. No clinical, ophthalmological or pathological changes attributable to treatment were detected in any of the lambs. Possible differential diagnoses and predisposing factors for rafoxanide toxicity are discussed. It is suggested that plasma-rafoxanide assay be used as a diagnostic tool.","1810":"By an indirect contact method, the total numbers of aerobic and coliform bacteria and of Escherichia coli I per cm2 on the surfaces of warm carcases of 498 cattle, 426 sheep and 499 pigs were established. Total and E. coli I counts were classified in geometric progression, the classifications being used to monitor levels of contamination. The highest levels were found on pigs, E coli I was frequently isolated from pig surfaces and only sporadically from sheep and cattle. The recovery of E coli I was related to the overall extent of bacterial contamination. Levels of contamination and the prevalence of E. coli I are illustrated by bar-graph arrangements.","1811":"Haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by Pasteurella multocida type E was diagnosed at post-mortem examination in a bovine originating from South West Africa. This is the first report of this disease occurring in South West Africa. The history, clinical symptoms and gross and microscopic pathology of this case are described. The pathologic features included generalized congestion, subcutaneous oedema especially of the submandibular area, fibrinous arthritis, tendovaginitis and myositis with an accompanying lymphadenitis of the regional lymph nodes and a haemorrhagic pleuritis and pericarditis. The epizootiology of the disease in South West Africa as compared with that in Central African and Asia, where the disease is common, is discussed. A case of septicaemia caused by P. multocida type E in a calf from a group of calves originating from the Transvaal, is also reported. A post-mortem examination on this calf revealed moderate pulmonary oedema and generalized congestion of the organs and musculature. The latter lesions suggest a septicaemic condition. Other calves in this group revealed one or more of the following lesions: myositis, fibrinopurulent pneumonia or fibrinous peritonitis.","1812":"Plasma cortisol levels were measured in Landrace pigs susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH), Landrace pigs resistant to MH and in Largewhite pigs, during growth halothane anaesthesia and after injections of Synachten. From 3 to 6 months of age mean cortisol levels in susceptible Landrace were 193,2 +\/- 49,7 nmol\/l, in resistant Landrace 220,8 +\/- 24,8 nmol\/l and in Largewhite 278,8 +\/- 13,8 nmol\/l. These values were not significantly different. After injection of 1 mg Synachten intravenously, plasma cortisol levels did not increase significantly in susceptible pigs. In resistant landrace pigs and Largewhite pigs the plasma levels after injection were significantly greater than pre-injection levels (P less than 0,05) and significantly different from susceptible Landrace levels. During halothane anaesthesia, cortisol levels rose more in resistant pigs than in susceptible pigs, but differences were no significant. These results suggest that susceptible pigs have a decreased ability to secrete cortisol during stress.","1813":"","1814":"A freefloating iris cyst in a dog, the congenitally attached apex of the epiglottis in a cat, spontaneous healing of Filaroides osleri in a dog and dermoid sinus in a Ridgeback crossbreed are discussed.","1815":"","1816":"An easy diagnostic technique for recognising fibrotic myopathy and scarring in the caudal popliteal area is described. A simplified corrective surgical technique is offered and discussed briefly. Some aspects of haematomas are reviewed.","1817":"The usefulness of laboratory tests is discussed, with emphasis placed on the correlation of the results with the clinical findings. The advantages and disadvantages of clinical chemistry and the precautions necessary when collecting the blood sample are delineated. Brief consideration is given to selecting the laboratory, the normal range, and the knowledge essential for interpretation of the results. The concentrations of the blood constituents are considered relative to the rate of release from cells, the method of transport in the blood, and the rate of removal from the blood. The physiological and pathological alterations in these factors dictate blood chemistry results. The physiologic influences on the concentrations of blood glucose, serum cholesterol, and plasma free fatty acids are considered. The causes of physiologic and pathologic increases and decreases in these blood constituents are discussed. Serum triglyceride concentrations are usually performed for an objective assessment of intestinal fat absorption. The principal causes of inadequate absorption are mentioned. The changes in the concentrations of total serum protein, albumin, the various globulin fractions, fibrinogen and prothrombin are non-specific but are frequently valuable diagnostic aids. The physiological and pathological influences on these parameters are described.","1818":"","1819":"Chemopathological changes were monitored in 20 experimentally infected and 70 clinical cases of feline babesiosis. Total serum proteins remained unchanged but there was a definite increase in gamma globulin and decrease in alpha and beta globulins. In most cases liver function was essentially normal although function tests occasionally indicated hepatic dysfunction. Renal function was unaffected. Venous blood pH remained normal throughout. Post mortem findings on the experimental cats included bile stasis and hepatic necrosis in some; marked internal icterus was only seen in 2 cases.","1820":"Three cases of diaphragmatic hernia in bovines were encountered over a period of 5 years. The successful surgical repair of one case is reported.","1821":"The anthelmintic efficacy of fenbendazole, dosed to artificially infested cattle at 5 mg\/kg live mass was determined against immature and adult Haemonchus placei. Ostertagia ostertagi, Cooperia spp., Bunostomum phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum. At this dosage rate, fenbendazole was more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the animals treated against the abovementioned nematodes. The only exception was against the third-stage larvae of B. phlebotomum when it fell to more than 60% effective in more than 60% of the animals treated.","1822":"Fifty-two untreated lambs from a contaminated flock were slaughtered at regular intervals throughout the year, and their gastro-intestinal tracts were examined for the presence of nematode parasites. Haemonchus contortus and Oesophagostomum columbianum were found to be of major importance. The incidence of Haemonchus rose to a peak and remained at a high level throughout the winter through the fourth larval stages of the parasite predominated at this stage. Oesophagostomum columbianum was recovered in numbers unusually high for this species, the incidence of which remained at a relatively high level from March until October. The minor genera recovered were Trichostrongylus spp., Cooperia spp., Strongyloides papillosus and Trichuris ovis.","1823":"","1824":"The anatomy of the female reproductive tract of the springbok is described, using material of 25 ewes collected at the S.A. Lombard Nature Reserve and 300 ewes collected at the De Beers farm Benfontein. No difference in the length of left and right fallopian tubes (104 +\/- 24 mm) was observed, and from the funnel to the isthmus it narrows considerably from 15 mm to 1,25 mm. A distinct flexure is formed by the utero-tubal juncture. A complete ovarian bursa with a ventral orifice occurs. The reproductive tract increases in mass from 9.2 g in infants to 38,0 g in adults. The right uterine horn of the bicornuate tract is consistently longer. Caruncles are more numerous in the right (60,2 +\/- 9,37) than the left (45,8 +\/- 10,18) uterine horn. The intricate cervical lumen consisting of four to six valves in non-pregnant ewes becomes a simple S-shaped canal with advanced pregnancy.","1825":"The different applications of embryo transfer from the animal improvement, scientific and commercial point of view are outlined. The most important application in South Africa is the production of the next generation's dairy A.I. bulls out of elite cows after superovulation, inseminations with the best available semen and embryo transfer to many foster mothers. The specific difficulties of running breeding programmes with small active breeding populations are discussed, and it is suggested that elite cows should be brought to special farms or government stations during the period of superovulation and transfer. In this way the disadvantage of small breeding populations could to a certain extent be overcome by embryo transfer.","1826":"Four outbreaks of leukoencephalomalacia in horses in widely separated areas in South Africa are reported. The clinical signs and pathological lesions observed in each outbreak are briefly described. Mouldy home-grown maize from which Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg (= F. moniliforme Sheldon) was isolated in every instance, was involved in the outbreaks. Clinical signs and pathological lesions were identical to those seen in experimentally produced cases of F. verticillioides poisoning in horses.","1827":"Sixteen Friesland bull calves were divided into two groups and raised artificially in an early weaning system. The liquid feeding of one group consisted of a commercial milk substitute and that of the other group of a 50:50 milk substitute-whey mixture. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals, starting one week after birth, and analysed for packed cell volume (PCV), blood glucose and haemoglobin (Hb); serum albumin, total protein, urea, inorganic phosphate (Pi), Ca, Mg, Na and K. The liquid portion of the diet had no significant effect on either the blood composition of the calves or on their performance (mass gain, dry matter intake and feed conversion) at the end of the experimental period (week 13). The only significant difference (P less than 0,05) between the two groups was the body mass of the calves at weaning. There were significant changes in the concentrations of most blood constituents with age (P less than 0,001 for Hb, PCV, albumin, globulin, Pi and K; P less than 0,01 for urea and Ca). A significant correlation (P less than 0,05) was also found between the calves' growth rates from 1 to 13 weeks and the concentration of globulin at one week of age. The regression of growth rate from 1 to 13 weeks with the blood constituents, globulin, Hb, PCV, Pi, Mg and Ca at one week of age accounted for 67,4% of the variance among calves. The evidence suggests that the above types of liquid feeding in an early weaning system would not significantly affect the composition of the blood of calves when sampled approximately six weeks or more after weaning, provided a predictive assessment of subsequent growth performance.","1828":"","1829":"An epizootic of East Coast fever followed the introduction of a highly fatal strain of Theileria parva parva into South Africa in 1902. This is a brief historical review of the campaign to control and finally eradicate the disease through tick control, quarantine and the slaughter of exposed cattle. The disease was responsible for an estimated 5.5 million deaths before its final eradication in 1954.","1830":"A small animal otoscope was used as a laparoscope to determine the sex of several species of monomorphic birds. This instrument provided an inexpensive and accurate method for sexing birds.","1831":"Antibodies against canine distemper virus were determined before and after the administration of a live canine distemper virus vaccine to 16 wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Antibody levels were either very low or non-detectable. The results were inconclusive.","1832":"A dog infested with Filaroides osleri was dosed with albendazole at 9,5 mg\/kg every day for 55 days. Clinical signs of disease disappeared after 30 days but a few nodules were still present in the left bronchus 373 days after the onset of treatment. The anthelmintic caused an increase in lymphocyte and decrease in neutrophil count.","1833":"Haematological changes were monitored in 20 experimentally infected and 70 clinical cases of feline babesiosis. There was a rapid drop in the haematocrit, haemoglobin and erythrocyte count. Experimental animals were most anaemic about 3 weeks after infection. Variations were encountered. There were no definite trends in the erythrocyte indices although the erythrocytes were often macrocytic and hypochromic. No significant changes were found in total leukocyte counts.","1834":"","1835":"The first outbreak of bothriocephalosis in common carp in South Africa is recorded. This condition was caused by Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, a pseudophyllid tapeworm not previously identified in this country. Methods to limit its spread are suggested.","1836":"Microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis were found in blood smears of a Dalmation which showed clinical signs of muscle weakness and membranous glomerulonephritis. The muscle weakness responded to treatment with neostigmine and the microfilariae disappeared after treatment with levamisole.","1837":"An outbreak of mortality in a flock of Merino x Mutton Merino crossbred sheep where 62 out of 300 4 month old lambs died over a period of 3 weeks, is described. Some of the lambs showed symptoms of illthrift, but most died within a day or two as a tough phytobezoars varying in size from 15-40 mm in diameter and consisting almost exclusively of the hairs which occur on the leaves and stems of Ornithopus sativus Brot.","1838":"The areas of infestation, life cycle, lesions, methods of diagnosis and the control of Parafilaria bovicola in cattle in South Africa are discussed.","1839":"Certain aspects of ethology and the horse's senses are discussed to bring about a better understanding between man and horse. Furthermore the behaviour of horses with respect to housing, feeding, breeding, veterinary treatment and work are considered.","1840":"The clinical and laboratory findings of illness in a 2-year-old Thoroughbred filly are described. The treatment employed, including unilateral nephrectomy, and the macro- and microscopic findings in the diseases kidney are presented and this rare case is discussed briefly.","1841":"Thirty seven intra-articular injections, each 2 ml sodium hyaluronate were made into 21 arthritic joints in 15 racing Thoroughbreds and one part-bred polo pony. One joint failed to improve at all, 16 became sound with one injection, 4 became sound with 2 injections, and 11 joints showed various degrees of response. Eleven of 14 horses became sound for flat racing. Discussion relates to the technique of using sodium hyaluronate, some clinical and pathological aspects of traumatic arthritis, joint lubrication and a brief review of some properties of sodium hyaluronate which have a bearing on arthritis.","1842":"A nematode of the genus Anatrichosoma caused extensive necrosis and sloughing of the footpads of a domestic cat. No male worms were found but a description of the female is given. This is the first report of Anatrichosoma sp. in the Republic of S.A. as well as the first report of it in a cat.","1843":"A single oral dose of fenbendazole (FBZ) at 10mg\/kg body mass was given to 5 donkeys. A further 5 donkeys were dosed with a medicated lick (1 mg FBZ\/g lick) until the oral consumption was 10mg\/kg body mass. In both trials FBZ was highly effective against adults of the following genera: Cyathostomum, Cylicocyelus, Cylicostephanus, Cylicodontophorus, Poteriostomum, Cabellonema, Craterostomum and Triodontophorus; similarly high efficiency was obtained against the following species: Habronema majus, Habronema musca, Strongylus vulgaris and Oxyuris equi and worms identified as belonging to the subfamily Cyathostostominae. These results were confirmed in horses and in addition FBZ at 10mg\/kg was highly effective against Gyalocephalus capitatus, Oesophagodontos robustus and Parascaris equorum.","1844":"An unidentified Babesia was seen in a blood smear from a cat showing signs of anaemia. The cat responded to treatment with diminazene (Berenil). The morphology of the parasite is described and a comparison is made with other Babesia which have been described from the domestic cat and wild felids. This parasite most closely resembled B. herpailuri described from a jaguarundi in South America.","1845":null,"1846":"The anthelmintic efficacy of a 44.5% paste formulation of cambendazole was evaluated in a critical trial performed on 5 horses and a donkey. A dosage of 20 mg\/kg showed reduction of mean parasite burdens as follows: Strongylinae greater than 99%; Cyathostominae 94%; immature and adult Oxyuris equi 89 and greater than 99%; Probstmayria vivipara greater than 99% and Habronema muscae 97%. Parascaris equorum and Anoplocephala perfoliata were present in small numbers in individual animals only, and while all were removed by treatment, the small numbers did not justify calculation of a percentage efficacy for these 2 parasites.","1847":"Sheep and goats naturally infested with Stilesia hepatica were treated with either praziquantel (Droncit, Bayer) or oxfendazole (Systamex, Coopers). Praziquantel at 15 mg\/kg was 100% effective in 20 sheep; at 7,5 mg\/kg 2 out of 20 sheep were still positive. Oxfendazole at 3,5mg\/kg was ineffective. In spite of its efficacy the cost of praziquantel prohibits its routine use as an anthelmintic.","1848":"Current literature on the prevention of the \"parturition syndrome\" in dairy cows using butaphosphone is summarised. A South African trial is recorded in which 2 pre-partum injections of the drug caused a significant reduction in the number of cases of parturition syndrome, as well as a marked reduction in intercalving period in the treated portion of the herd. No difference in lactation yield or culling rate was seen. The financial implication of the reduction in intercalving period is discussed.","1849":"The control of oestrus in the intact bitch through the use of chemotherapeutics is briefly reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the recently introduced product mibolerone and a summary of currently available products is presented.","1850":"The incidence of infection following adult inoculation is such that this method alone cannot be relied on to control the spread of brucellosis. Brucella infection is present in a high percentage of serologically positive cases using the interpretation of titres as applied in South African. One premature and one full term calf born to cows 7-9 months after adult vaccination as well as the placentae, discharges and colostrum were all heavily infected with B. abortus biotype I.","1851":"","1852":"","1853":"Transmissible venereal tumor was diagnosed in the vagina of a bitch. The tumor spread to the oral mucosa in the tonsilar area of a female offspring which was frequently observed licking the vaginal discharge from the bitch. Metastasis to the ovary occurred in the bitch and wide-spread metastasis, especially to the skin, lymph nodes and spleen was recorded in the offspring. Both animals were euthanased due to poor response to treatment. The diagnoses were confirmed by histopathological examination.","1854":"A specific clinical condition of unilateral hindleg spasticity is described which affected all the piglets of 8 litters in one piggery. Histopathological examination of 3 of the piglets revealed changes involving some of the large neurons in the red nucleus, cerebellar nuclei and lumbar spinal cord. These changes were absent from 2 control piglets of the same age which were studied. The clinical and histopathological findings are discussed in relation to the possible aetiology of the condition.","1855":"","1856":"Several indications for swimming horses are recalled. A satisfactory pool and the technique for its use are described. Some observations on the effect on swimming are offered.","1857":"","1858":"The correct use of hormones in genesiological cases is discussed with indications for their use, dosage levels and duration of treatment under the following groups, viz. hypothalamic hormones, hypophyseal hormones, other gonadotrophins, steroids, combinations of the foregoing and prostaglandins. The more important dangers associated with hormone therapy are then briefly discussed with a few examples of the more common and hazardous abuses.","1859":"The morphological changes in the post partum corpus luteum was investigated by light microscopy on 16 ewes during the normal breeding season (March\/April). The increase in luteal tissue results from hypertrophy and not from hyperplasia of the granulosa and thecal cells. Two types of lutein cells were found in the corpus luteum: a large light-staining cell and a small dark-staining cell. These might reflect the 2 extremes of a spectrum of cells in different functional states, or they might represent cell lines derived from the follicular granulosa and the thecal interna, respectively.","1860":"Diarrhoea and mortality in sheep on a farm in the Winter Rainfall area of the Republic of South Africa were found to be due to an enteritis produced by the massive penetration of the mucous membrane of the small intestine by the bristles of the pappus of the Cape Khakiweed.","1861":"Results of comparative investigations of different in vitro and in vivo procedures are reported. The aim of the investigations was to determine which of the test methods gives the best estimate of the activity against ticks under field conditions when used for active ingredients of varying chemical constitutions and different types of action. The data obtained indicate that results of in vitro test methods using tick larvae differ with the test procedure employed and the chemical class of the active ingredient. Therefore, in many instances these test methods do not allow extrapolation to practical conditions. In vitro tests employing engorged female ticks are much more reliable for most classes of compounds. However, there still are groups of compounds for which this test furnishes incorrect predictions. A better indication of the potency of a compound is therefore obtainable using in vivo test procedures. An economic and reliable method for the selection of prospective active ingredients is the mini-dip method using the specific host animal. This method provides not only an indication of the future concentration to be recommended but also provides information on the different types of activity of compounds active against ticks, i.e. tickicidal effect, paralysis, detachment, inhibition of development. Such observations are difficult or even impossible when in vitro methods are employed. The predictive value of the mini-dip method has been established for tick controlling substances of widely varying chemical constitution like organophosphorus compounds, carbamates, thioureas, diamidides, thiazolines and synthetic pyrethroids.","1862":"Clinical observations were made on 20 experimentally infected and 70 clinical cases of feline babesiosis. The experimental cats showed a remarkable ability to adapt to the disease. Lethargy, anorexia and anaemia were recorded in both groups. Icterus was only occasionally seen. Elevated body temperature was not a feature of the disease. All untreated animals eventually died. Blood smears revealed increased polychromatophils, Howell-Jolly bodies, nucleated erythrocytes and anisocytosis indicative of a regenerative anaemia. Erythrophagocytosis by monocytic type leucocytes was also observed.","1863":"Preliminary evidence indicates that the Langerhans cell granules (also known as Birbeck granules) may really be intercellular desmosomal discs of the more superficial layers of stratified squamous epithelium that have been taken up by the interdigitating dendritic processes of the Langerhans cells. They should therefore be considered as phagosomes whose only significance is in indicating that their hosts had traversed one or other of the various types of stratified squamous epithelium of the body. When seen in this light variable presence in Langerhans cells or occasional presence in melanocytes or keratinocytes can be satisfactorily explained. Although the Langerhans cells form the first line of immunologic defence as antigen detectors, it is unlikely that their granules play any role at all in the immune response.","1864":"The lymph drainage of the major joints of the porcine forelimb was subjected to a critical examination. Commercial India ink was injected into the left elbow joint and right shoulder joint of an experimental pig. The shoulder joint was approached craniolaterally, the injection site being at the cranial border of the tendon of insertion of the infraspinatus muscle. The elbow joint was approached from the dorsolateral aspect. A suitable site for intra-articular injection into the elbow joint was found to be within an imaginary triangle formed caudal to the lateral epicondyloid crest of the humerus, the ventral border of the lateral head of the M. triceps brachii, and a line just dorsal to the olecranon. The lymph nodes of the neck and shoulder region were carefully exposed and examined for any discoloration due to the ink. The dissection of the lymph vessels and lymph nodes showed that the Lnn, axillares primae costae drained the elbow and shoulder joint after the intra-articular injection of India ink.","1865":"Cyclic activity and palpable features of the bovine genitalia were recorded by means of observation and a prolonged series of follow-up palpations. Various uncommon features concerning follicular development, oestrus performance, ovulation and the corpus luteum are described together with observations on the cystic enlargement of follicles and corpora lutea. Cases are reported of ovarian haemorrhage at oestrus and cystic enlargement of the endometrium.","1866":"Cows on high and low feeding levels were submitted to palpation of the ovaries and recording of the presence and size of follicles at various days of the cycle. A mid-cycle rise in follicular activity was apparent and for which the nonovulating ovary was responsible. High level feeding stimulated ovarian activity in each of the 2 ovaries throughout the cycle and follicular activity commenced earlier in the ovulating ovary on high level feeding than on low level feeding. A larger number of inseminations per conception was required by cows on high level feeding on low level feeding. The effect of ovarian activity on fertility is discussed.","1867":"During the spring and summer of 1979 field outbreaks of porcine hyperoestrogenism characterized by swelling and reddening of the vulva and teats in prepubertal gilts and enlargement of the mammae in young males occurred in the mistbelt of the Natal Midlands. On a farm in the Ixopo district, pigs were fed a mixed ratio containing home-grown yellow maize stored on the cob in a crib and all the young pigs with a mass of 25-85 kg (=a total of 350) were affected. Maize ears from the crib had a high percentage (91%) of kernels infected by Fusarium graminearum and contained 10 mg\/kg of zearalenone. The mixed ration contained 0,95 mg\/kg zearalenone. After dilution of the contaminated maize with good quality white maize, a dramatic decrease in both the incidence and severity of clinical signs occurred within 3-4 days. On a farm in the Winterton district, approximately 80% of the growing pigs with a mass of more than 40 kg fed a mixed ration containing shelled yellow maize from the silo of the local Agricultural Co-operative were affected. The incidence as well as the severity of the swelling of the vulvas and\/or treats were lower than on the farm at Ixopo, thus indicating a lower level of oestrogen intake. A sample of maize from the silo delivered to this farm contained only 0,06 mg\/kg zearalenone while the mixed ration did not contain chemically detectable levels of zearalenone. This is the first published record of field outbreaks of porcine hyperoestrogenism associated with the ingestion of F. graminearum infected maize contaminated with zearalenone in the Republic of South Africa.","1868":"Various viruses relating to congenital brain teratology in ruminants are discussed. These include: bluetongue which may be responsible for porencephaly and hydranencephaly; Akabane disease, Rift Valley fever (mouse brain attenuated virus) and Wesselsbron disease (wild-type and mouse brain attenuated viruses) which can give rise to porencephaly, hydranencephaly, micrencephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia, and bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease which results only in cerebellar hypoplasia. Certain foetal, maternal and virological factors that might have an effect on the pathogenesis of viral teratogenesis are briefly reviewed. Mention is also made of the different diagnostic procedures that can be used such as, gross and histopathological examination, virus isolation and serology.","1869":"","1870":"","1871":"","1872":"","1873":"","1874":"Nutritional or secondary hyperparathyroidism in a litter of German shepherd dogs is reported. The bitch lost interest in the litter 2 weeks post partum, the owner proceeded to feed the pups on a mainly meat diet (low in calcium) together with whole wheat bread (high in phosphate) until they were presented at Onderstepoort at the age of 6 weeks. Clinically the pups showed poor growth, posterior paresis and pain on palpation of the long bones. Radiological examination revealed decreased bone density and thickness of bone cortices. A diagnosis of nutritional or secondary hyperparathyroidism was made. The diet was corrected and in addition the pups were treated with a balanced supplement of calcium and phosphate with very good clinical response. The pathophysiology of nutritional or secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as ricketts and hypertrophic osteodystrophy as differential diagnoses are discussed.","1875":"Babesia canis was successfully transmitted from the domestic dog to 3 wild dogs Lycaon pictus and 4 black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas. Both wild dogs and black-backed jackals showed no clinical signs or clinical pathological evidence of disease. Trophozoites of Babesia canis were found in peripheral blood smears from all experimental animals. The disease was also successfully transmitted from both black-backed jackals and wild dogs to the domestic dog.","1876":"The various sex and age components of Merino sheep flocks are analzed. Since a similar survey in 1965 the most significant difference is an increase from 40 to 52% of the mature female component. Various indicators point to an inability of the farmer to influence this slow rate of increase. The significant role which the prolonged retention of young Merino whethers on the farm plays in this respect is discussed. A higher percentage of rams during the mating period is also suggested.","1877":"","1878":"The effectiveness of lasalocid as a coccidiostat in wool producing feedlot lambs was investigated. Significantly lower (P less than 0,001) oocyst numbers were obtained with the lasalocid diet as opposed to the controls receiving no lasalocid. No significant differences were found with regard to wool growth and related properties such as staple length, crimp, fibre thickness, clean yield and clean wool weight. The lasalocid diet improved the efficiency of feed utilization by 6%.","1879":"","1880":"Plasma oestrogen and progesterone levels were determined in cattle at the time of dexamethasone induced parturition. Oestrogen levels were elevated from the day after dexamethasone administration as well as on the day of parturition but declined rapidly to low levels on the day following parturition. Progesterone levels showed a decrease from the day of dexamethasone administration until parturition with a rapid drop to very low levels on the day following calving. These results are similar to those reported by other workers.","1881":"The serological and biochemical characteristics of 100 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from quarter mild of dairy cows and of 107 strains cultured from various sites of human patients, were determined and compared. All the isolates were CAMP-phenomenon and Na-hippurate positive, aesulin negative, fell into Lancefield's Group B and could be placed into one of the 6 recognised serotypes. No human isolates fell into type R but for the rest all the other types were represented in the series of bovine and human cultures. In order of frequency, the human isolates were of type III, II, Ib, X and Ia and the bovine of type II, X, III, Ia, Ib and R. Of the human and bovine cultures respectively, 34 and 96% altered litmus milk, 30 and 100% were sensitive to bacitracin, 32 and 4% were pathogenic to mice, 82 and 93% reduced the ultimate pH of glucose broth to 4,2-4,8, 36 and 100% fermented lactose, 93 and 99% salicin and 94 and 79% trehalose. Concerning the combination of lactose\/salicin fermentation, 35 and 95% of bovine and human isolates were , 0 and 5% were , 59 and 0% were -\/=nd 7 and 0% were -\/-. Data are summarised in 5 tables and discussed against the background of reports from other countries. It appears that a proportion of the human infections concern organisms likely to have been derived from bovine sources, either directly or indirectly. Definite classification of South African GBS into either human or animal strains does not seem possible. It is concluded that it would be more correct to refer to the source of an isolate instead of inferring that because the organism was primarily cultured from, say human resources, it is necessarily a human \"strain'.","1882":"","1883":"Intrapapillary deposition of 5-30 CFU of 6 separate human strains of Group B streptococci into 7 lactating quarters of 6 cows resulted in clinical mastitis in all. Identical streptococci were subsequently recovered from 6 of the affected quarters. Details of milk somatic cell counts, bacterial isolations and clinical findings are tabulated. The role of GBS in human medicine and the implications of proof that the bovine udder is susceptible to small numbers of GBS from human sources, are discussed.","1884":"","1885":"","1886":"A summary is given of the results obtained in experimental transmission of jaagsiekte by means transplantation of cell cultures. Evidence is also presented of transformation as the mechanism of oncogenesis and possibility of a viral aetiology is discussed briefly.","1887":"The intricacies of the serological grouping of streptococci are discussed. The pathogenicity and accurate classification of streptococci isolated from arthritic porcine joints were in doubt. Pure cultures of these isolates were inoculated intravenously into healthy pigs to ascertain their pathogenicity and in an attempt to fulfil Koch's postulates. The pathogenesis of streptococcal arthritis in swine is discussed. On intravenous inoculation into experimental pigs the streptococcal isolates showed varying degrees of pathogenicity and arthritogenesis.","1888":"","1889":"Feline infectious peritonitis was recently diagnosed in a 5 year old, male, neutered, Siamese cat. Euthanasia was performed. Macro- and histopathology confirmed the disease.","1890":"An efficacy evaluation using febantel and fenbendazole was carried out against Strongyloides papillosus in sheep and goats in the Grootfontein area of South West Africa\/Namibia. Three groups with five sheep and three goats in each group were artificially infested with this species. When the worms had reached the adult stage one group was treated with febantel, the other group with fenbendazole and the third group left as controls. Both anthelmintics were dosed at 5 mg\/kg. All animals were sacrificed one week after treatment and total worm-counts carried out. Both anthelmintics were found to be highly effective.","1891":"Hypothyroidism in dogs should be diagnosed by integrating the history, clinical symptoms and thyroid hormone assay. Affected dogs have a slow onset of decreased activity, cold intolerance, and skin changes of thickening and mild hyperpigmentation. The hair coat becomes dry and coarse, and alopecia develops in friction areas. The non-specific clinico-pathological changes of a mild anaemia and hypercholesterolaemia do not occur consistently. The easiest and best documented thyroid hormone assay is serum thyroxine (T4). The most accurate diagnosis is made using either the thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation test or thyroid gland biopsy. The condition is controlled by thyroxine replacement therapy at a dose rate of 30--50 mcg\/kg\/day in 2 divided doses, for the life of the dog.","1892":"The total liver mass of live ruminants is frequently required in mineral nutrition studies. In healthy, well-fleshed sheep high correlations were obtained between liver mass and body mass. In 169 sheep older than 15 months the wet liver represented 1,13 +\/- 0,129% and the dry liver 0,34 +\/- 0,036% of the live body mass respectively, while in 51 young sheep (6--9 months of age) these values were 1,65 +\/- 0,135% and 0,48 +\/- 0,062% respectively. Some of the factors influencing these values are discussed. The dry matter content of the livers in healthy sheep--irrespective of the breeds used, their age, body mass or the portion of the liver sampled--showed little variation, being 29,5 +\/- 1,02%.","1893":"The paper supplies the results of a first survey of its kind: a total of 46 questions were presented to dog owners mainly in the areas in an around Johannesburg, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Pretoria, Windhoek, Salisbury, Port Elizabeth and Durban and the answers compiled. In this \"kynological study\", all aspects of the dog, his behaviour and relationship to man are involved. It is clear that South Africans love and care for their animals and spend about R135 per year on their pets. Some indications of differences between the owners of dogs--Afrikaans- and English speaking persons, as well as new immigrants--became apparent, but more data are needed to make clear differentiations. Comparisons to other countries would also throw more light on the \"pet owner problem\".","1894":"Macroscopically visible ticks were collected from the hides of 28 cattle slaughtered in pairs during a period of 14 months in the Waterberg District. In order of prevalence Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Amblyomma hebraeum, Hyalomma marginatum rufipes, Ixodes cavipalpus, Hyalomma truncatum and Boophilus decoloratus were recovered. Immature stages of the three commonest species constituted a major portion of the population for varying periods during the months April to September. These results are in general agreement with those of surveys done in the northern Transvaal, Natal and Rhodesia.","1895":"The anthelmintic efficacy of fenbendazole FBZ against Moniezia expansa was tested in sheep and cattle at a dosage rate of 10 mg FBZ per kg body mass. Twenty seven out of 30 lambs and 8 out of 12 calves were cured of the infestation.","1896":"Dichlorvos in a special slow release formulation at 31 mg\/kg body mass in equines was highly effective against all adult strongyles and Oxyuris equi, Parascaris equorum, Probstmayria vivipara and bots of Gasterophilus spp. It has no effect on 4th stage larvae of Trichonema ssp. nor the stomach worms Draschia megastoma and Habronema spp. Doses of dichlorovos 10 and 20 times the therapeutic dose (310 and 620 mg\/kg body mass) caused transient clinical signs but these disappeared 96 hours after dosing.","1897":"The most important parasites of antelope in small game reserves are ixodid ticks, the larvae of oestrid flies and nematodes. Methods of control based on the seasonal prevalence of these parasites are suggested. Adult ticks can be controlled during summer by the introduction of cattle which are dipped or sprayed with an acaricide at 5-day intervals. The larvae of oestrid flies can be controlled by the capture during winter of all alcelaphine antelope and their oral treatment with a larvicide, while the addition of an anthelmintic to feed supplement blocks during winter can be used to control nematodes.","1898":"","1899":"The efficacy of arprinocid was tested against artificial infections of mixtures of Eimeria spp. in broiler chickens under floor pen conditions in 3 experiments. Treatment with arprinocid at 60 ppm over a 56 d period significantly increased the live mass gain and feed efficiency of broiler chickens. This increase compared favourably with that obtained by treatment with lasalocid, robenidine and halofuginone. Birds treated with arprinocid had substantially reduced numbers of sporulated oocysts in their litter, and less severe lesion scores than non-mediated birds.","1900":"In a series of 11 trials, in which 281 lambs were artificially infected with 9 species of nematodes, larval anthelmintic tests were carried out to assess the activity of a dose of 5 mg\/kg oxfendazole against all 3 parasitic stages of each species. An efficacy of over 99,4% was obtained against all stages of Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Nematodirus spathiger, Gaigeria pachyscelis, Chabertia ovina and Oesophagostomum columbianum with the exception of the third larval stage of O. Columbianum for which an efficacy of 93,5% was recorded. Against Dictyocaulus filaria efficacies against the fifth stages and adults, fourth larval and third larval stages were 99,8%, 92,0% and 37,5% respectively, and in two additional tests against the combined third and fourth larval stages, efficacies of 86,4% and 85,3% were recorded. Efficacy against Strongyloides papillosus was poor. In 2 supplementary experiments oxfendazole exhibited a 92,2--94,8% efficacy against adults of the Boshof benzimidazole-resistant strain of H. contortus, the highest activity so far recorded against the strain of any benzimidazole tested.","1901":"Obesity in dogs is frequently encountered by veterinarians. The history, clinical and laboratory findings of an overweight dog are described. Overfeeding of an all-meat diet resulted in obesity, and subclinical nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism. The obesity caused fatigue, decreased cardiac performance, respiratory embarrassment, skin lesions, prediabetes and increased glucocorticoid level. A balanced diet fed in limited amounts, and exercise, resulted in a marked loss of weight and an improvement in the dog's health. The practical control of canine obesity is discussed.","1902":"From a country-wide serological survey done during 1978 it is evident that the disease is widely distributed in the areas densely populated with poultry in South Africa. This survey was done before vaccine were in general use in the country.","1903":"Babesiosis is the cause of serious economic losses in South Africa and involves most areas with an annual rainfall of more than 400 mm. Both Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis are present and both are considered to be important. The vectors, distribution and factors influencing enzootic stability of both species are discussed. Except in some areas only marginally suitable for ticks, and where tick control alone may be adequate, control by immunisation is recommended. Short term prevention can be achieved by chemoprophylaxis.","1904":"","1905":"Anaplasmosis occurs in those areas of northern and eastern Australia infested by the cattle tick Boophilus microplus but it has been studied intensively only in Queensland. Anaplasmosis is predominantly a disease of autumn and winter and of cattle greater than 1 year of age. The complement fixation test has been used in serological surveys of the tick-infested areas of the state. Both clinical and subclinical infections occur only in tick-infested areas and they are both more frequent in Bos taurus than in Bos indicus cattle probably due to the greater susceptibility of the former to ticks. Prevalence of infection is significantly greater in cattle exposed to heavy tick infestations than it is in cattle exposed to light tick infestations. B. microplus is considered to be the main vector with transmission being effected by transtadial and intrastadial but not transovarial means. Transtadial transmission by Rhipicephalus sanguineus has been demonstrated but attempts to demonstrate transmission by Haemaphysalis longicornis were unsuccessful. Vaccination with Anaplasma centrale is employed either as a routine preventative measure in young cattle or in the face of an outbreak. Attempts to attenuate a strain of A. marginale by adapting it to sheep were unsuccessful. Oxytetracycline and imidocarb have been used successfully to control the clinical disease.","1906":"The therapeutic regime used in the treatment of dogs with Babesia canis infection differed between dogs with mild (uncomplicated) and severe (complicated) disease. In addition to the treatment given to dogs with mild disease, the dogs with severe disease received intravenous fluids, heparin and blood transfusion together with other supportive measures. Mortalities occurred only in the group with severe disease and were attributed to disseminated intravascular coagulation.","1907":"A series of experiments leading towards the field trial of an irradiated blood-derived vaccine against Babesia divergens, common cause of redwater in cattle in Europe, is described. Initially a number of isolates of B. divergens were made from the blood of sick animals in a variety of localities in the british Isles. These isolates were cryopreserved and then characterised by inoculation into groups of spenectomised Friesian calves, whose reactions were statistically analysed. Attempts were made to prepare a vaccine against B. divergens infection using diluted infected blood, but when these failed it was found that irradiation of infected blood within the range of 24 to 32 kilorads and its intravenous inoculation into calves produced the required immune response without pathogenic effects. An irradiated blood-derived vaccine produced by the irradiation of infected blood at 25 or 30 kilorads was used in a field trial in Ireland, and vaccinated calves were protected against a field challenge which caused redwater in 10 control cattle, six of which had severe reactions.","1908":"Sixty cattle, artificially immunized against C. ruminantium, were challenged 3, 6, 12 and 24 months later. Levels of conglutinin were determined in pre-immunization serum samples. There appeared to be a relationship between the pre-infection levels of conglutinin and the susceptibility of the animals to heartwater: At the time of immunization 31 out of 60 cattle (51,6%) with levels in the low-titre range (1:100-1:160) showed a typical febrile response, whereas 29 (48,4%) with conglutinin levels in the high-titre range (1:320 and higher) were either fully or partially resistant. Except for 2 animals that developed mild febrile reactions when they were challenged 2 years after artificial immunization, all the cattle were fully resistant to challenge with C. ruminantium infected sheep blood. It can be concluded that in this experiment cattle retained their immunity to heartwater for at least 2 years in the absence of reinfection.","1909":"","1910":"Imidocarb was used by three different methods to control reactions in cattle induced by a Babesia blood vaccine produced in South Africa. Simultaneous administration of 0,15 mg\/kg imidocarb and Babesia bovis vaccine gave satisfactory control. When the vaccine was given seven days prior to the imidocarb treatment a dose between 0,15 mg\/kg and 0,6 mg\/kg imidocarb was required for effective control. A combined B. bovis and Babesia bigemina vaccine given at 21 and again 61 days after a 3 mg\/kg imidocarb treatment allowed the development of an adequate premunity to both these parasites.","1911":"Observations are reported on 2743 animals immunised against heartwater since 1958. The methods of immunisation and control of reactions are discussed. This procedure is not without risk and 0,83% of the animals died in spite of treatment. Bos indicus breeds appear to have a greater resistance to heartwater and are relatively easy to immunise. Of the Box taurus breeds the South Devon, the Jersey and the Charolais seem to be particularly susceptible. Older animals and pregnant cows are considered to be in the high risk category.","1912":"A tissue culture method was used to screen compounds for activity against Theileria parva, and demonstrated that the hydroxy-alkylated naphthoquinones, 'menoctone' and 993C were highly active, with ED50 values around 0,005 mg\/l. When injected into cattle artificially infected the T. parva, menoctone cured all of 7 cattle at a total dosage of 10 mg\/kg injected intravenously (i.v.). A further trial showed that injection of menoctone, 10 mg\/kg, as a single dose gby the intramuscular (i.m.) route was more effective than when a similar dose was given by the i.v. route. Titration of serum from these cattle in the in vitro system showed that inhibitory levels of drug persisted for three days after i.v. injection and six days when menoctone was injected i.m. The minimum effective dose level of 993C was 20 mg\/kg i.m. either as a single dose, or as two doses of 10 mg\/kg with an interval of 48 hours.","1913":"The sex, coat colour, age, province and month of occurrence of every case of babesiosis was recorded in a horse population of 5856 in South Africa and Rhodesia. A total of 115 cases were recorded during the period 1973-01-01 to 1973-12-31. Chisquared tests were used to evaluate the significance of frequencies. Significant biases in the distribution of cases of babesiosis were found with regard to season (P &lt; 0,05), sex (P &lt; 0,001) and coat colour (P &lt; 0.01).","1914":"A series of in vitro trials using unfed larvae and fully fed adult ticks confirmed ixodicidal resistance in the one-host Pantropical Blue Tick, Boophilus microplus (Canestrini). Fifty-seven of 64 field isolates were resistant to arsenic; 10 of 56 were resistant to toxaphene; 1 of 5 were resistant to lindane; 3 of 5 were resistant to dieldrin; 3 of 19 were resistant to DDT and 8 of 55 were resistant to the organophosphorus ixodicide, dioxathion. One of the field isolates resistant to dioxathion was also highly resistant to the carbamate, carbaryl, and to the organophosphorus ixodicides benoxophos and diazinon. A second was resistant to the organophosphorus ixodicides benoxophos, diazinon, carbophenothion, dicrotophos, ethion, fenitrothion and quintiofos. Low levels of resistance, less than 3X, were shown to chlorfenvinphos and coumaphos. No resistance was shown to chlorpyrifos, bromophos ethyl or the diamidine ixodicide, amitraz. In hand-spraying trials no variation in the susceptibility of an organophosphorus resistant strain or the susceptible laboratory strain to amitraz was observed. This is the first recorded resistance to ixodicides by B. microplus in Africa.","1915":"Experiments are described to examine the pathogenesis of anaplasmosis in Bos indicus cattle with particular emphasis on nutrition, breed and age. The disease seemed to be less severe in animals under a poor plane of nutrition. Breed was shown to have little effect and there was an age resistance. Natural transmission in Bos indicus calves occurred with ease in endemic areas. This indicated that the introduction of Bos indicus cattle should not adversely affect enzootic stability.","1916":"The distribution of tick species in Zimbabwe Rhodesia is significantly influenced by land utilization practices. The most commonly occurring species in the over-grazed tribal areas is Boophilus decoloratus. By contrast, well-managed commercial farms and ranches support a wide range of tick species, the most important of which is Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Until recently tick-borne diseases of cattle were efficiently controlled through dipping. The low incidence of disease was an important factor contributing to over-grazing in tribal areas. Between 1973 and 1978 political unrest resulted in a collapse of the dipping service in tribal areas. Populations of B. decoloratus built up and outbreaks of babesiosis and anaplasmosis occurred, normally between one and three years after the cessation of dipping. Reduced grazing pressure after the initial disease waves resulted in increased grass cover, allowing species such as R. appendiculatus and Amblyomma hebraeum to become re-established. Outbreaks of theileriosis and heartwater usually followed, decimating the already depleted herds. The heavy cattle mortality resulted from lack of immunity to tick-borne diseases, as a result of efficient disease control through dipping in previous years.","1917":"","1918":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation is described as a complication of Babesia canis infection in the dog. B. canis infection in the dog is characterized as a mild (uncomplicated) or severe (complicated) disease. The clinical, coagulation and haematological, pathological and histopathological findings of the severe disease are described. Thrombocytopenia is reported as occurring in both the mild and severe forms of B. canis infection in the dog.","1919":"A single oral dose of fenbendazole (FBZ) at 10 mg\/kg body mass was given to 5 donkeys. A further 5 donkeys were dosed with a medicated lick (1 mg FBZ\/g lick) until the oral consumption was 10 mg\/kg body mass. In both trials FBZ was highly effective against adults of the following genera: Cyathostomum, Cylicocyclus, Cylicostephanus, Cylicodontophorus, Poteriostomum, Cabellonema, Craterostomum and Triodontophorus; similarly high efficiency was obtained against the following species: Habronema majus, Habronema musca, Strongylus vulgaris and Oxyuris equi and worms identified as belonging to the subfamily Cyathostominae. These results were confirmed in horses and in addition FBZ at 10 mg\/kg was highly effective against Gyalocephalus capitatus, Oesophagodontos robustus and Parascaris equorum.","1920":"","1921":"A gastro-enteritis syndrome mimicking feline panleukopaenia was diagnosed in young dogs in the Republic of South Africa. Parvovirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy in the faeces of these animals. In addition an acutely fatal, acute to sub-acute non-purulent interstitial myocarditis occurred in pups in the same area. Histopathologically large basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were seen in the myocardium of these cases. The two syndromes generally occurred separately, but in two cases were found in the same individuals. The literature on the subject is briefly reviewed and the clinical and pathological findings in these outbreaks are reported.","1922":"Canine ehrlichiosis was successfully transmitted from the domestic dog to three Wild Dogs Lycaon pictus and three Black-backed Jackals Canis mesomelas. Wild Dogs showed symptoms of anorexia and depression as well as anaemia, leucopaenia and mild thrombocytopaenia. Black-backed Jackals were asymptomatic. Morulae of Ehrlichicia canis were found in peripheral blood smears from all experimental animals. The disease was also successfully transmitted from Black-backed Jackal to the domestic dog.","1923":"The use of doxycycline in the treatment of twenty dogs with canine ehrlichiosis is described. The drug was found to be effective even in cases which did not respond to treatment with oxytetracycline.","1924":"","1925":"An outbreak of goitre and hypothyroidism in newborn Angora kids is described. the does had been grazing on lucerne from the time of mating and received a free-choice lick, which included iodine. Investigations revealed that the condition was iodine-responsive, and was probably caused by a goitrogen like thiocyanate.","1926":"The history of bovine anaplasmosis, or tick-born gallsickness, since the discovery of Anaplasma marginale by Sir Arnold Theiler is briefly reviewed. The development of the Anaplasma centrale vaccine by Theiler, up to the composition of the present vaccine issued by Onderstepoort in which the original isolate is still passaged, is discussed in detail. Recent transmission studies at Onderstepoort have shown that 5 tick species are capable of transmitting anaplasmosis intrastadially, and intrastadial transmission, especially by adult male ticks, it is believed, could play an important role in the epizootiology of bovine anaplasmosis in South Africa. Disease incidence and tick distribution are discussed in relation to enzootic and epizootic conditions. Investigations have proved that the Onderstepoort A. centrale vaccine is not as avirulent in adult cattle as it was previously thought to be. The results of a field trial undertaken to test the infectivity of the vaccine, are given.","1927":"A short account of the epidemiology and control of babesiosis in Australia is presented. Epidemiological topics discussed include differences in the transmission of Babesia bovis and B. bigemina by the cattle tick, Boophilus microplus and the relative prevalence, disease incidence and pathogenicity of B. bovis and B. bigemina. Circumstances under which babesiosis occurs in Australia are described. In the Section on control, only vaccination is discussed. Changes in the preparation of babesial vaccines, particularly those resulting in a highly infective vaccine containing relatively avirulent B. bovis are described. Fluctuations in demand, such as the increase from about 100,000 to over 1,000,000 doses in 4 years in the mid-1960s are shown. An unexpected increase in the use of A. centrale in 1973 is discussed, and the supply of B. bigemina for cattle exported from Australia reported.","1928":"A card test for detecting anaplasmosis, along with the complement-fixation test, has proved useful in identifying carrier animals. This identification, associated with treatment with tetracyclines, has been a basis for control in the southeast where anaplasmosis is endemic. The tetracyclines are used parenterally (terramycin 11 mg\/kg, 10-14 days) or orally (2,2 to 11 mg\/kg, 45-60 days). Notwithstanding these methods, anaplasmosis remains a problem and many animals require treatment to moderate the course of acute infection. A new drug, T-200 (a long-lasting terramycin), has been tested and found effective in treating acute infections (20 mg\/kg, 1 time) and in cleaning carrier infections (20 mg\/kg, 2 times at a 7-day interval). For several years, a killed adjuvant vaccine was extensively used to control anaplasmosis. The occurrence of neonatal isohemolytic anaemia in association with this vaccine has discouraged its use. This vaccine is still being marketed, but is usually used on selected animals. An attenuated Anaplasma vaccine of ovine origin has been developed, but is not licensed for use in the United States although it has been successfully used elsewhere.","1929":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a clinicopathologic process of man and animals which occurs secondary to many diseases. The process may manifest in a variety of clinical syndromes including medical shock, haemorrhage, haemolysis and organ failure. A diagnosis can be confirmed by detecting a deficiency of several haemostatic components and the presence of raised levels of circulating fibrinogen (fibrin) degradation products. Therapy of the disorder includes the removal of the initiating factors which have provoked the clotting process together with the use of anticoagulants. The disease processes in which disseminated intravascular coagulation is implicated in the dog are enumerated.","1930":"","1931":"It is currently thought that the following species or sub-species of Theileria occur in cattle in southern Africa: Theileria parva parva (East Coast fever), Theileria parva lawrencei (Corridor disease), Theileria parva bovie (Rhodesian theileriosis), Theileria mutans proper (transmitted by Amblyomma species), so-called Theileria mutans (a non-pathogenic species transmitted by Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, possibly identical with Theileria taurotragi) and Theileria velifera. The parasites can be differentiated on serological, morphological and epidemiological grounds. The four true species are serologically distinct. T. mutans proper and T. velifera show morphological differences from the other two species in some stages of their development. The T. parva group are the only parasites that are commonly pathogenic. Differentiation of the three members of this group is based on differences in the numbers of schizonts and piroplasms present and on differences in the epidemiology of the diseases they cause.","1932":"","1933":"","1934":"Two tests for penicillin residues in milk using the test organisms Sarcina lutea and Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis respectively are presented. The test methods are described, the results compared and the advantages of the latter test demonstrated.","1935":"The pressure of the gametes of the protozoon parasite Hepatazoon in the blood of a domestic cat is recorded for the first time in South Africa. Clinical symptoms which may have been associated with the infection are described. The animal recovered after treatment with primaquine and oxytetracycline.","1936":"The clinical, clinical pathological and pathological findings of a dog showing progressive paralysis due to toxoplasmosis are described. Necropsy revealed polymyositis and a meningoencephalitis as well as a meningomyeloradiculitis. The differential diagnoses of the different forms of toxoplasmosis are briefly discussed.","1937":"The incidence, diagnosis and surgical treatment of canine cervical disc lesions are described.","1938":"The incidence, pathology and accurate localisation of canine intervertebral disc lesions are reviewed and the surgical technique for wide dorsal laminectomy is described.","1939":"Foreleg lameness caused by the interaction of diet and rapid growth rate is all too frequently encountered in the large and giant breeds of dogs. In this paper, the influence of rapid growth rate and growth hormone on bone formation is briefly considered. The importance causes of this problem are discussed. These are hypertrophic osteodystrophy, osteodystrophy II, retained enchondral cartilage cores, panosteitis an nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism. Rickets and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy are also considered. Emphasis is placed on the aetiology, radiographic diagnosis and rational treatment. A case report of a 6-month-old Great Dane with osteodystrophy II and retained enchondral cartilage cores in the ulnar metaphyses is presented as an example of such a problem.","1940":"Problems encountered in the hand-rearing of Cape hunting dogs are discussed. It is felt that these could be minimised by avoiding stress, by rearing pups as close to natural circumstances as in possible, by applying sound husbandry techniques and by keeping the pups together.","1941":"A study was undertaken to investigate the healing and regeneration of articular cartilage following trauma. Surgically created superficial and depp lesions involving the articular surface of the femoral condyles were evaluated in 28 dogs at intervals of two four, eight and sixteen weeks. The general conclusion reached was that cartilage resonded to trauma either with fibrous tissue repair (undergoing metaplasia to fibro--cartilage) when the lesion was deep, or by limited cellular replacement before the superficial layers became reorganised into zones resembling the normal, if the lesions were superficial. This process tended to tail off before the defect was filled i.e. the regenerative process appeared to cease before the lesion was anatomically restored to normal.","1942":"The protozoan Encephalitozoon was isolated in primary kidney cultures from dogs originating from three separate outbreaks of encephalitozoonosis in kennels. The disease was characterized by a fading syndrome in young puppies with nervous signs developing in some cases. It was not possible to reproduce the clinical disease with cultured organisms in either normal dogs or dogs immunosuppressed with methylprednisolone. The organisms were, however, reisolated in primary culture from two immunosuppressed dogs but not from other experimentally infected dogs. The freezing of Encephalitozoon organisms in liquid nitrogen is described.","1943":"White muscle disease appeared in lambs born of ewes in the zero grazing group during the course of a comparative fertility trial on ewes on various systems of husbandry. Analysis of the feed showed barely adequate selenium in the maize silage and a deficiency in the soil on which the high lysine maize was grown. Treatment of the lambs with a selenium\/vitamin E injection rapidly controlled the condition. This deficiency may be more widespread than is presently realised.","1944":"In a study of the response in cattle to a live and an inactivated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine prepared from cell cultures infected with RVF virus, the effects of varying doses and combinations of these vaccines were compared. The antibody response to a primary injection of either vaccines was poor when measured by the serum virus neutralization test (SVN) and the haemagglutination-inhibition test (HI) but a booster dose of inactivated vaccine evoked a good anamnestic response in cattle previously injected with either of these vaccines. Cattle vaccinated with the live vaccine but negative to the SVN or the HI for RVF were immune when challenged with a virulent RVF virus isolated from a cow during 1974.","1945":"A 1973 survey on the incidence of inhibitory substances (mostly antiobiotic residues) in market milk supplied in Pretoria, on 3 195 herd milk samples, 65 tanker milk samples and 252 samples of pasteurised milk using the disc assay procedure with Bacillus stearothermophilus C 953 as test organism, revealed inhibitory substances equivalent to 0,005 IU penicillin\/ml in 7.8% of the herd samples, 29,2% of the tanker samples and in 38.5% of the samples of pasteurised milk. In 38.9% of the positive herd milk samples and 73% of the samples of pasteurised milk, penicillin was indentified with the aid of the penicillinase test. Some of the pasteurised milk contained inhibitory substances equivalent to more than 1.0 IU penicillin\/ml; in some of the herd milk samples this figure exceeded 5,0 IU penicillin\/ml. A repeat survey was undertaken in 1977\/78 to evaluate the effect of compulsory dye-marking of non-prescription mastitis remedies on the situation. In a total of 1 081 herd milk samples, 60 tanker milk samples and 112 samples of pasteurised milk, antibiotic residues were found in 2,13% of the herd milk, 11,7% of the tanker milk and 2,1% of the pasteurised milk samples, with a much lower average concentration of antibiotic residues. The compulsory dye-marking of mastitis remedies had a beneficial effect on the occurrence of antibiotic residues in milk but did not ensure their complete absence, presumably because dye-marking was not made compulsory in scheduled preparations.","1946":"","1947":"Fifteen dogs which were serologically negative to the IFA test against Encephalitozoon developed antibodies in their sera following experimental infection. Six other dogs which were not tested prior to infection had titres to Encephalitozoon after experimental infection. In a sequential study in four dogs, antibodies first appeared between 32 and 39 days after infection. These results show that the IFA test would be suitable for epidemiological studies. Fifty serum samples collected from two kennels in which encephalitozoonosis had been confirmed showed an IFA test positive prevalence rate of 70%. In 220 serum samples submitted for various clinial pathological examinations the prevalence rate of antibodies to Ebcephalitozoon was 18%.","1948":"This is a case report of pneumocytosis of an eight month old Dachschund from the Cape Province. Clinically it was an afebrile disease with signs limited primarily to the lower respiratory tract. The report consists of a short history, the histopathologic findings, evidence of the electron microscopic confirmation of the diagnosis and a brief discussion. It is believed to represent the first case of canine pneumocystosis in the Republic of South Africa.","1949":"Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii in two unrelated Miniature Dachshunds is reported. The clinical findings, gross- and histopathology and some diagnostic transmission and scanning electron microscopic features of the condition are described. Although pneumocystosis has been reported from a human and a domestic goat in the Republic of South Africa, these are probably the first reported cases of the canine disease in this country.","1950":"Fenbedazole, dosed to artificially infested cattle at 7,5 mg\/kg live mass, was more than 80% effective in more than 80% of the treated animals against immature and adult Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi; Cooperia spp., Bunostomum phlebotum and Oesophagostomum radiatum.","1951":"In spite of genetic and environmental standardisation in farm and laboratory animal science, a considerable amount of variation in the results of comparable experiments remains. This presumably depends upon the individual variability within a species, and upon differences of various species in their specific demands to the environment in captivity. Due to a discovery in the Southwest-African lovebird species Agapornis roseicollis, used as a conventional laboratory animal in bioacoustic research, the phenomenon of instantaneous fear expressed in a number of different displays in connection with the presence or presentation of red objects is described and compared to earlier observations of instantaneous phobias, aggressions, and preferences towards colours, in other bird species. Consequently it is suggested that investigation of the chromatophobe and chromatophile behaviour of typical laboratory and farm animals be undertaken to ensure the adequate design of lodging and experimental environments.","1952":"An outbreak of mortality in a flock of mutton merino sheep in which 109 out of 568 sheep died in the south-western Cape Province, is described. It was characterized by haemorrhagic septicaemia, anaemia, leucocytopaenia and haemorrhagic tendencies. Mortalities followed unseasonal and heavy summer rain, extended over a period of 6 months and were associated with the uninterrupted consumption of sheep cubes processed on the farm severly fungus-infested wheat, barley and rye straw for a period of at least one month. The main clinical signs occurred in two phases: an elevated body temperature, listlessness, epistaxis and intermittent haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first phase of the outbreak, and a progressively worsening anaemia, leucocytopaenia and less severe haemorrhagic tendencies and a terminally elevated body temperature during the second phase. The predominant autopsy findings were purpuric haemorrhage on serosal and mucosal surfaces and in most of the organs, enterorrhagia and severe pulmonary congestion and oedema during the first stage; anaemia was the predominant sign during the second stage - widespread haemorrhage still occurred but was less extensive. Pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from most of the animals autopsied during the first stage. Histologically the most salient features were atrophy and necrosis of the lymphoid tissue, aplastic anaemia and a markedly impaired inflammatory response. Extensive post-natal lamb mortalities, probably due to an Escherichia coli infection precipitated by the toxicosis, occurred during the outbreak. Toxigenic strains of Stachybotrys chartarum were isolated from the wheat and barley straw. Diethyl ether extracts of the wheat straw, sheep cubes and S. chartarum culture material elicited positive skin tests in rats following intradermal injection and the presence of 12,13-epoxytrichothecenes in these extracts were confirmed by thin layer chromatography. In feeding trials sheep cubes and wheat straw caused the death of 4\/4 one-day-old Pekin ducklings and weanling Wistar rats in six and nine days, respectively. This is the first description of an outbreak of disease in sheep associated with the ingestion of S. chartarum-infested food components in the Republic of South Africa.","1953":"Twenty splenectomized Afrikander\/Simmentaler cross animals were used. Eight of these were naturally infected with Anaplasma marginale while 12 were infected artificially. When the packed cell volume was reduced to between 24% and 20% during the post splenectomy relapses or primary infections, six animals were treated with a single injection of 20 mg\/kg of long acting oxytetracycline (LA) and seven animals were treated on two successive days with 10 mg\/kg of short acting oxytetracycline (SA). The remaining seven animals served as untreated controls. Both drugs were effective in controlling A. marginale reactions. No deaths occurred in the group of animals treated with oxytetracycline LA and they showed a longer relapse interval and higher blood levels of oxytetracycline compared to those treated with oxytetracycline SA. A single death occurred in the latter group. Four deaths occurred in the control group which also had the shortest relapse interval.","1954":"A specific form of phytobezoar in goats and sheep is described with regard to epizootology, symptomatology, gross pathology, and gross morphology of the bezoars. The probable mode of formation and control measures are also discussed.","1955":"The possibility of including sodium hydroxide-treated lucerne hay as a constituent in rations for horses was investigated by measuring its effect on the performance and certain bloodcomponents of growing foals. As no adverse effects were found it is concluded that further investigation is necessary to see whether the inclusion of low grade-treated roughages in the ration of horses would be of economic significance.","1956":"Clinical, clinicopathological macroscopical and histopathological findings, as well as electron microscopic and cultural confirmation, in twelve natural cases of canine encephalitozoonosis are described, eleven of these under one year of age. Nervous symptoms, including blindness, retarded growth rate and nephritis are prominent clinical signs. The macroscopic findings and histopathology proved of great help in the diagnosis of the disease even in chronic cases. The organism was cultured and some distinguishing electron microscopical features between Encephalitozoon and Nosema are discussed. A transmission experiment confirmed the diagnosis. The results are compared with the reported cases in dogs and Blue Foxes (Alopex lagopus).","1957":"A case of cardiac myopathy resembling Selenium-Vitamin E Deficiency myopathy is described in a puppy. The left ventricular myocardium was extensively involved. The macroscopic and microscopic appearances are described. The literature on the subject is briefly reviewed.","1958":"The amounts of feed required during each of the reproductive phases are graphically illustrated and supported by specific recommendations where possible with discussion of the underlying rationale and of the often conflicting considerations. For flushing, an increase of 50 to 100% of energy requirements above maintenance level is recommended, supplied, for example, by one to two kg maize extra per day during the week before expected oestrus, in order to increase the ovulation rate. During pregnancy a constant feeding level is proposed 2.2 to 2.5 kg of feed with 8.8 MJ of nett energy\/kg and 12% digestible crude protein being necessary. Two days before farrowing the feeding level must be lowered and steps taken to keep the gut contents to a minimum. During lactation the feed has to contain 8.8 MJ nett energy\/kg and 14% digestible crude protein and the intake reduced by 10 to 20% in the case of early weaning. At weaning a fasting regime is suggested to effect physiological stress. The relation between feeding level during pregnancy and the mass gain of the sow asnd number of piglets born, as well as on the birth mass of the piglets, and the relation between N intake and N retention and litter mass oat birth are shown graphically.","1959":"Phencyclidine HCl and ketamine HCl were used as immobilizing agents on six captive Cape Hunting dogs. Both drugs were suitable and three dogs immobilized with ketamine HCl at a dosage rate of 7 mg\/kg had smoother and shorter recovery periods than the three animals immobilized with phencyclidine HCl.","1960":"The most obvious symptoms of rabies in farm animals and pets in South Africa and South-West Africa are discussed in the light of information obtained during routine examination of specimens for the 10-year-period 1967--1976. More than 55% of the cases encountered were cattle in which the most obvious symptoms were salivation (92%), bellowing (69%), aggressiveness (47%), paresis or paralysis (30%) and straining (12%). Unlike cattle, the most obvious symptom in goats was aggressiveness (83%). Salivation was observed in ony 29% of goats but, like bellowing in cattle, bleating was very obvious in 72% of cases. Sheep were usually quiet, but 67% were aggressive. Salivation was observed in 30%, while 27% showed an abnormal sexual desire. The second highest incidence of rabies was recorded in dogs (20%). Aggressiveness was the most obvious symptom (71%) followed by salivation (48%), paresis and paralysis (28%) and barking (11%). With the exception of salivation and paresis, which were rarely encountered, aggressiveness was the only symptom observed in cats. Several cats were encountered with rabies-like symptoms due to organic phosphate poisoning. The most obvious symptoms in horses and donkeys were aggressiveness (77%), paresis or paralysis 33%), the chewing of foreign matter (33%) and salivation 22%). It is obvious that other conditions can easily be confused with rabies. Therefore every possible cause for rabies-like behaviour must be considered and eliminated to avoid unnecessary destruction of animals.","1961":"During the rainy season in the central valley of Cochahbamba, Bolivia, the larvae and nymphae of this tick were found feeding under the tails of dairy cattle as well as in their ears. The conditions that apparently favour the temporary infestation of this site on some cows are discussed briefly.","1962":"","1963":"Two hundred and sixty nine beef, 230 sheep and 165 pig carcase surface were examined bacteriologically. Direct and indirect contact examination techniques were utilised. Colony counts per cm2 were expressed in geometric progression. Counting procedures, direct and indirect contact examinations, and effects of chilling were considered. Subsequently, results from an additional 489 beef, 520 sheep, and 408 pig carcases were employed to illustrate a count classification arrangement against which bacteriological monitoring assessments could be measured.","1964":"The techniques used in investigations undertaken to study the arterial blood supply of the brain of domestic ruminants are described and evaluated. These include various coloured intravascular injections, corrosion preparations, injection of contrast media for angiography and clearing of tissues.","1965":"A technique for the radioimmunoassay of progesterone in plasma is described. In one trial the oestrous cycles of four cycling cows and in another trial of one non-cycling cow and two cycling heifers were synchronized by the administration of progesterone. Each female received either 50 mg or 0,1 mg\/kg of progesterone intramuscularly on alternate days in two courses of four and six injections respectively. Blood samples of the animals were collected either daily or two-daily before, over the entire period of treatment and for eight days after the last progesterone injection. The results of the progesterone assays are represented graphically for each individual cow or heifer. The plasma progesterone levels during treatment were maintained reasonably well at levels corresponding to those normally encountered during the lluteal phase of the cycle. The progesterone levels, however, did not drop as rapidly as desired after the last injection but might have been influenced by a residual corpus luteum from a previous ovulation.","1966":"","1967":"A case of bovine cerebral theileriosis is described in which the principle lesions occurred in the spinal cord and its meninges. These were clogging of vessels with lymphocytes, many of which were parasitised by Theileria sp. schizonts (probably T. mutans), thrombosis and infarction of nervous tissue, and lymphocytic meningomyelitis. Rare cerebral meningeal vessels showed thrombosis. Clinically the animal showed posterior paresis.","1968":"A pilot trial was conducted with fenthion 20% m\/v to determine possible abortifacient or other toxic effects when applied to 4 1\/2 month pregnant beef cows. No abortions or other clinical symptoms which could be attributed to the fenthion were observed after two topical applications, at a 3-week interval, of up to 5 times the therapeutic dose.","1969":"","1970":"Anthelmintic trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of albendazole against helmi of 2,5 to 3,8 mg\/kg administered orally, resulted in a 98,8 to 100% reduction of adult parasites of the genera Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Trichostrongylus, Nematodirus, Gaigeria, Oesophagostomum, Chabertia, Marshallagia and Cooperia. Against the immature stages of these genera, except for Marshallagia and Cooperia, which were not tested, a dose level of 2,5 to 3,8 mg\/kg was 83,9-100% effective. Albendazole at 2,5 mg\/kg was 99,0% effective against adult stages of Dictyocaulus; its activity at a dose of 3,8 mg\/kg against the immature stages of D. filaria was 89,3%. In sheep naturally infested with Moniezia, 100% elimination was obtained at a dose level of 2,5 mg\/kg. Dose levels of 3,8 mg\/kg and higher were more than 76% effective against adult Fasciola hepatica, while a dose of 4,8 mg\/kg was 63% effective against adult Fasciola gigantica.","1971":"The findings of a recent investigation into the epizootiology, course, symptomatology, gross pathology, chemical pathology and prevention of Enzootic Icterus are presented and the findings of previous investigations on these and other aspects are reevaluated. Enzootic Icterus and chronic copper poisoning are shown to be identical in all fundamental features. Both diseases are characterised by sudden onset, high mortality, icterus, anaemia, haemoglobinaemia, methaemoglobinaemia, haemoglobinuria and deeply pigmented kidneys. There are no described microscopic features on which the diseases can be differentiated. Very high levels of copper in the blood, liver and kidneys are found in both diseases. In the present work 36 liver specimens had a mean copper concentration of 701 microgram\/g. Of 31 kidney specimens no values under 10 microgram\/g were found while the mean was 107 microgram\/g. Prevention of Enzootic Icterus by salts of molybdenum given orally confirms the identity. No close relationship with Geeldikkop is found other than the probability that the two diseases may act synergistically. Interpretation of existing knowledge of mineral levels of natural grazing in the enzootic region shows that the levels can account for the presence of chronic copper poisoning, although more investigation is required.","1972":"During a period of 14 months two tracer calves per month were slaughtered after one month's exposure to natural helminth infestation on a farm in the Northern Transvaal Bushveld. Total parasitic helminth burdens, which were never large, were determined in order to define their seasonal incidence. The gastro-intestinal parasites that were recovered were Bunostomum phlebotomum, Cooperia pectinata, Cooperia punctata, Haemonchus placei, Oesophagostomum radiatum and Trichostongylus spp. Of these Cooperia spp. were most prevalent, and the highest mean monthly burden attained was 1250 in November, 1976. Worm burdens were apparently positively correlated with rainfall, which during the survey period was lower than the average for the particular region. In addition to the more common gastro-intestinal nematodes, Thelazia rhodesii and Parafilaria bovicola were also encountered. Various techniques employed in conducting helminth surveys are discussed.","1973":"A dislocated elbow of a male elephant calf (Loxodonta africana) in the Addo Elephant National Park resulted in it being harassed by other elephants and consequently leaving its maternal herd at the age of 6 years, rather than the more usual age of 9-10 years. In the absence of large predators the elephant had survived for 9 years and had adapted its locomotion and intraspecific behaviour to its injury. The humeral joint of the affected forelimb was carried in partial extension while the cubital and carpal joints were permanently in partial flexion. Substantial secondary osteoarthritic changes, extensive fusion and compensatory remodelling of the humerus, radius and ulna had taken place together with compensatory development in the musculature. The planes of articulation of the limb bones had also been considerably rotated inward.","1974":"An apparatus designed to electrically stun Karakul lambs prior to slaughter was tested for efficiency using the cardiac pain reflex and electrocorticograms to assess unconsciousness. The electrical shock delivered by the apparatus was found to produce unconsciousness, as opposerd to curarisation, of sufficient duration to allow for subsequent slaughter.","1975":"","1976":"","1977":"The need for economic awareness is stressed, and some practical aspects which the author has found helpful are described in detail. Some such examples are: linking both professional and other salaries to gross fees as an aid to motivation, cash or credit for accounts receivable, financial analysis to guide money management, and the marketing of pet vaccines.","1978":"","1979":"A case of oestrogen toxicity in the dog is described. The bone marrow was primarily affected with resultant non-regenerative anaemia, leukocytosis followed by leukopaenia, and thrombocytopaenia. Endometritis, toxaemia and disseminate intravascular coagulation were complicating factors. The case terminated fatally intensive therapy.","1980":"","1981":"","1982":"A case of granulomatous enteritis in a 2 year-old Thoroughbred colt is reported. Clinically the horse showed chronic wasting and subcutaneous oedema of the ventral parts of the body and legs. Grossly the wall of the jejunum and ileum was uniformly thickened. Microscopically the lamina propria, submucosa and the tunica muscalaris of the small intestine were infiltrated with lymphocytes, plasma cells, epithelioid cells and occasional multinucleated giant cells. The granulomatous reaction was most marked in the muscular layers of the gut wall.","1983":"Fenbendazole was administered as an anthelmintic to cattle and sheep by incorporation into feed blocks. The therapeutic dose of 5 mg\/kg live mass for sheep and 10 mg\/kg for cattle was administered in divided dosages over periods of 4 d and in some cases 5 d. The periods were limited to obviate possible development of resistance. The anthelmintic effect was equal to, or better than, the standard therapeutic dose administered as a single dose in the form of the commercially available fenbendazole suspensions, when comparing the results obtained by the modified non-parametric method of evaluating anthelmintics.","1984":"","1985":"A series of in vitro trails confirmed resistance in the three-host tick, Amblyomma hebraeum Koch, to the organophosphorus ixodicides, dioxathion, chlorfenvinphos, quintiofos, bromophos-ethyl and a dioxathion\/chlorfenvinphos combination. The results of a routine survey showed that a resistance factor of greater than 100x was present in the offspring of ticks in six of 115 field isolates tested. These six isolates were confined to the lowveld areas of the province of Natal, Republic of South Africa, and Swaziland. Ticks in a further 59 isolates were less susceptible than the reference strain. Resistance was present in all three tick instars. This is the first recorded resistance to the organophosphorus group of ixodicides by multi-host ticks in Africa.","1986":"In a four year survey 253 isolates of Boophilus decoloratus from the Republic of South Africa and Transkei were tested in the laboratory for their susceptibility to certain organophosphorus ixodicides. Fifty-seven of these isolates were susceptible to organophosphorus compounds, 88 isolates showed a range of susceptibility between that of the susceptible laboratory strain and a strain having a resistance greater than that for the Berlin type strain. A field trial confirmed degrees of resistance shown in the laboratory to the organophosphorus ixodicides benoxophos, chlorfenvinphos, dioxathion, dicrotophos, quintiofos and chlorfenvinphos\/dioxathion.","1987":"Cases of acute mortality in sheep, characterised by severe nephrosis and resultant uraemia, were investigated on two farms 150 km apart in the Winter Rainfall area of the Republic of South Africa. This condition was experimentally reproduced by dosing sheep with Anagallis arvensis L plants. The most consipicious lesion was a coagulative necrosis with intratubular haemorrhage in the renal cortex. The history, clinical signs and the pathology, and experimental reproduction of the disease are described.","1988":"\"Cube colic\" is described and vain attempts to cause the problem on an experimental basis are recorded. It is concluded that not all horses are susceptible to cube colic and if colic occurs in horses being fed on cubes, it is not necessarily due to feeding of cubes. Nomenclature of bowel disorders is considered.","1989":"The literature on exercise physiology in the horse with special reference to swimming is briefly reviewed. The use of a pool for swimming horses is described and a technique discussed for the collection of haematologic and haemodynamic data using this form of exercise.","1990":"","1991":"Future developments will depend mainly on new information generated by research and on effective application of preventive medicine. In the latter case, the various diagnostic centres in South Africa will have to be developed to their full extent, leading to the drawing up of computerised disease profiles and monitoring of the incidence of scheduled diseases. Dealing with these problems will require further knowledge to be generated by research. Problems of increasing drug, insecticide and acaricide resistance and problems of virus bionomics will call for attack at the molecular, biochemical, biophysical and immunological levels. This will demand adjustment of post-graduate veterinary education and of ever closer collaboration with scientists well-versed in the basic disciplines. Despite the argument that animal production will be ousted by crop production, the former, particularly in South Africa, is bound to develop and will call for more attention to the physiology of digestion and metabolism and to diseases of metabolism of ruminants. Concern is expressed that so few young veterinarians take up research as a career, as South Africa has many veterinary problems peculiar to itself.","1992":"","1993":"A mycetoma like syndrome in a dog caused by a hyphomycete reminiscent of Acremonium hyalinum (Sacc.) W. Gams, is described. The organism was seen in smears of pus and sections from the kidneys and myocardium and was isolated in pure culture from the lesions.","1994":"","1995":"","1996":"","1997":"","1998":"","1999":"The standardisation of a method to perform antibiograms using Meuller Hinton agar routinely is described. It was found that from 1973 to 1975 the resistance of E. coli to oxytetracycline decreased from 49% to 32.5% and to sulphonamides from 49% to 42.5%. Resistance to furazolidone increased from 12% to 22%. No dramatic changes in the resistance to neomycin and chloramphenicol were found.","2000":"The present state of our knowledge on the symptoms, pathogenesis and breed susceptibility of preputial prolapse in bulls is reviewed together with the anatomical and physiological relationships that operate in the development of a prolapse of the inner layer of the sheath. Suggestions for the elimination of the condition through selection are made.","2001":"The history of the South African Military Veterinary Services is outlined from the time the first veterinarian, Thomas Burrowes, attached to the 8th Light Dragoons, set foot in the Cape in 1799, until the end of World War II. It summarises the extensive literature published mainly by Curson in previous issues of this Journal and extends it to include the period of that war.","2002":"","2003":"","2004":"The South African Veterinary Association originated with the formation of the Transvaal Veterinary Medical Association in 1903. The amalgamation of the three existing provincial associations under a joint constitution in 1920 formed a body representing the veterinary profession in the whole of South Africa. Throughout the past 75 years the SAVA has served as representative for the diversity of interests of the profession. The aims and major contributions of the Association, past and present, as well as the challenges of the future, are outlined.","2005":"","2006":"In briefly reviewing the history of veterinary education, particularly that in England, the enduring influence education has on the achievements and status of the profession is emphasised. The sound influence of the first teachers in South Africa, under the guidance of men like Theiler and subsequently du Toit, on veterinary education is outlined. The changes that have taken place in the face of altered demands, from that required by a predominantly State-employed profession to one consisting mainly of private practitioners but with ever-expanding fields of activity, necessitates continual attention to thorough teaching in the basic subjects, to the discipline as against the species approach--the latter being of value, however, when applying preventive medicine to herds\/flocks, to a uniform undergraduate curriculum, and to foreseeing and providing adequate, specialised post-graduate education. The present under-graduate course has been extended from five to five-and-a-half years and the South African student enrollment to 90\/a. Furthermore, more time will be found by already starting the teaching of Anatomy in the first year, thus providing for a final year of \"student-internship\". A completely newly planned faculty complex at a more favourable site is a necessity; clinical assistants will haevto be employed. More attention must be given to Public Health and Food Hygiene. Facilities for training Black studnets is a first priority in providing for additional student enrollment. Despite all modern teaching aids, the teacher must always play a vital key role.","2007":"","2008":"Drug development relies on the assumption of a high degree of correlation between the effects of drugs in animals and man. While a good correlation exists as far as the pharmacodynamic action of the drug is concerned it is usually the unpredictable pharmacokinetic properties of the drug responsible for obscuring proper correlations.","2009":"Certain techniques for measuring amino acid absorption are considered, their specific roles are defined and both theoretical and practical considerations are used to evaluate each system. Some methodological considerations are presented.","2010":"","2011":"","2012":"The patterns of urinary porphyria excretion and hepatic porphyrin accumulation in hexachlorobenzene-treated rats is similar to that observed in overt porphyria cutanea tarda and may be attributed to a decrease in activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen (UROGEN) decarboxylase. The 3.5 diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-treated rat has been evaluated as a model to test the porphyrinogenicity of drugs.","2013":"Using a rat model, it was shown that the synthesis of certain testis enzymes during pubertal development is under hormonal control, which acts as regulatory mechanism for gene expression during eukaryotic differentiation. Esterase activity and its electrophoretic banding pattern can be specifically induced by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Alcohol dehydrogenase and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are independently induced by HCG, and are apparently coded for by 2 different genetic cistrons.","2014":"Environmental chambers provide a convenient means of studying the toxicology of gases in experimental animals. The specialised equipment needed for these studies is not commercially available. This paper reports on the design, construction and performance of a simple, and inexpensive, inhalation chamber and gas mixing unit for air pollution studies in small laboratory animals. Provision has been made for controlling the mixing of gases, the ventilation rate, the even distribution of gases in the chamber and for the removal of vented gases to prevent the hazard of air pollution in the laboratory animal facility. No significant differences were found between the food and water consumption and body mass gain of a group of rats housed in the chamber for 5 days and a control group housed im similar cages located in a rodent room and managed under conventional laboratory conditions. The chamber fulfills all the requirements for an animal inhalation system.","2015":"The rodent species used at the South African Institute for Medical Research for the culture of mammalian species of schistosomes are listed. Emphasis is given to the advantages of wild South African species which have been adapted to laboratory conditions, and infection techniques are discussed.","2016":"The paper describes the use of 14 South African wild rodent species as experimental models and demonstrates the proven value of many of these as laboratory animals in research on bacterial infections (plague, relapsing fever), rickettsial infections (tickbite fever, louse typhus), viral infections (poliomyelitis. Rift-Valley fever and  other arbovirus infections, Lassa fever), fungal infections (histoplasmosis), parasitic infections (schistosomiasis) and in diabetes mellitus and cancer research.","2017":"","2018":"The development and organisation of the centre which now has over 1,500 non-human primates representing more than 30 species, including great apes, is described. Important projects are mainly in the neural and behavioural field, including language acquisition, but also on aspects of experimental pathology.","2019":"The use of the Japanese quail as a laboratory animal was first reported in 1959. Since then this species has been increasingly used as an avian model for biomedical research. A quail colony was recently established in the Dental Research Institute to provide adult birds for teratogenicity and toxicity studies. These birds are not widely used for biological research in South Africa at present. The housing, husbandry, breeding and nutrition of this species is described, together with the biomethodology which is applicable to this species.","2020":"The Y and the Z strains of Praomys natalensis (Mastomys) are being sucessfully inbred, as far as is known for the first time. Spontaneous tumours of the glandular stomach have been found to develop in these rodents. Evidence is provided of the great potential of the laboratory Mastomys for use in medical research on cancer, plague, bilhaziasis, and more recently in the research on the Lassa fever virus.","2021":"Laboratory animal technology has evolved into a specialised field of expertise which is associated with the production, care and use of laboratory animals in biomedical teaching and research. A survey of laboratory animal facilities and supporting personnel was undertaken to assess the uses of laboratory animals in relation to the administrative and technical staffing of animal facilities. The results of this study indicate that there is a need for training in laboratory animal science at both the technical and professional levels. Options for the development of formal training in laboratory animal technology are reviewed.","2022":"Various considerations aimed at improving the welfare of experimental animals are discussed, with particular reference to the situation in the United Kingdom. These include, inter alia, codes of standards for accommodation and equipment, prevention or reduction to a minimum of pain, and the appointment of committees consisting of biological scientists, veterinarians, teachers and lay persons to advise on proposed experiments.","2023":"The challenges of managing a facility serving a new and developing science are outlined. Basic to success are the appropriate handling of aspects such as staff selection, line management, financial support, changing demands, training and relations with staff unions, welfare organisations and at the international level.","2024":"The keeping of animals in an enclosed area and their use for scientific work goes back to the beginning of the Christian era. This activity gradually developed into the specific science we know today. Principles of housing, animal care, equipment and management according to which, it is felt a modern animal facility should be designed, equipped and operated, are discussed.","2025":"","2026":"In dental research, in common with other forms of scientific research, the use of laboratory animals is necessary to carry out many investigations that may not be undertaken on man, and to control biological variability. In South Africa the main experimental animals used in dental research are rats and vervet monkeys, although other species such as dogs and baboons have been used. This paper lists examples of published dental research carried out in laboratory animals in South Africa in the fields of bone healing, dental caries, dental materials, growth studies, oral cancer, oral mucosa and periodontal disease investigations.","2027":"The use of non-human primates stems from the concern for employing an animal genetically closely related to man. During a 3 year period over 300 baboons were handled in the Cardiac Research Unit and more than 60 heterotopic cardiac transplantations were performed. The baboon presents multiple advantages if compared with the problems arising from the use of the dog or the pig in cardiac surgical experimentation. This experimental work illustrated these advantages and demonstrated that heterotopic cardiac transplantation is a valuable model for treatment of patients in end stage cardiac failure. The procedure has been performed successfully in 16 patients, 12 being presently alive, 1-36 months following transplant.","2028":"Our surveys indicate that nearly all batches of vervet monkeys arriving at the National Institute for Virology from various areas of South Africa, are infected with foamy viruses and there is evidence that intra-urterine infection also occurs. Monkeys from certain areas of South Africa are apparently infected with the protozoal parasite Entopolypoides macaci in a sub-clinical state which becomes active when the monkeys are splenectomised. Serological studies indicate that infections with schistosomes, tick-bite fever (Rickettsia conori), chlamydsiae and occasionally by leptospirae, occur in monkeys in the Kruger National Park. Complement fixation tests for antibodies to R. mooseri and R. prowazeki were also sometimes positive; a finding of doubtful importance. There was a high percentage with positive antibody tests to chikungunya virus in a certain age group suggesting that there had been an outbreak of this disease in the Kruger Park in the late summer and autumn of 1976. This coincided with a human outbreak. Large numbers of vervet and baboon sera were tested for antibodies against SA 12 virus, a polyoma virus. A high percentage of baboons but only a small number of monkeys was found to be positive and it is concluded that SA 12 is probably a baboon virus which is occasionally transmitted to monkeys by contact. It is pointed out that these studies only indicate diseases from which monkeys recover and they do not indicate prevalence of severe disease causing grave illness or death.","2029":"Bronchiectasis is common in older rats and is a serious complication when the lungs are repuired for research purposes. SPF rats do not develop this complication, but special isolated accommodation must be provided and care of the animals must avoid introduction of outside micro-organisms. Animals removed from the isolated accommodation for experimental work are not returned, but can be kept in the general animal house provided there are no conventionally-bred rats.","2030":"The mortality rates and spontaneous diseases defining the course of natural mortality graphs in colonies of Han: NMRI mice kept under conventional, SPF and germfree maintenance conditions are reported. A specific problem in SPF colonies is caused by ubiquitous germs. The lesions and possible reasons for such types of infections are discussed.","2031":"The special procedures and techniques to develop poly-associated gnotobiotic animals in order to start large SPF colonies of small laboratory animals are discussed.","2032":"","2033":"Unfortunately, only successes tend to be published, so we are denied knowledge of partial successes and failures regarding SPF unit breakdowns. If more workers were prepared to be open about their partial successes, a combination of various techniques are appropriate to the case, could prove to be most successful. Each SPF colony is different and must be considered on its merits, nature of contamination, species and strains of animals and so on, but it would seem that caesarian derivation is not now always the only course of action.","2034":"Hepatomas were induced by feeding rats laboratory chow containing 0,6375 g of 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene per kg for 3 to 5 months. DAB-1 was a hepatoma induced in randomly bred Wistar rats and was transplanted for 3 years after which it failed to grow in vivo but not in vitro. DAB-2 and DAB-3 are new transplantable hepatoma lines established in highly inbred DBIX rats. DAB-3 has a metaplastic morphology showing, inter alia, goblet cells, cartilagenous areas, duct-like structures and glandular follicles. This is unlike DAB-1 and DAB-2 which showed poorly differentiated trabecular or anaplastic carcinomatous patterns.","2035":"Tuberculosis can cause great losses in captive colonies of various animal species. In South Africa the culprit is the human type of tubercle bacillus. Interspecific transmission of tuberculosis infection amongst laboratory animals, notably primates, is known to occur, and often handlers and caretakers act as the source of infection. The need for preventive measures in laboratory colonies and procedures for case finding and treatment of tuberculous animals are discussed. Indiscriminate destruction of diseased animals is opposed. The South African situation as revealed by questionnaire survey is described.","2036":"Blood was collected for blood chemical and haematological determinations from untreated surviving and non-surviving diarrhoeic baboons. The significance of changes in blood chemical and haematological values is discussed and the importance of supportive treatment is emphasized.","2037":"A semi-synthetic diet capable of sustaining good growth in young baboons and containing casein as the only protein source, is proposed. Growth rate data and problems encountered, such as soft stools and hair loss, are discussed. The main shortcomings of the diet are its lack of bulk (fibre) and the amount of time and effort which its preparation requires.","2038":"The menstrual cycle characteristics of 2 groups of adult female Chacma baboons were compared. Out of a group of 27 female baboons, 41% (11\/27) failed to cycle during the 6 month study period but were all under the stresses of fairly severe experimental manipulation. Data on the menstrual cycles of the remaining 16 unmanipulated females was collected and carefully analysed. These 16 females were individually caged and denied social contact with other baboons. Their menstrual cycles were then contrasted to those of a group of 8 individually caged females which received 24 minute mating tests with vasectomized males on alternate days during their cycles. The females denied the social contact of the mating tests showed significantly longer cycles as a result of significantly lengthened periods up to the time of perineal detumescence.","2039":"The 2 species are evaluated as far as adaptibility, economics, reproductive performance and behaviour are concerned. An important limitation is availability which makes conservation and breeding programmes imperative.","2040":"A breeding programme or rhesus macaques was established to produce animals with minimal disease and satisfactory behavioural patterns. Problems of design, management, health care and dietary requirements are described.","2041":"","2042":"Mortality curves of larvae of five common tick species dipped in dioxathion, chlorphenvinphos and oxionthiophos are presented. The mortality of three species of ticks were examined at various times of the day. The results showed that at 14h00 the larvae were more sensitive to acaricide treatments than at other times of the day.","2043":"","2044":"","2045":"","2046":"","2047":"Five dogs with achalasia were examined pre- and post-operatively. Photos were taken of the diseased oesophagus, cardia, cardia with retroversion and the cardia following surgery. The normal structures are also shown.","2048":"This report gives radiological and pathological evidence of bilateral ossification of the aponeurotic tendons of insertion of the pectineal muscles in a dog. This was associated with a severe grade 3 hip dysplasia of which the pathological changes are described. The ossification of the tendons is considered to have resulted from excessive and continous tension of the pectineus muscles. Various aetiological factors are discussed and some substantiation provided for the theory that pathology of the pectineal muscles and their tendons of insertion may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of hip dysplasia.","2049":"The history, clinical signs and pathological findings in a 9-year-old Labrador dog with an intracranial tumour, are described. The tumour conformed to the rare meningiothelial meningioma with focal ossification.","2050":"","2051":"Significantly higher mortalities were found in nicarbazine fed chickens than in amprolium fed chickens when exposed to the same heat stress conditions.","2052":"Ultrastructural morphology was monitored at intervals of time in corpora lutea of superovulated ewes following treatment with Prostaglandin F2-alpha. Lutein cells displayed an initial increased metabolic rate as marked by lipid accumulation, spherical mitochondria and a high respiratory rate. Three hours following injection, complete disorganisation of the cell was apparent; mitochondria are ruptured and a clear state of autolysis exists. The possible mode of luteolytic action of Prostaglandin F2-alpha in the ewe is discussed.","2053":"The paper mainly deals with racing pigeons. Beginning with organization, importance and cost of the pigeon sport it then details investigational procedures and techniques for drug administration before discussing some of the infectious diseases common in South Africa as well as the problem of poor racing performance.","2054":"Muscle irritation studies were done in rabbits using 9 different commercial products. Eight products had propylene glycol and 1 had polyvinylpyrrolidone as a vehicle. Macroscopical examination 3,6 and 10 days after intramuscular injection indicated that the irritation caused by the 8 products with propylene glycol as a vehicle were very similar. The product with polyvinylpyrrolidone caused much less damage and healing took place more quickly. Saline used as a control caused no tissue damage.","2055":"","2056":"Nitroxynil injected subcutaneously at 10 mg\/kg live mass achieved Class A efficacy when evaluated by the non parametric method against adult Fasciola gigantica. Haemonchus placei, Bonustomum phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum in cattle. The compound was not effective against adult Cooperia spp. at the same dosage.","2057":"A survey of 25 polony samples of different brands available to the consumer in Bloemfontein showed that significant numbers of various micro-organisms were present. Aerobic micro-organisms, psychrophiles, micrococci, pseudomonads, Microbacterium thermosphactum, lactobacilli, yeasts and moulds were enumerated by the plate count technique. The mean aerobic plate count was 15,850\/g and counts ranged between less than 100\/g and greater than 1 million\/g. Selective plate counts indicated that psychrophiles, pseudomonads and lactobacilli were the main groups present. During storage at 5 degrees C for 12 d, the mean pH of polony declined from 6,32 to 6,20 while the aerobic count increased 13 fold. Counts of all groups increased during storage at 5 degrees C especially M. thermosphactum, yeasts and moulds. No salmonellae were found and counts of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus were less than 3\/g. Storage of 5 polony samples at 1.1 degrees +\/- 1 degrees C until they spoilt after 8 wks resulted in the aerobic count increasing to greater than 10(8)\/g. Lactobacilli and psychrophiles increased most rapidly while pH decreased from 6,20 to 5,57. Organisms isolated most frequently from spoilt polony were yeasts, micrococci, lactic acid bacteria and corynebacteria. It is concluded that standards for microbiological quality of polony are unnecessary.","2058":"The advantages and disadvantages of the different diagnostic techniques e.g. pathological and microbiological studies, immunoglobulin and specific antibody determinations and fluorescent antibody studies in relation to these mortalities are discussed. The most important pathological lesions in the placentas and foetuses are described.","2059":"Studies on the host preferences of Culicoides imicola, the vector of bluetongue virus in South Africa, are reviewed. There is agreement that this species prefers to feed on cattle but will also feed on other bovidae and sheep. Over a seven year period cattle kept near sheep on a Natal farm appear to have appreciably reduced the incidence of bluetongue in the sheep. In addition to immunization this \"decoy\" approach is therefore recommended to assist in the protection of stock from insect borne diseases such as bluetongue and possibly African horsesickness and Rift Valley fever.","2060":"Baboons imported into Rhodesia from the Northern Transvaal proved to be heavily infected with intestinal protozoa and helminths. In fact, six protozoan species, one cestode and eight nematode species were recorded. A new concept in \"identification graphs\" is included in the paper which allows one to read off directly the species of strongyle eggs being passed by baboons in Southern Africa based upon length and breadth measurements of the eggs. Treatment of Balantidium coli and nematode infections of baboons is discussed as is the implication of some of these intestinal parasite infections in terms of potential human infection under natural conditions.","2061":"A technique for the transcervical recovery of ova in cattle is described. The donors recipient pool consisted of 122 cows of different ages and 4 different breeds. Of these 102 cows were superovulated. For recovery of ova an apparatus consisting of a metal catheter glued to the inside of a 3-way Foley catheter was used. The technique used for embryo transfer was basically the same as for collecting the embryos. The 102 donors yielded at slaughter a total of 956 corpora lutea i.e. an average of 9,4 per cow. Of the ova released 294 or 30% were recovered on transcervical flushing of the uterus. 40% of the inovulated cows conceived. The future development of inovulation in cattle is discussed on the basis of the results recorded and on those previously documented.","2062":"","2063":"","2064":"Four cases of severe parasitism due to Primasubulura otolicini in adult bush babies (Galago crassicaudatus) are described.","2065":"The paper deals with the increasing importance of aquaculture in South Africa and with the possible importance of disease problems following intensification and importation. It deals specifically with some infectious, parasitic and metabolic diseases found in South African eels. Attention is drawn to the role of fish as a public health hazard and to the need for increased attention to the provision of fish as food.","2066":"Three general biochemical mechanisms can cause ticks to be resistant to acaricides: an alteration in the properties of the site of action, a change in the rate of transportation and a change in the rate of metabolism. The first mechanism enables increased concentrations of acaricide at the site of action to be tolerated, while the last two mechanisms result in a decreased concentration and\/or persistence of the acaricide at the site of action. These mechanisms are discussed in detail with reference to a range or acaricides, particular emphasis being given to blue tick strains occurring in Southern Africa.","2067":"One hundred clinically negative Merino sheep were examined neurologically in an attempt to establish normal responses. Dependable results were obtained regarding eye muscle integrity, corneal sensitivity, the optic papilla and righting reflexes and to some extent the knee jerk reflex. The elicitation of other reflexes was inconsistent and unreliable except the placing reflex as shown by raising and lowering the forequarters.","2068":"The incidence, economic implications, aetiology and possible public health significance or porcine arthritis in South African slaughter pigs is discussed. An investigation into the aetiology and pathology of porcine arthritis as found at a South African abbattoir revealed that Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was present in 48% of the affected joints and Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. in 20%, 4% and 2% respectively. The joints showed various degress of subacute to chronic proliferative sero-fibrinous to fibrinopurulent arthritis regardless of whether bacteria were isolated. It is essential that the Lnn. axillares primae costae which drain the forelimb joints also be examined routinely during meat inspection.","2069":"The field manifestation of rabies in cattle is discussed. The observations cover the period 1974--1977 with emphasis on the geographical spread, vectors, symptoms and immunization of cattle with the Flury H.E.P. (high egg passage) rabies vaccine as prepared by the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute.","2070":"","2071":"An outbreak of mortality in cattle grazing kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) pastures on a farm in the western Transvaal is described. These pastures had been heavily infested with army worm (Spodoptera exempta) two weeks preceding the onset of deaths. The main symptoms were excessive salivation, paresis of the tongue and pharynx, localized fine muscular tremors, ruminal tympany and stasis and congested or cyanotic mucous membranes. Significant clinical pathological findings were leukocytosis, elevated blood sugar levels and lowered serum magnesium and sodium levels. Autopsy findings of interest were patchy or diffuse hyperaemia of the rumen and abomasum and small haemorrhages in especially the lymph nodes, heart and tracheal mucosa. The most important histopathological finding was superficial or deep necrosis of the ruminal epithelium with marked neutrophile infiltration. All forms of treatment, including intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate, were of no avail. The condition closely resembles so-called \"Kikuyu poisoning\" in New Zealand.","2072":"Wilted Tribulus terrestris plants were harvested from a camp in which geeldikkop had just previously broken out. The plants were treated in various ways in an attempt to preserve their toxicity. The only successful method of preservation found was rapid freezing of harvested material. Three kg of plants were kept frozen for six weeks and then dosed via rumen fistula to a sheep which subsequently developed characteristic symptoms and lesions of geeldikkop.","2073":"The clinical findings in six natural and two experimental cases of Kikuyu grass poisoning in Natal, South Africa, are described and compared with findings in cases of toxicity reported elsewhere. The toxic factor has not been identified but a mycotoxin is suspected.","2074":"Some aspects of the pathogenesis and comparative pathology of toxoplasmosis are described. The general pattern of infection, with or without necrosis, and tissue cyst formation as it occurs in all species is dealt with. The wide pathological manifestations of toxoplasmosis as seen in sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, cats, chinchillas and man are reviewed.","2075":"","2076":"The importance of diarrhoea in calves is briefly discussed. The role of viruses as primary invaders of the intestinal epithelium is stressed. The pathogenesis and problems encountered in diagnosing virus associated diarrhoea as well as the morphology of rota and coranavirus are discussed. Possible methods of prevention and treatment are briefly mentioned.","2077":"The clinical and pathological characteristics of a chondroma rodens affecting the internal occipital protruberance, cerebellar meninges and the cerebellum of a dog, are described. The principle clinical findings were Horner's syndrome and ataxia. The histopathologic differentiation of this tumour from other fibro-osseous growths, is discussed.","2078":"","2079":"","2080":"","2081":"Successful correction of anterior bowing of the foreleg and severe lateral carpal valgus following on premature closure of the ulnar growth plate in a month old Great Dane bitch is described. The procedure involved stapling the radius across the distal growth plate and section of the ulna.","2082":"The overriding economic importance of reproductive efficiency to successful pig production makes it necessary to collect and analyse performance records for the diagnosis and control of reproductive failure. Recently published production standards from the United Kingdom are related to the results obtained from 68 herds in the National Pig Health Scheme. It is concluded that more attention to the managerial aspects of weaning and rebreeding will do much to improve farrowing frequency.","2083":"","2084":"","2085":"","2086":"","2087":"","2088":"Refractory canine skin disorders from a large percentage of the cases referred to the Department of Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria. Included in these conditions are allergic skin diseases, primary pyoderma, generalised pustular demodicosis, endocrine alopecia, dermatomycosis, seborrhoea, acral pruritic nodule and nasal solar dermatitis. These conditions are discussed with emphasis on aetiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Thirteen colour plates illustrate the classical appearance of the dermatoses described.","2089":"Sources and serotypes of some salmonellae isolated from abattoirs, domestic animals, birds and man are given. At least 72 serotypes have been identified from 1273 isolations from abattoirs, animals and birds, and from 7 137 isolations from man. The sources and serotypes of these isolations are discussed and some suggestions concerning the epidemiology of Salmonella in Rhodesia are made.","2090":"","2091":"","2092":"The important economic and other implications associated with an incidence of between 3 and 30% of pueperal disease in cattle are strongly emphasized. To understand the problem the physiology of the puerperium is first reviewed. Possible pathology associated with the puerperium is discussed and the aetiological factors, symptomatology observed in the genital tract and the general symptoms are discussed. Possible ways by which puerperal disease may be prevented are briefly mentioned and possible treatments for various puerperal syndromes are subsequently suggested.","2093":"","2094":"","2095":"","2096":"Microbiological surveillance by swabbing meat wholesaler premises revealed ineffective cleaning and build-up of bacteria. Proper cleaning, sanitation and handling resulted in a vast improvement during 1975-77. Beef samples from the neck of carcases in the wholesale trade were investigated by microbiological methods. Excessive total bacterial counts were obtained from numerous carcases. Most carcases carried coliform organisms. Roughly 90% of carcases were contaminated with E. coli I; counts exceeded 10(3)\/g in 18% of carcases tested. Twenty serotypes of Salmonella were identified. Salmonella contamination decreased from nearly 5% in 1975 to less than 0,5% in 1977, and S. aureus contamination from 52% to 36% during the same period. Approximately 30% of carcases revealed contamination with unidentified clostridial species. The results indicate the need for stricter control over the production and slaughter of animals and over the handling of carcases in the wholesale trade.","2097":"","2098":"The paper emphasizes that fluids are generally given to cattle in insufficient quantities. Estimation of the state of hydration and calculation of requirements for replacement and maintenance for 24h is essential. Administration routes of choice are discussed. Acid-base balance, the relative importance of bicarbonate, K, Na, Ca, glucose and blood and precautions regarding typical South African conditions are discussed. Several examples of cases are presented, as are tables and formulae for calculation and replacement of fluid. The paper is essentially a practical guide for clinicians.","2099":"A congenital oesophagotracheal fistula in a two-year-old dog is reported. An account is given of the clinical symptoms, radiographic appearance, the supportive therapy, surgical correction and the post mortem findings.","2100":"An outbreak of ganskweek poisoning in a herd of 93 cattle on a farm in the Graaff-Reinet district of the Cape Province is described. Five animals died and at least 16 others were affected. Clinical signs included nervous symptoms (intractability, wildness, aggressiveness), icterus, melaena, abdominal pain and photosensitisation. The most prominent lesions present in the one animal autopsied were a severe hepatopathy and haemorrhagic tendencies.","2101":"The histopathological and ultrastructural findings in the central nervous system and lymphoid tissue of Abyssinian kittens suffering from a disease which was clinically characterised by neurological disturbances, are described. The lesions were vacuolisation of neurones and macrophages with light microscopy and lamellated membranous cytoplasmic bodies, initially in lysosomes with electron microscopy. Irregularly shaped membrane-bound bodies with an amorphous substance were eventually formed in the cytoplasm of affected cells. It is considered that this is a lysosomal storage disease.","2102":"The genetic, clinical and clinical pathological findings of a neurological syndrome in Abyssinian kittens are described. The findings are compared with similar cases in the literature and a tentative diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disease is proposed.","2103":"","2104":"Dendritic, migratory, lymphoid cells identical to the Langerhans cells of the epidermis, have been found in the epithelium of the bovine forestomach. They also possess the characteristic Langerhans cell granules. It can be assumed that these epithelial lymphocytes, (or Langerhans cells) as has been reported for the epidermal Langerhans cells, are antigen detectors and therefore form the first line of defence in the general immunological response of the body. The author suggests that the Langerhans cells of the forestomach be named epithelial lymphocytes. The existence of Langerhans cell granules has not yet been reported in the epithelial lymphocytes of the true stomach, intestines and respiratory epithelium.","2105":"Blood levels of oxytetracycline in dogs were determined by a spectrofluorometric method. Doses of 10, 50 and 100 mg\/kg body mass were administered as single doses per os. A single dose of 100 mg\/kg body mass gave adequate blood levels and the 10 mg dose was inadequate. When doses of 10 and 50 mg\/kg body mass respectively were repeated after 12 hours the higher dose gave adequate blood levels. Blood levels after dosing with 3 different commercial products containing oxytetracycline proved the non-equivalence of these products.","2106":"In order to evaluate clinically recognisable manifestations while undertaking examinations for fertility in cattle it is necessary to take cognizance of the physiological events taking place during the puerperium. The frequently incorrect diagnoses of cystic degeneration of the ovaries during this period can be avoided if the mechanisms controlling ovarian activity are properly understood. The close interaction between the ovaries, the hypothalamus, the hypophysis and adrenals as well as the luteolytic mechanism controlling ovarian activity is discussed. Attention is focussed on the effect of various pathogens on the endometrium, the influence of nutrition on the reproductive cycle and the consequent ovarian changes. The necessity to institute fertility examinations on a herd basis is stressed rather than attempts at treating the individual animal which, according to the owner, requires veterinary attention. By doing so a much more satisfactory service can be rendered. The existence of competent diagnostic centres, where the practitioner can obtain a metabolic or infection profile, is absolutely essential when fertility examinations on a herd basis are considered.","2107":"Over a period of 3 years some 314 widely distributed producers of fresh milk were made aware of their mastitis situation by regularly reporting the results of electronic determination of somatic cell counts in their bulked herd milk. These reports were preceded by information on the significance of high cell counts and followed by information relative to herd control of mastitis. The data are summarized in 2 figures and 1 table. Statistical analysis reflects a steady and significant improvement in the overall cell count picture over the duration of the programme. No differences could be established between counts on milk delivered in bulk and that delivered in cans. Regional differences existed. Of the herds in which the cell content was reduced to below 500 000\/ml, 65% reported an increase in production and a decrease in the incidence of clinical mastitis. In the herds where no decrease in cell content was effected, only 20% reported an increase in production and 30% a reduction of clinical mastitis. Whatever the case, the consumers of the milk benefitted in receiving aesthetically more acceptable milk.","2108":"The incidence of staphylococcal mastitis was investigated in 3 large commercial Friesland herds before and after the single intracisternal administration, during the dry-period, of 1 of 4 formulations containing staphylococcal antigens, antibiotics and base alone or in combination. Results suggest that the instillation of vaccine alone and vaccine plus antibiotics into fully involuted quarters very significantly reduced the incidence of staphylococcal mastitis in the subsequent lactation. Compared with antibiotics and base, each administered alone, the vaccine reduced the number of infected quarters in the subsequent lactation by 70,52% and 79,52% respectively, whereas the corresponding values for vaccine plus antibiotics were 62,22% and 71,22% respectively. The difference in results between vaccine alone and vaccine plus antibiotics is statistically insignificant, as is the difference between the results achieved by antiobiotics and base alone. The vaccine plus antibiotics is thought to possess combined therapeutic-preventive activity. The investigation showed, however, that vaccine plus antibiotics consistently protected mastitis negative quarters against new attacks of staphylococcal mastitis during the subsequent lactation period about 1,43, 4,00 and 5,32 times more effectively than did vaccine, antibiotics and base used individually.","2109":"","2110":"The general smear pattern in the oestrous doe was characterised by a copious flow of thin clear mucus which formed distinct fernlike crystallisation patterns. Following ovulation the cervical secretion became a thick white cheesy mass containing large numbers of cellular elements and debris. The luteal period, as well as anoestrus was marked by a scant serous secretion which formed no crystallisation patterns. Leukocytes occurred in varying quantities throughout the cycle. Desquamation of the vaginal epithelium reached a high level during late oestrus when large numbers of cornified cells occurred in the smear. It is concluded that the cytological changes in the vaginal epithelium of the Angora doe appeared to be influenced by cyclical ovarian activity and could be used to assess ovarian oestrogenic activity.","2111":"Various parameters in the life cycle of mammals were investigated to find a possible correlation between these parameters and the life-span. Twenty-two factors were calculated to determine the true life-span of any mammal. In addition a single formula, by means of which the life-span could be determined, was constructed. The life-spans of certain species, as calculated by means of the formula, are compared with authorative estimates.","2112":"","2113":"The effect of Trichostrongylus colubriformis on lambs maintained on a ration containing a low level of selenium and on animals receiving vitamin E and Se supplementation was investigated. The pathological changes seen in control animals slaughtered at the start of the experiment and in the animals which died during the course of the investigation revealed a high level of nutritional muscular dystrophy (NMD) in the lambs. There were no marked haematological changes in the control or infested sheep. Infestation was characterized by slight hypoalbuminaemia and gamma-globulinaemia. Serum levels of the enzymes AAT and CPK, which are important indicators of muscle necrosis and NMD, were greatly increased in sheep infested with T. colubriformis and not receiving supplementary Vit. E + Se. Data from this study therefore indicates that trichostrongylosis may aggravate the degree of muscle necrosis in lambs prone to the development of NMD.","2114":"A Friesland steer infested on four occasions at intervals of 4--6 weeks with 20 000 cercariae of Schistosoma mattheei developed progressive hepatic failure and died after 74 weeks. The condition was characterised by enlargement and induration of the liver with portal fibrosis, inflammation of the portal veins and \"piecemeal necrosis\", and was associated with a severe circulating eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinaemia. Similar cases were encountered in two natural outbreaks. The syndrome is considered to be of immunological origin, initiated by the reaction in the portal veins to antigen from schistosomes killed by the immune response of the host. It is usually seen in animals exposed to repeated heavy infestation but may occur occasionally after light infestation.","2115":"Delayed ovulation was recorded in 17,34% and anovulation in 17,66% of 623 oestrus periods in 32 Friesland cows. Cycle length was abnormal in 19,19% of 568 cycles and was associated with an increase in the incidence of defective ovulation. Inseminations failed in 24,6% of cases despite normal ovulatory function at oestrus while in nine out of 134 inseminations sperm retained its fertilizing capacity in the female tract between 24 and 72 hours.","2116":"Trials in a large scale commercial piggery indicated that use of a combination of hormones played a significant role in synchronising and expediting the onset of oestrus. The litter sizes in the treated group were significantly larger than in the controls.","2117":"","2118":"The literature on autotransplantation of the ovary is briefly reviewed with emphasis on the portal vein drainage area as the transplant site. An experiment is reported whereby bitches hearing such grafts were compared to entire and ovariectomised subjects with regard to endocrine status and behaviour. It is concluded that autotransplantation of the ovary to the portal vein drainage area may be a promising method of abolishing oestrus and yet avoiding the eunuchoid syndrome as is seen in ovariectomised subjects.","2119":"The clinical, clinical pathological and pathological findings in ten natural and two experimental cases of feline infectious peritonitis are described. The literature is reviewed and compared with the findings of these cases. It is concluded that feline infectious peritonitis occurs as a distinct clinical disease entity in domestic cats in the Republic of South Africa.","2120":"Sixty boerewors (\"Country-style\" sausage) samples bought from butchers in Pretoria were examined microscopically. It was found that 97% of these samples contained animal tissues that are not permitted in boerewors under the regulations of the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act (Act No. 54 of 1972). These regulations confine permitted tissues to fat and the musculature of cattle, sheep and pigs. Details of the tissues revealed in the survey are provided, and the implications of their presence are discussed.","2121":"The gastrointestinal fibrescope is introduced to the veterinary profession and its uses are emphasized. Various anatomical structures were examined in 251 domestic mammals and two birds. The findings for referred cases and routine examinations are listed. Twenty colour pictures taken with the fibrescope are reproduced.","2122":"A total of 100 animals were inoculated twice within 21 days with the Onderstepoort babesiosis vaccine. High blood group antibody titres were recorded, especially after the second inoculation. The possibility is discussed of neonatal isoerythrolysis occuring after vaccination as a result of maternal isoimmune blood group antibodies gaining access to the circulation of the offspring which inherited the corresponding blood group factors from its size.","2123":"Four experiments are described in which the efficacy of an experimental 5% injectable solution of rafoxanide was evaluated against various adult and immature helminths in cattle. Subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 3 mg\/kg live mass resulted in the following reductions in mean worm burdens: adult Fasciola hepatica, 82,6%; adult Fasciola gigantica, 99,8% immature Paramphistomum microbothrium, 10,1% adult Haemonchus placei, 99,6%, third stage H. placei, 73,7%; adult Bunostomum phlebotomum, 99,8%; adult Oesophagostomum radiatum, 99,9%; and fourth stage O. radiatum, 76,9%. At 5 mg\/kg live mass, rafoxanide solution was 97,5% and 99,2% effective against 8-week old F. gigantica and third stage H. placei respectively and at 7,5 mg\/kg, 92,4% against 6-week old F. gigantica.","2124":"A series of seven experiments designed to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of levamisole (1-tetramisole) by dermal application is described. This work involved use of 181 artificially infested calves. The drug was formulated at a concentration of 10% m\/v levamisole base in a solvent system promoting dermal absorption and was applied to both sides of the spine in the lumber region at a dose rate of 10 mg levamisole base per kg livemass. A consistent performance was achieved in these investigations, the results from all of which were based upon necropsy findings. Efficacy of treatment was assessed against the third and fourth larval stages and fifth stage larvae\/adult worms of six nematode species; the respective efficacies obtained were Haemonchus placei 72,0%; 99,3%; and 100%: Ostertagia ostertagi 85,5%; 38,1% and 74,5%: Cooperia spp. 98,9%; 99,9% and 100%: Bunostomum phlebotomum 83,0%; 100% and 98,5%: Oesophagostomum radiatum 47,4%; 94,9% and 99,6% and Dictyocaulus viviparus 79,5%; 94,1%; 90.9% (fifth stage larvae) and 93,8% (adult worms). The anthelmintic efficacy of levamisole in these experiments is of the same order as that achieved by orthodox methods of administration at dose rates between 7,5 and 10,0 mg levamisole HC1 per kg livemass. These findings add a new dimension to the use of levamisole and to anthelmintic therapy in general.","2125":"A series of in vitro and in vivo trials confirmed resistance by the three-host Bont tick, Amblyomma hebraeum (Koch), to Toxaphene in the Cape, Natal and Transvaal Provinces of the Republic of South Africa, and in Swaziland and Transkei. Resistance was present in 80 of 97 field strains examined. Lindane and DDT resistance was present in the one field strain tested. The results of comparative in vivo hand spraying and plunge dipping trials confirmed those of the larval in vitro tests, thus validating the usefulness of this latter technique for identifying changes of susceptibility in field tick strains to ixodicides. Selection of Toxaphene resistance in A. hebraeum occurred within a period of four years when a 14-day interval of treatment was used continuously. The presence of all three tick instars in all stages of engorgement at the time of each treatment under this regimen is thought to have enhanced this selection.","2126":"Twenty-eight Friesland calves were infested at 7 to 11 months of age with 5 000-45 OOO cercariae of Schistosoma mattheei. At 7 to 8 weeks post-infestation the majority developed an acute intestinal syndrome characterised by diarrhoea or dysentery, anorexia and loss of condition, from which they recovered spontansously. The severity and duration of illness was proportional to the level of infestation. Two heavily infested animals on a low plan of nutrition developed a subacute syndrome in which the initial acute disease was succeeded by prolonged unthriftiness, without diarrhoea, from which recovery occurred when the nutritional status was improved. Both acute and subacute forms of the syndrome were encountered in natural outbreaks.","2127":"","2128":"The results of parallel examination by two methods of 223 consignment samples of carcase meal were compared. Selective pre-enrichment of 5 g of sample prior to plating on to a solid media disclosed that 2,7% of consignments were contaminated with Salmonella. Non-selective pre-enrichment of 100 g followed by selective enrichment prior to plating food 21,5% of the consignment to contain Salmonella.","2129":"The immunising potency of an inactivated Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine prepared from RVF virus infected mouse brain and RVF infected cell culture was studied in cattle and sheep. Different doses and adjuvants were compared. In laboratory trials both cattle and sheep developed neutralising antibodies against virulent RVF virus and in cattle antibodies were still detectable 9 months after immunisation. Although the immunity produced was inadequate to prevent viraemia after challenge, evidence of protection against clinical RVF was obtained. Field trials in sheep showed that vaccination induced a good immunity in pregnant ewes.","2130":"This is a summary compiled on a regional basis from reports of officials of the Division of Veterinary Services in respect of sheep scab outbreaks occurring between 1967 and 1976. Possible sources of infection responsible for outbreaks occurring between 1940 and 1966 are discussed. Action to be taken where the disease is suspected, and control measures in terms of the Animal Diseases and Parasites Act (13\/1956) when the disease has been confirmed, are dealt with. Possible causes for the continuing spread of the disease and dipping problems are discussed. Recommendations for the future control and eradication of sheep scab in the Republic of South Africa are put forward.","2131":"Observations on the screening for resistance against acaricides in both larvae and adults of tick species commonly found on cattly in South Africa, have shown that widespread resistance of varying degrees occurs in strains of all these species against compounds of the arsenical, organochlorine and organophosphorous groups. With few exceptions the degree of resistance is of a low order and probably indicative of selection at the low acaricide concentrations generally used by stockowners. The distribution of less susceptible and resistant strains is patchy, and fully susceptible strains are found in the same areas.","2132":"","2133":"The isolation of Brucella abortus from free living wild africal buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, is described. The four isolates testes proved to be biotype I and it is speculated that the origin of brucellosis in wild animals is from domestic stock.","2134":"Listerial meningo-encephalitis (circling disease) is reported for the first time in ruminants in South Africa. An account is given of the clinical signs, pathology and bacteriological confirmation of the disease.","2135":"Tests currently in use of the diagnosis of brucellosis and the immune response in cattle following exposure to Brucella antigens are reviewed. The interpretation and evaluation of results obtained by different tests under conditions where S19 vaccine is used, are discussed. Attention is focussed on the possible role of the bull in disseminating Brucella organisms.","2136":"","2137":"A brief review is given of some of the more recent findings on lesions of diseases affecting the central nervous system of animals. These include local diseases caused by poisonous plants; Helichrysum argyrosphaerum, Solanum kwebense, Matricaria nigellaefolia; infectious diseases e.g. heartwater, cerebral babesiosis and cranial abscesses in goats caused by Corynebacterium pyogenes. Reference is also made to some conditions, originally described in overseas countries and which subsequently have been diagnosed in South Africa. Original findings on lesions seen in mycotoxicoses caused by Fusarium moniliforme and Aspergillus clavatus are included.","2138":"The aetiology and pathogenesis of respiratory syndromes in pigs are reviewed with emphasis on the role of environmental factors and diagnosis. Therapeutic and control measures are suggested and the cost of various regimens is dealt with in detail.","2139":"","2140":"","2141":"","2142":"A report of tetanus in a dog is presented. The symptoms were typical and the dog was successfully treated. The differential diagnoses and the therapy of tetanus are discussed with emphasis on the dose of antitoxin required.","2143":"","2144":"","2145":"The similarities between human and canine systemic lupus erythematosus are enumerated, using the incidence of symptoms reported for man as a guide to the possible incidence of clinical signs in the dog. Differences between the human and canine diseases are listed. Four clinical cases of the disease are reported. Diagnostic procedures were confined to the observation of clinical signs and serological and haematological methods.","2146":"On the single examination of 6804 quarter milk samples during a routine mastitis survey in 17 herds it was found that whereas 12,4% of quarters were diagnosed as subclinically mastitic when using the IDF standard set of diagnostic criteria, only 2,4% were positive when applying the additional criterium of a positive test for bovine serum albumin. The remaining 10% of quarters were then classified as being affected with septic inflammation of the ducts. The ratio of true subclinical septic mastitis to duct and test canal infections is recorded and the implications of the findings are briefly discussed.","2147":"A series of 152 quarters affected with subclinical staphylococcal and streptococcal mastitis was treated at random by intramammary infusion with one of 4 formulations containing inert solvent, specially prepared immunoglobulin (Ig) and antibiotics (penicillin G and streptomycin) in various combinations. The effect of treatment was measured by assessing the conversion of mastitic quarters to a normal or mastitis-negative state over a post-treatment period of 28 days. Considering the solvent as a placebo, solvent plus Ig had no significantly better effect than solvent only; solvent plus antibiotics gave results that were highly significant after 14 days even though about a third of the strains of S. aureus were resistant in vitro to one or both of the antibiotics; solvent plus antibiotics and Ig gave results that were highly significant during the whole 4 weeks after treatment. The Ig solution appeared to be considerably more effective against staphylococcal than streptococcal mastitis, but the small numbers precluded statistical analyses. It was concluded that use of the particular batch of Ig alone had no value in the treatment of the common forms of subclinical bacterial mastitis but that in combination with antibiotics the Ig had a somewhat better effect than was obtained with antibiotics alone.","2148":"Immunity plays a major role in the control of coccidiosis. With the presently practised system of \"protected exposure\" under chemoprophylactic medication, problems are encountered because of seasonal variation in litter moisture and coccidial challenge. The alternative, \"controlled exposure\" or \"vaccination\" products a more solid immunity and more reliable results. This was found to be the method of choice in coccidiosis control in replacement pullets in the semi-arid subtropical climate of Rhodesia.","2149":"A trial is described comparing the live mass gains and wool production of three groups of Merino sheep treated either at four-weekly intervals, strategically or not at all for the control of helminths and Oestrus ovis during a 19 month period. The group treated at four-weekly intervals had the greatest gain in masass was not greater than that of the group treated strategically. At both shearings the four-weekly treated group produced more wool than did the strategically treated group. The latter group produced more wool in total than did the untreated group. The seasonal incidence of nematodes, cestodes and Oestrus ovis on the trial farm was determined by the slaughter of tracer lambs at regular intervals.","2150":"","2151":"","2152":"Canine and bovine babesiosis are compared with particular reference to the occurrence of relapses and some immunological aspects of the diseases. Intact dogs resemble splenectomized cattle in respect of the relatively frequent occurrence of clinical relapses of babesiosis. The possible reasons for this are discussed. Attention is drawn to the fact that a sterile immunity of variable duration follows on auto sterilization of some Babesia infections and that antigenically difference strains of the parasite occur in the field.","2153":"Since 1974 green bacterial discolouration of Merino wool was frequently encountered in the Karoo and Eastern Cape areas. The occurrence of this condition coincided with the extraordinary wet conditions that prevailed during this period. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in almost pure culture from affected wool of 24 out of 25 different sheep. The role played by this particular organism was fonfirmed by the successful reproduction of this condition after exposure of unaffected sheep to cultures of Ps. aeruginosa isolated from green wool.","2154":"Parentrovite was administered to tsessebe as supportive therapy against artifically induced locomotory stress. An attempt was made to judge the efficacy of this treatment from enzyme levels such as that of LDH. Other parameters such as systemic blood pressure and the ECG were also recorded. No significant differences were established between treated and untreated animals although LDH levels were considerably higher in the untreated than in the treated group. The small numbers of tsessebe available and the artifical nature of the exercise induced made an evaluation of the effectiveness of Parentrovite in the treatment of locomotory or of capture stress uncertain.","2155":"Recent advances in the epidemiology and life cycle of toxoplasmosis are reviewed. Cats play a key role. Toxoplasma has a coccidian-type entero-epithelial cycle with oocyst prodlction in the feline host. An extra-intestinal cycle occurs in both feline and non-feline hosts. The worldwide distribution and the public health significance of toxoplasmosis as a zoonosis is discussed, with particular reference to available data regarding Southern Africa.","2156":"In South Africa 2,41% of horses bleed in a race. If all raced until they were 7 years old probably another 2,12% would bleed. Many others bleed after the race or during exercise or at rest. The incidence of epistaxis is significantly greater in geldings than in females and uncastrated males (P less than 0,001). There is an age distribution of bleeding which is highest at 4 years and lowest at 2 years of age (P less than 0,001).","2157":"The role of C. penicillata as a latent focus of rabies in South Africa is discussed. A description of the colony life, feeding and breeding habits and the relationship of the Yellow Mongoose to the Suricate Meerkat and Ground Squirrel is given. Observations on the epidemiology and symptomatology of rabies in the Yellow Mongoose are reported and various methods of control are suggested.","2158":"","2159":"Intravenous injection of Cowdria ruminantium infected blood produced no sings of disease in four impala, Aepyceros melampus; three blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus; a buffalo, Syncerus caffer; a kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros; a giraffe. Giraffa camelopardalis and a warthog, Phacochoerus aethiopicus. a control sheep injected with the same blood reacted severely and showed typical lesions of heartwater at autopsy.","2160":"","2161":"The incidence of penicillin in bulk milk supplies to the city has varied from 1,2% to 2,6% over the past five years, and 3,2% of 366 pasteurised milk samples examined in 1975 were found to contain penicillin. Investigation of the sources revealed numerous instances of producers, milkers and veterinarians who had not acted responsibly in regard to the marketing of milk from treated cows. Details are provided. The legal and professional obligations of the veterinarian are emphasized. Reference is made to the dye marking registered intramammary formulations for farmer treatment of mastitis.","2162":"The organisms responsible for clinical mastitis in dairly herds around Bulawayo were identified and their antibiotic sensitivity was determined. Streptococci, staphylococci and coliforms were responsible for 37%, 28% and 29,5% of cases respectively. Antibiotic resistance increased over the 3 year period. The high incidence of coliform mastitis is discussed, as is the effect of dry cow therapy on peri-natal mastitis and the nature of the scheme of control. The laboratory is considered an essential adjunct to other control methods.","2163":"Depending on the route of infection, experimental exposure of 30 sheep to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis resulted in either mucopurulent vaginitis, prosthitis, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, or in subcutaneous abscessation. Caseous lymphadenitis, from which the organism could be recovered in 52 out of 56 instances, occurred in every instance with the exception of animals infected by the preputial route.","2164":"Pulmonary hypertension was shown to occur in wild young zebra and wildebeest subject to forced exercise over 2 to 5 km distance. Measurements of pulmonary arterial pressure were made on a Devices recorder connected to a catheter passed via the jugular vein. Systemic pressure was recorded after puncture of the dorsal aorta. The electrocardiogram, PO2, PCO2 and pH were determined and enzyme levels such as CPK were estimated. Reduction of the pulmonary hypertension occurred after bicarbonate infusion.","2165":"Selenium levels in the liver of animals living in the Umfolozi Game Reserve in Natal and in the Sabi Sand Nature Reserve in the Eastern Transvaal were studied by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The distribution of the selenium content was followed for about 16 months and attempts have been made to explain seasonal fluctuations of the selenium level.","2166":"Cestodosis in battery-housed laying hens severely reduced egg production particularly at the time of peak production. Hens were able to consume large numbers of Musca domestica, the intermediate host of Choanotaenia infundibulum following the use of an aerosol insecticide to control flies. A considerable discharge of cestodes followed the use of \"Lintex\" in the feed resulting in a marked improvement in egg production. The use of an insect growth regulator in the feed showed promise in controlling the breeding of flies.","2167":"A detailed examination on a group of oxen naturally infested with Parafilaria bovicola suggested a prepatent period varying from 238 to 250 days. In these animals 54% of all lesions bled only once, 22% a second time and 24% more than twice. Of all active lesions 42% occurred in the shoulder region and decreased from this area both cranially and caudally. The same tendency was noticeable on carcasses after slaughter. During the observation period May 1974 to February 1975 the number of positive animals increased, reaching peak values during September - October 1974, after which a decline was noticed. The filaricidal effects of nine compounds were tested. These were suramin (used in combination with diethylcarbamazine citrate), thiacetarsamide sodium, fenchlorphos, phosmet, mebendazole, fenbendazole, levamisole hydrochloride and trichlorphon.","2168":"","2169":"","2170":"In a series of eight experiments attempts were made to change the levels of calcium in the blood of sheep by intravenous infusions of calcium, EDTA and thyrocalcitonin or changing the acid-base balance by various means. When total calcium levels changed these changes were mirrored closely by changes in the physiologically important ionized calcium fraction (r = 0.839). It is concluded that the total calcium determinations remain valuable indicators of changes in the physiological level of calcium in the blood.","2171":"","2172":"Two clearly defined types of E. coli infection are recognised and the factors predisposing and giving rise to pathogenicity are discussed. The mode of action of enterotoxins in the secretary mechanism is thought to be through stimulation of adenyl cyclase activity. Treatment and prevention of the disease is considered in relation to the pathogenesis of the infection.","2173":"The Milk Ring, Serum Agglutination, Biological, Mercaptoethanol and Rose Bengal Plate Tests were used in combination to diagnose brucellosis in cows in some herds supplying milk to Johannesburg. The work was done in conjunction with routine testing of bulk milk supplies for public health control. 4 769 cows in more than 76 herds were involved in the tests. Results confirm that no single test can demonstrate all infected cows in a herd and that repeated testing is necessary. In an infected herd in which Strain 19 adult vaccination has been used some negative and suspicious cows will have to be sacrificed in eradicating the disease.","2174":"","2175":"The geographical distribution of positive dourine cases found on serological testing at Onderstepoort during the period 1954 to 1975 is recorded, showing major foci of infection occurring in the northern Cape Province, northern Orange Free State, western and north-western Transvaal. Positive cases are also recorded from South West Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Rhodesia.","2176":"","2177":"","2178":"","2179":"","2180":"Five cases of bovine cerebral theileriosis are described. Macroscopically visible thrombosis of branches of the splenic vessels with associated infarction of the spleen are reported for the first time in this disease. The presence of Koch's bodies in thrombosed splenic vessels or vessels clogged with lymphocytes in the spleen is also a new finding. These changes were encountered in all five cases.","2181":"During an outbreak of diphtheria or ulcerative stomatitis in young Boergoat kids Fusobacterium necrophorum was consistently isolated under anaerobic cultural conditions from material taken from the edges of the ulcerative lesions from all of the cases examined. Corynebacterium pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Actinobacillus lignieresi, Moraxella spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were also isolated anaerobically and\/or aerobically. The typical symptoms and lesions were confirmed to the mouth, tongue and throat regions.","2182":"Parturition was induced in 17 Friesland heifers to decrease the possible occurrence of dystocia. The heifers were given 39 mg dexamethasone intra-muscularly on the 267th day of pregnancy and were observed for signs of impending parturition. The time of foetal membrane expulsion was noted. Parturition occurred on an average of 57 hours after corticosteroid administration. Three heifers required assistance during parturition. In one case a second injection of dexamethazone had to be given. The incidence of retained placenta was 68,8%. Rectal examination five to seven months after induction revealed that 76,5% of all animals were again pregnant. Of the four non-pregnant animals three had received assistance during parturition.","2183":"Pasteurisation of milk provides protection for the consumer against pathogens which may be present in the raw milk, and improves its keeping quality. Sterilisation provides indefinite keeping quality but has an undesirable effect on the flavour and nutritive value of the milk. Ultra high temperature (UHT) treatment produces a milk with prolonged shelf life at ambient temperatures yet has practically the same effect on colour, falvour and nutritive value as pasteurisation. UHT treatment of milk involves preheating to 80 degrees C and then quickly raising the temperature, either by indirect heating in a tubular heater or by direct steam injection, to 130 degrees-- to 150 degrees C at which temperature it is kept for 3 to 5 sec. Cooling follows immediately. Systems in operation in South Africa use steam injection for heating to sterilising temperatures. Evaporation cooling is obtained by subjecting milk to a partial vacuum. This removes any water added during heating by condensing steam and also removes steam-volatile off-flavours. UHT-treated milk is packed aseptically, usually into heat-sealed paperboard laminated cartons. Intact packages can be kept for up to three months. Absolute sterility cannot be obtained by UHT processing. The term \"sterilising effect\", introduced by Galesloot, means the log10 of the ratio of initial spore count to surviving spore count. A spoilage rate of not more than one litre package per 1000 is considered satisfactory. For laboratory control samples of the sterilized milk are incubated at temperatures favourable to germination of mesophilic and thermophilic spores respectively. After incubation the milk is examined for flavour and physical appearance, subjected to the standard plate count and tested for increase in acidity and decrease in stability towards the alcohol test. Milk for UHT treatment must possess protein stability in the alcohol test, be of good bacteriological quality, and a low spore count in particular.","2184":"The results of current investigations regarding the mechanisms of immunity to Salmonella infections and the use of vaccines are presented. Since chemical suppression of the humoral immune response in chickens does not jeopardise immunization with a live vaccine and immunized guinea-pigs exhibit distinct inhibition of macrophage migration, it is concluded that cellular immunity is a prominent factor in protection. Data is presented to show that the mice and calves can be equally well immunized with either live or inactivated S. typhimurium and S. dublin vaccines and the practical advantages of inactivated vaccines are discussed.","2185":"","2186":"A historical review of mineral imbalances recognised in Southern Africa is given. The survey procedures which were followed are described in terms of sample sources, as well as the analytical procedures with emphasis on the problems encountered at each stage of the developments. A concise summary is given of the mineral patterns known to date according to the ten regions currently recognised where specific patterns of mineral imbalances are known to occur.","2187":"The most common disease conditions encountered in domestic rabbits under intensive conditions in the Western Cape are discussed. Chlamydiosis is of paramount importance; it might be the limiting factor in the developing Rabbit Industry.","2188":"The introduction of U H T treatment of milk into South Africa raises problems for local public health authorities controlling milk hygiene in their respective areas because of the legislation concerning milk produced and sold for various purposes. It is essential that the raw milk supply be derived from healthy cows with healthy udders, and be produced under sanitary conditions. Uniform control standards are necessary for U.H.T. milk and other forms of milk supplying throughout the Republic. Uniformity is also desirable for efficient local authority veterinary health services. The progress of veterinary control and supervision of Johannesburg's milk supply is discussed to indicate what has been achieved. There is need for a national scheme for controlling mastitis. Tests for the purchase of milk on quality must include tests for udder health by regular electronic cell counting of raw milk sources. Appropriate mastitis control incentive or penalty schemes for milk producers should be instituted.","2189":"The nature, origin, influence and interrelationships of the steroid hormones are reviewed. Clinical application and the treatment of feline and canine patients with these substances is discussed, with special reference to particular conditions which occur in male and female animals. The therapeutic use of corticosteroids in small animal practice are considered, and some general observations are made concerning precautions and side effects.","2190":"A report of a myasthenia gravis-like syndrome, which occurred in two Fox Terrier litter mates, is presented. The clinical signs which appeared within 5 weeks of birth, and the subsequent course of the disease are described. Treatment with neostigmine and atropine initially provided control. Some recognised features of the condition in dogs are briefly reviewed.","2191":"Fatal cases of cordophilosis and gastro-intestinal verminosis in eland are reported. Some of these cases were complicated with heartwater or cytauxzoonosis. Cordophilosis resulted in acute cardiac arrest. Infestations with gastro-intestinal namatodes were responsible for extreme emaciation. Clinically affected eland responded dramatically to systemic treatment with levamisole hydrocholride.","2192":"The symptoms and post mortem findings of a case of diaphragmatic hiatus in a dog are described. At necropsy the caudate and right lateral lobes of the liver, the pyloric portion of the stomach, most of the small intestine and large intestines, the spleen, pancreas and omentum were found in the thoracic cavity.","2193":"","2194":"A report is presented of a fatal systemic Cryptococcus noeformans infection involving the central nervous system of a dog and complicated by a concurrent infection of the brain and splene by an unidentified filamentous fungus resembling a Paecilomyces spp. The literature on cryptococcosis in domestic animals is briefly reviewed.","2195":"","2196":"An intermandibular glandular area, never before described in any other ungulate has been found in the steenbok (Raphicerus campestris). It consists of enlarged sebaceous and apocrine sweat glands situated in the upper two-thirds of the dermis. They produce a dirty white almost flaky odoriferous substance which clings to the hairs of the area and is easily rubbed off for marking territorial areas as well as for marking females during mating. The infraorbital gland produces a black secretion which is the combined secretion of melanaceous, branched alveolar, sebaceous and enlarged apocrine sweat glands. The function of this secretion is not known as it is not used for any obvious marking purposes.","2197":"The morphology of the first, second and third stage larvae of Pneumostrongylus calcaratus is described. Greater numbers of larvae were present in experimentally than in naturally infested slugs. An attempt to transmit infestation to impala was unsuccessful.","2198":"Plastic collars impregnated with 9,4% Sendran effectively controlled adult Rhipicephalus sanguineus for a period of 49 days and immature ticks for a period possibly in excess of 70 days when fitted to four dogs. Four uncollared dogs served as controls. Although flea burdens were extremely low the collars were apparently effective for a period in excess of 70 days. A medicated collar killed all the ticks, fleas and lice on a severely parasited dog within a period of 48 hours.","2199":"","2200":"Gastric ulcers frequently complicate experimental surgery in the pig. This report concerns a super-infection of such an ulcer with fungi of the Mucor and Candida groups.","2201":"","2202":"","2203":"The authors describe the methods employed by the Artificial Insemination Section of the Division of Veterinary Services in collaboration with the Reproduction and Bacteriology Section of the Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort when herds are examined for infertility. A \"herd\" rather than an \"individual animal\" approach is advocated and certain infectious causes of infertility are discussed.","2204":"","2205":"","2206":"A study was made of the acid-base status of Babesia canis infected dogs judged unlikely to recover after specific babesicidal drug therapy despite the use of blood transfusion and other conventional supportive measures. Such cases were invariably acidotic and responded well and often dramatically to supportive intravenous sodium bicarbonate administration. Elevated blood urea nitrogen, also responded gratifyingly to this procedure. The rationale is discussed in some detail.","2207":"","2208":"","2209":"Using artificially infected sheep, the response of a laboratory strain of Haemonchus contortus, which had not been subjected to anthelmintics for three years, was compared with that exhibited by a parbendazole resistant field strain following treatment with each of seven anthelmintics, the laboratory strain proved fully susceptable to thiabendazole, parbendazole, cambendazole, mebendazole, fenbandazole, levamisole and haloxon, in contrast to the field strain which showed a moderate to marked resistance to all five benzimidazoles, but was fully susceptible to levamisole and haloxon.","2210":"Blood was collected from 28 zebra mare (Equus burchellia antiquorum) immediately after being shot in the Kruger National Park. The serum was separated within two hours after collection and then stored at -15 degrees C for later assay. Of these, thirteen selected samples were tested for gonadotrophic activity. The stage of pregnancy was determined from a foetal growth curve. Blood samples from pregnant horse mares were collected by venipuncture. Nine mares were sampled. Seven blood samples at different stages of pregnancy were collected from one mare, four from another and only one sample each from the other seven mares. The stage of pregnancy was calculated from the date of last service. The levels of gonadotrophic activity of the serum samples were estimated through its effect on the weight of mouse ovaries. Five groups of five virgin female white mice were injected subcutaneously with zero, 0,025 ml, 0,075 ml and 0,1 ml of serum per mouse on two successive days and killed by ether inhalation 48 hours after the last injection. The mean weight per overy was determined for each level of every sample injected and a dose: response curve drawn from which the percentage increase in ovarian weight caused by the 2 X 0,05 ml dosage level of each serum sample was estimated. The curves obtained by plotting gonadotrophic activity at various stages of pregnancy for horse and zebra mares are generally similar but differ in certain details. PMS obtained from horses has a greater activity and appears to be secreted over a shorter period of time i.e. it disappeared by the 160th to 180th day of pregnancy. In zebra mares, on the other hand, a relatively lower activity was found during the peak period (65th to 80th days) but it was maintained loger and was still detectable at 229 days but absent at 365 days after conception.","2211":"Twenty-three gemsbok in the Namib Desert were captured with combinations of fentanyl or etorphine hydrochloride, hyoscine hydrobromide and tranquilizers such as azaperone, SU - 9064, triflupromazine hydrochloride and acetylpromazine maleate. Fentanyl, a New immobilizing compound, proved to be a safe and effective immobilizing drug for capturing gemsbok. The gemsbok were chased on the interdune plains and darted from a Land Rover with the Palmer powder-charge Cap-Chur gun. A six-seater helicopter was used on a trial basis to dart a gemsbok, but it is suggested that a smaller, more manoeuvrable helicopter be used for further operations. All the gemsbok were transported under narcosis from the capture area to an enclosure. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride was injected into the captured gemsbok to sedate them in their new confined environment. Tranquillizers such as chlorpromazine hydrochloride, acetylpromazine maleate and a new tranquillizer SU - 9064 were used to sedate the animals during long distance transportation in crates. This prevented the animals from injuring themselves and damagin the crates. For the first time in South West Africa wild animals were transported by air. A journey by road which under normal circumstances would have taken over 40 hours, was completed in less than 9 hours by utilizing aerial transportation. There were no losses during transportation and only two gemsbok were injured during the translocation operation.","2212":"Sixteen Merino sheep were subjected to forced exercise after which half were treated with sodium bicarbonate, vitamin B complex, antibiotics and a glucocorticoid. Cardiac rate, rectal temperature and blood were taken from all the animals before, immediately after and again two and five hours after exercise. Exercise resulted in increased cardiac cardiac rate, rectal temperature, plasma levels of glucose, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, potassium, and decreased levels of blood pH, buffer base, bicarbonate, base excess and CO2. Compared with the controls, the therapy increased plasma glucose and blood pH, buffer base, bicarbonate and base excess, while there was a significant decrease in plasma potassium. This latter effect may be important in the therapy of capture myopathy in wild animals as hyperkalaemia may be one of the causes of death in the syndrome.","2213":"Vaccination with Rev 1 at four months of age protected rams against experimental infection with Brucella ovis. A double vaccination did not improve immunity whereas rams vaccinated later in life showed a decreased immunity to the infection. Lesions and complement fixation reactions were found to be inadequate criteria for the diagnosis of the disease in the individual ram.","2214":"An investigation was made into some lesser known aspects of the biology of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans, in order to find a basis for possible means of natural control of the pest on dairy farms. The reaction of adults to different kinds of blood was tested. Diets investigated were bovine blood alternated with ovine blood, bovine blood alternated with pig's blood, bovine blood alternated with manure filtrate, bovine blood alone, ovine blood alone, pig's blood alone and manure filtrate alone. Adults could not servive on manure filtrate alone. Flies in the other treatments exhibited no marked differences as regards duration of pre-mating-, pre-oviposition- and oviposition periods. There were, however, differences in the number of eggs laid. Females maintained on bovine blood alone produced most eggs i.e. 2,3 times as many as those laid by females fed on pig's blood alone. The latter were the poorest producers. Viability and incubation period of eggs did not appear to be affected by the kind of blood fed to the adults. Flies, however, lived longer when supplied with bovine blood and died sooner when maintained on pig's blood.","2215":"A survey was made in the Republic of South Africa and Swaziland to determine the incidence of arsenic resistance in multi-host ixodid ticks. Arsenic resistant strains were found in the following species:- Rihipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus evertsi, Rhipicephalus capensis, Amblyomma hebraeum and a species of Hyalomma, tentatively identified as Hyalomma rufipes. Strains of Haemaphysalis Leachi, Haemaphysalis silacea and Ixodes pilosus were also tested.","2216":"Laboratory tests on larvae of nine strains of the sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, and one of the hairy blowfly, Chrysomia albiceps, taken from the field are reported. Results indicate resistance to arsenic in one strain and to diazinon in the remainder and in Chrysomia albiceps. Field evidence corroborates the presence of resistance in the blowfly maggots to current flystrike insecticides with reduced protection resulting in more frequent treatment.","2217":"Armillifer armillatus, Linguatula serrata and L. nuttalli have each been isolated from nine different mammalian species in the Kruger National Park: lion, Panthera Leo; Leopard, P. pardus; buffalo, Syncerus caffer: blue wildebeest, Connechaetes taurinus; giraffe, Girraffa camelopardalis; kudu, Tragelophus strepsiceros; waterbuck, Kobus ellipsyprymnus; tsessebe, Damaliscus iunatus and impala, Aepyceros melampus. Successful transmission of L. serrata from the lion to a domestic ox and impala is recorded for the first time. Pentastomiasis is also a disease of man and these findings are possibly of epidemiological significance.","2218":"Six 14 month old rams were divided equally into three groups and received either a high Ca (1,102% Ca : 0,192% P : 0,128% Mg), control (0,322% Ca : 0,311=P : 0,128% Mg) or high P (0,127% Ca : 1,043% P: 0,130% Mg) diet in pellected form for 150 days. 2. Dry mass and ash % of the third cervical vertebra decreased as Ca intake decreased while fat % increased. There was a highly significant negative correlation (= -0,992) between bone ash% and bone fat %. Bone P and Mg showed no particular trends. 3. Total body Ca and P as well as % body Ca and P all decreased with a decrease in dietary Ca and increase in dietary P intake. Body Mg showed no particular trend. 4. The results suggest that while plasma values may be useful in assessing the P intake of sheep on natural pastures, bone and total body P may not be.","2219":"While the horizons for cryobiology may be bright and granted, tremendous strides have been made in the area of artifical insemination(AI), it is evident that only dairy cattle AI with frozen semen has achieved industrial application. Beef cattle AI has been hampered by the lack of suitable techniques for oestrous control. However, with the advent of prostaglandin F2alpha, it may now be possible to make the genetic progress which has been accomplished through AI in dairy cattle. Genetic progress through AI is possible in all far species but the overriding influence has to be economic...","2220":"","2221":"The anthelmintic efficacy of morantel tartrate at 5mg\/kg bodymass was investigated in three separate controlled trials comprising 68 calves. High anthelmintic activity was established against adult Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia ostertagi, Cooperia spp. (C.pertinata and C. punctata), Bunostomum phlebotomum and Oesophagostomum radiatum.","2222":"","2223":"The anthelmintic efficacy of cambendazole dosed orally at 20 mg\/kg live mass was determined against naturally acquired cestode infestations in lambs. The anthelmintic was completely effective against both Moniezia spp. and Avitellina centripunctata. Difficulties in ascertaining the presence of infestations with the latter species in the living animal are discussed.","2224":"The effects of locality on the copper, iron, manganese, zinc and magnesium levels in 407 bovine caudate lobe liver samples preserved in formalin for differing storage periods were examined. The mineral determinations, expressed on the wet basis (WB), were made by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after wet ashing of the liver. Two hundred and ten of the liver samples were from cattle from one farm (Farm 1) the remaining 197 cattle being from another farm (Farm 2). The copper, iron and magnesium levels were taken as indicative of the hepatic concentrations at slaughter. Locality had a significant effect (P less than 0,05) on the copper, iron and magnesium levels. All copper levels on Farm 1 fell well below the accepted minimum (33,0 mg\/kg). The deficiency appeared to be secondary with the possible implication of sewage effluent. In terms of biological variation the different iron levels appeared of minor importance and no inverse relationship was found between iron and copper. The manganese and zinc levels were interpreted with caution due to the significant differences reported in their hepatic concentrations after six months of storage in formalin. Extremely high zinc levels in individual animals could have been associated with sewage effluent.","2225":"In Africa trichinosis is essentially a disease of wild carnivores. Once established in a suilline cycle it becomes a more important threat to man. The results of tests on 8,000 specimens of 20 wildlife species in the Kruger National Park are discussed and the epizootiology of trichinosis in South Africa is briefly reviewed. The first case of trichinosis in an African civet, Viverra civetta Schreber, 1776, is reported. The confirmed absence of trichinosis in true herbivores is of practical significance in view of the increasing utilization of game meat as food.","2226":"The clinical findings and the macroscopic and microscopic lesions in a kitten which died during an outbreak of ulcerative glossitis in a cattery are described. A brief review of the literature is given to support the theory that the virus of feline panleukopenia may well be the aetiological agent in this outbreak.","2227":"A case of valvular aortic stenosis in a dog is described. The presenting sign was syncope during exercise. An unusual feature was right bundle branch block electrocardiographic pattern. During syncope electrocardiograms usually indicated atrial standstill and always had sever ST segment changes indicative of myocardial ischaemia. Pathological findings included chronic valcular changes which did not appear to be the result of a infectious inflammatory condition.","2228":"Dystocia in a free-living impala (Aepyceros melampus) in Kruger National Park (KNP) is described. An exaggerated unilateral foot-nape posture is held responsible for a complete obstacle to parturition.","2229":"Echinococcosis has been diagnosed in the following wild species in the Kruger National Park : lion, Panthera leo, spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, Cape hunting dog, Lycaon pictus, Burchell's zebra, Equus burchelli antiquorum, buffalo, Syncerus caffer, hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius, and impala, Aepyceros melampus. Infestation rates in the herbivores vary from 60% in zebra to less than 1% in impala. Species like elephant, Loxodonta africana, and blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, do not seem to be susceptible. The successful artificial transmission of Echinococus granulosus felidis from Burchell's zebra to the lion is reported for the first time.","2230":"Two laboratory tests on beef carcase fat, two on serum and one on urine from suspect icteric carcases were compared. Used singly on serum, the indirect van den Bergh and Fouchet tests were found to be most useful, and either of these two used together with the indirect van den Bergh test on fat gave results which agreed most closely with a subjective assessment of the marketability of suspect jaundice carcases after 24 hours' chilling.","2231":null,"2232":"Oesophagostomum radiatum and Oesophagostomum columbianum became established in low numbers when 2 calves and 2 sheep respectively were exposed percutaneously to pure cultures of infective larvae of these worms. A further sheep infested in the conjunctival sac became heavily infested but this may have occurred via the lachrimal duct. As far as can be ascertained this is the first time that development of O. columbianum has been demonstrated after percutaneous exposure.","2233":"Anthelmintic efficacy studies involving 49 cattle either naturally or artificially infested with Fasciola hepatica are described. Some of the animals were also artificially infested with Haemonchus placei and Bunostomum phlebotomum. At dosage rates of 3,75 and 5,0 mg\/kg live mass rafoxanide was 64,6 and 92,6 per cent effective respectively against adult naturally acquired infestations of F. hepatica. At 7,5 and 10,0 mg\/kg it was 37,9 and 55,7 per cent effective against 42 day old liver fluke. At 7,5 mg\/kg it was 100, 87,4 and 94,6 per cent effective against mature F. hepatica, fourth stage H. placei and adult B. phlebotomum respectively.","2234":"Procaine caused respiratory arrest in halothane-anaesthetized normal Landrace pigs at a dose of 4,2 - 8,2 mg\/kg. In some cases death due to respiratory failure occurred after giving 10 - 13 mg\/kg. Because of its toxicity in pigs procaine is unsuitable for treating the porcine malignant hyperthermia syndrome.","2235":"The rates of elimination of iodinated human serum albumin (ALBUMIN-125I), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-125I); and tritiated dextran (DEXTRAN - METHOXY-3H) (mol masses of 69 000 - 72 000, 30 000 - 40 000 and 60 000 - 90 000 respectively) from the circulation of sheep were studied; albumin and PVP initially disappeared from the circulation rapidly having half-life times (t 1\/2) of 10,5 +\/- 3,7 and 43 +\/- 45 hours respectively. This phase is regarded as being due to equilibration within the initial volume of distribution, the rate being determined primarily by the relative mol. mass of the molecule. Hereafter PVP-125I was eliminated considerably faster (t 1\/2 = 176 +\/- 39 h) principally via the kidneys. The limited data available for dextran-3 H suggests that this particular substance is rapidly excreted via the kidneys (t 1\/2 = 9 h).","2236":"Evidence of the presence of porcine parvovirus in Southern Africa is given and the diagnostic significance of this finding is discussed. Minor abnormalities in the replication of the virus were observed.","2237":"Blood was collected from 14 baboons 3 - 5 min, 30 min and 60 min after the intramuscular injection of phencyclidine at a dosage rate of 1,5 mg\/kg body mass. The determination of blood chemistry and haematology was then undertaken. An abrupt decrease in total plasma protein occurred after the injection of phencyclidine but thereafter it remained at approximately the same level. The sodium, potassium, chloride and cholesterol remained practically unaltered throughout. A significant decrease occurred in the blood urea level. The blood sugar value showed a highly significant decrease over the first 30 min period and less over the second 30 min period. Plasma enzyme activity and corticosteroid levels did not show marked alterations. Marked and significantly lowered values occurred in white blood cell count, erythrocyte count, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit level but these values returned to within normal limits at 60 min.","2238":"Using aqueous urea solution extracts of heated ostrich muscle as antigen for the production of precipitating rabbit antiostrich sera, it was possible to specifically identify raw, heated (70-95 degrees C) and air dried-salted ostrich meat by means of gel immunodiffusion tests. The sera did not react with chicken, turkey or horse meat or with beef in any form. The soluble proteins extracted from ostrich meat heated to temperatures of 70 degrees C for 30 minutes appear to constitute at least two closely related antigenic determinants of which only one is thermostable at temperatures above 70 degrees C).","2239":"The most important characteristics and the distribution of the viruses of African swine fever and hog cholera are reviewed. Both viruses were probably present simultaneously in South Africa in the first two decades of the century. While hog cholera was eradicated by 1918, African swine fever persists to the present day because it has a different epizootiology. The role played by wild pigs and the argasid tick (Ornithodoros moubata porcinus) in the epizootiology of African swine fever is discussed and an account of the outbreaks of the disease in South Africa from 1926 to 1974 is given. It appears that the disease in the Transvaal has had a cyclic occurrence.","2240":"The transmission of bubonic plague from the kitten of a domestic cat to a man by means of a bite on a finger is described. The human case was complicated by the development of a secondary meningitis, followed, after specific therapy, by protracted recovery. The kitten showed swollen lymph nodes of the head and neck, frothing at the mouth and nostrils, and signs of an acute infectious disease which had a fatal termination. Yersinia pestis was isolated on about the 8th day from the cerebrospinal fluid of the man. The foster mother of the kitten exhibited signs of spinal and cerebral meningitis but recovered following treatment; her serum contained plague antibody levels of 1:512 and 1:1024 on the 22nd and 34th days respectively after the first evidence of illness. Three litter mates of the kitten also died. The outbreak occurred on a farm in the Graaff-Reinet district of the eastern Cape Province, which is situated about 160 km from the nearest known natural plague focus.","2241":"Serum creatine phosphokinase activity was determined in German Landrace and Landrace x Large White pigs from 11 weeks to 28 weeks of age. A very pronounced age dependence of enzyme activity was observed in both groups, peak activities occurring at 19 weeks of age for the German Landrace and at 15 weeks for the crosses. The large increase in serum creatine phosphokinase activity observed occurred during the rapid phase of growth after which enzyme levels returned close to initial values. Sedatives and the stress of handling while obtaining blood can also cause raised serum creatine phosphokinase levels and complicate the interpretation of the data in regard to the detection of the stress syndrome. Enzyme activity also displayed a diurnal variation thus introducing a further parameter in the use of creatine phosphokinase activity for detection of the stress syndrome. Certain limitations in the method of measurement of creatine phosphokinase are discussed.","2242":"","2243":"","2244":null,"2245":"Blood chemical and haematological determinations were carried out on 64 baboons. The blood chemical and haematological values determined were found to be in general agreement with the values for man and other primate species. Some blood constituents however, did show noteworthy differences. Marked sex differences were demonstrated in some blood chemical and haematological parameters.","2246":"The migration of domesticated animals in Africa is of particular interest to the anthropologist and ethnologist in that it may provide valuable information concerning the migration of human tribes that accompanied these animals. Haemoglobin C is only found to be present in indigenous breeds of African cattle and can therefore be used as one of the best genetic markers of these animals. Haemoglobin B has been established in many breeds in Africa and India. It seems that the further away the animals migrated from India, the lower is the frequency of HbB. Breed comparisons from numerous breeds in Africa are made, including the results of the present investigations on breeds of different countries in Southern Africa.","2247":"Chlamydial infection in a large beef herd is illustrated and discussed. The pre-natal and post-natal losses that occurred during 1972 are highlighted. Total pre-natal losses for the nine calving herds comprising 2,915 animals varied between 3,7% and 12,4%. Between 1,2% and 11,4% of the calves born alive in the nine herds died before weaning with 70% of the losses occurring within the first three weeks of life. Chlamydial organisms were demonstrated in pre-natal and post-natal losses from all nine herds. Clinical manifestations and lesions involving the intestinal, respiratory, nervous, skeletal, reticulo-endothelial and urinary systems were observed in chlamydia-infected calves. Invariably at autopsy in chlamydia positive cases there was some degree of a fibrinous inflammatory process present. Serological evidence showed that chlamydial organisms had been present on both farms prior to the 1972 investigations.","2248":"Chronic fluoride poisoning in sheep and cattle was diagnosed on a farm in the Vredenburg district, Cape Province, and confirmed by laboratory analysis. The source of the poisoning was pastures contaminated with rock phosphate dust containing 2,1 to 3,3% of fluoride emitted from a fertilizer factory. Tabulated analyses of blood, liver, bone, pasture and water are given.","2249":"A simple method for the in vitro study of drug diffusion across ruminal epithelium is described. The characteristics of the isolated membrane were defined by studies of ketone production from butyrate, histological studies, phenolsulphonthalein penetration and permeability to pentobarbital, antipyrine and tetraethylammonium. The preparation was found to be suitable for studies of less than 12 hours duration; after that time the integrity of the membrane as a barrier was lost due to degenerative changes. The method had a primary advantage in that experimental variables could be rigorously controlled.","2250":"A procedure for cannulating the bile duct of the dog is described. An intramuscular injection of Genebile increased the bile flow rate. A possible mechanism for this increase is suggested.","2251":"Lions in the Kruger Park have been found affected by a variety of parasitic and other disease conditions, including trichinosis, filariasis, sarcoptic mange, pentastomiasis, echinococcosis, taeniasis, hepatozoonosis, anthrax, babesiosis and rickets. Six of these may be directly or indirectly transmissible to man or are, at least, closely related to human parasites or disease. Nine of these diseases, or closely related conditions, are also known to infect domestic animal species. The opposite may, of course, also be true--man and his domestic animals may, under certain circumstances, transmit certain diseases to lions, presumably sometimes with fatal results.","2252":"The migration of strongyle larvae is the most common or basic underlying cause of colic in the horse. Disease conditions producing symptoms of colic occur in all sections of the intestinal tract and consist of impactions, torsions, herniations and foreign bodies. Colic also occurs as a result of pre- and post-partum diseases such as torsion of the uterus, haemorrhage, rupture and inversion of the uterus. In general, lesions resulting in circulatory obstruction are the types requiring surgical intervention. There are six general types of small intestine obstruction that lend themselves to surgical treatment; namely, volvulus, herniations, intussusceptions, stenosis of the lumen of the bowel by external bands or by foreign bodies and chronic inflammatory lesions. The large intestine is not subject to the variety of obstructive lesions found in the small intestine. Impactions count for a large percentage of the obstructions seen. A standing laparotomy for diagnostic purposes may be indicated. Small colon impactions are readily treated by standing laparotomy. Enteroliths are of very common occurrence in some areas of the country; they often result in rupture of the colon. Torsions of the colon produce septic shock very rapidly. The left dorsal colon moving medially or laterally and ventrally initiates the torsion. Clockwise rotation is most common. Massive intravenous therapy is needed to maintain hydration. Ventral midline laparotomy gives best access. Surgery must be performed very early to avoid massive tissue necrosis. Survival rate is 30 percent or less. The small colon is also capable of rotation and volvulus, and of strangulation in the umbilical or inguinal ring.","2253":"","2254":"","2255":"The migratory route of infective Strongylus vulgaris larvae was determined: penetration of small and large intestine into the lumina of submucosal arteries, migration up the arterial tree, reaching the cranial mesenteric site by three weeks, where the larvae develop to the mature 4th stage. After 3-4 months they exsheath and the young adults migrate down the arteries towards the intestines, to the limit of arterial narrowing, from where they rupture from nodules into the lumen of the intestine. The prepatent period is about 6 months. The clinical syndrome was similar to, but less severe than that recorded in the literature. The most significant haematological changes were an early, sharp rise in WBC, increased neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, and eosinophilia. Marked, progressive increase of total serum proteins as result of betaglobulins occurred. The rate of albumin catabolism was higher in infected horses and red cell survival was reduced. In field studies, it was shown that foals turned out to grass in spring can be infected both by overwintering larvae and by their untreated dams, the latter being by far the more important source of infection.","2256":"","2257":"Contrary to common belief, Gastrodiscus aegyptiacus can be pathogenic to horses. History of cases of a particular stud, necropsy findings, diagnosis, and successful treatment with hexachlorophene and with dichlorvos are recorded. The presence of eggs can be established by a special flotation technique.","2258":"Pertinent questions regarding the history of a horse with diarrhoea are listed, as are diagnostic procedures that might be included in a complete clinical work-up. For purposes of discussion, diarrhoea is regarded as \"acute\" or \"chronic\" wherein the former concerns cases where the features of the disease are severe with progressive electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, toxaemia, or other life-threatening manifestations and the latter refers to cases that have been prolonged for a month or more. Patterns of disease, including results of diagnostic techniques, are stressed. In the \"acute\" category, salmonellosis, haemorrhagic and oedematous colon (Colitis X), acute peritonitis, and Corynebacterium equi infection are discussed in some detail. In the \"chronic\" group, strongyle larval migrans, granulomatous enteritis, chronic liver disease, Corynebacterium equi infection and chronic salmonellosis are emphasized.","2259":"","2260":"Intestinal surgery in the foal is seldom necessary but some conditions in which it is essential are well recognized. The foal is a good surgical subject but success depends mainly on operating promptly before irreversible degenerative changes take place. Exploratory laparatomy is recommended whenever mechanical obstruction is suspected. Indications fall broadly into two main categories: 1. Cases arising from congenital defects. These form a miscellaneous group and present considerable difficulties in diagnosis and effective treatment. 2. Cases related to acute onset of obstruction, mainly due to volvulus or torsion. By far the most important condition in this category is volvulus of the ileum close to the ileocaecal valve. Aetiological factors are discussed, and the value of resection of affected small intestine and creation of a new jejuno-caecal opening is indicated. It is suggested that with improvement of such techniques it will be possible to save a higher proportion of foals suffering from mechanical intestinal obstruction.","2261":"","2262":"The revised NRC's Nutrient Requirements of Horses is changing the outlook on equine nutrition, dominated for so long by the traditional belief in oats. This has lead to the need for properly balanced diets, in the compounding of which dietary cubes offer the distinct advantage of providing a standardized diet of constant quality in keeping with modern knowledge. Additional factors are: longer storage, freedom from dust, palatability, refractoriness to mould infection, and facilitation of routine feeding. Cube size and hardness are important considerations for the manufacturer. Horses appear to favour smaller-sized cubes, but on the whole preferences for size and hardness appear to be equivocal. The nutritional status of four commercial brands of horse feed marketed in South Africa has been analyzed and compared to commonly used raw feedstuffs. The results of feeding cubes have been assessed by means of a questionnaire. There appears to be a need for more knowledge concerning equine nutrition on the part of trainers, as well as for more specialized advisory services. The establishment of training centres has been suggested.","2263":"","2264":"","2265":"Adequate post-operative management of equine abdominal patients is as necessary to patient survival as the most heroic corrective surgery. Post-operative management must begin during the anaesthesia recovery phase to insure adequate oxygen supply, ventilation, and minimize any abdominal discomfort. The animal's physiological status must be constantly monitored to detect and determine the degree of abnormalities concerning serum electrolytes, fluid balance, and acid-base abnormalities. The most commonly observed serum electrolyte imbalance is hypokalaemia. Replacement potassium is usually supplied intravenously. If the dificit is slight, oral replacement may be possible. Fluid balance is usually maintained via intravenous fluid therapy as determined by monitoring PCV and plasma protein. Metabolic acidosis is treated with 5 percent sodium bicarbonate administered intravenously. Broad spectrum antibiotics are usually given intravenously but may be administered intra-peritoneally. To facilitate the intravenous therapy, an indwelling silastic catheter is often employed to minimize jugular thrombosis.","2266":"Emergency equine abdominal surgery is easiest and most efficiently carried out with a team of surgeons. The surgical site should be as protected as possible by the use of sterile drapes and wound protectors. A ventral midline laparotomy incision has been found to be the most convenient approach to most equine intestinal obstructions. A standing laparotomy through the left paralumbar fossa gives adequate exposure for exploration of the abdomen and is, therefore, useful as a diagnostic tool. Horses tolerate having both ventral midline and left paralumbar laparotomy incisions well. If the cause of the intestinal obstruction is not readily apparent upon opening the abdominal cavity, a thorough systematic exploration of the abdominal cavity is necessary. If the problem cannot be found with the bowel in situ, intestine must be exteriorized for examination. The decision as to the extent of adequate bowel resection often depends on a subjective assessment of bowel function. In equivocal cases, the surgeon should choose to resect some normal bowel rather than taking a chance on leaving compromised bowel in place. Incarcerations are frequent causes of small intestinal obstructions. The small intestine may become incarcerated in the epiploic foramen, the inguinal canal or in an umbilical hernia. Thromboembolic compromise to intestinal vessels results in the longest lengths of embarrassed bowel requiring resection. Impactions are the most common obstructions associated with the caecum. Large colon torsions of 270 degrees or less may be corrected by surgical manipulation; with 360 degrees torsions of the large colon, however, vascular compromise is usually sufficient to devitalize this organ. Enterotomy of the large colon allows retrieval of most enteroliths from its lumen. Enterotomy of the right dorsal colon is also useful for removal of foreign bodies which cause obstruction of the most proximal portion of the small colon. In our Clinic a two-layer end to end anastomosis is usually utilized. Recently introduced automated stapling and ligating instruments have been useful in decreasing surgical time. Antibiotics, usually furacin and sodium or potassium penicillin in 2 litres of Normasol-R, are placed in the peritoneal cavity before closure of the abdomen. A Penrose drain is commonly placed into the abdominal cavity to provide drainage of the peritoneal cavity after surgery. The peritoneum is sutured with No 0 chromic gut in a simple continuous pattern. A second Penrose drain may be placed between peritoneum and ventral body wall, with its ends retracted through stab incisions in the skin. The linea alba is closed with simple interrupted sutures of stainless steel wire or No. 3 chromic gut. Employing the above described principles and techniques has increased the success of abdominal surgery in our Clinic.","2267":"Initial examination and therapy, and the avoidance of maltreatment are emphasized. Gastric decompression is of prime importance, after which no compound should be administered via stomach tube. Where large amounts of high starch grains are fed, primary acute gastric dilatation must be differentiated from that secondary to small bowel dilatation, by immediate gastric intubation and irrigation of the cardia with lidocaine. If cessation of pain and improvement of peristalsis and general attitude follow, the former state may be assumed. If pain persists and peristalsis does not improve markedly, one should assume small bowel displacement. Rectal examination is helpful in initial evaluation: impactions, inguinal herniation and ileocaecal intussusception may be diagnosed and small bowel displacement suspected. Palpation of one or more distended loops of bowel in the ventral middle third of the abdomen indicates small bowel displacement or ileus and flaccid distension. Distinction by rectal palpation alone is difficult. Palpation of the gas-distended apex of the caecum in the middle third of the abdomen is virtually pathognomonic for 180 degrees rotation of the large bowel. Abdominal paracentesis yielding true sanguineous effusion indicates a necrotizing segment of the bowel. If negative, such a segment is absent, or there is an infarcted segment, not yet damaged to the point of leaching whole blood, or the necrotizing segment is outside the peritoneal cavity, i.e., in the thorax, intussuscepted into the caecum, or herniated into the inguinal canal. Recurrent colics frequently may be due to verminous arteritis but the relationship to diet should be investigated. Recurrent colics after grain ingestion with occult blood in the faeces may be due to ulcers; such cases respond well to grain withdrawal. The advantages and disadvantages of phenothiazine-derived tranquillizers are discussed. They are contra-indicated if there is any evidence of circulating volume insufficiency but are benefical in many instances through improved peripheral perfusion of organs provided circulating volume is adequate, i.e., early in acute abdominal disease prior to development of circulatory insufficiency. They should not be administered if immediate surgery is contemplated because of hypotensive effects. The administration of oral antibiotics (Neomycin) early in the course of the disease is encouraged. This is contra-indicated if the horse is already toxic, when it should receive parenteral antibiotics, preferably chloromycetin. Tetracyclines may predispose to the later development of salmonella diarrhoea. Absolute analgesia should be provided; our preference is the magnesium sulphate-chloral hydrate solutions. Administration of mineral oil is desirable in initiation of peristalsis, depression of Gram-negative overgrowth and softening of impactioning obstructions but nothing should be administered per os if the stomach has required decompression.","2268":"The basic components of the immune system, and the defence mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract, are briefly reviewed. Histological studies in 84 equine foetuses showed that lymphoid cells begin populating the thymic primordium at 11-12 weeks, the mesenteric lymph nodes at 13 weeks, the spleen at 25 weeks and the intestinal lamina propria at 13-14 weeks' gestation. Lymphocytes were seen in the intestinal epithelium very early in gestation. Histological signs of response to antigenic stimulation were seen in five foetuses, indicating that the horse is likely to be capable of mounting an immune response in utero. The changing status of the foal as it becomes fully immunocompetent is discussed.","2269":"Recent knowledge regarding the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestine of the horse has been reviewed. Consideration has been given to sites, mechanisms and factors affecting absorption as well as to the availability of calcium and phosphorus from feedstuffs commonly used in Eastern North America. Although the anatomy of the digestive tract might appear to impose restrictions on the ability of the horse to assimilate minerals, studies of absorption show that the horse utilizes the calcium and phosphorus of many feeds very efficiently.","2270":"Dietary carbohydrates, which constitute a most important source of equine nutrition, are digested and absorbed by a series of complex processes principally in the small intestine, beginning with intraluminal starch hydrolysis by the action of pancreatic amylase. The continuous secretion of a copious volume of pancreatic juice, low in enzyme activity, presumably releases sufficient oligosaccharides for further hydrolysis at the intestinal cell surface by brush border enzymes. Active carrier mediated mechanisms then transport the final hexose products across the intestinal cell for uptake in the hepatic portal system. Brush border disaccharidase activities in the equine small intestine are of the same order of magnitude, and have a similar distribution pattern, to those reported in omnivorous and carnivorous species. The disaccharidase development patterns are characteristic and reflect the ability of the horse to digest the major nutrient sources adequately at various stages of life. The efficiency of the mucosal disaccharidases and the monosaccharide transport systems in the equine small intestine have been established by a series of oral disaccharide and monosaccharide tolerance tests. Horses older than three years of age are unable to hydrolyse lactose, but young and adult horses are fully capable of rapidly hydrolysing sucrose and maltose loads. Several tests have clinical application for assessing small intestinal dysfunction in the investigation of diarrhoea and malabsorption. The deficient digestion or absorption of carbohydrate, whether primary or secondary, can almost always be localized to a defect in the enzymic or transport capacity of the small intestinal surface cell. The continued ingestion of lactose could be detrimental in severely diarrhoeic foals.","2271":"Recent studies on the digestive physiology of the horse are reviewed. It was suggested that the small intestine is the primary site of digestion and absorption of protein, soluble carbohydrates, most minerals, fats, fat soluble and water soluble vitamins. The large intestine is the primary site of fibre digestion and net water absorption. Significant amounts of phosphorus are also absorbed from the large intestine. Many factors such as rate of passage, processing of feeds, level of intake, work and maturity of plant may influence digestive ability.","2272":"The horse with an abdominal crisis caused by acute gastro-intestinal tract obstruction develops hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte depletion, metabolic acidosis and shock. During preparation for operation, treatment with fluids, antibiotics and bicarbonate will impede metabolic imbalance. Stomach decompression may slow the passage of sodium, water and potassium to the gut lumen, reduce pain and minimize the risk of stomach rupture. Selected laboratory determinations and the monitoring of arterial and venous pressures will provide a measure of security, and serve as a guide to replacement therapy. In the post-surgical period, vigilance must be directed towards potassium and bicarbonate imbalance and adequate hydration.","2273":"","2274":"","2275":"","2276":"","2277":"","2278":"","2279":"","2280":"","2281":"","2282":"","2283":"","2284":"","2285":"","2286":"","2287":"","2288":"","2289":"","2290":"","2291":"","2292":"","2293":"","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"","2300":"","2301":"","2302":"","2303":"","2304":"","2305":"","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"","2309":"","2310":"","2311":"","2312":"","2313":"","2314":"","2315":"","2316":"","2317":"","2318":"","2319":"","2320":"","2321":"","2322":"","2323":"","2324":"","2325":"","2326":"","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"","2331":"","2332":"","2333":"","2334":"","2335":"","2336":"","2337":"","2338":"","2339":"","2340":"","2341":"","2342":"","2343":"","2344":"","2345":"","2346":"","2347":"","2348":"","2349":"","2350":"","2351":"","2352":"","2353":"","2354":"","2355":"","2356":"","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"","2366":"","2367":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Corrigendum:
