Germany, the prevalence of infections with the human papilloma virus (HPV) among women and men is high. High-risk HPV types can lead to certain types of cancer (e. g., cervical cancer). Vaccination against HPV infections associated with cancer and genital warts was introduced in Germany in 2007. Currently, HPV vaccination is recommended for girls and boys by the German Standing Committee on Vaccination. The vaccination rate, however, remains rather low, with rates below 50% in 15-year-old girls and of about 5% in 15-year-old boys in 2019. This suggests that new approaches are urgently needed to increase HPV vaccination coverage in Germany in the coming years. This qualitative study aimed at identifying opportunities and challenges related to the application and implementation of different approaches designed to increase HPV vaccination uptake among male and female adolescents in Germany according to expert views. From April to July 2020, 43 experts from the field of HPV vaccination in Germany were interviewed using a semi-standardized interview guide. The audiotaped interviews were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis by Udo Kuckartz. According to the experts interviewed the following would be the most promising approaches to increase HPV vaccination rates in Germany: educational measures, school vaccination programs, increasing participation in the adolescent health check-up \"J1\", reminder and recall systems. The most reasonable solution would be to pursue several approaches simultaneously. According to the experts, more political support with implementing strategies and reducing bureaucratic obstacles as well as an increase in cooperation between relevant stakeholders is required to achieve the effective implementation of these strategies. ","1":"It is widely assumed that in Germany it is particularly difficult to address the issue of the relationship between costs and benefits in medicine. It is argued that the reception of recent medical historiography makes it possible to more clearly identify a specifically German tradition of questioning theory-based controlled comparisons of clinical efficacy. Of central importance here is the Comparative Therapy (Vergleichende Therapie - V.T.) project carried out during the Second World War, whose guiding spirit was Paul Martini (1889-1964). The failure of this large-scale project influenced the further development of the methodology of clinical research and contributed to the \"lateness\" of the acceptance in Germany of prospective controlled clinical trials compared to the Anglo-American world. This alsohh needs to be viewed in combination with the deep scepticism towards the cost-benefit debate whose rationale is still frequently questioned in Germany in relation to the need for individualised medicine. It seems important to give medical historiography greater space in order to reach a better understanding of the culture of the \"late EbM nation Germany\".","2":null,"3":"Quality indicators to assess the quality of primary care have only been applied on a national or regional level in European countries, and there have been no comparisons between regions of different countries. In the interventional pre-post-study \"Improvement of Quality by Benchmarking - IQuaB\" (level of evidence: 3), we aimed to improve and compare quality of process care in 57 participating general practices in Salzburg, Austria, and South Tyrol, Italy. The intervention consisted of self-audit, benchmarking and quality circles. Quality indicators for eight common chronic diseases (e. g., diabetes) were extracted from the electronic health records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Based on 19 quality indicators, a supra-regional quality score was calculated and compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. A relatively weak baseline performance was identified in both regions. In all three assessments, the median quality score increased in both regions and was significantly higher in South Tyrol than in Salzburg. During the study period the median supra-regional quality score increased from 20.00 to 38.00 in the Salzburg sample and from 47.00 to 79.5 in the South Tyrolian sample. The differences between the two regions were significant at baseline and after intervention (2012: p=0.015, 2014: p=0.001). Despite data extraction challenges in Austria, we are convinced that our data highlight real differences in (processual) quality of care between the two regions. The reasons underlying the persisting differences between the two regions may include: (1) different functions in electronic health records, (2) benchmarking as an integral part of the electronic health record, (3) gate-keeping system and use of registration lists, (4) state-supported quality initiatives. ","4":null,"5":"Delirium is a common condition of a global disturbance of cognition, triggered by underlying diseases. The objective of this study is to review the current evidence in the literature on direct healthcare costs and health related quality of life (HRQOL) associated with delirium. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Embase for relevant studies published between January 1, 2010 and November 4, 2021. Studies for inclusion reported estimates on healthcare costs or HRQOL, adjusted for relevant confounding factors. Fourteen studies on healthcare costs and eleven studies on HRQOL were included. Delirium resulted in (adjusted) increased costs ranging from $1,532 to $22,269 depending on included cost categories, the country and the type of hospital department. Increased length of stay for delirious patients ranged from 2.5 days to 10.4 days and had the largest contribution to overall, direct incremental costs. Heterogeneity was observed in HRQOL outcomes. The analysis indicates that the presence of a delirium episode may lead to increased costs of hospitalisation. Changes in HRQOL due to delirium are not well demonstrated and more research is needed to determine the effect of delirium on HRQOL. ","6":"Contrary to current guideline recommendations, second-line antibiotics are still frequently used in the ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI), which are associated with a high risk of antibiotic resistance development. The REDARES project (REDuction of Antibiotic RESistance in uncomplicated urinary tract infections by treatment according to national guidelines in ambulatory care), funded by the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA)\/Innovation Fund is developing a multimodal intervention for primary care physicians to support them in a guideline-based approach. The intervention consists of the following components: (1) provision of local resistance data of pathogens of uncomplicated UTI (Robert Koch Institute), (2) concise guideline content on the therapy of uncomplicated UTI for patients (paper and online), and (3) prescription feedback on practice level and benchmarking among the study participants (anonymized). In a participatory approach and as part of the process evaluation, representatives of the intended target group were interviewed in advance about the acceptance and feasibility of the intervention. Using guided individual interviews, Thuringian GPs were interviewed before the start of the intervention phase. Following a description of the study concept and the planned components of the intervention, the interviewees were asked about their assessment regarding acceptance and feasibility. The individual interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed according to Mayring. A total of ten interviews with an average duration of 29minutes were conducted and evaluated. 40 per cent of the interviewed GPs were female and, on average, 45 years old. The interviewees described the uncomplicated UTI as an easily manageable condition. The practical nature of the research question was described as a reason to potentially participate in the intervention phase; lack of time or human resources were cited as potential barriers. Regarding the intervention elements, the provision of local resistance data of UTI pathogens was considered beneficial to their own work. The extraction of their own antibiotic prescription data from the practice software was basically assessed as feasible. The interviewees differed in their assessment of whether they would take account of the feedback on their prescribing behavior in their daily work. The interviews generated a detailed picture of the different diagnostic and therapeutic pathways used by respondents for uncomplicated UTI. Overall, they predominantly regarded both the study concept and the intervention components as feasible. Although the study population is small and not representative, some of the results seem to be transferable to other regions in Germany. A research question relating to their daily routine can increase participation of primary care physicians in (intervention) studies. Starting the process evaluation before the intervention seems to be reasonable since the results will be integrated into the design of the intervention. The method of data extraction from practice software by practice teams seems to be promising.

The involvement of the practice staff promises decisive advantages in detection and diagnosis. So far, there has been a lack of studies exploring the extent to which non-medical practice employees in general practices are integrated into dementia detection, what experiences they have had and how they assess their own potential to contribute to more efficient dementia detection. Between August 2020 and August 2021, a total of 64 semi-structured, audio-technically recorded individual \/ expert interviews were conducted with non-medical practice employees (medical assistants) in general practices in all German federal states (four interviewees per federal state). The interview transcripts were evaluated using a qualitative, structuring content analysis according to Mayring (Software MAXQDA 2020). The GP team members show a high degree of willingness and motivation to support the doctor in identifying and diagnosing dementia; situations have been reported where their assistance has led to an earlier identification of people with dementia. Observation and detection of dementia patients are rarely based on systematic criteria. On the whole, only some GPs entrust their staff with tasks like this. A large portion of the interviewees expressed considerable uncertainty regarding the assessment of possible signs of incipient dementia, which corresponds to the fact that only a minority of the interviewees have ever completed further training in which dementia was an important topic. Practice staff can provide invaluable support when it comes to the timely and consistent detection of incipient dementia in general practice. In addition to sensitizing GPs and optimizing practice management, targeted training with regard to geriatric issues will be instrumental in achieving this. Accordingly, more advanced training formats should be developed that are tailored to the perspective of practice employees and convey important dementia-specific diagnostics, action and communication skills. ","11":"Sexual and domestic violence against women and young girls are widespread and can lead to significant psychological, psychosocial and health consequences for the victims. \"Confidential Securing of Evidence\" (\"vertrauliche Spurensicherung\", VSS) offers victims the opportunity to have the consequences of the violent acts they have suffered documented without primary police involvement, thus gaining time for decision-making. However, VSS and, in general, the care for victims of violence pose special challenges to physicians. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the documentation app iGOBSIS was developed in a project to support physicians in the care for victims of violence, especially in the VSS. The aim of the work was to clarify how physicians in North Rhine-Westphalia evaluate the functionality of violence victim care and VSS. Specifically, main deficits were to be identified, and suggestions and recommendations for optimizing care and VSS be explored. Interviews with 39 physicians were conducted in focus groups and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Medical care for victims of violence and VSS are mainly complicated by stress and time constraints and lack of professional qualification. There is a need for more public relations and educational work, better professional qualification, consistent documentation and secure funding. Readily available forensic medical support for documentation that will hold up in court, secure funding, networking and public relations are important elements to ensure good medical care for victims of violence and a functional VSS. ","12":null,"13":"Family doctor care in rural areas is facing upheaval. On the one hand, demographic change is increasing patient demand, but on the other hand, it is also reducing physician density. In this context, telemedicine opens up new potentials for care. This study explores the possibilities of digitalization in family care with diverse stakeholders. The most important element of this work is to explore the attitudes towards telemedical supplementary options in primary care. In doing so, the chances and concerns of both general practitioners and citizens will be analyzed. The aim is to find out possibilities which can relieve GPs and support the health care provision in rural regions in the long term. A mixed-methods design combines findings from qualitative semi-structured guided interviews with general practitioners (N=8) with a quantitative citizen survey (N=1,276) in a rural region. Concern about future health care provision is high among physicians and citizens. Although physicians see a need for action and opportunities through telemedicine measures, they also raise clear concerns about the doctor-patient relationship. The citizens are principally open to various telemedical options and can imagine using simple services such as e-prescription and e-appointment booking. These results can serve as a basis for the further development of digital offerings of family doctors' offices as well as other model projects in rural regions, if they guarantee low-threshold access, are implemented in cooperation with doctors and patients and do not endanger the established doctor-patient relationship. There are major concerns about the future of family physician care, especially in rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic opens up opportunities for digitization across age boundaries. However, telemedicine care can initially only have a supplementary role. Low-threshold offerings in close cooperation with the family doctor are particularly promising here.

Few studies were able to show that fact boxes, when compared with other formats, significantly improve risk perception, comprehensibility and readability. The fact boxes available in Germany, however, vary with regard to how tables and accompanying texts are presented. It is unclear to what extent the existing evidence can be applied to these formats. Hardly any fact boxes have been piloted systematically. The aim was to pilot the fact box \"Antibiotics for acute bronchitis\" as a model for the format in terms of feasibility. We used print and online media to recruit adults (&gt; 18 years). The characteristics gender, age and level of education were considered for sampling. The feasibility was explored by means of a semi-structured interview guideline. The focus group interviews were audio-taped and then transcribed. Data analysis was conducted as content analysis according to Mayring. Five focus groups with a total of 28 participants took place between April 2018 and May 2019 (Halle\/Saale, Saxony-Anhalt: n=3; St. Ingbert, Saarland: n=1; Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate: n=1). The fact box was piloted in an iterative process; the results were revised accordingly and checked again in focus groups until information saturation was achieved. The analysis identified the following main categories: interpretation of contents, readability, low reliability; credibility, relevance of the information, relevance of the presentation; superfluous information; completeness and layout. Overall, the fact box was hardly understood, especially regarding the numerical presentation given and the technical terms used. Both the objective and the intended addressees of the fact box were not clear. After revision, feasibility was established. The iterative revision process resulted in a final version that was well understood and perceived as a decision aid. The results support the demand of the guideline \"Evidence-based Health Information\" for piloting evidence-based health information prior to their dissemination and further evaluation. The next step will be to evaluate the fact box format in a randomised controlled trial. ","18":null,"19":"Relatives play a very important role in palliative care. Whilst previous research has investigated this role from the perspective of health professionals, this article focuses on the perspectives of the relatives of palliative patients. The present paper aims to identify relatives' perceptions of their role with respect to their relationship to professionals and to describe their significance for satisfaction with palliative care. Content analysis of 23 guideline-based interviews with relatives in Switzerland identified three main role perceptions of relatives, namely as: \"vulnerable persons\", as \"partners\" or \"warriors\". The results indicate that relatives' satisfaction with palliative care depends on the role assigned to them by specialists in the care process. This article demonstrates that well-trained health personnel in the field of palliative care and a common understanding of the roles within the palliative care team are central to supporting relatives. These findings can help inform good collaboration between relatives and professionals in palliative care (e.g., general practitioners, nurses, specialized doctors, such as oncologists, and specialized nurses) and to encourage families to feel comfortable with the care their loved ones receive.","20":null,"21":"Vascular anomalies are orphan diseases that occur in all age groups and range from purely aesthetic to potentially life-threatening conditions. This thesis paper outlines the typical conferring problems in patient management and possible structural solutions for a better patient treatment in the future. A multi-perspective author panel consisting of key stakeholders from the German Interdisciplinary Society of Vascular Anomalies and the German Society for Surgery defined problem areas and possible solutions including quality indicators as criteria for certified interdisciplinary Vascular Anomalies Centers (VAC). According to the literature available, clearly defined nomenclature and nosological entities often remain unused in this field, and consented diagnostic and therapeutic evidence is rare. Expert opinions dominate and in some cases lead to disparate recommendations. Typical patient problems arise from this situation, exemplified in patient vignettes. Centralized and standardized patient treatment in interdisciplinary VAC may be a solution to this problem. These centers should agree on a set of general principles and quality indicators with an additional minimum set of structural and procedural criteria. The present position paper outlines perspectives for implementing certified interdisciplinary VAC. There is a need for a comprehensive nomenclature, access to interdisciplinary treatment centers, more scientific evidence, and further education in this rare group of diseases. Use of scientifically sound and patient-relevant criteria for certifying the interdisciplinary quality of VAC is expected to improve health care in Germany.

In addition, residents have the opportunity to participate in a regional training network. The aim was to assess the burden of burnout and the importance of the learning environment in the clinical training phase. We conducted a cross-sectional study. Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which comprises the scales \"Emotional Exhaustion\", \"Depersonalisation\" and \"Personal Accomplishment\". The quality of the learning environment was recorded using the German version of the Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test (D-RECT German). In addition, multivariable linear regressions were performed to estimate the impact of learning environment, year of training and participation in a regional network on the level of burnout. 129 clinical residents enrolled in the CCRTB were invited to participate in the study, 78 (61%) of whom submitted a response. 76 (59%) of these residents were included in the analyses. The present study discloses an increased burden of burnout among residents in the clinical training phase, with approx. 40% reaching a critical burnout score. A higher quality of the learning environment was associated with significantly milder burnout symptoms on the majority of the D-RECT scales. Family medicine residents in the clinical training phase show a high burden of burnout. Therefore, increasing the quality of the learning environment appears to be an effective key element in achieving a reduction of burnout in clinical training. This might contribute to an increase in professional satisfaction, which finally may also prevent migration from the medical profession.

The majority can be cared for within general outpatient palliative care (AAPV) by general practitioners. Previous studies have described outpatient palliative care to fall short behind the estimated needs and to be initiated rather late in the health care process. Yet, little is known about the development of outpatient palliative care in recent years and about the parameters influencing its utilisation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the number and time of initiation for AAPV and specialised outpatient palliative care (SAPV) in a rural and small-town region in Lower Saxony on the basis of routinely collected general practice data. Furthermore, this study sought to estimate the influence of various parameters related to patients, practices and physicians on the provision of AAPV and SAPV. All general practitioners (n=190) in two counties in Lower Saxony were invited to take part in the project \"Optimal care at the end of life - OPAL\" (Innovation Fund, 01VSF17028) between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. In the participating practices, clinical data pertaining to patients with statutory health insurance, who had died in the second or third quarter of 2018, were collected in pseudonymised form and analysed using selected indicators for end-of-life care. The number of hospital stays and the provision of AAPV and SAPV were the subject of the descriptive analyses. In order to take the cluster effect of the practices into account, mixed-model analyses were carried out. The data of 279 deceased patients (48% female; median age 82 years) from 31 general practices were analysed. In the last year of life, AAPV was provided for 78 deceased patients (28.0%) with a median onset of 20 days before death. 52 deceased patients (18.6%) received SAPV with a median onset of 28 days before death, respectively. In the last six months of life, 207 deceased patients (74.2%) were hospitalised at least once. The mixed-model analyses showed a greater probability of receiving AAPV (odds ratio (OR)=3.3) or SAPV (OR=3.2) in the last year of life for patients with oncological diseases. It was also shown that GPs with a higher value on the subscale practice organisation billed more AAPV (OR=1.4). The number of patients with SAPV is at least equivalent to the estimated needs known from the literature in both selected regions. In contrast, AAPV seems to be provided relatively rarely and rather late in the health care process. Relevant reasons for this may be the lack of concrete criteria for AAPV (e. g., ambiguities and competing codes for billing) as well as prognostic uncertainties of health care providers especially for patients with non-oncological diseases. Strategies to further develop end-of-life care should especially strengthen the AAPV provided by general practitioners and focus on patients with non-oncological diseases. ","28":null,"29":"Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) has been established to be the most important therapy option for improving health and social burdens of people with opioid dependence. Pharmacies provide drug substitutes to substitution practices or outpatient clinics and administer drugs to substituted patients (medication under visual control) or supply prescriptions for unsupervised, at-home use by patients. Given the gaps in medical care, the relevance of pharmacies for the comprehensive treatment of opioid-dependent patients will become even more important in the future. The 3rd Revision of the Narcotic Drugs Prescription Ordinance (NDPO) adopted sweeping reforms to the framework of OAT in 2017. This paper examines the impact of this reform from the pharmacist's perspective. Between November 2020 and March 2021, pharmacists in the German federal states of Hamburg, North-Rhine Westphalia, Saxony, and Bavaria were informed by their State Chambers of Pharmacists about participation in this online study. A total of 480 questionnaires were evaluated. The analysis differentiates between pharmacists who are currently involved in the substitution of opioid-dependent patients (54.2%), pharmacists who were involved in the past (21.4%), and those who have never been involved in opioid substitution (24.4%). Pharmacists involved in OAT have not seen any positive changes resulting from the 3rd Revision of the NDPO. According to 97.9% of the pharmacists, remuneration for administering medication under visual control should be analogous to remuneration in doctors' practices. Mixed prescriptions (prescription of take-home dose and intermediate medication under visual control) increase the administrative workload and have been rejected by a quarter of the pharmacists. Non-involved pharmacists significantly overestimated the occurrence of critical situations with substituted patients in the pharmacy. While only 2.7% of pharmacists involved in OAT reported drug emergencies, 23.1% of non-involved pharmacists expressed such concerns. 39.3% of the pharmacists felt they could be motivated to participate in OAT if they were approached directly, and 73.9% of the pharmacists who are currently involved in OAT said they could provide substitution medication under visual control to additional opioid-dependent patients. The 3rd Revision of the NDPO has no influence on the situation and willingness of pharmacists to be involved in OAT. However, to ensure that pharmacists continue to be actively involved in OAT and attract new substituting pharmacies, their importance for comprehensive OAT must be upgraded. This includes, and not least, the funding of pharmacists' administration of substitution drugs under visual control. In addition, knowledge about OAT, attitudes toward opioid-dependent patients, and contact anxiety could be addressed by promoting educational awareness and training. ","30":"Combined hearing and vision impairment, which can negatively affect the performance of activities of daily living, is particularly prevalent in those over 70 years of age. Existing studies show that this dual sensory impairment has implications for safety in the home environment. Insights into how individuals integrate hearing and vision changes into their daily lives are needed for planning care-related interventions. A qualitative method was used supplemented with quantitative methods (\"Concurrent Embedded Strategy\"). Based on the grounded theory approach, we conducted guided interviews with hearing- and vision-impaired individuals aged 70 years and over (n=46) as well as a questionnaire survey on how they cope with their daily lives. As part of their processing, individuals with hearing and visual impairments go through three stages that are closely linked to \"being able to communicate.\" A partial result of the KoRes model is presented. This article focuses on the first two stages of this model: \"diagnosis\" and \"reflection\". People with dual sensory impairment behave reactively on the first two of a total of three stages with regard to the processing of their impairments. They need a supportive environment to be able to clarify these changes in hearing and vision and come to grips with the underlying causes.

Therefore, European guidelines regarding the diagnosis of coeliac disease were changed in 2012. If laboratory tests are positive, children can now be diagnosed without performing an endoscopy. The aim of this study was to characterize the Swiss patients, who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease. This is a retrospective study of Swiss paediatric patients who have been diagnosed with coeliac disease according to European guidelines between 01\/2011 and 11\/2020. The data needed was extracted from medical records. A total of 369 children were included in the study. The main complain was abdominal pain (118; 32%), followed by failure to thrive\/gain weight (92; 24.9%). 10% (37\/367) of all patients had no symptoms at all. In 72.6% (268\/369) of all patients, an endoscopy was performed due to lower antibodies. Mean values for ferritin, vitamins D and B12 as well as folic acid were within normal range. In our cohort of patients, females were clearly more often affected and also showed a small deviation in height and weight. Our finding of 10% of all patients having no symptoms at all is in line with other studies observing a decline in symptoms. A complicating factor for the clinician is the fact that overall no vitamin deficiencies were detected. As the incidence continues to rise but the clinical presentation of coeliac disease is changing from a malabsorption syndrome to a silent disease, further observational studies are needed to monitor this trend.

This study aims to gain the patients' perspective on the education of medical students to improve future curricula. Using a semi-structured interview guide, 17 interviews were conducted with patients undergoing inpatient (N=9) or outpatient (N=8) medical treatment. The interviews were subjected to computer-assisted analysis guided by Grounded Theory. 480 codings were condensed into seven main categories: Science Fiction Medicine, Society and the Patient, Professional Environment and Health Care System, Medical Curriculum and Continuing Education, Value System and Motivation, Psychosocial Competence and Medical Professional Competence. The largest main categories are Psychosocial Competence (114 codings) and Professional Environment and Health Care System (105 codings). There is a need for psychosocial education in addition to medical knowledge. A future-focused curriculum should entail practice-oriented education to ensure the training of motivated physicians who possess strengthened digital skills and act on ethical principles and values. Assessment of the patients' perspective should play a crucial role in medical education research. ","36":"More than 50% of the type-2 Diabetes (T2DM) mortality is due to cardiovascular disease. Current treatment guidelines recommend an increasingly differentiated and comprehensive management of cardiovascular risk factors. This study aims to measure the extent to which T2DM care is currently adjusted for cardiovascular risks in clinical practice. This observational study included 123 T2DM patients of nine outpatient diabetology specialist clinics in Southern Germany. Guideline adherence was measured based on selected aspects of the joint guideline of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). The proportion of patients with treatment target adherence, monitoring adherence, and therapy adherence for the areas of blood pressure and lipid metabolism management was determined, and the correlation between adherence and treatment outcome was assessed by comparing treatment target achievement rates between the group that received guideline-adherent care and the group with no guideline-adherent care. The combined adherence rates were 39% for blood pressure management and 10% for lipid management. 70% of the participants with adherent blood pressure management and 56% with non-adherent blood pressure management achieved the blood pressure target (p=0.165). 50% of the patients with guideline-adherent lipid management and 17% with not guideline-adherent lipid management achieved the LDL cholesterol target (p=0.032). Less than half of the study population received care that was adequately adjusted for cardiovascular risks. Participants that received risk-adjusted care achieved their treatment target for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol more often. In order to validate methods and results, the study should be repeated with routine care data from a larger study population. Guideline-adherent care pays off: cardiovascular risk-adjusted care, especially following the more differentiated ESC\/EASC guideline 2019, increases the chance for T2DM patients to avoid or delay cardiovascular complications. ","37":"Being cared for in one's own home environment is of great significance for many people in need of care. In addition to care provided by relatives, the care provided by professional home care services is also important. More and more people in need of care are being cared for by relatives together with or solely through such home care services. Because of this, the issue of quality and quality measurement in home care has become increasingly important. The prerequisite for measuring and assessing quality is the definition of specific requirements for medical and nursing care. A comprehensive quality framework for home care has not yet been developed. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current situation in home care and to identify relevant aspects of care subsequently. Finally, these aspects of care should be presented in a framework model. In order to describe the situation in home care, a review was conducted based on the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology of a scoping review. The literature was analysed, and the relevant aspects of care were derived by using an inductive approach. Furthermore, these aspects of care were assigned to quality dimensions defined for health care (e. g., patient safety, patient-centeredness) and merged into a quality model of home care. A total of 222 publications were included, and 17 aspects of home care were identified. These involved structural aspects of care and aspects of care for shaping relationships with people in need of care and their family carers, as well as aspects of support for people in need of care and their family carers. Furthermore, process-related and outcome-related aspects of care were identified. The comparison of these aspects with the defined quality dimensions showed that each of these quality dimensions is covered by at least one aspect of care. This results in a comprehensive quality model for home care which can serve as a framework for measuring and assessing quality in home care. The aspects of care identified can be used for the development of instruments such as routine data-based quality indicators and thus allow for the measurement, presentation and assessment of quality in home care. ","38":"The complex and dynamic situation in the current pandemic requires a regionally coordinated and interconnected cooperation between the different stakeholders within the health care system, such as the inpatient sector or the public health service. The aim of this study is to analyze health care management during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with a focus on regional networking and communication structures. As part of the BMBF-funded project \"egePan Unimed\", an online questionnaire on pandemic management was sent to the boards of all 35 German university hospitals in November 2020. The questionnaire focused on the core topics of regional networking, crisis management, data exchange, and communication with political stakeholders. The questionnaire consisted of 37 closed and three open-ended questions. After piloting, the invitation to the survey was extended three times by mail and once by telephone. The results (n=25, response 71.4%) show that 68% of the clinics surveyed were connected to representatives from the inpatient sector and 86% to representatives from the public health service. Networking with representatives from the outpatient sector was less common (26%). Of the university hospitals surveyed, 84% had a leadership role in a regional COVID-19 pandemic management effort. Data exchange with regional hospitals in the course of pandemic management took place at 75% of the participating university hospitals and with supra-regional hospitals at 67% of the clinics surveyed. To manage regional medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, university hospitals often assumed a coordinating role in the complex pandemic care process. There were often structured collaborations with regional clinics and health departments and comparatively few cooperations with the outpatient care sector. However, this cooperation has the potential to prevent overcrowding in hospitals. ","39":null,"40":"It is important to study the well-being of patients and their relatives after receiving hospital treatment, as both the healthcare professional and the political attention towards user participation is constantly increasing. In this study, user participation is understood as a way to manage the user's rights, opportunity for choices and human rights through relationships and with their well-being as a common goal. Therefore, the health professionals' understanding of this must be increased, evidence must increasingly form the basis for the chosen actions and the professional management must support a person-oriented clinical practice. The research program's theoretical perspective for perioperative nursing is presented in this article, and it is based on answering person-oriented Fundamental of Care questions and as a methodological challenge to have user involvement as a constant activity. This theoretical and methodological choice guides the continued development of the research program. Perioperative nursing is understood from the time the patient meets the nurse at the time of admission until the time of discharge after the elective surgical treatment is completed. To our knowledge no studies regarding the outcome of FoC for the perioperative patient have been conducted. We address healthcare providers' actions, starting from when a nurse admits a patient until the day of discharge after treatment is complete, and nursing care related to elective surgical procedures in Norwegian and Danish non-university hospitals. The research program seeks insight into the experiences of current and former patients and relatives as well as the healthcare professionals who perform the treatment in Norwegian and Danish non-university hospitals. Based on results from this research program, we expect to be able to increase the healthcare professionals' competencies in Fundamental Care and to increase their openness regarding user involvement, options and human rights for the benefit of surgical patients well-being.","41":"To overcome challenges in dementia care, technological concepts are considered to have a potential. It is unclear, however, how utilization of assistive technologies in Switzerland could look like and which specific potentials it may offer. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to elaborate options for using assistive technologies in dementia care on the basis of the opinion, experience and knowledge of experts. We chose a qualitative study design. Thematic analysis served to evaluate the expert interviews. To report this study, we followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR). Between November 2018 and May 2019, we interviewed 15 experts. The analysis resulted in three themes, each with three sub-themes: (i) use and potentials of technologies (support in the home care network, promoting a sense of security, facilitating and preserving interaction), (ii) requirements for using technology (structural framework conditions, enhancing quality of life and care, considering individual needs and health situation), and (ii) ethical considerations and technical assets (security and freedom, side effects of telepresence care, caveats and technological optimism). To exploit the identified potentials of assistive technologies for people with dementia, it is necessary to fulfil the requirements on a structural level in nursing policy, education and clinical practice. Furthermore, assistive technologies should be applied that have demonstrated effectiveness without unwanted effects. The decision to use assistive technologies should be made on an individual basis. Accordingly, the use of assistive technologies should take into account the needs of the persons involved and be adapted to the state of health of people with dementia. ","42":"The impact of climate change on health and the necessity to reduce emissions in the health sector is becoming an increasingly discussed topic. Little is known about medical doctors' (MDs) attitude towards climate protection measures in outpatient practices. Between October 2020 and February 2021, a survey was conducted among MDs in German practices. 1,683 participants answered 39 questions on energy use, transportation, disposable materials, budget and patient counselling. Data were collected on status, motivation, obstacles and needs regarding climate protection in practices. 83% considered climate change an urgent problem requiring immediate action. A majority reported climate effects on their patients' health. Most MDs felt responsible for climate protection in their practices, showing a high degree of willingness to implement climate-friendly measures. Obstacles reported include lack of information and institutional support as well as the expected financial burden. A majority of MDs called on professional associations and politics to develop climate-friendly strategies. In view of national climate targets and the willingness of outpatient MDs to contribute to climate protection, support from medical associations is required, e. g. through practical recommendations and financial help, in order to transform the health sector in accordance with the idea of Planetary Health. Accompanying studies should provide further evidence on effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in practices. ","43":"Nurses working in oncology use a wide range of naturopathic interventions in their daily practice to alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life of oncological patients. However, there is no external evidence for many of these interventions. Due to a lack of scientific studies in the field, the aim of the project described here is to develop a standardized procedure to generate evidence on naturopathic interventions, on the basis of which recommendations may be derived for nursing practice. The systematic procedure presented here was developed by the working group (WG) Integrative Nursing in Oncology over a period of four years in an iterative process. This process is based on the expert panel members' experience with the development of guidelines and\/or quality instruments such as practice standards. The systematic methodological approach presented here consists of three successive steps where internal and external evidence have been combined: a scoping review, a structured consensus process with oncology nurses to collect and evaluate naturopathic interventions, and finally a further supplementary literature review based on additional findings of the consensus conference. The procedure was successfully carried out for mucositis, insomnia, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome and chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy. Through the step-by-step synthesis of internal evidence and the best available external evidence, the evidence base for naturopathic nursing interventions in oncology can be generated and practice recommendations derived. The procedure represents a successful theory-practice transfer through structured cooperation between (nursing) scientists and nursing practitioners. In terms of the AWMF classification, the practice recommendations developed in the process described fall somewhere in between an S1 guideline (informal consensus of an expert group) and an S2e guideline (evidence-based). ","44":"Careful evaluation of new interventions is essential. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews of RCTs provide the most reliable evidence base in comparative evaluations of treatments and interventions. Observational study designs are found at the lower levels of the classical evidence hierarchy. In light of policy efforts to accelerate the availability of innovations, the use of evidence from non-randomized studies for reimbursement decisions is being discussed. The present study addresses the question of the value and feasibility of RCTs and observational studies for benefit assessment after an intervention has been introduced into practice. Experts from German-speaking countries were interviewed using qualitative, semi-structured interviews. Participants included experts in health economics, health services and health services research, health communication, ethics, and health policy. The interviews were conducted by one researcher and then analyzed using a deductive approach. Main categories and subcategories were extracted. Twenty-six experts were invited to participate, and 15 agreed to be interviewed. The duration of the individual interviews varied between 35 and 80minutes. The interviewed experts considered it possible and necessary to conduct RCTs when an intervention is already available in care in order to demonstrate that an intervention is more effective than existing alternatives. Experts considered good study design, methodological knowledge of those conducting the study, infrastructure, and funding as underlying conditions. They emphasized that the benefit of an intervention cannot be conclusively clarified on the basis of observational studies and that RCTs can therefore only be dispensed with in exceptional cases. Therefore, observational studies do not represent an alternative to RCTs in benefit assessment in general. In the opinion of the experts, the requirements for observational studies included sensible criteria and quality assurance measures. As alternatives to RCTs, the experts named studies based on routine data or high-quality, prospective, comparative cohort studies. Individual experts were very critical of studies based on data from registries. The results of the interviews are underlined by findings from the scientific literature. For example, international scientists advocate for conducting RCTs instead of observational studies and for a reduction in hurdles and barriers for conducting RCTs. In international methodological standards for the preparation of health technology assessments, RCTs are also generally preferred for benefit assessment. Nevertheless, there is still a need for research about the optimal use of observational studies, alternative RCT designs and the use of data from routine care or registries, as policy makers, among others, believe that observational studies should be used for benefit assessment. The results show that experts still adhere to the established principles of clinical epidemiology. Observational studies should only be used as an alternative to RCTs in exceptional cases to examine whether one intervention is more effective than existing alternatives. ","45":null,"46":null,"47":"Due to the high variability and, at the same time, rare occurrence of rare diseases, the diagnosis of these patients (approx. 4 million people in Germany) can turn into an odyssey. The large time interval between the appearance of symptoms and the final diagnosis of the rare disease leads to a delay in the appropriate treatment. The often long period of uncertainty about the cause of symptoms as well as non-specific or even wrong therapies can have negative effects on both the course of disease and the patients' quality of life. For a better understanding of the current care situation and IT landscape, the interdisciplinary care pathway for people with rare diseases will be modelled and the possible uses of IT applications identified that have the potential to improve diagnosis, treatment and therapy of rare diseases. In order to achieve these goals, an initial care pathway was modelled on the basis of process descriptions which are commonly used in the literature, discussed in detail, and agreed upon in a first workshop with six experts from outpatient and inpatient care as well as employees of Centers for Rare Diseases. In a second workshop, ten experts analyzed the resulting care pathway with regard to the possible use of IT applications, and the identification was agreed upon. The experts included those involved in the process, in particular physicians, patients \/ patient representatives, health care researchers, and experts in hospital IT, IT security, and data protection. The two workshops resulted in process models including the specification of possible uses for IT applications. The most important steps in the care pathway for people with rare diseases in Germany include: neonatal screening, seeking medical advice, outpatient care by general practitioners, outpatient care by specialists, care by specialist outpatient clinic, care by clinic, care by a Center for Rare Diseases: case review and case conference and treatment and therapy. The discussion of the possible uses of IT applications resulted in a focus on registers (e. g. with regard to experts, treatment and therapy options) as well as on digital tools, such as \"digital findings and findings platform\" and \"digital referral with referral tracking\". Our results show that the care pathway is very heterogeneous and complex. Thus, the sub-processes show different variants with many branches and repetitions. They also illustrate that the care for people with rare diseases requires a high level of interdisciplinary collaboration; diagnosis as well as treatment and therapy often take place across sectors and in cooperation between different medical health care institutions and professions. When analyzing the current IT landscape, it becomes clear that IT applications can be used at many process steps in the care for people with rare diseases and have a high potential. Therefore, they must be used to inform decisions about the adequate diagnosis and treatment as well as communication about the clinical pictures and the patient's case between practitioners and medical care sectors. The interdisciplinary collaboration highlights the need for cooperation between the various parties involved in the process, which requires the identification and implementation of interfaces between the stakeholders and their systems. However, it is not enough to include the view of the processes; the data perspective is also required. Creating interoperability also enables the use of IT applications. The basis for this is the results obtained. ","48":"The process of enrolling participants is an important component and often a time-consuming step in scientific research projects. Due to different financial, organisational and ethical framework conditions, the enrolment of participants is often a challenge. In this article, we report our experiences of enrolling patients in clinical trials made in the project \"Psycho-oncological care of cancer patients with a migration background - a mixed methods study\" (POM). Participants were recruited through outpatient haemato-oncology practices. Patients and relatives were primarily made aware of the project by the treating physicians and recruited to participate in qualitative interviews. Nine patients and relatives were interviewed nationwide in individual qualitative interviews. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were other patient enrolment challenges. In many cases, participation was refused. The reasons included: \"not interested\", the use of the terms \"psycho-oncology\" or \"person with a migration background\", family denying permission to participate, no face-to-face interview due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as too much emotional distress and deterioration of health after prior consent. Enrolling study participants from vulnerable groups for a sensitive topic such as psycho-oncology entails multiple challenges. In order to achieve successful study inclusion, regular telephone and written exchanges with the respective practice staff proved to be helpful, allowing an overview of challenges to be gained and study inclusion to be evaluated and adjusted in a timely manner. In research projects with vulnerable groups and on sensitive topics, both a target-group-specific, sensitive approach in plain language (layman's terms) and regular consultations with the persons responsible for study inclusion in care facilities should take place in order to adapt the existing procedure during the study inclusion process, if necessary. ","49":"In Germany, family physicians care for about 85% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The geographic distribution of the first wave in 2020 was heterogeneous, and each federal state experienced different percentages of patients that died from COVID-19. Each of the 16 federal states implemented its own regulation about medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Against this background, the objective of this analysis was to gather experiences made by primary care physicians managing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients during the first wave in March 2020 and to clinically characterize these patients. In total, 5,632 physicians were invited to participate in an online questionnaire surveying routine data regarding the general care situation at the physician practice level and the care for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to characterize treatment experiences and to identify patient characteristics predicting the course of disease. 132 family physicians from all German federal states (except from Berlin) participated in this analysis (response rate 2.3%) and provided routine care data for 1,085 patients. Information from 373 of these patients were provided in greater detail. On average, each physician treated 8.5 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. About 15% of the physicians used video consultations to communicate with their infected patients. More than 82% made positive experiences with the exceptional regulation to provide a certificate of incapacity to work by telephone. Half of the physicians faced equipment insufficiencies due to a lack of protective gear, and in 10% of the practices, the staff themselves acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Greater numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases treated in a practice translated into higher odds for members of the practice to get infected (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% CI [1.01;1.06]). Older persons, males and patients in rural areas had higher odds of a severe course of disease. Our results show that a large percentage of primary care physicians additionally managed their COVID-19 patients remotely by telephone or video during the outbreak, while also being at a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, the increased severity in rural areas underlines the importance of strong primary health care in order to enable hospitals to concentrate on critically ill patients. ","50":null,"51":"In the joint project \"Mobile Care Backup\" funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the smartphone-based app \"MoCaB\" was developed in close cooperation with informal caregivers. It provides individualized, algorithm-based information and can accompany and support caring relatives in everyday life. After a multi-step development, informal caregivers tested the MoCaB app in a home setting at the end of the research project. The goal was to find out how the test persons evaluate MoCaB and in which form the app can provide support to informal caregivers. Eighteen test persons caring for relatives participated in a four-week test of MoCaB. Guideline-based qualitative interviews to record usage behavior and experiences with the app were conducted after two and four weeks of testing, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The test persons described the care-related information as helpful. The individualized, algorithm-based mode of information delivery and the exercises provided for family caregivers were generally rated as helpful, but their use depends on the individual usage style. Three dimensions can describe the effects of MoCaB: 1) expansion of care-relevant knowledge, 2) stimulation of self-reflection, and 3) behavior towards the care recipients. With few exceptions, the testing caregivers felt that the MoCaB app was enriching. The support dimensions have an effect at different points in everyday life and vary in intensity, depending on the duration of the existing care activity and the individual preferences of the users. The way in which caregivers used the app was not always consistent with the expected behaviors. This demonstrates the relevance of open-ended, qualitative research methods in the evaluation of health apps.

A high priority should therefore be placed on identifying and preventing avoidable adverse events. The patient perspective plays an important role in improving patient safety. In this study, we conducted a representative, population-based survey of knowledge, perceptions and experiences of patient safety, especially of subjectively experienced errors in health care. Our aim was, in particular, to assess patient safety from the patients' point of view, and to analyze differences in assessments of risk and preventability between persons that felt well or poorly informed about patient safety topics. In 2019, computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted nationwide as part of the \"TK-Monitor Patient Safety\" project. Recruitment was carried out by using multistage selection and forming a stratified random sample. Adults (18 years and older) with sufficient knowledge of German were included. The survey was conducted using a structured guideline containing 21 questions concerning perceptions and experiences of patient safety, and 12 questions on sociodemographic factors. The results were analyzed both descriptively and using inferential statistical methods. Of a total of 1,000 respondents (51% female), approx. half (52%) were gainfully employed, and 57% rated their state of health as \"very good\" or \"good\". The patients regarded data protection, medication errors, hospital infections and diagnostic (un)certainty as of major relevance to patient safety. Overall, 55% of the respondents rated their knowledge of patient safety as \"very good\" or \"good\". The results showed that subjective knowledge was negatively associated with important outcome parameters such as having experience of medication errors or suspecting errors had been made in a medical examination or treatment. Patients that considered themselves well-informed also reckoned they could contribute towards increasing safety in health care. The respondents considered diagnostic uncertainty to be one of the greatest risks to their person. This shows that they recognized a need for further information and felt this need was inadequately satisfied in the German research landscape. With regard to the correlation between subjective knowledge and outcome parameters, it is also necessary to analyze whether the respondents' subjective knowledge reflects their actual knowledge, as this would be necessary for preventive measures to be effective. This question will be the subject of further studies. The patient perspective is an important addition to the study of the safety of medical care in Germany. Factors influencing subjective knowledge should be investigated. Furthermore, regular surveys would be desirable in order to gain greater insight into the topic. ","57":"The National Association for Quality Development in Hospitals and Clinics (ANQ) has conducted patient satisfaction measurements in the inpatient sector in Switzerland since 2009. Specifically designed for this measurement, an instrument consisting of five questions was evaluated on an 11-point rating scale. Nevertheless, the instrument showed substantial ceiling effects, which did not allow for hospital discrimination. Therefore, ANQ initiated a revision testing different scales in a pilot study. The results showed that a 5-point verbal scale displayed good psychometric properties. Compared to the 7- or 11-point scales, the 5-point verbal scale exhibited reduced ceiling effects, which was more appropriate to compare hospitals. For the national public reporting of hospitals and clinics, risk adjustment by age and self-reported health status was recommended, which was not the case for gender, principal diagnosis, type of admission and insurance status.","58":"The number of patients visiting emergency departments (ED) due to acute but less than urgent treatment needs is increasing. A deeper understanding of emergency perception and decision-making competencies of patients is fundamentally important for developing strategies to reduce ED utilization. The aim of this study was to assess ED patients' subjective understanding of an emergency in general as well as relating to their own specific consultation. Additionally, the patients' perspective on the ability to make appropriate decisions in acute situations should be explored. Seventeen qualitative semi-structured patient interviews were conducted and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The majority of participants attributed their ED consultation to a subjectively perceived emergency situation. Interviewees mostly understood an emergency as a serious or life-threatening constellation associated with impending long-term health damage. They believed that uncertainty concerning the interpretation of their symptoms and associated anxiety may particularly promote situations in which referring to an ED appears to be the only alternative. Patients' health competencies were assessed negatively by a majority of interviewees with regard to assessment of complaints and decision-making in acute situations (\"insecure patients\"). In contrast, few patients, including those with chronic disease and experience in dealing with health problems, were considered to have a high level of competence (\"confident patients\"). Improving patients' health literacy skills to strengthen their assessment of acute situations and their decision-making is important in order to promote appropriate ED utilization. ","59":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the German health system has faced major challenges since spring 2020. In addition to restrictions in the inpatient health care sector, the maintenance of outpatient care by health care providers has also been affected by the pandemic-related restrictions. Both a decline in treatment frequencies and temporary practice closures have been observed. The aim of the study was to survey the work and care situation in outpatient physiotherapy practices during the first wave of the pandemic. An anonymous online survey including quantitative and qualitative items was conducted among physiotherapists in the outpatient sector in Germany between June 1 and August 31, 2020. The survey is part of the mixed-methods study \"ArTheCo\", which was conducted throughout Germany including outpatient therapists and patients in physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. In total, 577 physiotherapists from all over Germany took part in the survey. During the first wave of the pandemic, the occupancy rate fell below 50% at 45% of the facilities. 15% of the facilities had to close temporarily. Short-time work was announced at 58% of the respondents' practices. This and the implementation of hygiene measures restricted the provision of physiotherapy. This mainly affected patients with a higher risk of a severe clinical course of disease, such as nursing home patients. Due to complex changes in practice organisation and patient care, many of the interviewees felt that their economic existence was threatened and also described a large physical and psychological burden. Existing dissatisfaction seemed to have increased by the pandemic. To maintain continuous physical therapy, a reorganisation of the reimbursement system as well as easily accessible, consistent and feasible action plans for practices are needed. In combination with threats to existence due to the pandemic and increasing skill shortage, the outpatient physiotherapeutic care also appears to be threatened beyond the pandemic. The current pandemic has highlighted long-standing challenges causing dissatisfaction and making the profession increasingly unattractive for some of the respondents. Political action to support physiotherapists needs to be initiated. This study indicates potential starting points. ","60":null,"61":"In health technology assessment (HTA), the demarcation of ethical and social aspects in two separate domains is a given fact. While an overlapping of ethical and social aspects is possible, this also raises theoretical and methodological questions, such as why overlaps happen (on the basis of which understanding of ethical and social aspects), or whether they are legitimate from a methodological point of view. We analyzed, on a basis of purposive sampling, a) two well-known HTA frameworks (HTA Core Model, INTEGRATE-HTA), b) methodological literature about ethical and\/or social aspects in HTA, and c) published HTA reports from the German DAHTA database and the international CRD database regarding statements on the understanding (definition\/characterization) and relationship between ethical and social aspects. The frameworks use identical definitions for ethical aspects but deviate when it comes to social aspects. Methodological papers do not always provide a definition of social and ethical aspects. In the context of ethical aspects, they often refer back to ethics as a base discipline that deals with the motives and consequences of good and bad actions for ethical aspects, while for social aspects, there is orientation towards already existing checklists and methods, without reference to a base discipline such as sociology. The analyzed HTA reports barely offered details on their understanding of ethical or social aspects (7% of n = 33). The problem of defining\/characterizing and differentiating ethical and social aspects exists in both theory and practice. The impression is that little attention is paid to demarcations and overlaps, and that also the methodological literature has not yet thoroughly addressed the issue. While there are also pragmatic reasons for the possible ambiguity between the ethical and the social domains, deeper epistemological issues related to the multi-\/interdisciplinarity nature of HTA will have to be considered, too, such as the danger of \"disciplinary capture\" (pressure on some domains and their basic disciplines, e.g., ethics, to adopt the concepts and standards of other domains that are more dominant in HTA, e.g., efficacy assessment\/evidenced-based medicine). The domains in HTA reports should be better described epistemologically and brought into a coherent relationship with each other. This is important to avoid unreasonable overlapping and possible problematic redundancy. Further, this could help with questions of adequate expertise and methods for the processing of all relevant information for solid technology assessment. ","62":"The aim of the present study was to survey the current state of quality assurance of teaching at German-speaking medical faculties. Another aim was to determine whether and how the evaluation loop is closed. A questionnaire was sent out to 45 German-speaking faculties in the DACH countries to determine how the faculties ensure quality of teaching. Information was collected on qualification programs offered to faculty, course evaluations (LVE), evaluations during the final year (PJ-E), and on the implementation of graduate surveys (ABS-B). Evaluable data sets are available from 29 of the 40 faculties that responded. At almost all faculties, lecturers can take advantage of various didactic offers. Training programs for (M3) examiners (32%) and PJ supervisors (21%), on the other hand, are offered less frequently. Students at two-thirds of the faculties participate in the planning and implementation of LVEs, which are conducted at all faculties. Almost all faculties conduct PJ-E, and 72% of the faculties report interviewing graduates (ABS-B). However, the responsibility for conducting the ABS-B lies with the faculties themselves in only 48% of the cases. Twenty faculties report various additional teaching evaluations (e.g., evaluation of projects, progress tests). Indicators of teaching quality are mostly student satisfaction (LVE=93%, PJ-E=82%, ABS-B=100%), practical relevance of content (LVE=72%, ABS-B=100%) and quality of supervision (PJ-E=86%). The majority use questionnaires that are often self-developed (LVE=63%, PJ=78%). Surveys are mostly summative and either purely online (LVE=44%, PJ-E=81%, ABS-B=40%) or combined with paper (LVE=56%, ABS-B=60%). The majority of results are reported back to the academic deans in writing and\/or as a presentation of results. In addition, faculties conduct results-based interviews with faculty\/departments (LVE=79%, PJ=64%) and make binding goal agreements during these interviews (LVE=52%, PJ-E=50%). The survey results are often used to inform curricular development (LVE=79%, PJ-E=89%, ABS-B=80%). However, changes in the curriculum based on these results are not re-evaluated in all cases (LVE=83%, PJ-E=60%, ABS-B=63%). This study provides an overview of the evaluation practice at German-speaking medical faculties. The number of evaluations carried out in the various areas related to teaching indicates that quality assurance of teaching is taken very seriously by medical faculties. However, there is still need for optimization in some areas: training programs for examiners and PJ supervisors should be offered more frequently to ensure teaching quality. It should also be examined whether the quality indicators used can be supplemented to include, for example, the indicator \"giving appropriate feedback\". Very often, self-developed questionnaires are used whose reliability and validity are questionable. The use of standardized questionnaires would be desirable in order to be able to adequately classify the results. In addition, the evaluation cycle is not closed with re-evaluations in all cases after curricular changes have been implemented. This is especially true of changes initiated by the PJ-E and ABS-B. . ","63":"To provide Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance for assessing inconsistency, imprecision, and other domains for the certainty of evidence about the relative importance of outcomes. We applied the GRADE domains to rate the certainty of evidence in the importance of outcomes to several systematic reviews, iteratively reviewed draft guidance, and consulted GRADE members and other stakeholders for feedback. We describe the rationale for considering the remaining GRADE domains when rating the certainty in a body of evidence for the relative importance of outcomes. As meta-analyses are not common in this context, inconsistency and imprecision assessments are challenging. Furthermore, confusion exists about inconsistency, imprecision, and true variability in the relative importance of outcomes. To clarify this issue, we suggest that the true variability is neither equivalent to inconsistency nor imprecision. Specifically, inconsistency arises from population, intervention, comparison and outcome and methodological elements that should be explored and, if possible, explained. The width of the confidence interval and sample size inform judgments about imprecision. We also provide suggestions on how to detect publication bias and discuss the domains to rate up the certainty. We provide guidance and examples for rating inconsistency, imprecision, and other domains for a body of evidence describing the relative importance of outcomes. ","64":"E-Health is of increasing importance in ensuring demand-oriented health care. In addition to technical feasibility, issues concerning the normative requirements for their use are growing. This paper discusses the ethical, legal and social implications of the use of mixed reality (MR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in the therapy of elderly people with hypertension. It is based on the results of a study conducted as a part of the BMBF project BewARe. In the context of the above-mentioned background, an expert workshop was held with various stakeholders in an early phase of the BewARe project in accordance with the MEESTAR model, in which ethical, social and legal requirements for the development and use of AR\/MR technologies were anticipated. The results of the workshop were subsequently evaluated using content analysis. Content analysis identified eight main challenges for the development and use of AR\/MR technologies in the therapy of elderly people with hypertension: ethical challenges for the decision-making and action capacity of older users (1), stereotyping (2), user-oriented development and implementation (3), data protection (4), support (5), health risks (6), social participation (7), and the need for an integrative approach (8). In line with other studies, it can be shown that orientation towards medical guidelines and behavioral principles is essential to promote acceptance and adherence among end users and to minimize potential health risks. In addition, end users should be more strongly involved in the development process to overcome existing user stereotypes and establish qualification strategies for health-promoting use. Finally, legal and health economic framework conditions must be created to ensure data security and sustainable application concepts. For a successful diffusion of AR\/MR applications in health care, a holistic implementation concept is required which must involve various groups of social actors. In this context, the article discusses eight main challenges that can be understood as current challenges in this process. ","65":"Practical training on the patient is crucial in medical students' last year education - the so-called practical year (PJ) in Germany. Due to difficulties in combining student training with the everyday tasks on ward, it is often criticised as not sufficient for a good preparation for later practical work. The Medical Faculty of the University of Jena therefore designed a project called \"PJplus\". The project includes mentoring and workplace-based assessment by means of Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) in combination with training workshops for supervisors. Three years after the first clinical departments started voluntary participation, the project was evaluated by comparing the experience and the self-assessed learning progress of students from departments participating in this project (PJplus group) with those non-participating (control group). An online questionnaire was sent to all medical students registered at the University of Jena for PJ between March 2016 and April 2017. The students were invited to participate at the end of each section of their PJ within that period. The answers of the PJplus group were compared to the answers of the control group using descriptive and multivariable analysis. 201 students participated in the survey and filled out 257 questionnaires. PJplus was recommended by 80% of the students participating in the project. The PJplus group (n=92) was significantly more satisfied with their PJ and felt significantly better prepared for work than the control group (n=165). The project's elements mentoring and feedback could lead to a better improvement in practical medical skills. However, only 17% of the students managed to conduct the required amount of three Mini-CEX during their PJ rotation and 52% of the students seemed to have lost contact to their mentor or did not have one at all. These difficulties arose due to unfamiliarity with the project, shortage of time and staff on ward or due to lack of motivation among supervisors. Adding mentoring and feedback to the PJ helps to better prepare students for their practical work after finishing studies. With the project presented, it is feasible to integrate these elements in a structured way. Nevertheless, a good control of the elements' implementation and consistent training of the supervising physicians is needed to ensure long-term success. ","66":"Physicians in training are major contributors to the German health care system. After graduation from medical school, physicians in training qualify for a certain specialty. The workload of physicians in training in Germany is so high that they have expressed their need for support. One opportunity to support physicians in training is by delegating tasks to physician assistants (medical assistants qualified by a specific course of study, graduated from universities of applied sciences). However, there is a lack of knowledge about the qualification of physician assistants and the conditions which allow support of physicians in training by physician assistants in Germany. Based on a focused internet search, this paper describes the development of the profession physician assistance in Germany and the currently offered graduation courses including their duration and qualification requirements. Furthermore, we present available recommendations for the content of physician assistants' education and characterize conditions for the support of physicians in training by physician assistants. In Germany, physician assistance has been an academic discipline since 2005, the profession is, however, still quite seldom. Qualification requirements and the duration of education are determined by the universities. The aim is to qualify students for several competencies, which enable physician assistants to perform tasks of physicians under delegation. The conditions for delegation to physicians in training and to physician assistants are quite similar, resulting in partly comparable practice. Major differences relate to the so called \"physician reservation\" or physicians' core area, both of which define tasks that may only be carried out by physicians. Integrating physician assistants into a medical team means supporting the specialists by delegating tasks, thus reducing the workload of all physicians in the team, including physicians in training. Currently, there are no data on and no outcomes of the performance of physician assistants in Germany. In everyday practice, health care delivered by physician assistants and by physicians in training is similar, at least as regards activities and tasks that do not need physician supervision.

Considering an increasing digitalization of the health care sector and in view of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of in-person visits could be reduced by remote monitoring using smart sensor technology. We aim to give an overview of the current international research on the use of smart sensors in prenatal care and its benefits, costs and resource consumption. For this narrative review, PubMed and Science Direct were searched for clinical trials using smart sensors in prenatal care published in English or German language from 1\/2016 to 12\/2020. We included studies which addressed the benefits, costs and resource consumption of this innovative technology. We identified 13 projects using smart sensors in the fields of basic prenatal care, prenatal care for patients with hypertensive disease in pregnancy and prenatal care for women with gestational diabetes. The projects detected positive effects of smart sensors on health care costs and resource consumption and at least equal benefits for the pregnant women. The current COVID-19 pandemic underlines the need for the introduction of smart sensor technology into German prenatal care routine. Remote monitoring could easily reduce the frequency of in-person visits by half. Smart sensor concepts could be approved as digital health applications in Germany. In order to increase user acceptance, there should not be any additional costs for pregnant women and health care professionals using modern health care apps. However, health insurance providers need to invest in smart sensor technology in order to eventually benefit from it. ","69":"The current staffing levels for nursing care in long-term care are too low. There are no empirically verified figures with regard to the exact quantitative and qualitative need for additional staff. In order to develop a scientifically based method that is able to determine the number and qualifications of the nursing staff required for nursing care based on a facility-specific resident structure, a qualification mix model (QMM) was needed that indicates the minimum level of qualification available for the professional provision of nursing interventions. Such a model has not yet existed. Due to a lack of normative or empirically based assignment of interventions and qualification levels, a theoretical approach was chosen for the conception of the QMM using existing qualification frameworks, competence models, legal stipulations, the new assessment tool and nursing studies. By differentiating the complexity of work requirements, a total of 10 intervention classes-some with sub-classes-were formed, each of which was linked to one of five qualification levels. The resulting QMM enables qualifications to be assigned to care-relevant interventions as a normative basis of measuring staffing requirements, and also provides orientation for a more competence-oriented distribution of work and responsibility in inpatient long-term care. Since the model is structurally conservative and based on current (i.e. at the time of development) legal stipulations, it is a minimum standard.","70":"So far there has been little evidence of the extent to which project steps can affect the timing and successful implementation of research projects in general practitioner (GP) practices. Using the example of an intervention study on palliative care, the aim of this article is to report a) how the overall course of the project turned out compared to the original planning, and b) what recommendations can be derived to promote efficient implementation of intervention studies in GP practices. In two workshops each, GP practice teams selected specific measures to improve their palliative care and tested them during a four-month implementation phase. In order to track the progress of the project, the times at which the practice teams reported their participation in the study, the individual project steps and the contacts were documented and descriptively analysed using Microsoft Excel. Due to a high willingness of practice teams to participate in the intervention study, recruitment was completed on time. The overall duration of the project was extended due to an increased workload for the preparation of an unexpectedly high number of selected measures to improve palliative care. Conducting intervention studies in GP practices is promising if practice teams take an active and co-determining role during the entire research process. Research projects can best be implemented if they involve minimal time commitment for the practice teams, and if continuous personal support from the study team is ensured. When planning future intervention studies with a high participatory share of GP practice teams, it is advisable to take into account potential additional work for the preparation and further development of intervention measures. ","71":null,"72":"Active involvement of patients in clinical research is increasingly demanded in Germany. It has great potential to increase the quality and relevance of research and to contribute to patient empowerment. However, patients, researchers and research funders have experienced that the implementation of patient involvement is accompanied by cultural, practical and personal challenges. The aim of this article is to discuss the opportunities and challenges of patient involvement in Germany from the perspective of the stakeholders involved. A patient representative, a clinical researcher and two staff members from research funding management were invited to discuss the opportunities and challenges of patient involvement. Their perspectives were recorded in two written open survey rounds. The answers were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. In the opinion of the stakeholders involved, the increasing involvement of patients in clinical research is an opportunity to promote the practical relevance of research and the implementation of studies, to increase their acceptance by the target group and to improve the uptake of research results in practice. However, the implementation of patient involvement was also perceived as challenging. They described problems with regard to the acquisition and selection of patients, the training of the patients and the specifications and support structures for the implementation of patient involvement. While patient involvement in clinical research offers great potential, the development of appropriate structures and framework conditions for its implementation is still virtually unestablished in Germany. This needs to include, among other things, creating a broader awareness of the potential of patient involvement, developing training programs for patients and researchers, providing sufficient, mainly project-independent resources and ensuring regular evaluations. ","73":"The diagnosis of cancer leads to high levels of emotional distress in many patients. Quality of life is an important therapeutic goal in this context. A quality-of-life guide was implemented in the oncological day clinic (ICT) at the University Hospital of Regensburg (UKR) in order to individually support outpatients, help them with their questions and needs and improve their quality of life. A screening tool is necessary for the structured assessment of quality of life\/needs in the routine of tumor therapy and follow-up. As part of a mixed-methods study, focus groups with health professionals\/patients were organized to specify the needs of cancer patients. On this basis, the literature was searched for questionnaires covering these needs in order to adapt an ICT-specific questionnaire and integrate it with the help of a workflow. A total of 333 individual aspects were brought up by the participants in focus groups on the needs of cancer patients in various phases of treatment\/with various tumor entities. Since none of the questionnaires identified in the literature met our requirements, a new screening tool containing elements from different standardized forms and the results of the focus groups was developed and a new workflow created to integrate the questionnaire into the ICT routine. By interviewing health experts from different areas and patients with different tumor entities, the needs of cancer patients over different stages of the disease and additional possible differences between the cancer entities were identified and recorded. Through the implementation of a quality-of-life guide in the ICT, a structured assessment of the quality of life and an analysis of patient needs can take place with the help of the screening. A workflow was created to integrate screening into routine care. In addition, the questionnaire was designed in such a way that it can be used repeatedly at various points in time. In order to cover important stages in the course of therapy and to determine how patient needs change over the course, patients should be asked to complete the questionnaire several times after specified time intervals. The questionnaire is intended to assess the needs of cancer patients receiving outpatient treatment in a structured manner. Now it needs to be explored how the new screening tool and workflow interact and perform in clinical practice and how they help to improve patients' quality of life. It is also interesting to analyze which patients accept the advice offered by the quality-of-life guide and which needs are expressed most frequently. ","74":"The effective integration of professional nursing staff with university training into care processes is associated internationally with better patient outcomes. In Germany, there is a current lack of reliable figures on graduates and their areas of responsibility. Therefore, the aim of this follow-up survey, designed as a repetition of a previous one, was to ascertain the number of nurses with a Bachelor's or Master's degree involved in direct patient care at university medical centers. In a cross-sectional study, chief nursing officers in university medical centers were asked to quote the number of professional nurses with a university degree (Bachelor, Master, Doctorate). Additional questions focused on their tasks and responsibilities and the measures undertaken to facilitate their integration into the organization. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In total, n=29 valid questionnaires from 35 university medical centers were included in the analysis, resulting in a response rate of 82.85%. For a total of 18 centers, the number of university-qualified nurses had increased by n=786 between 2015 (n=593) and 2018 (n=1,379). The overall percentage of nurses with a university degree working at a university medical center in the study was 3.16% (SD=1.66; min - max=1.09 - 6.69; Q1 - Q3=1.49 - 4.04; 95% CI 2.30 to 3.95). In direct patient care, the quota was 2.11% (SD=1.40; min - max=0.47 - 5.42; Q1 - Q3=0.87 - 3.16; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.76). The main focus of their duties was on standard care and patient education (graduates with a Bachelor's degree), evidence-based nursing practice development (Master's degree) and research activities (doctoral degree). Compared to 2015, the proportion of professional nursing staff with university training has increased but remains at a very low level. These nurses perform relevant clinical tasks and are involved in the development of good practice. However, there is a need for better competence-based differentiation.

We systematically compiled a comprehensive checklist of items linked to relevant resources and tools that guideline developers could consider, without the expectation that every guideline would address each item. We searched data sources, including manuals of international guideline developers, literature on guidelines for guidelines (with a focus on methodology reports from international and national agencies, and professional societies) and recent articles providing systematic guidance. We reviewed these sources in duplicate, extracted items for the checklist using a sensitive approach and developed overarching topics relevant to guidelines. In an iterative process, we reviewed items for duplication and omissions and involved experts in guideline development for revisions and suggestions for items to be added. We developed a checklist with 18 topics and 146 items and a webpage to facilitate its use by guideline developers. The topics and included items cover all stages of the guideline enterprise, from the planning and formulation of guidelines, to their implementation and evaluation. The final checklist includes links to training materials as well as resources with suggested methodology for applying the items. The checklist will serve as a resource for guideline developers. Consideration of items on the checklist will support the development, implementation and evaluation of guidelines. We will use crowdsourcing to revise the checklist and keep it up to date. ","78":"The benefits of patient education in bronchial asthma in terms of reducing hospitalization and incapacity to work are well documented. However, only about a quarter of patients take advantage of training offers. Therefore, this qualitative study with asthma patients examines how to sharpen the motivation to participate in training programs. In order to investigate narrative patterns of chronic illness in asthma patients, we conducted 14 problem-centered narrative (telephone) interviews. The collected data were evaluated in accordance with system-theoretical analysis. This methodology allows for the interviews to be examined for their narrative patterns. The central question was how the patients we interviewed succeeded in constructing normality in the interviews. From the analysis of the interviews, we were able to develop four types of narrative patterns: the chronic illness as a crisis (1), as a passion (2), as an odyssey (3), and as homeostasis (4). Within these forms of narration, the transition from normal to pathological is told in a specific and exemplary manner. The results of our study can be seen as a contribution to the dynamization and differentiation of trajectories of chronic disease. We identified significant differences in the experienced trajectories of the disease. Patients are dealing with chronic disease in different styles, which have individual \"pressure points\" where motivation for adherence is created in the first place. The results show that the patient's knowledge structures unfolding in the narrative patterns should not be viewed as health illiteracy. These typologies of the normal and the pathological do not only provide a key to understanding the life-world (Lebenswelt) of chronically ill people, but also to the question of what motivates chronically ill patients to participate in patient trainings. This in-depth understanding could help us to improve motivational discussions with these patients. ","79":null,"80":"As part of the measures to combat the shortage of general practitioners (GPs) particularly in rural areas, health services planning is becoming increasingly important. This paper shows how the quality of health services planning can be improved by combining population forecasts and physician number forecasts based on the cohort component method. On the basis of already available data (population data and doctors' registers), developments in the levels of care supply can be predicted on a small regional scale. The regional and temporal differentiation allows for early identification of specific needs for action. However, it is important to consider limitations in the interpretation of results. The example of Lower Saxony shows that by 2035 a decline of more than 20% in the number of GPs is expected. At the same time, regions are affected to varying degrees, and even within the more vulnerable rural areas there are heterogeneous developments which require regionally adapted responses. The greater the gap between supply and demand, the more important high-quality planning for efficient allocation of health services becomes. Against this background, care supply projections can serve as a useful building block of evidence-based care planning. ","81":"The gender-specific unequal distribution of paid employment and unpaid household and family work may entail specific implications for women's and men's health and work ability. Medical rehabilitation is provided to maintain or restore work ability and to prevent disability pensioning. However, more than half of the employees who receive disability pension have not utilized any pre-retirement rehabilitation services. The study was conducted to examine associations between strain due to unpaid work and the subjective need for rehabilitation among employees with an increased risk of early retirement due to adverse health conditions. Cross-sectional data from the \"Third German Sociomedical Panel of Employees\" (GSPE-III) were analysed. The sample comprises 1,908 German employees aged between 42 and 56 years. Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for women and men to explore the association between the strain level and the subjective need for rehabilitation. Overall, women reported a higher strain level compared to men. Strain due to housework was not associated with the subjective need for rehabilitation in men and women. However, after adjustment for socio-demographic, work- and health-related characteristics the odds for a subjective need for rehabilitation were three times higher for women (OR=2.9, p &lt;0.001) and two times higher for men (OR=2.0, p=0.027) with a high level of strain due to family work compared to persons with a low strain level. This study analysed the strain of unpaid work in the context of the utilization of medical rehabilitation services. Although women report a gender-specific higher strain due to unpaid work, a high strain level due to family work seems to be an additional and independent factor influencing the subjective need for rehabilitation for both genders equally. To prevent disability pensioning, more consideration should be given to the strain factors associated with unpaid family work when designing and organising interventions to promote access to medical rehabilitation services. ","82":"Examinations are a central element of the medical curriculum: they contribute significantly to the quality assurance of medical training and subsequent medical care. In order to meet the high expectations placed on examinations in terms of content, legal and organizational aspects, continuous quality assurance measures are necessary. The aim of this paper was to record and analyze the quality assurance measures implemented at the medical faculty of Heidelberg. We investigated quality indicators that are relevant to medical examinations - adequate choice of examination formats, blueprint\/validity, reliability and distribution of grades, feedback to students, consequences of examinations - within the faculty examinations in the decentrally organized Heidelberg Curriculum Medicinale (HeiCuMed). In addition, the organizational structures in examination management were examined. For this purpose, interviews were conducted with teaching staff, students and the technical examination administration. The surveys show that the quality indicators in HeiCuMed have already been met in many areas. Optimization work remains to be done concerning the criteria \"adequate choice of examination formats\", \"feedback to students\" as well as the documentation of the examination process and the definition of substitution regulations. Training courses, statistical analysis and accompanying research are essential for establishing additional innovative, practice-oriented examination formats. In order to improve feedback to students, formative assessments should be more intensively integrated into the curriculum. As a measure for structured quality-oriented examination management, it is also helpful to document the examination procedure and the staff assigned to it using templates. Especially with decentralized examination management, the internal coordination of individual departments is of great importance in order to guarantee the quality of examinations. Regular surveys of the parties involved can be of support by collecting best-practice examples and deliver the respective information in handouts encouraging interdisciplinary exchange. ","83":null,"84":null,"85":"In addition to physical, psychological and social effects, economic effects and the associated financial burden of a cancer diagnosis may also gain in importance during prolonged disease progression. Counselling by social services is an important factor in coping with this burden. People employed in social work in oncology were invited to participate in a survey. The survey comprises 16 items on the perception of financial burdens, changes in the relevance of the topic, risk factors and current counselling practice. 81% of the respondents reported that the financial burden arising from a cancer diagnosis is a relevant topic of consultation for at least half of the patients. For 55%, this topic has become more important in recent years, which is due to higher survival rates, an increased number of younger patients, and poorer social security and working conditions. Despite comprehensive insurance coverage, the financial burden of cancer patients has also gained in importance in Germany and must be increasingly taken into account in everyday social service counselling. Due to numerous risk factors and complex reasons, further measures are required to enable the early identification of risk constellations and to improve the situation of those affected. ","86":"Since its introduction in 2007, the quality of care in specialized palliative home care (SAPV) is being measured using the patients' perspective. The perception of beneficial or inhibiting factors on the quality of care from the perspective of care providers received only little attention. To investigate the factors that promote or impede the quality of care in SAPV from the care providers' perspective. Within the framework of a transregional qualitative study, 113 problem-centered interviews were conducted on-site at 10 SAPV providers with their staff as well as their network partners. Grounded theory methodology was used for data curation and analysis. The factors that are perceived as either enhancing or inhibiting the quality of care largely depends on the culture of care of the individual SAPV provider. For participating doctors, nurses and psychosocial professionals, successful performance is associated with good symptom control, participation of relatives and the achievement of certainty of action and of interpretation by means of 'good' decision-making procedures. Problematic performances are linked to a lack of time resulting in restlessness and especially in disagreement between the parties involved in the provision of care as well as to the denial of death. The results of the study show that the perceived strategies, interpretations and evaluation categories, which are associated with good quality of care, are very heterogenous. On the basis of qualitative data, they do, however, follow three typical patterns in terms of cultures of care: proceduralism, holism and dualism. ","87":"The capability concept became a recognized approach to the measurement of quality of life. The ICECAP-O for older people aims to measure capabilities and has recently been used in people with dementia (self-rating) and informal carers (substituted judgement). However, linguistic validation studies have so far been lacking. A cross-sectional cognitive interview study with 15 people with dementia (PwD) and 23 informal carers (ICs) was conducted in Germany and Portugal. Respondents were asked to reveal their understanding of the ICECAP-O and the capability approach as well as the response process. A summarising content analysis was performed. Despite the small sample, our linguistic validation of the German and Portuguese translations detected considerable difficulties or deviations in item comprehension when compared with the intended meaning. In some cases, the item interpretations did not reflect the entire scope of the associated capability dimension, though they were basically correct. Moreover, participants were not able to differentiate some items appropriately from one another, and some misinterpretations occurred. ICs relied mainly on observable behaviour, emotions, or verbal expressions of the PwD. Therefore, ICs found items that ask about the achievement of individual expectations or thoughts about the future difficult to assess. Only very few PwD clearly indicated that they understood the capability approach. ICs in Germany had more difficulties in understanding the capability concept than in ICs Portugal. This linguistic validation study in Germany and Portugal indicates a need for some rephrasing and refinements of the ICECAP-O translated items in both countries to fully encompass some dimensions and avoid misinterpretations. Further studies with larger samples are necessary. Based on our findings, the current German version for ICs' substituted judgement cannot be recommended for this kind of respondents without further advancements. ","88":"The loss of a loved one can have serious health implications. In Germany, however, bereavement care services often provide support regardless of risk or need. A structural framework within which these services are provided systematically and which enables the establishment of qualitative standards throughout Germany has not yet been proposed. A British stepped care model for professionalized bereavement support is actually being discussed internationally. In this paper the British model is adapted to the German context in order to improve nationwide bereavement care services.","89":"Providing patient safety is a central matter in health care requiring complex treatment processes containing many risks. In hospital care, adverse events and patient harm occur frequently. In this context, the safety sciences investigate causes and contributing factors of such events as well as improvement measures. With Safety-I and Safety-II, two complementary approaches come into play. While Safety-I aims to minimize adverse events, the Safety-II approach focuses on understanding the system as a whole whose normal operations can result in both desired and adverse events. With the implementation of the Critical Incident Report System (CIRS), the Safety-I approach (with a focus on errors and correction of negative consequences for patient safety) has become an integral part of the university hospital chosen for this study. The subject matter of this study is to determine if and how the Safety-II approach (focussing on normal operation and the understanding of positive effects for patient safety) is already in use and what measurements can support its integration in daily clinical practice. Through observation, the structures of daily feedback meetings (huddles) from six different hospital departments have been gathered to determine if they can be considered as potential starting points for the implementation of the Safety-II approach. The following expert interviews (n=7) discussed four potentials of the Safety-II approach using the Resilient Assessment Grid (RAG). Finally, a focus group discussed which measurements are central for the integration of the Safety-II approach in daily clinical practice. The study shows that department teams partially follow the Safety-II approach. During team huddles, positive experiences are already exchanged. The expert interviews revealed that the RAG potentials respond, learn and anticipate have already been realized satisfactorily while the potential monitor fell behind. The focus groups regard the Safety-II approach more as a matter of corporate culture and less as a paradigm shift which is needed to be integrated into day-to-day business. Successfully establishing the Safety-II approach requires a focus not just on unwanted occurrences. It is also necessary to focus on the often not directly apparent desired occurrences, which ensure patient safety, and to systematically reflect on them in order to contribute to the development of the organizational culture. Having a better understanding of how the system of daily clinical practice with all its subsystems works will make it possible to proactively counteract unwanted occurrences, for example through regular feedback sessions and debriefings, and to increase patient safety. ","90":null,"91":"After the Digital Healthcare Act (Digitale-Versorgung-Gesetz, DVG) reformed digital health applications' (Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen, DiGAs) access to German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) reimbursement, the discussion concerning necessary evidence requirements has intensified. In the past, different \"alternative study designs\" have been proposed to replace randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the DiGA efficacy and benefit assessments. The present paper examines the suitability of these alternative designs for informing SHI reimbursement decisions. The four alternative study designs primarily discussed in the context of DiGA - \"Continuous Evaluation of Evolving Behavioral Intervention Technologies\" (CEEBIT), \"Multiphase Optimization Strategy\" (MOST), \"Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial\" (SMART) and \"Micro-Randomized Trial\" (MRT) - are characterized and compared on the basis of relevant primary and secondary sources. Subsequently, their suitability for effectiveness and benefit evaluation in the context of SHI reimbursement decisions is discussed. None of the study designs examined aims primarily at conclusively demonstrating efficacy and benefit. Three of the four designs (MOST, SMART, MRT) focus on the development and optimization of interventions. In order to reduce resource requirements, the approaches presented sometimes deviate considerably from the methodological approach in traditional RCTs. This is especially true for their applied statistical error tolerance and their underlying randomization logic. Three of the four concepts (MOST, SMART, MRT) therefore still require RCTs after the development phase in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit of the optimized intervention. The methodological differences of the alternative study designs compared to classical RCTs are accompanied by serious potentials for bias and uncertainties with regard to the identified intervention effects. These may be acceptable in the context of intervention development, but do not appear to be appropriate for use in collective SHI reimbursement decisions. The alternative study designs presented cannot be regarded as a suitable RCT alternative for efficacy and benefit assessments. A pragmatic study design, which continues to meet high methodological standards, and better utilization of real-world data could, in the future, contribute to a compromise between the justified claims to sufficient certainty of results on the one hand and appropriate procedural effort on the other. ","92":"Feedback from patients about aspects of rehabilitation services is increasingly provided online, for example, on specialized hospital comparison websites. Therefore, we examined which kind of online statements from rehabilitation patients published on the leading hospital comparison website \"Klinikbewertungen.de\" (KB) is associated with a positive recommendation of a rehabilitation clinic and which negative aspects are associated with a non-recommendation. For eight indication groups stratified online statements of rehabilitants at KB were evaluated qualitatively using content analysis. The relationship between positive (negative) statements and the (non-) recommendation was examined. Content analysis of 911 experience reports revealed 20 categories. Most often, it was the \"rehabilitation success\" perceived by rehabilitation patients that was significantly associated with a recommendation or a non-recommendation of a hospital, and in five quality assurance (QA) comparison groups the category \"catering\" was associated with a positive or negative recommendation. In all QS comparison groups, there was an association with at least one of the following process-oriented rehabilitation categories: \"rehabilitation measures\", \"rehabilitation plan and rehabilitation goals\" and \/ or \"diagnosis to discharge\". Patient experiences with the perceived \"rehabilitation success\" and with the central processes of rehabilitation are particularly important for the recommendation or non-recommendation of a hospital for patients in all eight indication groups. On the basis of these results, rehabilitation hospitals can specifically identify the aspects of care that are important when patients recommend a hospital for rehabilitation. Online narratives of patients provide additional insights into the reasons for patients' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their rehabilitation. These narratives are available to potential rehabilitation patients as a low-threshold source of information and decision-making aid.

Despite clear evidence of the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccination, vaccination coverage has internationally remained at inadequate levels in recent years. The general practitioner is of central importance for the care of this population. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate various measures in general practice to increase seasonal influenza vaccination rates for the chronically ill, taking into account various international health systems. A systematic literature search was carried out in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and ERIC as well as manually in trial registers and literature lists. Only randomized controlled studies were taken into account. The methodology was defined in advance in a study protocol and published (PROSPERO CRD42018114163). A total of 14 studies within the framework of a national health service (United Kingdom), a state (Australia) and social (Switzerland) health insurance system and a private health care system (USA) were included in our review. Analog patient reminders and automated physician reminders as well as changes in professional roles have led to a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates, but only in the private health care system. In the national health service, none of the interventions we analyzed achieved a significant increase in vaccination rates, although the National Health Service in the United Kingdom documented relatively good basic influenza vaccination rates before the studies were carried out, regardless of the intervention. Good results were achieved in the social and state health insurance systems of Switzerland and Australia by training events for practice teams and SMS reminders. In Germany, training events for medical teams and centrally organized invitation and monitoring systems might improve vaccination rates among the chronically ill. That the federal government pays for the vaccination costs seems to ensure a good basic influenza vaccination coverage for indicated patients in various health systems. ","95":"In order to strengthen health promotion spreading knowledge is as essential as tackling typical problems of its implementation. Both aspects can be adressed by using game-based learning approaches. To this end, we specifically developed a discussion game divided into four phases of play. Our aim is to (1) spread facts, (2) raise awareness of the topic and (3) promote well-informed political opinion-forming at individual as well as group levels. Experience shows that these objectives can be achieved with this game. The game as a whole or parts of it can easily be integrated into university teaching in different ways. In addition, there is major potential for using the game in lifelong learning settings and health promotion projects. In the next step the game will be adapted to enable its implementation in the workplace as a special setting for health promotion.","96":"The present paper explores the introduction of computer-based nursing documentation in a hospital as an example of organizational learning viewed through the lens of organizational education. It provides insights into existing routines and patterns of nursing practice within the organization and seeks, in understanding them, to support organizational learning in hospital settings. The focus of this article is on the analysis of patterns of practice specific to the organization in order to derive the specific need for support of organizational learning for the hospital as an organization. A mixed-methods approach was used to record data, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. Its theoretical focus draws on organizational education in examining organizational learning - a context in which the use of mixed-methods approaches, triangulation and multiperspectivity appeared to be best suited for the task. The results demonstrate that the practical implementation of computer-based nursing documentation calls, alongside technical adaptations, for the consideration of organizational learning, defined as learning undertaken by a social unit comprising a range of groups with distinct interests. The key challenge to organizational learning consists in disrupting long established routines and standardizing new patterns of practice. Success in this endeavor requires time and space for employees' dialog-based, cooperative exploration of the patterns previously in place. The literature on organizational learning provides numerous examples of members of organizations rupturing previous patterns and routines, yet few examples aimed at creating an understanding of existing practices, particularly in relation to hospital settings. This paper fills this lacuna by describing extant practices in such a setting and seeks to support organizational learning processes in this context. ","97":"Former results of the KarMed study revealed a significant decrease in the career satisfaction of female physicians with children in the course of their postgraduate training compared to male physicians with children. Yet, female physicians with children showed the highest scores on satisfaction with life at the fourth year of postgraduate training. The present study evaluates whether the different courses of career satisfaction and life satisfaction of female physicians compared to male physicians are caused by parental status. Data were collected in the course of the KarMed study (2008-2016). A cross-lagged panel design was used to analyze data from T2 to T5. The results indicate an inverse association of career satisfaction with life satisfaction. Women physicians with a low level of career satisfaction were more likely to have children than those with a higher career satisfaction. Furthermore, we found a causal effect of parental status on career satisfaction in male physicians. For female physicians, yet not for male physicians, life satisfaction predicts the parental status. The structural improvement in postgraduate training needs to be adjusted in terms of parental status. Prospective studies should take medical leave during pregnancy as well as parental leave of male medical residents into account.

To prove the effectiveness of appropriate interventions, valid instruments are crucial to measure violence. Between November 2019 and May 2020, a systematic search for studies and instruments was conducted in relevant databases and reference directories assessing violent behaviour by employees towards residents, by residents towards employees and resident-to-resident abuse. 24 instruments were identified. 8 instruments capture staff-to-resident violence, 14 capture resident-to-staff violence, 3 resident-to-resident aggression, and 5 instruments are not exactly attributable to the constellation of violence. No instrument covers all three situations of violence. Four of the instruments used to capture violence by staff cover all forms of personal violence. Validity and reliability data are inadequate. At present, there is no tool that fully depicts violence in resident homes and is suitable for measuring the effectiveness of interventions. There are sufficient tools for the individual constellations of violence that represent all forms of violence. Not all instruments could be procured in their original form, and even available instruments did not always provide information on the development of the instruments and a possible review of their quality.

The number of medical staff with a migration background is also increasing because of the shortage of qualified employees in the healthcare sector. Therefore, the ability to act culturally sensitive is essential. A training course for employees caring for chronically ill elderly patients with a migration background was developed, tested and evaluated. The training was developed on the basis of interviews with experts and research literature and took place over half a day. It was then tested in a pilot study in three hospitals (geriatric, orthopaedic, cardiologic clinics) and evaluated with respect to content and implementation using both guided interviews, which were subjected to content analysis, and a questionnaire. The training was feasible and well received by the participants, and a high demand for interventions on cultural sensitivity could be derived from the interviews. Improvements were achieved on the dimensions of self-reflection (recognizing one's own and others' cultural imprint), communication with patients and their relatives, and teamwork. The participants asked for a more extensive and broader training. A multiplier training should be considered in order to implement the contents nationwide and sustainably in clinics. A randomized controlled design is necessary to verify the assumed effects.

","105":"With the introduction of the Therapy Allergens Ordinance (TAV) the previously unapproved therapeutic allergens on the existing market need to be checked for their risk-benefit ratio as a basic prerequisite for approval under pharmaceutical law. This process is criticized because it can lead to long transition periods so that patients will probably be treated for two decades with preparations whose effectiveness has not yet been proven and may never be proven. The aim of this work is to list the critical preparations for which no publicly accessible study activity has been recorded since the beginning of the TAV in 2008. For this purpose, the European Clinical Trials Register (clinicaltrialsregister.eu) and the American study register (ClinicalTrials.gov) are systematically searched. The following hypothesis, consistent with the TAV, will be checked: \"In the past years, study programs were carried out for the preparations in the process of the TAV - the majority of these preparations are about to be approved by PEI\". The hypothesis is refuted with the findings of this work. In fact, no preparation can currently be identified that is about to be TAV approved. 61 preparations are currently in the TAV process; only two preparations have already passed this successfully. If the total of 63 (61+2) preparations are combined in the homologous groups - trees, grasses, mites and mixtures -, there are 33 preparations that can be classified as follows: For the 33 preparations in the TAV process, 36 studies (phase II and III) that may potentially be relevant for TAV were found as part of the screening. For 15 of these studies the results have duly been entered in the European study register. The results of another 13 studies have not been stored in the study register although they are marked as completed. No information has been stored in the European study register for four studies so that the status of these studies remains unclear. Four studies have not yet been completed. Responsible doctors can make recommendations for the prescription of a certain SIT preparation only if there is adequate evidence of its effectiveness. For preparations that have not yet started studies more than ten years after the introduction of the TAV, it is very doubtful whether approval can still be obtained or whether it is even being sought. For the three main inhaled allergens (grasses, trees and mites) there is already a selection of approved, evidence-based and effective alternatives for both subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual (SLIT) application from various manufacturers on the market.

Care and Case Managers (CCMs) can help to coordinate and structure outpatient care for these patient groups. This approach will be realized in the project RubiN (\"Continuous Care in Regional Networks\"), which is funded by the Federal Joint Committee. The aim of the present qualitative study was to explore the motivation to work as a CCM. As part of the qualitative study framework, semi-structured interviews with CCMs were conducted as part of a joint kick-off event. The interviews were focused on the reasons and motivation for participating in the RubiN project. The transcribed interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Eight of 20 CCMs agreed to take part in the interviews. One of the main motivations for taking part in RubiN was to shift away from working conditions that were perceived as stressful and towards an activity that was experienced as appreciative. The CCMs felt that their professional expertise was recognized by other service providers, and that appreciation of their role increased through their active involvement in the care of geriatric patients. Care and Case Management as a practical application with extensive coordination services for geriatric patients may contribute to an increase in appreciation and recognition through establishing a separate area of responsibility and scope as well as working in an interdisciplinary team.

In healthcare, Quality of care is not linear but multi-dimensional, with myriad challenges. The aim of the study was to establish the organizational pedestal for quality of care and predominant quality of care dimension. This study was approved by the IRB of our Institution. This study empirically tested the quality of care climate types in NABH accredited and non-accredited hospitals using quantitative method with a sample of 410 healthcare managers from accredited and non-accredited hospitals in South India. The results indicate that among the dimensions of quality of care climate, competitive advantage was perceived the lowest with a mean rating of 73.14 among the rest. Value-Stream was perceived as the highest quality of care climate with a mean of 83.12. The results indicate that patient centered value-stream is the predominant dimension of quality of care climate as perceived by the managers and value stream is the predominated determinant of patient centered decisions. The results designate a promising support for patient centered quality of care approach for health care excellence with a balance on value stream mapping. ","110":"","111":"When addressing the variable \"gender\" in health research designs, a distinction is made between biological (\"sex\") and sociocultural or psychosocial aspects (\"gender\"). In health research, it is important to avoid systematic errors that may result when gender aspects are inappropriately or not sufficiently addressed (so-called gender bias). A gender bias occurs, for instance, when the presence of gender differences is assumed without empirical evidence or when research data that was generated from samples of male participants is automatically applied to women. Funding institutions can create incentives for researchers to integrate gender-sensitive analyses into their research projects and to consider the potential influence of the \"gender\" variable. The aim of this study was to explore which explicit requirements concerning gender aspects applicants to German funding institutions in the various health sectors need to meet in their research designs. From March to June 2019, we researched funding institutions in the health sector at the German federal level. We examined the funding guidelines of each identified institution in light of their requirements for applicants to take gender aspects into consideration in their research. We explored this in a two-step procedure (online document search and e-mail contact). We examined 18 institutions. Information on the requirements for applicants to address gender aspects in their research projects was identified for four institutions: the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the German Federal Ministry of Health, the German Research Foundation, and the Volkswagen Stiftung. In particular, the consideration of gender aspects for planned research projects was used as an evaluation criterion in the institutions' application guidelines available online. If considered relevant for a planned research project, the consideration of gender aspects affects project planning, implementation and evaluation of results. Eight institutions had no such requirements. For the remaining six institutions, we were not able to find any such information, neither by document research nor through e-mail contact. Only a few funding institutions in the health sector have so far included requirements regarding the consideration of the \"gender\" variable in health research in their application guidelines. Furthermore, the funding institutions' requirements are somewhat heterogeneous and need standardization. Funding institutions in the health sector could identify research needs and set new research priorities in order to expand the empirical evidence on gender aspects in the various health sectors and to increase the social benefit of the scientific results obtained. In this way, applicants can be sensitized and encouraged to consider gender aspects in their research projects and, if necessary, to conduct them in a gender-differentiated manner.

As these requirements can only be insufficiently fulfilled by systematic reviews due to the high amount of time required, abbreviated evidence syntheses in the form of rapid reviews are becoming increasingly popular. This commentary aims to enhance methodological and methodical discussions and research about abbreviated evidence syntheses. A selective literature search and evaluation focussing on research dealing with rapid reviews. In rapid reviews, a wide variety of methods can be used to speed up the process of literature search and evaluation, while at the same time maintaining the principles of methodological quality and transparent reporting. But do rapid reviews currently keep what they promise? We discuss the increasing trend towards rapid reviews, giving the currently available evidence on the topic some critical reflection. Following this discussion, we will finally derive demands that go beyond the topic of rapid reviews alone. ","119":"Patient and public participation in health research is of increasing social importance. The participation of citizens (patients, their next or interested parties) is not yet structurally anchored in Germany. This manuscript aims to present and to discuss first experiences with patient and public involvement in two palliative care centers. In two centers, a general patient and public involvement committee (Erlangen) and a project-associated patient and public involvement group (Munich) were founded. Strategies for recruitment of potential members (public lectures, personal contact, information on the website, leaflets) were developed and applied. Sociodemographic data and motivations were assessed using survey and personal communication. 18 months after foundation citizens were asked to give feedback on participation during personal meetings. The 20 members of the PPI committee (14 female) are between 52 and 86 years old in Erlangen. The PPI group in Munich has 7 members (5 female). Motivations to contribute are, for example, gratefulness for the care of a relative or the wish to share occupational competencies for a good purpose. Voluntary participation took place by consulting the research teams. Consultation was, among others, performed in joint sessions with brainstorming, moderated group discussions, piloting and commenting interview guides, texts or website content. Participation improved the quality of study material and data assessment instruments. Citizens appreciated that they were able to gain new information and meet people from different fields. They partly wished there was a more detailed preparation and debriefing after joint meetings. The research teams did not quantify the considerable staff and time expenses. The recruitment strategies used have proved successful, and the experiences so far indicate a positive impact of PPI on research in the field of palliative care. Research is needed to evaluate the resources required and the effect of PPI in palliative care. On a structural level, discussion of PPI as one specification of voluntary engagement in palliative care, centralized provision of general information on PPI in palliative care and the possibilities of exchange between PPI groups and researchers of different facilities, should take place. There is a need for networking and exchange among researchers and citizens of different project groups with experience in PPI. An institutionalized provision of expertise would pave the way for PPI in palliative research. ","120":"Even though the importance of nurses' participation in the process of technology development is frequently stressed by stakeholders, participation has been described as negligible and limited by nurses' abilities to identify and communicate their needs and ideas for application scenarios or the improvement of digital nursing technologies (DNT) in everyday care practice. Prior research often uses hypothetical scenarios or laboratory settings with little real-world relevance, and the number of studies investigating needs for technology development, application scenarios or requested technologies from the perspective of nurses with experience in technology use is exceedingly small. Against this background, this study aims to investigate needs, application scenarios and perspectives of nurses with practical experience in real-world DNT application in a range of different care settings. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design including an online survey (QUANT) and focus group (FG) discussions (qual) was used to explore nurses' perspectives and experiences. A convenience sample of participants was accessed via 19,000 e-mail contacts of directors of nursing (DONs) in care facilities and hospitals throughout Germany. Preliminary results of the online survey were discussed and elaborated in depth in three FGs. Quantitative results of the online survey were included in the development of the interview guideline for and data collection from the FGs. Descriptive, setting-specific analysis was conducted for quantitative data, and qualitative data was analysed by identifying key aspects. A total of 1,335 participants took part in the online survey, most of whom worked in ambulatory care institutions and held management positions such as DON or team leader. There were 14 FG participants. Ninety-five per cent of the participants of the online survey reported having experience in the use of DNT, predominantly with information and communication technologies (ICT). Overall, DNT were deemed to make work easier, and participants concurred on other positive effects such as increased efficiency or saved time and improved quality of care. Negative effects or concerns were reported less frequently. Reasons for non-adoption included technology-related (e.g. usability, functionality) and non-technology-related (e.g. competencies and context factors) issues, and facilitators for adoption were discussed in the FGs. Key aspects of application scenarios were enhanced technological support of direct nursing care tasks to reduce physical burden and mental stressors. Specifically, participants of the FGs expressed their wish for participative development and a general openness for nurses to be included in the development and testing of digital technologies. Although efforts in development, research and theory-building have been increasing over recent years, DNT that go beyond more traditional or common applications within the ICT category (such as electronic nursing records or process planning) are rare. There are already technologies available for many of the expressed needs for which, however, adoption fails or does not happen. The reported barriers and facilitators indicate issues that should be taken into account when developing DNT for application in nursing practice. The study reveals a distinct need for information, counselling, facilitation and organizational development, and brings to light broad opportunities for the collaborative development of guided DNT implementation and evaluation processes. Future development and research activities should preferably be conducted by interdisciplinary research groups. ","121":"COVID-19 had an impact on the whole range of worldwide medical services. Due to the high risk of in-hospital transmission and disproportionate perioperative rates of morbidity and mortality in occult COVID-19 patients surgeons were faced with the challenging triage of surgeries into emergency, urgent and elective. The present study investigates postponed elective surgery and its impact on the medical condition of patients in two high-volume departments of general, visceral, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery. Operations that have been postponed due to COVID-19 were recorded in the Departments of General-, Visceral-, Thoracic- and Vascular Surgery at the University Hospitals of Leipzig and Greifs-wald. Data was analysed descriptively concerning patient outcomes as well as emergency admissions and surgeries. In the Leipzig and Greifswald University Hospitals 89 and 92 elective surgeries were postponed, respectively. No patient needed an extension of surgical procedure when eventually operated. One patient with extensive obesity died early during the suspension period due to cardiac complications. Four patients needed emergency admission to hospital one of whom required urgent surgery. In neither of the two surgical departments did a patient acquire a nosocomial infection with COVID-19. While medical consequences of COVID-19 seem multidimensional and severe, our data indicate that the short-term postponement of elective surgery did not cause an unproportional increase of morbidity and mortality. Although the restrictions may have been fear-driven, given no confirmed cases and thus no concrete risk of infection, the early and well-coordinated action may have provided protection from uncontrolled interruption of medical services by loss of medical workforce or capacity. Well-organized and early suspension of elective surgery had no disproportionate impact on patient outcomes while averting nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. ","122":"Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapies are becoming increasingly more important in the treatment of malignant diseases. Monitoring with focus on adherence, side effects and interactions poses new challenges for medical care. The role and capabilities of family doctors in the care of TKI patients are yet unclear and should be uncovered in a nationwide survey. From April to July 2016, 3,000 family doctors in Germany were asked to complete a written questionnaire regarding their capabilities for co-supervision of TKI patients. The response rate was 18% (n=553). The peak age was between 50 and 60 years. 81% were specialists in general medicine, 14% specialists in internal medicine and 5% general practitioners. 98% cared for no or less than 10 TKI patients per quarter. Knowledge of side effects and interaction potential of TKIs was low in over 90%. 83% preferred monitoring by the treating oncologist and 93% felt uncertain about treatment monitoring. The control of adherence was of little importance in 66%. The number of treated TKI patients had a significant impact on knowledge and opportunities for treatment monitoring. There was a significant correlation between knowledge about TKIs and confidence in treatment monitoring. In general, younger doctors tended to be more confident in treatment monitoring, and specialists in internal medicine tended to have more knowledge than specialists in general medicine general practitioners and general practitioners. Currently, the low number of TKI patients, little knowledge about TKI, and the desire for specialist care are limiting the possibilities of co-caring for TKI patients by family doctors. Although family doctors are generally motivated to care for tumor patients, routine treatment controls of TKI patients conducted by family doctors seem hardly possible at the moment and should currently remain with the specialist. ","123":"In 2017, a national recommendation on multidrug-resistant bacterial microorganisms (MDRO) in end-of-life care was published. In order to monitor the implementation in a hospital-based palliative care unit, a dedicated multidisciplinary working group on MDRO was established. It developed a standard operating procedure and a documentation template (checklist). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the implementation status after one year. A mixed-methods approach was selected. The status of implementation was identified through a survey among staff members. A retrospective routine data analysis was performed. A focus group discussion with members of the working group focused on previous steps, factors conducive to implementation and on remaining problems. Almost all (18 out of 20) participants (20 out of 29 eligible staff members) knew the national recommendations. Twelve out of 27 recommendations had a high degree of implementation after one year, another 13 recommendations were seen as at least partly integrated into daily routine. For two recommendations the degree of implementation was rated low: (i) \"Taking into account any additional time constraint imposed by protection and isolation measures when planning for personnel and bed occupancy\", and (ii) \"Facilitating the patient's ability to distinguish and recognize team members and family caregivers\". Working group members reported improvements since the implementation, whilst reporting some uncertainty prevailing among both staff members and visitors. Inhibitory factors were said to include the complexity of the standard operating procedure, inadequate usage and poor usability of the checklist. Behavioural and cognitive barriers such as anxieties related to transmission and the sense of security caused by the routine use of protective clothing were considered to be strong. Improving the checklist and the standard operating procedure as well as anchoring procedures in daily routine were considered to be the next important steps. The implementation of recommendations is an iterative process and requires the ongoing development of appropriate measures for implementation in the respective institution. A multidisciplinary working group with monitoring tasks is an advantage. ","124":"General practitioners (GPs) are the first point of contact and they coordinate the care for multimorbid patients. This article discusses possible solutions for GPs' needs and wishes regarding the support for non-medical issues, in particular social and legal tasks as well as the cooperation with already existing institutions. In the third study phase of a mixed-methods approach, two focus groups with eleven GPs from Berlin were carried out. The project is part of the NAVICARE project, funded by the federal Ministry of Education and Research. The focus groups were analyzed using the framework analysis. GPs caring for multimorbid patients are often faced with non-medical patient needs and social consultation issues. They would like to receive support in these areas and want more cooperative care structures. They are largely unaware of existing offers by social institutions in their city districts. The designation of a fixed contact person in social institutions could improve communication and thus enable low-threshold access. The GPs agree that there is a need for support with social and legal matters in general practice. The focus groups discussed already existing offers that GPs could use more frequently and how a cooperation with providers of social care could succeed. GPs in Berlin think that support and relief measures, in particular in the form of cooperation with institutions in the district that provide social and legal support, are both desirable and conceivable. ","125":"In Switzerland a legal prohibition of volume-based bonus agreements has been initiated which is expected to take force at the beginning of 2021. Bonus agreements for physicians pose a risk to unbiased indication, possibly leading to over-, under- and misuse of medical care. In order to investigate physicians' perceptions of bonus agreements and reflect on them from an ethical point of view, we conducted a qualitative interview study with Swiss senior physicians. The remuneration system is complex and diverse so that the interviewed physicians were not always able to explain in detail to which targets the variable components of their salary were linked. Study participants were aware of their ethical responsibility regarding non-biased indication and cost-effective medicine. All rejected volume-based bonus agreements. Target agreements should generally have a clear, comprehensible function and always contain a component related to the quality of care delivered. Critical attention should go beyond a narrow focus on volume-based bonus agreements to include other volume-oriented target agreements and reimbursement systems that have the potential to negatively affect patient care.","126":null,"127":"About 35,000 people in Germany suffered from stroke-related aphasia in 2019. One of the most frequent manifestations of aphasia are word finding disorders. In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the temporary approval of video therapy enables the maintenance of speech therapy treatment. This leads to the necessity to investigate the effectiveness of screen-to-screen therapy via a video conferencing system compared to conventional face-to-face therapy of adult aphasia patients. For this scoping review, a literature search in the databases Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science was conducted for the period February 2010 to 2020. We included German- and English-language studies comparing the effectiveness of a classic face-to-face therapy with a screen-to-screen therapy of adults with aphasia. The studies were selected using the PRISMA flowchart. A total of five studies were identified. Both face-to-face therapy and screen-to-screen therapy showed significant improvements in naming performance in an Italian crossover study, a Canadian randomized study and a quasi-randomized study conducted in the UK. No improvements were found for both forms of intervention in an Israeli crossover study. In a German comparative study, significant improvements in naming performance were found for face-to-face therapy, but the results did not differ significantly from the screen-to-screen therapy intervention group. In all included studies, screen-to-screen therapy and face-to-face therapy had a comparable effectiveness on naming performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a screen-to-screen therapy under everyday conditions. However, it is possible that this form of therapy cannot always be implemented. Barriers to screen-to-screen therapy can be the use of technologies and restrictions in the visual field due to a neglect. One limitation of the scoping review was that only the naming performance was considered as an outcome, another was the small number of studies included. For many patients screen-to-screen therapy is currently the only possibility to receive speech therapy treatment. Therefore it is a positive aspect that screen-to-screen therapy is as effective as face-to-face therapy. Screen-to-screen therapy can provide expanded access to health care and professional expertise in health services. In this way, speech therapy care during the COVID-19 pandemic can be largely maintained. Further research is needed on evidence-based treatment methods and user-oriented apps for video therapy. ","128":"Considering the amount of national and international scientific evidence regarding the use of anticoagulants in the periprocedural prevention of thromboembolism, the decision-making process when prescribing anticoagulants is complex. Due to frequent prescriptions for inpatients, the topic is of high significance. This decision-making process in our hospital is the main focus of the study. In a standardised survey, a target group of physicians was asked about their decision-making process with regard to the prescription of anticoagulants in the periprocedural period. For this study a questionnaire was developed consisting of 12 survey questions. Data from 130 participants was collected and analysed. Generally, there was a high level of agreement on the importance of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Significant differences exist between medical specialities. A gap between scientific evidence and clinical practice among the respondents could be identified. The decision-making process when prescribing anticoagulants was not documented by the physicians. A combined approach consisting of structured documentation with electronic decision support in combination with standardised treatment methods and educational measures can be a useful solution. ","129":"To give an overview of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) programs in routine cancer care that allow for both major purposes of PROM assessment: 1) monitoring of an individual patient's outcome to assist treatment decision making, and 2) use in quality improvement initiatives including the benchmarking of providers. We synthesize information on program elements like the mode of assessment and questionnaire used, as well as information relevant for adaptation following a PDCA scheme. We carried out a systematic literature research in the databases PubMed and EMBASE using MeSH terms and keywords related to PROM assessment in routine cancer care to identify eligible studies published between January 2003 and November 2018 (PROSPERO reg. no. CRD42019141402). We included studies in which PROM assessment programs had been reported as being implemented in clinical practice as well as collected multicentrically with at least one site in Europe and in which PROMs had been collected before and at least once after intervention. Study authors were queried to verify or correct the program elements extracted and merged during the review. Study quality assessment was not done, since it is not expedient for the objective of this review. Overall, 5,545 unique references were identified, 5,416 of which were excluded after the screening of titles and abstracts. Of the 29 references assessed, five programs were identified and included in the synthesis. The programs included those from Germany, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, and patients with different cancer types and tumor stages, which used paper-based or purely electronic PROM assessment. Few reports have so far been published on PROM programs that allow for both the monitoring of an individual patient's outcome and use in quality improvement initiatives. The studies revealed relevant information on existing PROM programs and gave valuable insight into issues that need to be considered when setting up such an infrastructure. Some critical issues, however, were hardly addressed, among them costs, staff resources and methods of reporting and responding.

For breast surgery, these quality indicators are mainly based on recommendations of the German clinical guideline for screening, diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of breast cancer. The 2018 update of this guideline includes a new chapter on breast cancer in men. The aim of this analysis is to examine whether male and female patients with breast cancer are treated equally where appropriate and recommended by the clinical guideline, as measured by the quality indicators. Data of ten quality assurance indicators were analysed, for each indicator separately, stratified by sex and pooled over a 5-year period to gain statistical power. This dataset constitutes the largest data pool of men with surgical interventions for breast neoplasm in Germany. Indicator results were then compared between male and female cases. Additional subgroup analyses were carried out for two quality indicators with substantial outcome difference between male and female cases in order to detect possible differences in the treatment of breast cancer between different medical departments. The database of the ten quality assurance indicators comprised 551,221 patients (546,324 females and 4,897 males) between 2014 and 2018. Pooled data of nine quality indicators (QIs) showed statistically significant outcome differences between male and female cases. In spite of pooling, the male sample size of four QIs was too small to allow for statistically reliable comparisons between male and female patients. Outcome differences in the remaining five QIs may, on the one hand, be explained by anatomical differences and different extent of the surgery, and on the other hand they confirm international data for lower HER2-positivity rates in male breast cancer patients. However, two process indicators, aiming at pretherapeutic biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in invasive breast cancer recommended by the clinical guideline, show substantial differences of more than 6 percentage points between the sexes: although recommended by the clinical guideline, both procedures are carried out less often in male cases. Further analysis regarding the medical departments that recorded the treatment revealed that risk for non-adherence to guideline recommendation was high if treatment took place in non-gynaecological departments. Compared to gynaecological departments, procedures such as pretherapeutic biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were carried out less frequently if cases were documented to be handled by surgery or plastic surgery departments. Analysis of breast surgery quality indicators reveals a lower level of adherence to guideline recommendations for men with breast cancer compared to women in some aspects of the guideline, as measured by statutory quality indicators in breast surgery. Male breast cancer might be a rare disease, but nevertheless, awareness-rising is needed in diagnostics, treatment and interdisciplinarity in order to avoid inequality between the sexes. ","137":null,"138":"Patient involvement in health research is an integral part of health care in many countries. It promotes the relevance and quality of research and increases the meaningfulness of research results. Meanwhile, the value of patient involvement has also been recognised in Germany. The lack of a common understanding of patient involvement and appropriate methods make implementation difficult. In Germany, patients are still rarely involved in the planning and conduct of health research. Vulnerable patient groups such as the elderly and the very old are considered particularly challenging for researchers in active patient involvement due to their special needs, which is why they are often neglected. Especially nursing home residents suffer from a variety of health impairments which are accompanied by a high number of prescription drugs and adverse events and can therefore make patient involvement more difficult. The present project aims to test the method of patient advisory boards for the involvement of nursing home residents. Using the design of a clinical trial to optimise medication for nursing home residents as a case study, we will assess the feasibility of the method for this target group. We will also install a patient advocate as moderator of the advisory board. The study plan is described in the present study protocol. Two patient advisory boards with nursing home residents will be established. With a patient advocate acting as moderator, the essential elements of a clinical trial to optimise medication will be discussed and passed on to the study planning team via the patient advocate. The overall topic of the clinical trial is the optimisation of medication in cardiovascular disease. The nursing home residents are informed about the contents and ideas of the study to be planned and the interests of the researchers, respectively, and will discuss the proposals of the study planning team. Nursing home residents', the patient advocate's and the researchers' expectations and experiences will be examined in individual interviews. The study will provide a potentially suitable method to involve nursing home residents in the research process. The jointly developed study design will be incorporated into a new project proposal. The results will be used to inform the development of a German handbook on active public and patient involvement. ","139":null,"140":"Global warming is a fundamental threat to human civilization. Urgent and comprehensive actions are needed to achieve the Paris Climate Convention goals. This work aims to provide a systematic overview of global warming and its linkages to public healthcare. In a narrative review, we outline causes, consequences, and necessary measures regarding global warming and the implications for public healthcare. Closely linked to our resource behaviours and economic systems, greenhouse gas emissions play a central role in global warming. We are seeing an increase in temperature records and heat waves as well as droughts with crop losses, rising sea levels and, ultimately, effects on the human body and mind. Despite these threats, there is a gap between awareness and action. Measures are urgently needed at a political, innovative, economic and individual level. As a significant greenhouse gas emitter, the public health sector bears responsibility. Healthcare professionals are directly confronted with the impact of global warming through the treatment of people suffering from its effects; they can serve as role models in tackling it. Necessary changes in life (style) do not only involve a more conscious use of our resources, but also hold the chance of creating a new form of social solidarity. Healthcare institutions and professionals play a significant role as emitters, practitioners, and role models in global warming. ","141":"The creation of control groups in the evaluation of statutory health insurances is a key issue. Randomization represents both an ethical and a legal problem with legally guaranteed services. Matching procedures are relevant alternatives in the construction of control groups. Matchings are mostly based on secondary data from statutory health insurances (for example age, gender, cost of illness, days of incapacity to work). In this study, we examined whether matching based on secondary data alone can cause selection bias. We used data from three large prevention studies and applied sensitivity analyses to compare the results of propensity score matchings used to create control groups on the basis of secondary data, with those obtained on the basis of both primary and secondary data. Analysis of covariance was used to investigate the impact of potential selection bias on cost effects. Matchings based on secondary data alone lead to control groups with similar characteristics captured by secondary data. However, the control group participants are significantly healthier (they have, for example, lower levels of pain, lower levels of psychological stress, a higher degree of quality of life) than the patients in intervention groups. This selection bias would lead to a systematic underestimation of the cost reduction produced by preventive interventions. Prevention course participants seem to have characteristics that differ from the average population (higher health orientation level, preference for prevention over medical treatment services, etc.) and cannot be captured by secondary data; therefore, matchings based on secondary data alone cause selection bias. Including both primary and secondary data reduces the risk of selection bias in matching procedures for prevention studies. The E-value can be used to evaluate the robustness of results with regard to selection bias. ","142":null,"143":"Care-dependent community dwelling people are vulnerable to deficits in medical care provided by the German statutory health insurance (GKV). Quality of care indicators (QIs) contribute to the identification of deficits and of potential for the optimization of care. To investigate the discriminatory ability of QIs in a population of elderly people with and without care dependency and different age structures, insights into the feasibility of such QIs based on health claims data are of interest. The aim of this study is an explorative approach to health claims based QIs for the ambulatory medical care of care-dependent elderly which can be used to optimize health care processes. This cross-sectional study used anonymised health claims data of a sample of statutory health insurance members from all German federal states of the year 2016. The sample consisted of 5,934,986 insured persons aged 65 years or older, who were community dwelling with (n = 785,135) or without care-dependency (n = 4,799,369) or who were residents of a nursing home (n = 350,482). 47 QIs focusing on ambulatory care-sensitive conditions such as, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2 and depression were calculated on a quarterly basis and are reported descriptively as the arithmetic mean of four quarters stratified by place of residence and age group. The majority of QI values vary between the observed groups with an overarching trend to the disadvantage of older individuals. Even though care-dependent insured persons show higher prevalence rates of the underlying diagnoses of the QIs (except for asthma diagnoses), they score more detrimental QI values than those without care-dependency. This finding holds true after stratification by age group. This study describes differences in the quality of medical care for elderly people. Considering prior empirical evidence of deficits in medical care, factors that act as barriers or facilitators of guideline-oriented medical care need to be investigated. The contribution of patients' preferences, access to medical care or prioritisation by medical and nursing care providers when initiating diagnostic or therapeutic procedures remains unclear. Methodical limitations of this study notably derive from the selection process of the observed groups using two stratification variables. For the further development of QIs other influencing factors on both an individual and a population-related level as well as the providers' ability to influence these factors need to be taken into account and incorporated in a risk-adjusted description of QIs. Measurement of ambulatory medical care of an elderly population based on health claims data is feasible and shows differences in care processes of older and care-dependent individuals if place of residency and level of care-dependency are considered. Further development of the QIs explored should incorporate a thorough methodical foundation, particularly with regard to risk adjustment. In addition, the contribution of individual and contextual factors on QIs remains to be examined with a view to the community-dwelling care-dependent elderly and their ongoing residency in this setting. ","144":"Internationally, Advanced Practice Nurses (APN) are associated with improvements when measuring results in health care. Advanced Nursing Practice (ANP) refers to an extended nursing care with the aim of meeting the changing conditions in health care systems by providing evidence-based practice. APN outcomes are the endpoints of nursing interventions based on clinical experience, scientific knowledge, and practical skills. Due to the challenges in health care systems, Advanced Practice Nurses have become well established internationally in various fields. In Austria, the first nurses are currently trained in Advanced Nursing Practice on a master's level according to the International Council of Nurses core curriculum (ICN). However, national implementation and evaluation strategies are still missing. The aim of this short report is (i) to show the current situation of APNs in Austria, and (ii) to underline the importance of measuring APN outcomes in implementing this role for future developments in health care. A literature search was conducted in CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library in the period 09\/2019 to 01\/2020. With the help of APNs and coordinated, holistic, patient-centered care, a higher quality of care for different patient groups is clearly evident. The cost-effectiveness and the positive experience of both patients and nursing staff have been demonstrated in international studies. In particular, the guidance and educational skills of APNs have been shown to improve health outcomes in vulnerable population groups. With regard to the implementation of APNs in the health care system, more focus is needed on the measurement of outcomes in nursing research. Outcome research has been shown to help identify the unique effect of APNs in patient care and to highlight the health-related improvements through Advanced Nursing Practice for health policy and further developments in the health care system.

The objective of this research was to collect data from general practices based on their experiences in training these particular groups of patients. In a quantitative cross-sectional study design, 795 general practices throughout Germany with the additional designation of diabetology were invited via e-mail to participate in a fully structured, standardised online survey. An exploratory data analysis was performed using the statistics software IBM SPSS. Out of 146 participating practices (response rate 18%), 66 (45%) estimated the proportion of patients with migration background in their practice to be more than 20%. Approximately 76% of the practices providing diabetes training (n=119) trained patients of Turkish origin. Forty six percent of these practices estimated the ratio of patients of Turkish origin with low literacy skills to be 10 to 50%. Less than 36% of the practices were aware of suitable training programmes for this target group. Existing programmes were modified to special needs and new materials creatively developed. Additional culturally sensitive and visually enriched materials are needed. Forty two percent of the interviewed practices reported billing difficulties concerning frequently needed individual trainings.

There is a lack of evaluated materials that are adapted to the users' cultural background and level of education. In the face of a significantly changed immigration structure, information and materials as well as interpreters for additional languages are increasingly required. Further development of evidence-based, multi-lingual, image-based, culturally sensitive and educationally diverse materials and training units and their scientific evaluation is needed.

This creates a risk that patients' needs and interests are not reflected in clinical research. The aim of the present paper is to give an introduction to patient involvement in clinical research. It is based on an exploratory literature research and our own experiences with patient involvement. By actively involving patients in the design, conduct and translation of clinical trials, research and healthcare can be better tailored to meet the patients' needs. Patient involvement has the potential to enhance the quality and relevance of research, support patient empowerment and contribute to the democratisation of research processes. There are different methods to involve patients in research, which are often differentiated as consultation, cooperation and user-led research. Methods, time of involvement and persons to be involved should be chosen to fit the aims of the involvement. While cultural, practical and personal barriers could hinder patient involvement, there are several strategies that enable effective involvement: defining the aims of the involvement, clarifying motivation and expectations as well as roles and the form of cooperation, offering training, planning sufficient resources, involving patients from the start and communicating the benefits of involvement.","149":"The German Rheumatism League (\"Deutsche Rheuma-Liga\") is the largest patient organisation in Germany, with about 300,000 members. In the sense of participatory research, the Deutsche Rheuma-Liga involves trained patient representatives in research projects funded by either the Deutsche Rheuma-Liga or other organisations. In order to invigorate the principle of participatory research in the field of rheumatology in Germany various measures have been undertaken: the principle of participatory research has been implemented as obligatory in the funding guidelines of the German Rheumatism League. A training course for German-speaking patients was created, and reference cards and an explanatory brochure were provided. In a letter campaign, about 70 universities and hospitals with rheumatology departments were contacted and informed about the benefits of participatory research. Since 2014, three training courses with 21 participants have been conducted. The trained patient representatives have participated in more than 30 projects up to the end of 2019. The overall experience of the patient representatives actively involved in research projects was mainly positive, and participatory research was perceived as being interesting and enriching. The implementation of participatory research in the German Rheumatism League can be described as successful. The article describes the measures taken to implement the principle of participatory research into the structures of the German Rheumatism League and summarises the experiences of patients and the patient organisation during five years of active participation in research projects.","150":"The aim of this paper is to describe a conceptual framework for how to consider health equity in the Grading Recommendations Assessment and Development Evidence (GRADE) guideline development process. Consensus-based guidance developed by the GRADE working group members and other methodologists. This is a German translation of the original paper published in English. We developed consensus-based guidance to help address health equity when rating the certainty of synthesized evidence (i.e., quality of evidence). When health inequity is determined to be a concern by stakeholders, we propose five methods for explicitly assessing health equity: (1) include health equity as an outcome; (2) consider patient-important outcomes relevant to health equity; (3) assess differences in the relative effect size of the treatment; (4) assess differences in baseline risk and the differing impacts on absolute effects; and (5) assess indirectness of evidence to disadvantaged populations and\/or settings. The most important priority for research on health inequity and guidelines is to identify and document examples where health equity has been considered explicitly in guidelines. Although there is a weak scientific evidence base for assessing health equity, this should not discourage the explicit consideration of how guidelines and recommendations affect the most vulnerable members of society. ","151":"A Bachelor of Nursing qualification has been facilitated by the new Care Professions Reform Act since January 1, 2020 as a standard in Germany. Due to the Reform Act students must have completed 2,300hours of practical training in a healthcare institution. Recent projects have revealed that the practical part of current study programs is inadequate with regard to content, organization and didactics. Therefore, specific quality criteria need to be developed for institutions providing academic training of nursing professionals that are in line with the requirements of medical teaching hospitals. These quality criteria have been developed from March 2019 to February 2020 in a three-phase process using the Delphi technique. Phases I and II were conducted as online surveys among various stakeholders (n = 396; n = 555) to identify quality criteria and to assess both their relevance and feasibility. Phase III consisted of an expert conference to finally select the quality criteria. The result was a set of requirements for practical and academic education with a total of 55 criteria subdivided into five dimensions (organizational, personal, infrastructural, formal and didactic). Against the background of the diversity of settings and institutions providing practice learning opportunities for nursing students and their specific frameworks, the practicability of individual criteria needs to be discussed. Also, the level of commitment and the related approval process have to be questioned. The criteria developed should be a tool to leverage quality, that is to improve the practical learning part of the nursing study programs. The addressees include representatives of universities and healthcare institutions taking part in the fundamental academic qualification in nursing care. The results provide guidance for the selection and the design of strategic and operational cooperation. Furthermore, the criteria can be used as a basis for the certification of academic teaching institutions. ","152":"Even in well-developed healthcare systems, raising awareness for undesirable dangers and risks of modern healthcare services among the clinical staff is a continuous and methodical challenge. The concept of the so-called \"Room of Horrors\" is both an innovative and a low-fidelity simulation approach for team-based training of patient safety-relevant hazards. The purpose of this evaluation study is to report on practicability and acceptance of such a low-threshold simulation training. A fictitious patient room including a patient manikin (lying in bed) was set up in the hospital to simulate the Room of Horrors. Additional artifacts such as a side table, medication and the medical record completed the simulation, in which 12 typical errors or latent risks related to patient safety were hidden. After a short briefing, individuals or groups (2-5 participants) should enter the room and try to find as many errors as possible. The error detection rate was evaluated immediately followed by a debriefing. The participants were then asked to answer a short structured questionnaire to provide content-related feedback about the patient safety simulation. Within three days, the Room of Horrors was visited by a total of 89 participants (27 teams and 6 individuals). Average error detection rate was 8.54 out of 12 hidden errors (71%), whereby the teams showed a slightly better result. All the surveyed participants found the simulation to be educational and beneficial. The importance of team discussion was particularly emphasized by a majority of participants. 91% of the participants found the wrong patient identification wristband and in spite of a documented lactose intolerance a yogurt on the side table. 88% of the participants recognized the bell which was out of the patients reach. Few participants found the missing indication of a permanent catheter (24%) and a doubled prescription of paracetamol (42%). A comparison of several international studies about so-called Rooms of Horrors shows that the present study has a relatively high average detection rate (71%), although a significant percentage of the participants are not engaged in medical or nursing services. Not surprisingly, the average detection of errors of the teams were higher than individuals. This strengthens the theory that a discursive discussion and exchange of dialogue among the clinical staff in a patient's room increases patient safety or at least strengthens situational awareness for clinical risks. The consistently positive feedback coincides with the evaluation results of other clinics and thus demonstrates the acceptance of simulation-based on-site training. The organizational and financial effort to execute the simulation training remained very low (apart from the resulting costs incurred due to the participants missing from their regular hospital duties). Hence, the evaluation study proves practicability and acceptance of this simulation method. The study provides no information about the extent to which the simulation actually influences the behavior and situational awareness of the participants. At least the awareness of the participants for real risks, hazards and errors of modern patient care was raised temporarily. The Room of Horrors can be easily adapted to different learning goals and settings. It is a flexible and practical learning arrangement. In comparison to the organizational and financial efforts involved, the implementation can be recommended without exception.

In March 2020, participants registered on the HeReCa-Online-Panel from Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Schleswig Holstein were invited to complete a 65-question survey. 1048 respondents answered the questionnaire, which amounts to a response of 3.5%. 83% of respondents stated that they felt themselves to be well-informed or very well-informed concerning COVID-19 and the coronavirus. The majority of respondents reported fears for the well-being of family members (60%) or the health of the German population as a whole (45%); 79% reported concerns regarding adverse economic impacts. 79% of respondents have implemented individual protective measures, such as reducing social contacts and maintaining the recommended physical distance in public spaces. Most respondents regarded the government-mandated safety measures as predominantly reasonable and appropriate.

Typically, a distinction is made between qualitative and quantitative approaches.

Using mixed-methods designs promises, among other things, to compensate for weaknesses of the individual methods, to improve the scope of the results, and to provide a comprehensive insight into the topic. In this systematic review of two German journals we examine the role of the mixed-methods approach in the field of health promotion and how it can be translated into specific research projects. The review's results show that mixed-methods designs are implemented in various contexts. In most studies, the quantitative research strand plays the central role. The use of the mixed-methods designs in health promotion can be further discussed, especially taking into account technical innovations in the field of data collection or with regard to the interpretative potential of qualitative research.

","160":"Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are one of the most important sources to inform clinical decision-making. They contain recommendations to support treatment decisions. These recommendations should be free from bias and should only aim to increase patient benefit. To ensure this, recommendations should be free from bias caused by conflicts of interest. When conflicts of interest exist, they should be completely transparent. The aim of this study was to analyze the payments from pharmaceutical and medical device industry to clinical practice guideline panel members (GPM). In addition, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of the GPMs' conflict of interest statements. A manual search for international guidelines was conducted on the website of the National Guideline Clearinghouse. We included all available clinical practice guidelines published in 2017. We extracted the names of all guideline group members and identified the payments they had received from industry over the four years preceding the publication using the \"open payments\" database. In total, 81 guidelines were identified. We found data on payments for 543 out of 659 GPMs. For 34% of the GPMs, there was no declaration of individual conflicts of interest in either the guideline or related documents. The sum of payments across all guidelines to all GPMs was 10,844,938 USD. The average payment amounted to 19,972 USD and the median 1,227 USD. Sixty two percent of GPMs received at least 500 USD. Of these, 17% stated that they had no conflict of interest to declare. The amount of industrial payments in some subject areas raises doubt about the independence of guideline recommendations. Stricter rules are needed to avoid and manage conflicts of interest of guideline authors. The analysis carried out indicates that conflict of interest involving GPMs is a considerable problem. GPMs receive sizeable payments from industry. The payments are often inadequately disclosed or not disclosed at all.

Nine further indicators derived from the guideline for medication reviews and expert opinion were amended. After discussion in a focus group, the 32 indicators were reduced to a preliminary set of twelve indicators used for the Delphi survey. Following two Delphi rounds, a final indicator set consisting of three structure indicators, one process indicator and two outcome indicators, was generated.

The series of SRs has been carried out in the PRIMA-eDS-project (www.prima-eds.eu) to develop recommendations for the treatment of elderly patients with polypharmacy. The research question was to which extent recommendations on drug therapy in older patients are based on sound evidence. To this purpose, we performed a quality assessment of all studies included using AMSTAR for systematic reviews, CASP for observational studies, and the Cochrane \"Risk of Bias\" tool for intervention studies. The evidence base for commonly prescribed drugs in the elderly is weak. The studies identified by the systematic reviews revealed a significant lack of studies addressing the target population as well as a lack of high-quality evidence. Among the 33 observational studies, it was unclear in nearly half of the publications whether the follow-up was sufficiently long and complete. For one-third, the conclusions did not match the observed evidence. The greatest risk of bias in the intervention trials was due to selection and incorrect blinding. Quality deficits of the systematic reviews consisted in the provision of a complete study list and the lack of consideration of potential publication bias. Overall, many methodological deficits were revealed, making it difficult or almost impossible to derive reliable recommendations. Our work illustrates the immense need for research in the treatment of older patients as well as the importance of ensuring the highest quality standards when conducting intervention and observational studies or carrying out systematic reviews.

The evaluation is to be based on a set of indicators that can be captured in routine data. On the one hand, they can be used to assess ICM-GK programs that are program-specific and geared towards prevention and disease management. On the other hand, possible negative side effects of the ICM-GK, which is designed as a \"shared savings contract\", are to be examined by also observing care needs not covered by the ICM-GK contract. Since an indicator set for the evaluation of regional integrated care (IC) programs in Germany is not yet available, a suitable indicator set should be developed. RESULTS: The methodological framework links the OECD concept for quality assessment of health systems with Kessner's tracer methodology. Disease groups with a high prevalence (\"common diseases\"), prevention potential and potential for improvement through IC were selected as tracers. The literature search resulted in 239 QIs and the QI database search in 293 QIs, which were supplemented by 21 QIs from the focus groups. Out of a total of 553 QIs, 251 QIs remained after removal of duplicates and comparison with the data basis. This preliminary QI set was reduced to 101 QIs by consensus. In addition, 48 health reporting indicators were supplemented which serve to classify regional quality results. The final QI set maps the following 19 disease categories\/tracers: heart failure (16 QIs), myocardial infarction (4 QIs), CHD (10 QIs), stroke (6 QIs), metabolic syndrome (7 QIs of which 5 were diabetes-related), COPD (6 QIs), asthma (3 QIs), chronic pain (5 QIs), back pain (3 QIs), geriatrics (7 QIs), dementia (8 QIs), osteoporosis (3 QIs), rheumatism (3 QIs), multiple sclerosis (2 QIs), depression (4 QIs), antibiotic therapy (3 QIs), drug safety (1 QI), child care (5 QIs), early detection\/prevention (5 QIs). 33 of these QIs are dedicated to five tracers that are not explicitly ICM-GK programs. Most QIs assess aspects of the effectiveness of care for the chronically ill and measure process quality. The set of indicators initially enables the quality assessment of regional, cross-indication care quality in the population-based integrated health care model 'Gesundes Kinzigtal' on the basis of routine data. Although the QI set focuses on effectiveness and process quality, it also includes QIs for preventive and acute care, coordination of care, patient orientation and safety, and outcomes. In contrast to other QI sets, both primary care and specialist health care and integrated, cross-sectoral and cross-professional care aspects have been considered. The benefits of the QI set for comparisons of regional quality and the evaluation of different IC programs remain to be tested. On the basis of a broadly based research and participatory development process, a set of indicators has been developed that enables comprehensive evaluation of the regional quality of care of cross-indication, integrated care models focusing on common diseases. In order to be able to increasingly evaluate aspects of care coordination and patient orientation, health promotion as well as nursing, palliative and emergency care in the future, it would be helpful if routine data were collected or made accessible in these areas as well.

The aim of the study was to translate the EPIC scale into German, to test its comprehensibility in German-speaking countries and to interculturally adapt the scale. The translation process followed international guidelines. After two independent translations into German and two independent back translations had been conducted, an expert committee discussed discrepancies in view of intercultural comprehensibility and agreed on a preliminary German version. The comprehensibility of this version was evaluated with physical therapists from Switzerland, Austria and Germany. They were recruited using purposeful sampling and interviewed via telephone using a semi-structured questionnaire (cognitive interviewing). The interviews were recorded and analyzed independently by two authors using a structured evaluation scheme. Based on these results, the final version was created. All changes were discussed with the author of the EPIC scale. Sixteen physical therapists of the three German-speaking countries were interviewed. Demographic data showed a balanced distribution of country of origin, age group, qualification and years of work experience. In general, participants reported a good overall comprehensibility. However, they reported that (too) many scientific terms caused comprehension problems and that some of these terms were unknown to participants. During the intercultural adaptation attention was paid to simplify and shorten sentences and to paraphrase terms that were difficult to understand. Moreover, the instructions were expanded to address partial lack of knowledge of scientific terms. The EPIC scale was successfully translated and interculturally adapted to the German language.

The interviews were analyzed using content analysis. The significant differences between hospital-based and primary care practice initially came as quite a shock to the study participants. Key differences and challenges compared to working in a hospital included: 1) the totally different type of patients or complaints they faced; 2) learning that in many situations one can and should bide one's time (\"wait-and-see\" approach); 3) ruling out avoidable dangerous developments in patients reliably and coping with the corresponding residual risk; 4) the discovery that sometimes it makes sense not to make a diagnosis; 5) that the doctor-patient relationship should be more cooperative in general practice; and 6) that GPs are often under pressure to act although there is no clear need for taking action or no clear treatment option from a medical and scientific point of view.

For continuous outcomes, imputed mean values come from other studies within the systematic review and the standard deviation (SD) from the median SDs of the control arms of all studies. If the results of the primary meta-analysis are robust to the most extreme assumptions viewed as plausible, one does not rate down certainty in the evidence for risk of bias due to missing participant outcome data.

These approaches could increase feasibility in day-to-day practice and create incentives for caregivers to provide more high-quality general outpatient palliative care.

The quality of the underlying evidence in the inpatient long-term care setting was predominantly low, therefore, it was not always possible to draw clear conclusions regarding the efficacy of the interventions. The low quality of evidence was mainly due to the high heterogeneity as well as the low number and limited methodological quality of the primary studies.

The GRADE accounted for issues that mitigate concerns about confounding and selection bias by introducing the upgrading domains: large effects, dose-effect relations, and when plausible residual confounders or other biases increase certainty. They will need to be considered in an assessment of a body of evidence when using ROBINS-I. The use of ROBINS-I in GRADE assessments may allow for a better comparison of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies (NRSs) because they are placed on a common metric for risk of bias. Challenges remain, including appropriate presentation of evidence from RCTs and NRSs for decision-making and how to optimally integrate RCTs and NRSs in an evidence assessment.

Therefore, the reduction of potentially inadequate medication (PIM), an improvement in drug therapy safety and, in general, a more rational use of drugs is an objective of various interventions. The aim of this prospective single-arm interventional study is to investigate the potential of a decision support system (DSS; \"Arzneimittelkonto NRW\") to improve medication safety in outpatient care. 15 primary care physicians participating in the study recruited 874 patients. Prescription data and results of medication safety tests were available for 654 patients. Data of at least 12 months were available for 86% of these patients. PIM prevalence declined within 12 months (-11.3%), but not at a statistically significant level. The number of prescriptions after the introduction of the DSS is significantly below the prescription volume before the introduction of the DSS (-14.1%). Constantly high alteration rates of up to 85% were observed, for example, on drug interaction system warnings made by the DSS. Technical decision support systems have the potential to support a safer and cost-saving drug use. For the first time, this pilot study provides evidence for this in the context of standard outpatient care in Germany. However, further investigations are necessary to establish a robust body of evidence. A particular focus should be on the qualitative monitoring of the studies and the involvement of other actors in the care process.","194":null,"195":"To provide guidance for guideline developers on how to consider health equity at key stages of the guideline development process. Literature review followed by group discussions and consensus building. The key stages at which guideline developers could consider equity include setting priorities, guideline group membership, identifying the target audience(s), generating the guideline questions, considering the importance of outcomes and interventions, deciding what evidence to include and searching for evidence, summarizing the evidence and considering additional information, wording of recommendations, and evaluation and use. We provide examples of how guidelines have actually considered equity at each of these stages. Guideline projects should consider the aforementioned suggestions for recommendations that are equity sensitive. ","196":"Systematic reviews are regarded as the cornerstone of evidence-based decision making across many disciplines. The teaching of systematic review methods is thus very important, yet it is a field that still remains unexplored. In this paper, we will outline an approach for teaching non-clinicians about systematic reviews at the University of Cologne. Our aim was to cast some light on the challenges involved and to stimulate discussion and discourse on this topic. Out of a total of twelve weeks of teaching (1.5hours per week), nine of them included hands-on exercises that cover all the steps involved in a systematic review, from defining a specific review question up to conducting and interpreting meta-analyses. The course was based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions that provide specific guidance for the development and assessment of systematic reviews. A well-reported, well-conducted systematic review was used as a working example throughout the course. The course was taught by an experienced systematic reviewer without input from additional experts such as information specialists or biometricians. To improve the learning success, four fields of challenge were identified: the selection of appropriate topics for the course assignment, the selection of an appropriate guiding review, specific requirements related for the lecturer, and the integration of methodological progress.","197":"Evidence-based and formally consensus-based clinical practice guidelines (S3-CPGs) are a valuable source for the development of quality indicators (QIs) in Germany. While deriving QIs from guideline recommendations is a mandatory part of the development of S3-CPGs within the National Program for Disease Management Guidelines (DMGP) and the German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO), there is no such obligation in the guideline program of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) (MS program). Despite that, several S3-CPGs in the MS program have been published with QIs in the last years while some DMGP and one GGPO S3 guidelines have failed to meet this requirement. From the perspective of the guideline authors of all three mentioned programs, the present qualitative study examined why S3-CPGs do or do not contain QIs and explored the factors perceived by authors as either facilitating or hampering in the QI development process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with authors of 22 S3-CPGs, 11 of which represented guidelines containing QIs and 11 of which represented guidelines without QIs. Authors of guidelines containing QIs (n=11) were asked about the perceived decisive reasons for formulating QIs and about facilitators and barriers during the QI development process. Authors of guidelines without QIs (n=11) gave reasons for not formulating QIs. Interviews were analyzed using structuring qualitative content analysis. Within the MS program, not formulating QIs was mainly attributed to the lack of a mandatory requirement and to insufficient funding of guideline projects. Amongst DMGP authors, a low priority of QI development prevailed, which was, for example, due to already existing QIs or to their lacking implementation. In the GGPO guideline examined, not formulating QIs was due to the guideline topic (prevention) - for this topic, there was a lack of suitable evidence and data sources. If QIs were developed, the most important facilitating factor in the development process, across all programs, was the methodological support provided by the guideline program. Important hampering factors included the additional time required for QI development and concerns regarding the implementation of many potential QIs, especially due to a lack of data availability. For regular development of QIs within S3-CPG projects, the incorporation of such a requirement in the guideline program is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. Other pivotal factors include systematic methodological support, adequate financial and staff resources and the perceived meaningfulness and relevance of guideline-based QI development, measured in terms of the actual implementation of already existing QIs. The study reveals starting points for measures to strengthen the consideration of QI development in German S3-CPG projects, especially within the MS program. Without substantial structural changes, especially of the resources of guideline groups, and without an overall concept covering the entire process from QI development to QI implementation, guideline-based QI development will remain heavily dependent on the (self-)motivation of guideline groups.

All health professional involved in the treatment of patients were asked to participate in a systematic, process-orientated and anonymous survey to assess the probability of occurrence of 69 treatment risks in stationary patients. The surveys were conducted in 2006 before establishing quality management (QM) and digitization, and recently after various certification activities have been performed and the digitization has been completed. According to the survey respondents, QM measures and digitization have led to a significant reduction of the probability of occurrence of 20 treatment risks, although the number of surgeries performed rose 1.8-fold while the number of employees increased by just 1.2-fold to 1.4-fold. The risk reduction was most pronounced regarding mistaken patient identity errors, while complex process risks like insufficient postoperative aftercare or patient dissatisfaction with ineffective communication remained unchanged. An increase in process risks that may be due to an increased workload can be mitigated by QM and digitization measures. This requires a quality and risk management system that is organized by the administration, supported by responsible and risk-aware employees and not imposed. Health professionals estimate that digitization and QM measures have the potential to reduce patients' treatment risks and help offset the increased workload.

One area of action is the promotion of the nursing home residents' psychosocial health. The objective of this systematic review was to describe and analyze interventions and intervention components related to the psychosocial health of nursing home residents. First, we conducted a search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in Medline via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Gerolit, Embase, Psyndex, and Livivo, and hand-searched additional sources. Second, references of all relevant randomized controlled trials (n=86) were extracted from the identified systematic reviews (n=27). The original articles of the included primary studies were then analyzed using criteria for the evaluation of complex interventions. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Seventeen interventions for promoting the psychosocial health of nursing home residents were identified. The majority of the study participants were nursing home residents with dementia. Since the underlying evidence was predominantly very low, it was not possible to draw clear conclusions concerning the efficacy of the interventions for psychosocial health outcomes. The best indications of positive effects were found for reminiscence, mealtime interventions, music therapy, and special care staff training. The diversity and heterogeneity of the interventions made both classification and consistent judgments of the quality of the evidence difficult. From the perspective of promoting the psychosocial health of nursing home residents, the identified interventions should only be considered as suggestions or proposals for prevention and health promotion measures, and future studies should evaluate their implementation.

Hierarchical linear models and path analysis were used to analyse longitudinal associations after three and five years (T3 to T5). A positive residents' career satisfaction had a small causal effect on the training quality. A delay in obtaining the degree as a medical specialist had a small negative effect on residents' career satisfaction. A high residents' career satisfaction was negatively associated with a delay in training. Gender predicted the career satisfaction of physicians with children. The career satisfaction of female physicians with children decreased significantly in the course of their postgraduate training compared to male physicians with children. The speciality choice had no significant impact on residents' career satisfaction. Residents who were satisfied with their job subjectively rated the quality of postgraduate training conditions more positively. The anticipated delays in obtaining the degree as a medical specialist and the residents' career satisfaction were reciprocally related.

As part of an annual patient survey in breast care centres in NRW, two subscales of the Perceived Involvement in Care Scales (PICS) were used and analysed in multi-level models. Data from nearly 40,000 patients could be analysed with consistently high response rates.

Despite the documented benefits, integration, acceptance, and user opinion continue to play an important role in the successful implementation of such systems. To date no studies have been carried out in Switzerland to assess the attitude or acceptance of nurses towards electronically supported medication systems after implementation. This study was conducted in order to close this gap. Following a four-month test phase of a closed-loop medication system on two mixed medical-surgical units in a tertiary teaching hospital, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted among the participating registered nurses (response rate: 62.5%). The new system was evaluated positively by the majority (70%) of users. Accordingly, the barcode-assisted medication process was proven to be especially beneficial to users during the 24-hour medication preparation process and during the preparation of infusions. However, user compliance decreased significantly during the administration of bedside medication and the preparation of additional single doses. This was mainly due to a lack of time and inadequate system performance. In the study, 75% of participants reported that they were open to or even enthusiastic about using the new technologies and were supportive of their introduction into the medication process.

In phase 1, we reviewed existing youth-specific HRQoL instruments and conducted focus group interviews with healthy children and adolescents to identify potential new labels. In individual sorting and response scaling interviews, participants aged 8 to 15 years rated the severity of the identified labels. Based on the results, a 4L and a 5L version were developed.

Five out of 14 health economic evaluations also assessed associations between costs and quality of care. The majority of studies did not include evidence on rating approaches and\/or thresholds. Even though the validity and reliability of the used data in single studies is frequently discussed, only one in four of the included studies undertook a discussion of the suitability of the applied indicators. 121 studies explored indicators that can, in whole or in part, potentially be calculated on the basis of German social health insurance claims data and that target medical conditions such as osteoarthritis, asthma, chronic pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis or mental health disorders as well as ambulatory care-sensitive events, appropriate medication of the elderly and polypharmacy, preventive care and continuity of care.

Above all, the process quality and safety of case management as well as ensuring the relevant documentation at the POC appears to offer significant potential for optimization. An essential approach to eventually realize the potential for optimization is the reduction of fragmentation of the micro-processes associated with the case management duties on inpatient wards. This homogenization of these activities ideally requires a new and interdisciplinary acting profession, the clinical case managers.

These may result from clinicians not having or not using the available knowledge, from the incompleteness of the medical science base as a whole, or from the inevitable randomness of biological, psychological and social phenomena. Advances in science promise to reduce uncertainty by making ever more precise diagnosis and treatment possible. Here, we discuss two typical examples of scientific progress and on how they impact on clinical uncertainty: first, the stratification of chemotherapy for early breast cancer by a 70-gene signature, and second, the interpretation of knee MRI regarding meniscal damage. According to a large randomized trial, the 70-gene -signature successfully differentiates between strata for invasive treatments. The quantitative results and related trade-offs, however, pose considerable difficulties for patient information and shared decision-making, thus increasing uncertainty. Knee complaints are only weakly associated with MRI findings. Pathological findings are highly prevalent in symptom-free individuals. Recent advances in diagnostic methods increase the cognitive demands on clinicians and thus their uncertainty.

On the one hand, demographic change plays an important role and, on the other hand, the rapid development of medicine and nursing care can be attributed to the pressure to change. The Lean Management concept, which originated in the automotive sector, represents a successful management method for meeting these growing challenges. The aim of this work therefore was to use interviews with experts from the healthcare sector to find out which leadership philosophy hospitals need in order to successfully implement the lean management approach in their organisational culture. A semi-qualitative approach was chosen as a survey instrument for the present study of the expert interviews. The interview guideline was divided into four categories: hospital management, knowledge, practice and implementation. Four experts were interviewed for approx. 45minutes each. All four interviewees are male and hold intermediate- or top-level management positions in a hospital. The evaluation method used is based on the content analysis according to Mayring. In category 1, a high pressure for change was indicated. The reasons cited were different financing arrangements, changes in the framework and the unregulated flow of patients into the hospital. Managers in hospitals are not recruited for their management skills, but exclusively for their medical knowledge. Category 2 shows that managers in hospitals have never learned to lead or manage. The term 'Lean Management' is sometimes interpreted differently. In category 3, the interviewees cited different reasons for implementing the lean management approach. Among other things, they see the possibility of increasing quality for the patient, employee satisfaction and safety. In category 4, it was confirmed that employees and management play a key role in implementation. In a hospital, the 'patient-first' approach should be prioritised. A critical analysis of the results shows that implementing the lean management approach in a hospital will pose a major challenge. The functional, hierarchical structure as well as the understanding of leadership and the organizational culture are critical success factors.

Clinicians need complete, up-to-date information to be able to develop an adequate mental model of the patient's situation. The aim of the present study was to identify patient safety hazards coming with the use of health information technology (HIT): patient safety hazards in three outpatient oncology infusion centers were assessed and priority topics identified. Additionally, the number of information sources clinicians have to use in order to get an idea of the patient's situation was systematically assessed. Interviews and observations were conducted with one nurse and one doctor of each ambulatory infusion center. Information management-related patient safety hazards were omnipresent in daily care: eleven topics were identified from 125 assessed patient safety hazards. Three of them were particularly relevant to the clinicians' development of an adequate mental model about the patient: patient-related information was not stored in one place but often fragmented in different HIT systems; despite the introduction of HIT, paper documentation remained in place for certain information, making access difficult and increasing the number of relevant sources; the lack of usability of the HIT systems made it difficult to retrieve patient information in a timely manner. Clinicians needed to use between 5 and 11 sources of information to get a more complete picture of a patient's situation. Overall, it has been shown that the design of the HIT systems is not sufficiently adapted to the work processes and does not support clinicians in being fully informed about a patient. The topics identified point to future system design and areas for improvement. In this process, it is very important to align the real work requirements with the design of the HIT and to evaluate and monitor the actual implementation and use of HIT.

However, not every patient is able to attend outpatient aftercare programs, especially if they interfere with professional or social responsibilities. Telemedical alternatives could provide those patients with longer durations or varying degrees of aftercare, regardless of location or time restriction. The present study aimed to investigate what cardiovascular rehabilitation patients expect from a telemedical aftercare program. Data was collected in individual semi-structured interviews with cardiovascular rehabilitation patients, where subjects were asked about their expectations towards a telemedical aftercare program. To identify groups of associated topics, the results obtained were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Nine cardiovascular rehabilitation patients were interviewed (8 male, 1 female). None of the respondents had ever taken part in a telemedical aftercare program; however, eight out of the nine patients indicated their willingness to participate in such a program. Patients preferred telephone-based aftercare programs where they could speak with a member of staff familiar with the patient's clinical picture, circumstances and goals. Some respondents wanted additional web-based services or services via text message. Overall, the option of telemedical aftercare was viewed favorably by rehabilitation patients as long as the program included personal contact with a healthcare provider. Respondents preferred interaction via familiar media, especially by phone. Low-threshold experiences with new technologies may help overcome reservations and facilitate acceptance of innovative telemedical services in rehabilitation patients. Personal interaction with an attending member of staff should occur throughout aftercare programs, at least occasionally or during initial the stage. ","236":"In selected healthcare sectors and settings, patients and their relatives are now regarded as co-producers of the healthcare system. This is associated with modified patient roles and new relationship models. Physiotherapists also have to face them by including educational interventions into their traditional scope of practice. However, corresponding intervention concepts for physiotherapy do not yet exist. Therefore, the aim of this contribution is to initiate an empirically supported concept development. As part of a qualitative empirical study, interviews were conducted with 15 parents of children with life-limiting diseases in four federal states of Germany and then evaluated using the reconstruction method of the documentary method according to Bohnsack. The parents' experiences with the assumption of physiotherapeutic care were used as input for first reflections on an instructive intervention concept with reference to relevant learning theory approaches. In the course of the data evaluation, three divergent orientations (parent types) were identified. Parent type A (autonomy) acts largely autonomously and requires only occasional support. Parent type B (understanding) and C (relief) need more intensive support. While parent type B requires education in order to satisfy their pronounced need for knowledge, parent type C generally questions why they should have to carry out physiotherapeutic task and delegates responsibility back to the professional help system. Physiotherapeutic instruction should take into account the different types of parents with regard to the provision of care. Parents who are motivated to engage in learning processes would like to a) focus on central physiotherapeutic measures, b) be instructed face-to-face and c) be recognized as experts for their child and their situation. Supplemented by the perspective of professionals, insights into the parents' perspective can serve as the basis for empirical impact analysis. The empirically validated intervention concepts for instructive action must be integrated into existing educational, training and further education courses in order to ensure systematic dissemination of knowledge into physiotherapy. In addition, a debate on professional policy must be launched in order to secure instructive action more strongly in the physiotherapeutic repertoire.

While telemedical applications are piloted in research projects in Germany, they have rarely become part of everyday care. In order to find indications as to why the transfer of knowledge into practice has so far been slow, it is necessary to examine telemedical projects for aspects of implementation science. A systematic search looking for telemedical projects in Germany was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and ACM Digital Library using a complex search strategy. The criteria and domains of the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST) were used to evaluate the publications. A total of 336 publications were identified, 16 of which were ultimately included in the analysis. Much of the work deals with stroke and the implementation of telemedicine networks. The analysis according to MAST shows that most publications omit essential considerations. Publications on telemedical projects are often characterized by unsystematic approaches. The MAST instrument identifies areas where the approaches to telemedical projects could be extended in the future to ensure the sustainability and feasibility of these prototypical telemedical applications. ","241":"Digital transformation in healthcare presents enormous challenges as it partially redefines care processes and interaction between patients and doctors. In order to seize opportunities to improve patient care as well as patient safety by using digital innovations, arising patient safety risks due to these changes have to be considered and addressed. The German Coalition for Patient Safety, the Austrian Network for Patient Safety and the Swiss Foundation for Patient Safety decided to develop a recommendation for members of all professional groups in healthcare to sensitize for arising risks, inform about cause-effect relationships and to empower professionals to perform an individual risk-benefit-assessment for existing and upcoming digital innovations. In May 2017 the German Coalition on Patient Safety implemented its working group Digitization and Patient Safety with its subgroup Digitization and Risk Management. Based on open brainstorming of experts followed by a nominal group technique process the most relevant risks for patient safety arising from digitization were identified and assessed by using a modified scenario analysis. After internal consultation of all members of the German Coalition for Patient Safety and all executive boards of participation associations, the recommendation was published at the annual meeting of the German Coalition for Patient Safety in May 2018. We identified six core risks that were assessed by modified scenario technique: insufficient protection of the IT system from external attacks, insufficient protection of the IT system from unauthorized access, non-availability of IT system or patient data, handing over data to external service providers, unsafe embedding of medical devices in IT systems and insufficient digital literacy of healthcare professionals. In addition, we developed a checklist for the self-assessment of risks arising from implementing digital innovation, using risk criteria according to ONR 49002-2:2014, and provided key questions for decision makers. On the basis of the approach described a multiprofessional and intersectoral recommendation for clinical core risks associated with digitization in healthcare was developed within a 12-month period. The dissemination of this recommendation in German language can be regarded as very successful since the German Coalition for Patient Safety received more than 22,000 requests for paper copies, and 1,200 downloads of this open-access publication have been registered. An English version of this recommendation will soon be available.","242":"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models are mandatory for dosing and the safe use of drugs in the paediatric population. Different modelling methods allow for the development of dosing regimens for children requiring only a small number of blood samples or none at all.

Even well-known rare diseases are diagnosed with unacceptable delay in many countries. After decades of studying medical histories with delayed diagnoses and the respective literature, we describe the often severe aftereffects of a late diagnosis. We point out the underlying problems on the part of the physicians involved, of the affected families and of the health system in Germany, in particular with respect to the many emerging centers for rare diseases, most of which are associated with academic institutions. We gained the impression that the cause of delayed diagnoses is frequently not a lack of expertise or other resources, but inefficient communication between parents, practitioners and expert centers. We consider two approaches as promising and practicable: (1) strengthening the parents' competence and role in the dialogue with their doctors, an important element of which is obtaining written information on the state of the diagnostic process in language understandable to the parents; (2) definition of binding requirements for centers officially dedicated to the diagnosis of rare diseases and to research into unknown conditions. Many of our observations and deliberations in the pediatric field should be equally applicable to adults.","247":"There are still few epidemiological data on patients with chronic wounds (leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers). Statutory health insurance (SHI) data is increasingly being used for questions relating to healthcare science. When using this data, which is primarily collected for billing purposes, the methodological procedure for defining cases must be presented transparently. Here, it must be checked whether the target group can be validly defined using the coded diagnoses and, if necessary, further information from routine data. Therefore, the aim of this contribution is, on the one hand, to develop criteria with the help of which patients with a florid (active) chronic wound can be identified safely or as doubtful cases in routine data and, on the other hand, to determine the corresponding frequency estimates. Initially, a literature research was carried out to identify parameters relevant to care in patients with chronic wounds. In the next step, these were divided into specific, less specific and non-specific criteria (visual validity) in a multi-stage consensus procedure with regard to the specificity for wound care. On this basis, three different case definitions are used to identify florid chronic wounds. Based on an SHI sample of insured persons, frequency estimates were made for various case definitions (safe and questionable cases). Of the 21 parameters identified in the literature, eight were classified as specific, six as less specific and eight as non-specific criteria for the identification of patients with chronic florid wounds. Using diagnostic coding alone for the target diseases, an administrative prevalence of chronic wounds of 1.13% was observed for the year 2010. If a case is defined using the less specific and\/or the specific criteria, prevalence drops to 0.79%; if only the specific criteria are used, prevalence drops only marginally to 0.78%. These changes were observed in patients with leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, but not in patients with pressure ulcers. Here, the lowest administrative prevalence (0.18%) can be seen when only looking at the diagnoses, but this increases slightly when taking wound-relevant treatments into account (specific and less specific criteria: 0.25%). It is possible to define patients with a chronic florid wound on the basis of wound-relevant treatments using SHI data and to make estimates of administrative prevalence. Depending on the question, the criteria for defining cases can be narrowed down or broadened. The comparison provides information on the internal validity of diagnostic coding. However, further studies are needed to verify external validity. ","248":"Clinical guidelines are based on the best available evidence and produced systematically. In this context, the transparent presentation of the decision-making process from evidence to recommendation is indispensable. The Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks for clinical practice recommendations enables guideline panels to structure their approach and make it comprehensible. The EtD frameworks include three main sections: formulating the question, assessing the evidence and \"Additional considerations\" for each criterion, and drawing conclusions. This article focuses on the selection and operationalization of those criteria of the EtD framework that are relevant for clinical recommendations in guidelines. These include the priority of the problem, benefits and harms, certainty of the evidence, importance of the outcome, balance, resource use, equity, acceptability and feasibility. To make a recommendation, a panel must consider the implication and importance of each of the above judgments. The EtD framework helps ensure consideration of key criteria that determine whether an intervention should be recommended and that judgments are informed by the best available evidence.","249":"Practitioners and providers who want to apply evidence from studies will usually face the following two questions: 1) 'Are the study results valid?', and 2) 'Will these results be the same in my setting?' Major progress has been achieved in regard to the first question. An array of tools to assess the validity has been developed. Much less effort, though, has been put into developing and applying methods to assess the transferability of evidence from one setting to another. Existing concepts to assess transferability aim at identifying similarities and differences between the study context and the context in which the study findings are supposed to be applied. In a second step, the impact of the differences on the outcomes are estimated. Context can be distinguished into 'implementation' (how is an intervention applied?), 'target group' (who will receive the intervention?), and 'setting.' In this article selected tools to identify context variables and to assess transferability are presented.","250":null,"251":"Biological and social factors, such as age, comorbidities and the care system, may - as well-established effect-modifiers - limit the transferability of study results to populations with dissimilar characteristics. In order to enable transparent and evidence-based decisions in systematic reviews and guidelines targeting subpopulations that are little or not represented in the study landscape, the GRADE approach is a valid tool to assess the certainty of the evidence. GRADE provides a structured methodology that covers all steps, from developing a precise question, prioritizing patient-relevant outcomes and assessing the available evidence to derive recommendations for practice, among other things. Evaluating confidence in a body of evidence comprises judgments on risk of bias, study heterogeneity, directness, including comparability between study population and target population, precision of effect estimates and publication bias. Because GRADE demands transparent decisions about the applicability of study results from the study population to the target population, gaps in the evidence landscape can be uncovered. Overall, the approach cannot solve the problem of the transferability of study results. It does, however, support the explicit handling of applicability and can give impetus to targeted research gaps.","252":null,"253":"The main advantage of an abbreviated licensing pathway is the possibility of extrapolating efficacy and safety data from an original medicinal product to a subsequent \"copy\" version, thereby reducing the clinical development programme in particular. For small-molecule chemically synthesized generics, such an abbreviated licensing pathway was established decades ago, whereas it was only more recently implemented for similar biological medicinal products, so-called biosimilars. Clinicians and patients have repeatedly expressed concerns about the efficacy and safety of biosimilars, especially in 'extrapolated' indications for which no own clinical data have been generated. Generic drugs usually contain well-defined active ingredients whose \"identity\" with that of the originator, the so-called reference product, is easily verifiable. Biological substances are generally more complex and difficult to characterize. They are produced in living organisms and therefore naturally exhibit some intrinsic variability, i.e. microheterogeneity. Since the chosen expression system and the manufacturing conditions influence the quality characteristics of a biological substance, mostly its posttranslational modifications such as the glycosylation pattern, it is unlikely that two independent manufacturing processes can achieve completely identical biologicals. A biosimilar, especially if it is a glycoprotein, can therefore, at best, be highly similar to the reference product. It seems that the not-identical-but-(highly)-similar-paradigm for biosimilars is often not well understood and causes confusion. However, while at first glance an abridged approval pathway for biosimilars appears to be daring, it is in fact based on sound scientific reasoning. A biosimilar applicant has to provide a considerably larger package of comparative data than a generic applicant to ensure that the biosimilar can indeed rely, for the purpose of licensing, on the efficacy and safety experience gained with the reference product. While for a generic, the demonstration of similar in vitro dissolution and in vivo bioavailability (so-called 'bioequivalence') is sufficient to conclude therapeutic equivalence with the reference product, for a biosimilar, comparable physicochemical, biological and functional characteristics as well as efficacy and safety\/immunogenicity with the reference product must be demonstrated. In addition, unlike generics, any extrapolation to other indications of the reference product must be scientifically justified. More than 10 years of successful clinical experience with biosimilars in the EU support the credibility of the scientific principles guiding the biosimilar concept. So far, there has been no need for either withdrawal of an approved biosimilar or for additional labelling because of efficacy or safety concerns.","254":null,"255":"Internationally, efforts are underway to develop coordinated and standardized approaches for palliative care service delivery by improving service quality in hospice and palliative care networks. German legal regulations explicitly demand networking between hospice and palliative care providers. However, there is little research on models of cooperation and the building and development of hospice and palliative care networks. Research-based recommendations for network building and advancement are lacking. The study aim was to develop empirical recommendations for the building of new and advancement of existing hospice and palliative care networks in Bavaria, Germany. The project utilized a qualitative approach. The research project was structured in six sequential phases: 1) semi-structured individual interviews on status quo of networks, 2) a workshop including a focus group to develop definitions of key terms and prioritize major network themes, 3) semi-structured face-to-face interviews on factors enabling and inhibiting cooperation, 4) drafting of a recommendation for regional hospice and palliative care networks, 5) an online consensus survey questionnaire to rate relevance and feasibility of the draft recommendation and an internal consensus meeting to revise the draft, and 6) an expert workshop to develop examples of realization. Coordinators and chairpersons of 12 hospice and palliative care networks constitute the study population for study phases 1 to 3, 5, and 6. Network representatives partook in one (n=6), two (n=6), three (n=4), four (n=2), or all five (n=1) of the study phases 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

However, robust evidence on the incidence of VTE in Germany is lacking. Estimation and comparison of the incidence of VTE based on different routine data sources of the German healthcare system. Estimates and comparisons of the incidence of VTE, TVT and LE were made using two databases that both covered the inpatient and the outpatient setting; the DaTraV database comprising information of all persons subject to compulsory health insurance, and the Health Risk Institute (HRI) database derived from approximately 70 statutory health insurance funds. In addition, IMS Disease Analyzer, a medical record database comprising information from the outpatient setting, was used as a data source. Patterns of age- and sex-specific VTE incidence estimates were comparable between all databases used. However, estimates based on the medical record database were comparatively high. Analyses of DaTraV data led to a VTE incidence of 0.14%. Use of HRI data yielded comparable results (0.17-0.20%). VTE incidence based on data of the IMS Disease Analyzer was comparatively high (0.32%). Results on the VTE incidence based on DaTraV or HRI date are comparable to international evidence, whereas the use of the IMS Disease Analyzer data presumably led to an overestimation due to double-counting of VTE cases. Different types of routine healthcare data sources can therefore lead to very heterogeneous results. Thus, the selection of adequate data sources strongly depends on the study question and the quality of the dataset.

At the same time, conventional health services and programs do not sufficiently reach them. Migrant organizations (MOs) are said to have the potential to reach this otherwise difficult target group. This review examines whether there are any indications in the scientific literature that MOs could improve target group attainment. A broad-based systematic literature search was carried out in German and English databases with predefined search terms for the period from 2005 to 2015 (inclusive). Out of 3,236 hits, 8 studies fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies provide indications that MOs are effectively reaching and addressing the target group. Due to a lack of comparability of the MOs involved and different study populations, the interpretation of the results is difficult, though. MOs, as protected social spaces in everyday life, provide an opportunity to offer healthcare services to organizationally affine people with a migration background. However, the research process (e.g., selection of MOs, field access, recruitment of participants) does not seem to be methodologically stringent. Above all, it is still unclear which principles are effective when MOs are integrated into health services. This is where future projects should be started.

The Actifcare project, in which eight European countries participated, emphasized the point in time in the trajectory of dementia when formal care becomes more and more important for supporting caregivers at home. A mixed-method study conducted over 12 months aimed to improve the understanding of care needs and the influencing factors for using informal and formal support for care at home. This report focuses on the German sample of the cohort study. People with dementia with their informal caregivers from the German federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony were interviewed between January 2015 and July 2016. A set of validated questionnaires was used for the baseline interviews and two follow-ups. Additional guideline-based semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subgroup of informal caregivers at the last follow-up interview. The standardized questionnaires were analyzed using a descriptive approach, and the semi-structured interviews were subjected to qualitative content analysis. Similar to the data collection processes, the results of both analyses were synthesized using a data triangulation approach. A total of 52 people with dementia and their informal caregivers participated in the standardized interviews. A subsample of 12 informal caregivers was included in the qualitative interviews. At baseline, 28 out of 51 informal caregivers cared for their relatives with dementia without additional informal support (T2: 22 of 41). The social network of approximately half of the informal caregivers included three to four relatives, who were ready to help if necessary. On average, 3.4 support services were used (T2: 3.6). During the study period, the interest in educational, informational and counselling services decreased (T0: 11 of 52 informal caregivers; T2: 5 of 41). Formal care was more often rejected by people with dementia than by informal caregivers. Sometimes, the available services were considered insufficient in terms of personal needs of formal support, which should be flexible, unbureaucratic and tailored to the needs of the individual patient's situation. It is important for people with dementia and their informal caregivers to be involved in the decision-making processes of caregiving. Since dementia is a progressive disease, early participation is a prerequisite for making shared decisions about healthcare services. People with dementia and their informal caregivers should be informed about formal care services and involved in decision-making processes as early as possible. To this purpose, account must be taken of the various informal social networks. This could improve the use of formal care services and the further development of these offers and thus prolong care at home.

Data on information seeking, the level of information, socio-demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected using a questionnaire. The patients (n=827) used several additional sources of information - most frequently the internet (69.5%; n=767). The majority felt well informed about their disease and found the information provided easy to understand. A social gradient was observed in relation to media use, information evaluation and obtaining a second opinion.

The legislator instructed the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) to develop basic requirements in a quality management guideline (QM-RL). Factor analysis was used to examine whether individual quality categories had a significant influence on the scores of QM systems. The random sample was collected in Saxony and included a total of 24 medical practices because these practices were made available for analysis by the Saxon Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. First, two primary units (family physicians\/specialists) were established from the population. In the following step, one sample per QM system was drawn for each primary unit. In total, there were twelve family physicians and twelve specialists, or eight practices per QM system. The analysis was performed using three self-constructed questionnaires (physician, employee and patient). The individual items were developed independently of a QM system (26 quality categories with 40 questions per survey group). For the analysis, the arithmetic mean was calculated in the individual groups of questions. Factor analysis was used to investigate which quality categories per QM system had a significant influence on the evaluations. The Kaiser-Meyer test was used to measure the data's suitability for factor analysis, also Bartlett's test relating to significance and the cumulative percentage of total of variance were applied. In the first step, the quality categories having a significant influence on the overall evaluation of the QM system are presented. Regarding the DIN EN ISO 9001, 18 quality categories have a significant influence on the overall result; in QEP and QisA, 17 quality categories each have a significant influence on the overall result. The quality categories 'continuous professional development and qualification', 'hygiene and cleaning', 'quality management system', 'quality objectives', and 'procurement and storage' do not define an influence on the overall rating in any of the QM systems. Finally, eleven relevant quality categories were discovered which have an influence on all the QM systems. 17 quality categories have a significant influence on the overall rating based on sample documents, flow charts, process flows, interview guidelines, maintenance protocols, or job advertisements.

All study designs and publications since 2005 were eligible. We included studies investigating robotic interventions in the home care setting and their impact on outcomes relevant to patients or family members. The relevance of the robotic systems for nursing care was assessed according to the six dimensions of the new definition of care dependency in the Eleventh Book of the German Social Code (SGB XI). The search revealed 7,755 hits; 19 studies were included. Two studies used a control group. Further studies were feasibility studies and acceptance surveys. The majority of studies were conducted in EU countries. Three out of 13 robotic systems were commercially available. Nine studies did not report ethical approval, and seven studies did not mention whether informed consent was obtained. Robotic systems in home care have mainly been investigated in exploratory or pilot studies. Apart from technical aspects, the studies focussed on ease of use and, to this purpose, predominantly employed prototype robots.

Migration-sensitive information, e. g. on the websites of rehabilitation facilities, can help remove access barriers. We assessed the migration sensitivity of such websites in a comprehensive document analysis. Websites of orthopedic rehabilitation facilities in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein were systematically examined by means of qualitative content analysis using MAXQDA. Migration-sensitive rehabilitative strategies focusing on patients with a Turkish migration background served as an example. Websites of 44 rehabilitation facilities (North Rhine-Westphalia: 32, Schleswig-Holstein: 12) were included in the analysis. Only one rehabilitation hospital provided online information about migration-sensitive rehabilitative services, such as clinical services\/materials in different languages or migration-sensitive training and therapy. Few facilities described migration-sensitive aspects of accommodation and catering. Integration\/diversity officers or Turkish-speaking employees were rarely introduced on websites. Just a few rehabilitation facilities provide information regarding migration-sensitive services on their websites.

Students repeatedly rated communication training as moderate, and indicated an insufficient level of preparedness with regard to the medical background of the cases used. Also, tutoring was often perceived as unbalanced between medical and communicative issues associated with the tutor's profession-who was either a resident or a psychologist. In addition, peer role-play was frequently criticized for being used in a case featuring cultural and language barriers. Communication training was extensively remodeled. A blended learning concept was introduced with virtual patients in preparation for case-specific medical content, peer role-play was combined with standardized parents, and team teaching by residents and psychologists was introduced to strike a balance in discussions between medical and communicative matters. During the following term, the faculty's standardized evaluation was used to elicit overall rating and particular curricular changes of the communication training; overall ratings were compared to earlier evaluation results. In addition, teaching analysis polls (TAP) were conducted to obtain direct feedback from students about their perceptions of the remodeled training. The overall rating of the communication training did not improve after course revision. Items on specific changes implemented in the training received only moderate ratings. In contrast, direct feedback through TAP revealed significant learning effects perceived through the blended approach, peer role-play and standardized parents, and team teaching. However, students made requests to shorten the training duration and expressed controversial opinions on the use of peer role-play and standardized parents. Despite large efforts to improve teaching, evaluation results do not necessarily meet educators' expectations. If evaluations are more likely to measure acceptance alone among students, improvements in teaching might not be fully communicated to medical educators.

For future analyses, it is relevant to know which data sources are suitable for which research questions, which variables they include, how they can be accessed and which limitations are to be considered. This article offers a comprehensive overview. The German Advisory Council on the Assessment of Developments in the Health Care System used various data sources for its special report on sick pay. For this purpose, several individual agreements with institutions have been made. Insights from these analyses have been systematically analysed and described. Important data sources on sick pay and sick pay recipients include the official statistics hosted by the Federal Ministry of Health and the data of single sickness funds. Moreover, the dataset of the morbidity-oriented risk structure compensation scheme includes some information on sick pay - partly on a regional level. Furthermore, data on cases of long-term incapacity to work, e. g. from the AOK sickness funds, can be used as an approximation for sick pay cases. The available data sources differ regarding available variables, data format, available time course and representativeness. Which data source is most suitable for analyses of sick pay and sick pay recipients, strongly depends on the research question. There may be a trade-off between depth and applicable analytical methods on the one hand (e. g. with data of single sickness funds) versus representativeness and a long-term course on the other hand (e. g. with official statistics). Finally, several recommendations are made on how to further improve the informative value and comparability of data, especially among sickness funds.

In part, this is due to patients who have acute symptoms, but do not require emergency care, as well as multimorbid patients needing complex medical care. Emergency departments serve as an interface between primary care and in-patient as well as out-patient care. The ongoing public discussion about the need to readjust emergency care structures in Germany does not adequately address this aspect. The knowledge of characteristics and needs of patients seeking help in emergency departments is insufficient. In order to develop interventions matching these needs it is necessary to gain deeper insight into these characteristics and needs. EMANet is a health services research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Its aim is to collect representative data on the course of medical care of emergency patients with ambulatory care sensitive conditions in all eight emergency departments in Mitte, the inner city district of Berlin. The EMANet project focuses on three patient groups: a) patients with cardiac symptoms and possible psychiatric comorbidities, b) ambulatory patients with acute or chronic diseases of the respiratory tract, and c) geriatric patients with hip fractures. The collected data shall be used to gain a better understanding of health care utilization patterns, patient-perceived satisfaction and risk factors for potentially avoidable medical conditions or worsening of chronic disease. The mixed methods design of EMANet includes quantitative data of 1,650 patients at two time points and corresponding secondary (i. e. routine) data from hospital information systems. In addition, qualitative interviews with patients and health care professionals shall reveal unmet needs for medical care. The results will give us more in-depth insight into the perceived current capacity overload and help implement structural changes in the health care system.","278":null,"279":null,"280":"Due to an increasing number of care recipients with severe and multiple illnesses and their increased risk of infections, the importance of hygiene has grown steadily over the past years. In home care settings, we are increasingly faced with multidrug-resistant pathogens, resulting in new requirements for a sufficient ambulatory hygiene management. As there are only few study results relating to the prevalence and implementation of a standardized ambulatory hygiene management, our study aims to explore the extent to which both fixed MRSA decolonization measures and instructions for the handling of specific pathogens are available to care staff and whether MRSA management is documented. Finally, it was examined whether this is influenced by professional experience, qualification, working hours and hygiene trainings for care staff. In the winter of 2016\/17 a cross-sectional survey was conducted among the employees of home care services in Germany. The aim was to survey 10 employees of 10 services in each federal state. Being aware of the difficulties of this kind of study, we expected a response rate of 50 per cent. It was intended to show correlations between the existence of fixed MRSA decolonization protocols, the documentation of MRSA decolonization treatments as well as handling instructions for specific pathogens and independent variables such as professional experience in years, qualification, trainings, working hours and care patients per shift. A total of 107 home care services participated in the study, with 656 care workers returning completed questionnaires. The results showed statistically significant differences between hygiene trainings conducted within the last 12 months and those having taken place more than a year ago. As a general principle, there was more awareness of the existence of fixed MRSA remediation protocols, procedures for handling specific pathogens, and logging of MRSA remediation when staff hygiene training had been conducted within the past 12 months. In the light of demographic changes and the associated increase in the number of multi-morbid, chronically ill patients in need of care, adequate hygiene management should be implemented in a standardized, comprehensive manner. This includes annual trainings as well as a standardized application of hygiene procedures. ","281":"To validate a German translation of construct-validated implementation outcomes of Proctor et al.

However, despite the increasing body of evidence about relevant differences between women and men regarding healthcare, the prevention, management and treatment of many common diseases do not yet reflect the knowledge of sex\/gender characteristics. Furthermore, in the development of clinical practice guidelines, which are a valuable tool for knowledge transfer between scientific evidence and healthcare, sex\/gender factors are only rarely explicitly and systematically considered. The goal of the current study therefore is to identify barriers and facilitators for the consideration and integration of sex\/gender differences into guidelines, to create a basis for potential solutions and tools to increase the development of sex\/gender sensitive guidelines in the future. Barriers and facilitators for the development of sex\/gender sensitive guidelines were identified by conducting semi-structured interviews with twelve experts in national and international guideline development (guideline authors and coordinators), as well as gender experts (female: n=8). The selection of experts followed a purposeful sampling strategy and the interview data was analyzed using the qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. The views on barriers and facilitators were allocated to and summarized in five categories with ten subcategories. The identified barriers mainly addressed the increasing complexity of guidelines, the lack of availability and quality of sex\/gender sensitive evidence, and the shortage of resources. In addition, barriers were identified in an individual\/professional context, such as deficiencies in awareness\/knowledge about relevant sex\/gender differences. The results of facilitating factors showed that experts see political policies and standards from guideline organizations as support for the consideration of sex\/gender factors in guideline development. The perspective of experts illustrates that besides organizational and political inventions, individual and social factors should also be addressed in order to achieve behavioral change.

Decision makers sometimes neglect important criteria, give undue weight to criteria, or do not use the best available evidence to inform their judgments. Thus, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group developed a system to support transparent decision making. The purpose of the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework is to help people use evidence in a structured and transparent way to inform decisions in the context of clinical recommendations, coverage decisions, and health system, or public health recommendations and decisions. EtD frameworks include the formulation of the question, an assessment of the evidence, and drawing conclusions. EtD frameworks inform users of recommendations about judgments that were made and the evidence supporting these judgments by making the basis for decisions transparent to target audiences.

The GermanIMPACT study evaluates whether this low-threshold model using short behavioral interventions that are conducted by care managers and supervised by a psychotherapist\/psychiatrist, is as effective as in other countries. Besides effectiveness, the feasibility of the intervention is also essential for the implementation of the program. Care managers and supervisors were interviewed using a qualitative interview guide with questions concerning feasibility and effectiveness of the GermanIMPACT intervention, and the interviews were then evaluated using qualitative content analysis. The interviewees provided important information on how to optimize the realization of the intervention by selecting patients more carefully and by providing case managers with more training. Moreover, the intervention was described as being supportive of patients and as providing relief for general practitioners. Whereas interviewees wanted the intervention to be expanded to other disorders, they simultaneously highlighted the limits of the intervention. The present study provides practical information for implementing the GermanIMPACT model. Thus, specific recommendations for implementation into standard care can be derived.

However, resulting challenges for patient safety have rarely been considered. Against this background we aimed to explore whether international recommendations for patient safety in home care in general and in intensive home care in particular already exist and how they can stimulate further practice development in Germany. A review of online English documents containing recommendations for patient safety in intensive home care was conducted. Available documents were analyzed and compared in terms of their form and content. Overall, a small number of relevant documents could be identified. None of these documents exclusively refer to the intensive home care sector. Despite their differences, however, the analysis of four selected documents showed similarities, e. g., regarding specific topics of patient safety (communication, involvement of patients and their relatives, risk assessment, medication management, qualification). Furthermore, strengths and weaknesses of the documents became apparent: e. g., an explicit understanding of patient safety, a literature-based introduction to safety topics or an adaptation of the recommendations to the specific features of home care were occasionally lacking. This document analysis provides interesting input to the formal and content-related development of specific recommendations and to practice development in Germany to improve patient safety in home care.

Systems supporting an automated steering system of documents are called document management systems (DMS), and they also enter the healthcare sector. The use of DMS in the German healthcare sector has hardly been investigated so far. To close this knowledge gap, interviews were carried out with German university hospitals over a six-month period and subjected to a qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. In total, 25 university hospitals agreed to participate in this study, 19 of which have been working with a digital DMS for about six years on average. There was a great variety among the IT systems used. Document management and usability of the DMS as well as its integration into existing IT structures were key decision-making criteria for the selection of a digital DMS. In general, the long-term usability of the DMS is supported by regular evaluation of one's own requirements for the system, administration and training programs. In addition, DMS have a positive effect on patient safety and the quality of medical care.","295":"Inpatient administrative data from hospitals is already used nationally and internationally in many areas of internal and public quality assurance in healthcare. For sepsis as the principal condition, only a few published approaches are available for Germany. The aim of this investigation is to identify factors influencing hospital mortality by employing appropriate analytical methods in order to improve the internal quality management of sepsis. The analysis was based on data from 754,727 DRG cases of the CLINOTEL hospital network charged in 2015. The association then included 45 hospitals of all supply levels with the exception of university hospitals (range of beds: 100 to 1,172 per hospital). Cases of sepsis were identified via the ICD codes of their principal diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors influencing in-hospital lethality for this population. The model was developed using sociodemographic and other potential variables that could be derived from the DRG data set, and taking into account current literature data. The model obtained was validated with inpatient administrative data of 2016 (51 hospitals, 850,776 DRG cases). Following the definition of the inclusion criteria, 5,608 cases of sepsis (2016: 6,384 cases) were identified in 2015. A total of 12 significant and, over both years, stable factors were identified, including age, severity of sepsis, reason for hospital admission and various comorbidities. The AUC value of the model, as a measure of predictability, is above 0.8 (H-L test p&gt;0.05, R2 value=0.27), which is an excellent result. The CLINOTEL model of risk adjustment for in-hospital lethality can be used to determine the mortality probability of patients with sepsis as principal diagnosis with a very high degree of accuracy, taking into account the case mix. Further studies are needed to confirm whether the model presented here will prove its value in the internal quality assurance of hospitals.

In order to provide relief for caregivers and stabilize informal care, care and relief services for people with dementia and their caregivers were established by the German long-term care insurance (\"Pflegeversicherung\"). It is unknown how many people with dementia have used the additional care and relief services over the time and which characteristics predict permanent utilization. The analysis is based on administrative data. 2,887 people with prevalent dementia were followed from 2012 to 2015. The data was analyzed descriptively and by logistic regression. About a quarter of the observed people with dementia continuously used the additional care and relief services from 2012 to 2015. 22.8% used them since 2013, while nearly a quarter made no use whatsoever of the services during the observation period. The probability of using care and relief services is higher when using an outpatient nursing service in comparison to family care and when the care level has gone up in the year before use. Permanent utilization of care and relief services seems to be based on need in most cases. It could also be a learning effect or supplier-induced when simultaneously using an outpatient nursing service. People who discontinued service use or never used it could provide further information in order to adjust the additional care and relief services program.

JAMoL's design was based on established clinical measures, the rationale of exposure-based anxiety treatment, and research on family practice-based case management. After piloting, the JAMoL was used in the clinical study 'Jena-PARADISE' (ISRCTN64669297), where non-physician practice staff monitored patients with panic disorder by telephone. Using semi-structured interviews in concomitant studies, study participants were asked about the instrument's functionality. The JAMoL assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms (6 items) as well as the patient's adherence to therapy (4 items) and fosters the case management-related information exchange (3 items). An integrated traffic light scheme facilitates the evaluation of monitoring results. Within the clinical study, non-physician practice staff carried out a total of 1,525 JAMoL-supported monitoring calls on 177 patients from 30 primary care practices (median calls per patient: 10 [interquartile range, 9-10]). Qualitative analyses revealed that most practice teams and patients rated the JAMoL as a practicable and treatment-relevant tool. The JAMoL enables primary care practice teams to continuously monitor anxiety symptoms and treatment adherence in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Within the behavior therapy-oriented treatment program 'Jena-PARADISE', the JAMoL constitutes an important case management tool. ","300":"The impact of patient preferences in evidence-based medicine is a complex issue which touches on theoretical questions as well as medical practice in the clinical context. The interaction between evidence-based recommendations and value-related patient preferences in clinical practice is, however, highly complex and requires not only medical knowledge but social, psychological and communicative competencies on the side of the physician. The multi-layered process of oncology physicians' clinical decision-making was explored in 14 semi-structured interviews with respect to a first diagnosis of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A case vignette was used and the Q method (\"card sorting\") was applied to analyze the influence of different factors (such as evidence, patient preferences and the role of relatives) on physicians' deliberations. Content analysis (Mayring) was performed. The results show that the participating oncologists consider patient preferences as an important guidance which, however, is limited on certain occasions where the physicians assume a leadership role in decision-making. From the interviewees' perspectives, the preferences of the patients' relatives are likewise of high importance because debilitating oncologic treatments can only be carried out if patients have both social and psychological support. There is a need for an ongoing reflection of the physicians' own values and due consideration of the patients' social role within the context of shared decision-making.","301":null,"302":null,"303":"The combination of an ageing population and unequal distribution of healthcare capacity between rural and urban regions requires the development of innovative healthcare models, especially in rural areas, thus increasing the need to involve community representatives.

It is likely that these judicial decisions also affect the sickness funds' decisions on requests for reimbursement and thus patient access to new technologies in general. The aim of this study was to identify the technologies that have repeatedly generated court actions and whether these actions have been successful. The focus was on differences between sectors, technology groups and indications. Based on this, we analysed in a case study whether judicial decisions on the reimbursement of the same technologies vary across the years. Based on a systematic review, we identified judicial decisions of German social courts on new technologies for the years 2011 to 2016. The analysis included social court decisions on reimbursements for technologies used in the treatment of individual patients. 284 judicial decisions on new technologies were considered in the analysis. In one third of the cases, the sickness funds were required to reimburse the costs, with a higher percentage in inpatient than in outpatient care. Technologies used in treatment of diseases of the eyes and the ears were granted most frequently. In cases involving similar circumstances the social courts sometimes came to conflicting decisions; these decisions are, in part, contradictory to subsequent assessments by the Joint Federal Committee (G-BA). Decisions as to whether reimbursement for new technologies is granted or not do not appear to follow a systematic approach. In the context of the seemingly innovation-friendly policy in inpatient care, there is uncertainty with regard to the \"generally accepted state of medical knowledge.\" It is problematic for both patients and their treating physicians that over a number of years legal proceedings are being initiated for technologies that have not been subjected to a systematic assessment of their benefit.

Repeated testing with key feature cases yields better medium-term retention than repeatedly studying the same material (without questions).

Besides implementing top five lists, these aim to change attitudes, expectations and practices in the culture of medicine. The field of internal medicine has initiated change in Switzerland (Swiss Society of General Internal Medicine: Smarter Medicine) and Germany (German Society of Internal Medicine: Klug entscheiden). Formulating Choosing Wisely principles in managing complex patients with multiple concurrent acute or chronic diseases, i. e., multimorbidity (MM), will present a particular challenge. Research is needed to determine the primary sources of overuse in specific combinations of diseases (i. e., MM clusters) and spearhead corresponding recommendations. National Choosing Widely campaigns may serve as a forerunner to a more global initiative.","328":"","329":"An increased popularity of peer-assisted learning in medical schools all over the globe has caused a growing interest in taking a closer look into how student tutors are trained to handle the task. This article provides an overview of the tutor training strategies at five medical faculties in Germany. Nine German medical faculties with an evident tutor training strategy were contacted by phone or e-mail. Ultimately, five of the nine contacted faculties responded and provided a detailed overview of their individual tutor training. In many cases, tutors receive a mandatory didactic training in preparation of the tutorials and also an additional technical or specialized training. Frequently, tutor training is provided within the framework of an organized, faculty-based tutor training program. There is a trend towards a needs-adapted training strategy. There is a broad variety of peer teaching and tutor training strategies at the various faculties surveyed. Their individual characteristics are determined by factors such as the nature of tutorials and the number of students. ","330":"","331":"Patient involvement (PI) in research is increasingly required as a means to improve relevance and meaningfulness of research results. PI has been widely promoted by the National Institute for Health Research in England in the last years. In Germany, widespread involvement of patients in research is still missing. The methods used to realize PI have been developed mainly in English research contexts, and detailed information on how to involve patients in systematic reviews is rare. Therefore, the aim of the study was that patients contribute and prioritize clinically relevant outcomes to a systematic review on meta-cognitive interventions, and to evaluate a patient workshop as well as patients' perceptions of research involvement. Seven patients with experience in psychiatric care participated in our workshop. They focused on outcomes pre-defined in the review protocol (e.g., meta-cognitive or cognitive changes, symptomatology, quality of life), neglected other outcomes (like satisfaction with treatment, acceptability), and added relevant new ones (e.g., scope of action\/autonomy, applicability). Altogether, they valued the explicit workshop participation positively. However, some suggested to involve patients at an earlier stage and to adapt the amount of information given. Further systematic reviews would benefit from the involvement of patients in the definition of other components of the review question (like patients or interventions), in the interpretation of key findings or in drafting a lay summary.","332":"","333":"Peer teaching or peer-assisted learning is a popular topic in the medical education literature. While not one method of education, a categorization is possible according to (a) the developmental distance between learner and peer teacher, (b) the scale or group size of learners in peer teaching arrangements and (c) the extent of formality or structure of the arrangement. That yields many different forms of peer teaching. Viewing peer teaching as a multifaceted method shows several benefits. On a deeper level however peer teaching may be viewed as a philosophy of medical education that has historical roots but aligns well with current thinking of teaching and learning across the continuum of medical education.","334":"The quality of reporting practice guidelines is often poor, and there is no widely accepted guidance or standards for such reporting in health care. The international RIGHT (Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare) Working Group was established to address this gap. The group followed an existing framework for developing guidelines for health research reporting and the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network approach. A checklist and an explanation and elaboration statement were developed. The RIGHT checklist includes 22 items that are considered essential for good reporting of practice guidelines: basic information (items 1 to 4), background (items 5 to 9), evidence (items 10 to 12), recommendations (items 13 to 15), review and quality assurance (items 16 and 17), funding and declaration and management of interests (items 18 and 19), and other information (items 20 to 22). The RIGHT checklist can assist developers in reporting guidelines, support journal editors and peer reviewers when considering guideline reports, and help health care practitioners understand and implement a guideline.","335":"Almost all medical faculties in Germany actively employ peer tutors. However, little is known about the roles these tutors play from a faculty point of view. Also, there are only few descriptions of the tutor recruitment and selection processes. 32 of the medical faculties in Germany, where tutors are used in the training of medical students, were asked to provide information on the role and recruitment of tutors by means of a partially standardized questionnaire. At the surveyed faculties (return rate 28%), tutors are mostly employed for the purpose of teaching staff support. Even though desired in individual cases, tutors rarely play an active role in curriculum- or faculty development. The way tutor recruitment is handled strongly depends on the capabilities of the individual faculties and the way tutors are utilized. In many cases this process is structured, consisting of written and oral application phases, in other cases recruitment takes place without formal application procedures. The selection criteria, however, were found to be very similar at most faculties. The role of tutors from the faculties' point of view depends strongly on the respective nature of the tutorials, which are just as diverse as the approaches to tutor recruitment. ","336":"The effect of public reporting to improve quality in healthcare is reduced by the limited intelligibility of information about the quality of healthcare providers. This may result in worse health-related choices especially for older people and those with lower levels of education. There is, as yet, little information as to whether laymen understand the concepts behind quality comparisons and if this comprehension is correlated with hospital choices. An instrument with 20 items was developed to analyze the intelligibility of five technical terms which were used in German hospital report cards to explain risk-adjusted death rates. Two online presentations of risk-adjusted death rates for five hospitals in the style of hospital report cards were developed. An online survey of 353 volunteers tested the comprehension of the risk-adjusted mortality rates and included an experimental hospital choice. The intelligibility of five technical terms was tested: risk-adjusted, actual and expected death rate, reference range and national average. The percentages of correct answers for the five technical terms were in the range of 75.0-60.2%. Between 23.8% and 5.1% of the respondents were not able to answer the question about the technical term itself. The least comprehensible technical terms were \"risk-adjusted death rate\" and \"reference range\". The intelligibility of the 20 items that were used to test the comprehension of the risk-adjusted mortality was between 89.5% and 14.2%. The two items that proved to be least comprehensible were related to the technical terms \"risk-adjusted death rate\" and \"reference range\". For all five technical terms it was found that a better comprehension correlated significantly with better hospital choices. We found a better than average intelligibility for the technical terms \"actual and expected death rate\" and for \"national average\". The least understandable were \"risk-adjusted death rate\" and \"reference range\". Since the self-explanatory technical terms \"actual and expected death rate\" and \"national average\" are easy to understand and the comprehension is correlated with hospitals choices, we recommend using them for the presentation of measures which contain risk-adjusted mortality. The technical terms \"risk-adjusted death rate\" and \"reference range\" should stay in the background, since comprehension problems can be expected and explanations would have to be provided.

Hospitals only play a minor part in the vaccination subject, although they play a big part in the treatment of chronically ill patients. In this study we wanted to test the practicability of the implementation of vaccination recommendations in discharge letters as a chance to give the subject more attention and involve hospital doctors in the vaccination process. In addition, we analyzed clinical und primary care physicians' attitudes towards these recommendations and vaccination in general. 88.5% of the general practitioners and 81.3% of the hospital doctors consider vaccination recommendations in discharge letters reasonable. 86.3% of the general practitioners said they were willing to perform the recommended vaccinations. The main responsibility in the vaccination process is clearly allocated to general practitioners, but many hospital doctors want to raise the level of attention given to the vaccination subject in their departments. Standardized implementation of vaccination recommendations in discharge letters is a reasonable way to involve hospital doctors in the vaccination process as part of the preventive care services for chronically ill patients. At the same time, general practitioners will be regularly informed about indicated vaccinations for the individual patient.

Indicators were developed by a modified RAND\/UCLA Appropriateness Method with 1) the compilation of an indicator register based on a systematic literature search and analyses of health care claims data, 2) the selection of indicators by an expert panel that rated them for relevance and for feasibility regarding implementation. Indicators rated positive for both relevance and feasibility formed the final indicator set. 847 indicators were identified by different searches. Out of these, 56 were selected for the indicator register. During the formal consensus process the expert panel recommended another 45 indicators so that a total of 101 indicators needed to be considered by the panel. Of these, 27 indicators rated both relevant and feasible were included in the final set of indicators: this set included 4 indicators addressing structures, 19 indicators addressing processes and 4 indicators addressing outcomes. 17 indicators of the set will be reported by hospitals and 8 by psychiatric outpatient facilities. Two indicators considered to be cross-sectoral will be reported by both sectors. F20-F29 and its treatment show some specific features which so far have not been addressed by any procedure within the statutory QA program of the German health care system. These features include: Schizophrenia and related disorders a) are potentially chronic conditions, b) are mainly treated in outpatient settings, c) require a multi-professional treatment approach and d) are treated regionally in catchment areas. These specific features in combination with the peculiarities of some legal, political and organizational characteristics of the German health care system and its statutory QA program have strongly influenced the development of indicators. The result was a seemingly \"imbalanced\" set of indicators with a greater number of indicators for inpatient than for outpatient care despite the fact that clinical reality is otherwise. The circumstances of the German health care system that restricted the development of this cross-sectoral QA procedure addressing care for F20-F29 are also most likely to emerge with the development of cross-sectoral QA procedures for other (potentially) chronic conditions that are mainly treated in the outpatient setting by multi-professional teams or by networks of different providers. In order to be able to develop a QA procedure that mirrors the reality of service provision for (potentially) chronic diseases such as F20-F29 we need to explore further current and new data sources, diminish sectoral borders, and implement health care responsibility on the level of catchment areas.

Regarding the impact of chronic dialysis treatment on the quality of life of patients and on health care costs, quality assurance in dialysis is considered highly relevant. The directive on Quality Assurance in Dialysis (QSD-RL) established an external quality assurance programme on the basis of the assessment of certain quality parameters combined with an internal quality management system based on benchmarking parameters in all dialysis practices and centres. Data on quality parameters are collected and analysed quarterly. Regional associations of statutory health insurance physicians take responsibility for quality improvement measures and sanctions. This article aims to provide an overview of the development of quality parameters from 2008 to 2015. We analysed the summarised annual quality reports published on the website of the Federal Joint Committee between 2009 and 2016. We present results on the so-called core quality parameters duration and frequency of dialysis sessions (both for haemodialysis patients), wKt\/V for peritoneal dialysis patients, and percentage of haemodialysis patients with central venous catheters which has only been measured since 2014. In 2015, 92,000 patients received outpatient dialysis. Between 2008 and 2015, the results for the core quality parameters duration and frequency of haemodialysis improved while the results for wKt\/V seemingly show an unfavourable trend. The percentage of patients with central venous catheters appears to be quite high, and thus indicates that there is potential for quality improvement. For the future, the Federal Joint Committee has resolved to merge the quality assurance programmes in dialysis and in kidney transplantation into a newly designed programme that has the potential to follow patients through all stages and kinds of renal replacement therapy and to focus on further aspects of treatment quality. ","347":"Computer-assisted learning (CAL) programs are becoming more widely used in medical and dental training. However, the combination of CAL programs and evidence-based education in dentistry has not been described previously. The aim was to determine the acceptance and user-friendliness of a CAL program combined with evidence-based training. The didactic concept of the module includes the case-oriented, problem-based embedding of a total of 32 EbM learning assignments, which can be completed interactively and self-determinedly in an interdisciplinary context using focus patients with different diseases. The present study was conducted at the Dental School of the Goethe University in Frankfurt\/Main. Data on acceptance and user-friendliness were collected from three consecutive cohorts of 114 dental students attending their first clinical semester. They used the \"Toothache Walk-in Clinic: FOCUS\" CAL, which can be downloaded via the Internet. The instrument consisted of 64 statements. The first part addressed general information about the user. The second part contained 43 specific statements on the CAL program. These included factors A (handling and technical aspects), B (content and functional range), and C (didactics and suitability for education). Possible responses ranged from 0 to 3 (0 = strongly disagree, 3 = strongly agree). All of the 114 questionnaires distributed were returned (response rate 100%). Most users (90.1%) considered the topics of evidence-based dentistry important for their training. They rated the program by using German school grades, and the overall rating was 2.26 (SD = 0.64). Most students (88.6%) considered the program useful for their clinical training in the treatment of patients. The mean scores for the 43 specific items amounted to 1.90 (factor A, SD = 0.63), 1.55 (factor B, SD = 1.93), and 2.23 (factor C, SD = 0.79). The CAL program with dental medicine vignettes and learning elements for evidence-based medicine received a primarily positive assessment.

","348":"Clinical practice guidelines can change the practice in healthcare only if their recommendations are implemented in a comprehensive way. The German S3 guideline \"Local Therapy of Chronic Wounds in Patients with Peripheral Vascular Disease, Chronic Venous Insufficiency, and Diabetes\" will be updated in 2017. The emphasis here is on the guideline's validity, user-friendliness and implementation into practice. Therefore, the aim was to identify the improvements required in regard to the guideline's methods and content presentation. The methodological approach used was the critical appraisal of the guideline according to established quality criteria and an additional stakeholder survey. Both were conducted between August and November 2016. The guideline and its related documents were reviewed independently by two researchers according to the criteria of the \"Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\" (AGREE-II). Published reviews and peer reviews by external experts and organisations were also taken into account. For the stakeholder survey, a questionnaire with open questions was distributed by e-mail and via the Internet to health professionals and organisations involved in the care of patients with leg ulcers in Germany. The questions were aimed at amendments and new topics based on the stakeholders' experience in inpatient and outpatient care. In addition, the survey focused on gathering suggestions to improve the applicability of the guideline. Suggested new topics and amendments were summarised thematically. The stakeholders' suggestions to improve the applicability, the results of the critical appraisal and the relevant aspects of the external reviews were then summarised according to the AGREE-II domains and presented in a cause and effect diagram. 17 questionnaires (out of 864 sent out by e-mail) were returned. Due to high practice relevance, the stakeholders suggested an expansion of the inclusion criteria to patients with infected wounds and pressure ulcers. They also proposed that plastic surgical procedures, several specific wound products and complementary measures should be included. The guideline is of high methodical quality with respect to the systematic synthesis and the formal expert recommendations. From both the stakeholders' and reviewers' perspectives, the guideline should be more in line with what guideline users regarded as key issues. The recommendations should be more action-oriented. Implementation concepts should be provided to teach, implement and evaluate the guideline in healthcare facilities. The updating process should also follow current standards for guideline development, for systematic reviews and for managing conflict of interests. The guideline is of high methodological quality but currently difficult to implement in clinical practice. The structured evaluation clearly reflects not only the potential for improvement but also provides a transparent theoretical framework for experts and scientific medical societies involved in the guideline updating process. Although some valuable insights were gained from the stakeholders' perspective, the representativeness is limited by the low response rate.

It considers background and central elements of VbHC and discusses similarities and differences between the two authors. Especially the differences raise questions that will hopefully play a role in the German discussion that is still in its infancy. Three complex topics seem to be particularly relevant: the relationship between VbHC and evidence-based health care, the question of who is to benefit from VbHC (total, diseased, patient population?), and the role of moral values especially the value of solidarity with the severely ill and socially deprived.","350":"In 2015, more than 890,000 asylum seekers were registered in Germany. The provision of medical and psychosocial care for asylum seekers is facing numerous obstacles. Access to health care is mostly insufficient, particularly in initial reception centres. The present article describes the development and implementation of an interdisciplinary outpatient clinic for asylum seekers at the main registration authority in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg operated by physicians of the University Hospital of Heidelberg and the local Medical Association in Heidelberg. A steering committee was appointed to plan and implement the interdisciplinary outpatient clinic. Semi-structured interviews with nine steering committee members were conducted to elucidate perceived barriers during the planning and implementation phase. The steering committee's strong personal commitment and the health authorities' impartial management were cited as the main contributing factors to the success of the implementation process. Significant barriers were seen in the funding of personnel, equipment, and language mediation as well as in legal liability and billing-related aspects. Results are discussed with a focus on financing, administrative and legal framework as well as language mediation, documentation and further matters that are essential to ensure high-quality care.","351":"The aim of this paper is to identify systematic differences due to sociodemographic and health-related determinants in outpatient healthcare utilisation and access in Germany for the period from 2006 to 2016. The study focuses on frequent users and those reporting particularly long wait times for their physician appointments, and it contributes to assessing the level of health equity in Germany. The investigation draws on nine population surveys conducted by the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (NASHIP), which interviewed 42,925 respondents aged 18 and above. \"Frequent users\" were operationalised as those respondents who reported more than ten consultations with outpatient general practitioners (GPs) and specialists (SPs) in the preceding twelve months. Respondents who experienced wait times of more than one month for their last doctor appointment were categorised as \"very long wait times\". Sociodemographic determinants included age, gender, educational and occupational status, population and region of place of residence, as well as type of health insurance of the respondents. Health-related factors were self-assessed health status and reason for last medical consultation. Statistical analyses were conducted using bivariate and multivariate techniques (logistic regression). Utilisation: Frequent users of GPs and SPs are predominantly respondents in poor health, retirees and younger persons (18 to 34 years of age). Furthermore, people with a lower educational background consult their GPs significantly more often than people with higher levels of education. Also, patients with statutory health insurance coverage visit GPs more frequently than those having private health insurance, whereas the opposite holds true for SP consultations. Access: Very long wait times for GP and SP appointments were most often experienced by respondents who consult GPs and SPs for preventive medical check-ups or health screenings, have statutory health insurance, live in eastern Germany and who are above 60 years of age. In addition, people with higher levels of education are significantly more likely to experience wait times for SP appointments of more than one month than people with a lower educational background. The proportion of frequent users as well as of those reporting very long wait times for SP appointments has increased in Germany over the period examined. This study reveals that a high frequency of GP and SP consultations is primarily associated with self-assessed poor health, indicating that prioritisation is based on clinical need. In order to ensure the same needs-based prioritisation in the access to outpatient healthcare, regulatory measures are required to decrease wait times of more than one month for SP appointments, with a special focus on people with statutory health insurance coverage, residents of eastern Germany and the elderly. ","352":null,"353":"In the mid-1920s Porter and others developed a reform approach for existing health care systems, aiming at a patient-focused, value-based orientation. Improving patient outcomes by attaining, preserving and restoring good health is inherently less costly than dealing with poor health. The authors of the present article will outline that the German statutory accident insurance system, which was already introduced in1884 and is of an evolving nature, reflects key elements of Porter's efficient value-based health care system. The German accident insurance system with its statutory mandate limited to the prevention and rehabilitation of work-related damage to one's health can also serve as a model for other larger health care insurance systems. Prevention and rehabilitation is pursued using all appropriate means to achieve the set goals of protecting and restoring individual health. In line with these objectives, the statutory health insurance controls the process in terms of the required care quality. The components of a complex health care system, usually managed by a variety of different institutions, are consolidated. Thus it can be ensured that in both prevention and rehabilitation all services that are necessary to keep focussing the value \"individual health\" rather than indemnities are applied.","354":"Systematic reviews aim at searching, selecting, analyzing and synthesizing scientific literature in a transparent and systematic way in order to inform decision-making in the health care system on the basis of the best available evidence. In recent years, such reviews have also gained importance also in bio-, public health- and research ethics, as well as in health technology assessment. Such reviews do not only analyze ethically relevant empirical literature (e.g. on risk and benefit), but normative literature as well, i.e. literature consisting of ethical arguments. As the appraisal of the literature that should be included is paramount for a systematic review, the problem of how to appraise the quality of normative literature arises. This problem has not yet been solved satisfactorily. After developing a pragmatic definition for \"normative literature\", a typology of different types of systematic reviews of normative literature is presented. Based on existing approaches for quality appraisal, this paper identifies three possible strategies for solving the problem of quality appraisal of normative literature, and discusses their respective strength and weaknesses relative to the different types of systematic reviews. It becomes apparent that none of the existing approaches is able to solve the problem of quality appraisal in a general and convincing way. The paper concludes with stating minimal conditions regarding the elaboration of future strategies, and outlines a promising strategy that is theoretically acceptable and practically feasible.","355":"Pay for performance (P4P) links reimbursement to the achievement of quality objectives. Experiences with P4P instruments and studies on their effects are available for the inpatient sector. A systematic narrative review brings together findings concerning the use and the effects of P4P, especially in dental care. A systematic literature search in PubMed and the Cochrane Library for reimbursement models using quality indicators provided 77 publications. Inclusion criteria were: year of publication not older than 2007, dental sector, models of quality-oriented remuneration, quality of care, quality indicators. 27 publications met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated with regard to the instruments and effects of P4P. The database search was supplemented by a free search on the Internet as well as a search in indicator databases and portals. The results of the included studies were extracted and summarized narratively. 27 studies were included in the review. Performance-oriented remuneration is an instrument of quality competition. In principle, P4P is embedded in an existing remuneration system, i.e., it does not occur in isolation. In the United States, England and Scandinavia, models are currently being tested for quality-oriented remuneration in dental care, based on quality indicators. The studies identified by the literature search are very heterogeneous and do not yield comparable endpoints. Difficulties are seen in the reproducibility of the quality of dental care with regard to certain characteristics which still have to be defined as quality-promoting properties. Risk selection cannot be ruled out, which may have an impact on structural quality (access to care, coordination). There were no long-term effects of P4P on the quality of care. In the short and medium term, adverse effects on the participants' motivation as well as shifting effects towards the private sector are described. A prerequisite for the functioning of P4P is the definition of clear targets and measuring parameters. Furthermore, evidence-based quality indicators have to be developed that validly depict quality differences. It is yet unknown whether P4P will have long-term effects or whether the quality of dental care will increase.

E-mail invitations to participate in the study were sent to all 543 medical doctors of the University Hospital Hanover, Germany, who had taken part in one of the leadership and management courses offered between June 2005 and June 2015. The enquiry was carried out between June 1 and June 30, 2015. 84 e-mail addresses were no longer active; and so, N=459 clinicians actually received the invitation. Of these, 104 participated (22.7%). The study included 59 items. Six were free text items, twelve items were closed questions which could be answered by choosing from a drop down menu, and 41 were answered on a Likert scale from 0 (not fitting at all) to 10 (perfect fit). Based on the items answered on a Likert scale, the following scales and mean values were deduced: Job Satisfaction (M=7.44); Leadership (M=7.77); Trust (M=7.22); Striving for Power (M=7,45); negative Affect (M=4,91); Target Achievement Motivation (M=8.19); Communication (M=8.30) and Management (M=6.48). Regression analysis showed that Job- and Team Satisfaction can predict to what extent the participants regard themselves as good leaders. The study participants defined the following topics as very important: leadership and management style, managerial functions, team management, human resources development and project management. Further topics included rhetoric skills, presentation techniques, as well as basic economics such as understanding balance sheets, profit &amp; loss statements and contribution margin calculation. 55% of the course contents were described as being directly applicable to their daily working environment. In the clinicians' view, the ideal leader acts as a role model (passing on values like respect, appreciation, honesty, openness, fairness, sense of justice, and empathy), someone who motivates his colleagues by giving them a vision, structure and transparency. The participants estimated that they met 60% of these qualifications. 51% of the participants found the course highly beneficial, and 45% rated it as being beneficial. 55% said that the course boosted their career. 96% were willing to attend further leadership and management courses. 98% would recommend the course to their colleagues. The return rate of 22.7%, the subjective benefit of the courses (96%), the willingness to attend such courses (96%) and to recommend them to colleagues (98%) demonstrates that clinicians are highly interested in leadership and management topics. This may be due to the fact that these topics are not part of the training program for medical students or junior doctors.

Experts identified two key overarching patient safety and regulatory issues in relation to office-based surgery and anaesthesia in Switzerland. First, experts repeatedly raised the current lack of data and transparency of the setting. It is unknown how many surgeons are operating in offices, how many and what types of operations are being done, and what the outcomes are. Secondly, experts also noted the limited oversight and regulation of the setting. While some standards exists, most experts felt that more minimal safety standards are needed regarding the requirements that must be met to do office-based surgery and what can and cannot be done in the office-based setting are needed, but they advocated a self-regulatory approach.

For a long time this issue has been avoided in healthcare debates. As a result, normative directives are still missing, which can lead to priority setting among healthcare providers in daily healthcare practice. Prioritization can be conducted at three different levels: at the government (macro), the institutional (meso), and the patient (micro) level. Surveys about societal preferences for different criteria exist; however, specifications on their respective weighting in the situation of approval and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals (meso) are missing. For this reason, the present study analyzed the implementation and weighting of the criteria for priority setting at the meso level, taking values and experiences of the participants into account. Six qualitative focus groups were carried out with representatives from the fields of medicine, ethics, public health and economics. During the discussions four fictitious drugs for the treatment of different lung diseases were prioritized based on guidelines. The discussion processes were analyzed according to Bohnsack's documentary method. The criteria \"quality of life\", \"life expectancy\" and \"other patient-relevant outcomes\" were discussed in relation to each other. The evaluation of change in patient-relevant outcomes was difficult to perform for non-medical participants. The second argument concerned the criteria \"costs\", disease severity and \"number of patients\". Costs were given less weight, but were often used to support other criteria. Other challenges in reaching a consensus included emerging role conflicts between profession and personal opinion, and the transfer of the discussion to a different level of decision-making. In the discussions the problem of prioritizing did not arise from different preferences for prioritization criteria, but from the weighting of the criteria.

In spite of interest among some health professionals in SDM and increasing attention to patient involvement in decisions, very little has been done to train Iranian health professionals in SDM. There is also no clear strategy or policy to support SDM implementation within the national health system, and initiatives to promote SDM are in their infancy. What does the future look like? SDM's future in Iran seems promising. However, implementation of SDM will depend on strengthening collaborations among patients, health professionals, academics and policy makers, along with the Iranian government investing in promoting SDM.","374":"The main focus of the paper is on the description of the development and current state of research and implementation of patient-centered care (PCC) and shared decision making (SDM) after fifteen years of substantial advances in health policy and health services research. What is the current state of SDM in health policy? The \"Patients' Rights Act\" from 2013 standardizes all rights and responsibilities within the framework of medical treatment for German citizens and legal residents. This comprises the right to informed decisions, comprehensive and comprehensible information for patients, and decisions based on a clinician-patient-partnership. What is the current state of SDM interventions and patient decision support tools? SDM training programs for healthcare professionals have been developed. Their implementation in medical schools has been successful. Several decision support tools - primarily with support from health insurance funds and other public agencies - are to be implemented in routine care, specifically for national cancer screening programs. What is the current state of research and routine implementation? The German government and other public institutions are constantly funding research programs in which patient-centered care and shared decision-making are important topics. The development and implementation of decision tools for patients and professionals as well as the implementation of CME trainings for healthcare professionals require future efforts. What does the future look like? With the support of health policy and scientific evidence, transfer of PCC and SDM to practice is regarded as meaningful. Research can help to assess barriers, facilitators, and needs, and subsequently to develop and evaluate corresponding strategies to successfully implement PCC and SDM in routine care, which remains challenging.","375":"In this paper we present the evolution of shared decision making since the mid-nineties in terms of legislation, official statements and guidelines. We outline the goals and declarations of the French Ministry of Health and the French National Authority for Health, for whom informing patients and shared decision-making are central concerns. Finally, we discuss research projects and clinical initiatives in shared decision-making in France and provide a general overview of progress and barriers to progress.","376":"","377":"Norway has traditionally high standards regarding civil rights particularly emphasizing equal access to societal resources including health care. This background and the health care system's centralized national organization make it perfectly suited for implementation of shared decision making (SDM). In recent years, great efforts have been made by policy- makers, regional health authorities and not least the patients to facilitate a process of change in health communication culture. SDM is currently even given highest priority in health care strategies on all system levels. SDM has been structurally implemented, e.g. by including corresponding guidance in the standard patient pathways. Moreover, SDM is established as an element of service on the national health portal hosting a constantly increasing number of decision aids. Essentially the Norwegian Knowledge Center for Health Services contributes by searching and providing information for use in decision aids. Implementation is now being rolled out unit by unit for a list of medical problems as a series production of SDM using decision aids and health professional training. Importantly, production of SDM begins and succeeds as a soundly structured communication with both clinical environments and patients. However, as communication training has not been implemented before now, there are no data demonstrating sufficient realization of SDM in current health care. Beyond making reasonable use of scientific achievements, the Norwegian movement's secret of success is the simultaneous commitment of all actors of the health system to a common idea.","378":"","379":"Argentina is a high-middle income country located in Southern South America with an estimated population of 44 million inhabitants. The epidemiological profile of the population is characterised by an increase of non-communicable diseases. The health system is heterogeneous, fragmented and loosely integrated. There are no unified research agenda or government initiatives encouraging the implementation of and research on shared decision making (SDM). Progress has been made lately to respect patient autonomy through the enactment of the 'Patients' Rights Act', which expressly enshrines the right of patients to get information as a key element of decision-making. To our knowledge, the team at the Department of Family and Community Medicine of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires is the only one working on shared decision making in Argentina. This department carries out research, medical undergraduate and graduate training, and clinical practice implementation activities through strategies aimed at professionals and patients alike. We face some challenges regarding SDM, such as: 1) the fragmentation and the heterogeneity of the local health system; 2) we are a small group of people working on this topic who, simultaneously, have care, management, teaching and research responsibilities; 3) we have no government support and project funding is scarce; 4) due to the geographic location of the country, we must make a great effort in order to attend events on the state of the art in SDM. Given the current state of our health system, we believe the government is not likely to encourage, implement or research on SDM in the short term. Our group will continue to work on the local initiative and also to instil it in other interested groups.","380":"Peer-assisted learning (PAL) has a long tradition and is nowadays implemented in the curricula of most medical faculties. Besides traditional areas of application like problem-based learning, anatomy, or CPR, more and more departments and institutes have established PAL as part of their everyday teaching. This narrative review provides some background information and basic definitions of PAL. It offers an overview on features and determinants as well as underlying learning theories and developments in PAL. In addition, motives for implementation are highlighted followed by a comparison of advantages and disadvantages. After outlining aspects of quality management including the training of tutors and the evaluation and acceptance of PAL formats, this review concludes with an outlook on how PAL can proceed into the future and where further research is necessary.","381":null,"382":"In view of the rising cost pressure and an increasing number of drug shortages, switches between generic drug preparations have become a daily routine in hospitals. To ensure consistently high treatment quality and best possible patient safety, the equivalence of the new and the previous drug preparation must be ensured before any change in the purchase of pharmaceutical products takes place. So far, no easily usable, transparent and standardized instrument for this kind of comparison between generic drug products has been available. A group of pharmaceutical experts has developed the drug HTA (health technology assessment) model \"HERA\" (HTA Evaluation of geneRic phArmaceutical products) through a multi-step process. The instrument is designed to perform both a qualitative and economic comparison of equivalent drug preparations (\"aut idem\" substitution) before switching products. The economic evaluation does not only consider unit prices and consumption quantity, but also the processing costs associated with a product change process. The qualitative comparison is based on the evaluation of 34 quality criteria belonging to six evaluation fields (e.g., approval status, practical handling, packaging design). The objective evaluation of the quality criteria is complemented by an assessment of special features of the individual hospital for complex drug switches, including the feedback of the physicians utilizing the drug preparation. Thus potentially problematic switches of pharmaceutical products can be avoided at the best possible rate, contributing to the improvement of patient safety. The novel drug HTA model HERA is a tool used in clinical practice that can add to an increase in quality, therapeutic safety and transparency of drug use while simultaneously contributing to the economic optimization of drug procurement in hospitals. Combining these two is essential for hospitals facing the tension between rising cost pressure and at the same time increasing demands on quality and transparency, triggered by, amongst others, current legislation (Hospital Structures Act, anti-corruption legislation).","383":"It is conventional knowledge that travel is educational and that a study stay in a foreign country contributes to a student's personality formation and well-roundedness. The benefit of such experiences on attitudes that shape professional aptitude and career success may, however, be debated. It could be argued that exposure to experiences that are irrelevant to a student's chosen profession may have no sizeable impact - thus not justifying the invested time and money - or, in an extreme case, may even be detrimental to career success if the wrong conclusions are drawn. Examples for such occurrences may include the adoption of inappropriate belief systems, educational priorities, or work habits. In this study, it was investigated how a short-term study stay abroad was reflected in the self-efficacy of students and graduates of a professional Master of Science program. A cohort of U.S. American students of Prosthetics and Orthotics who had participated in non-compulsory study excursions to Germany and a comparable cohort of their peers who had not participated in such trips were asked to state their confidence in mastering specific hypothetical situations of daily work life. About one half of the subjects of each group had already graduated and were in residence at the time of the survey, whereas the remaining half was still in their first year of the study program. Answers were compared using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis to investigate main and interaction effects of professional experience and short-term stay abroad. The results seem to support the hypothesis that the experience was beneficial, making the inclusion of respective course offerings recommendable.","384":"Peru has achieved sustained development in the last two decades. However, despite this achievement, it has not been matched with improvements in the quality of education and health; investment in both sectors is among the lowest in the region. This situation perpetuates huge gaps in infrastructure and also conditions a poor literacy level of the population specifically in health. Currently, there is a fragmented model of patient care, in which the systems are exclusive of each other. They do not cooperate or communicate with each other; and if there is no vertical communication within the system, preventing referral of patients directly from the basic level to the complex level of care when needed. In addition, there has been no progress in the development of an empathetic, respectful or person-centered clinical practice; instead, economic, social and educational differences perpetuate a paternalistic clinical practice. The task of orienting medical training towards the development of humanism is pending. The patient is the center of the medical act and the main objective of doctors' actions. A humanistic care approach will not only empower the person in the clinical encounter - to participate and make decisions related to his\/her health care - but it will allow us to move towards an empathetic, caring, respectful and kind model of clinical practice.","385":"The aim of this paper is to update the previous review on the state of patient and public participation in healthcare in Italy. Policymakers consider patient involvement an important aspect in health care decisions and encourage patients to actively participate in the clinical interaction. Nevertheless, the term shared decision making (SDM) is still not clearly defined. Patient associations promote patient participation in health care decisions. Several experts attended the latest consensus conference about patient engagement to reach a consensus on the definition of SDM. Research regarding SDM in Italy continues to increase with 17 articles published between 2012 and 2017. Researchers have assessed the variables associated with patient involvement and explored the use of the SDM approach in different medical settings. Despite the dedicated SDM initiative, researchers in Italy recognize room for improvement. Work is needed to reach a common language regarding SDM and its mechanisms to implement this approach at the clinical level.","386":"Shared decision making in the United States is increasingly being recognized as part of value-based care. During the last decade, several state and federal initiatives have linked shared decision making with reimbursement and increased protection from litigation. Additionally, private and public foundations are increasingly funding studies to identify best practices for moving shared decision making from the research world into clinical practice. These shifts offer opportunities and challenges for ensuring effective implementation.","387":"Shared decision making (SDM) is firmly on the policy agenda in the UK and a recent legal ruling has confirmed its importance. Policymakers, ethicists, professional regulators and societies, patient organisations and now the courts are committed to ensuring that SDM becomes the norm throughout the NHS, but an unfavourable economic climate makes this especially challenging. Considerable progress has been made over the last few years, with new learning from demonstration sites, various initiatives in capacity building and training, wider availability of patient decision aids, and important leadership initiatives. Enthusiasm for this way of working is growing among clinicians, patients and managers, but it could be undermined if SDM comes to be seen primarily as a means of cost control.","388":"Canada's approach to shared decision making (SDM) remains as disparate as its healthcare system; a conglomerate of 14 public plans - ten provincial, three territorial and one federal. The healthcare research funding environment has been largely positive for SDM because there was funding for knowledge translation research which also encompassed SDM. The funding climate currently places new emphasis on patient involvement in research and on patient empowerment in healthcare. SDM fields have expanded from primary care to elder care, paediatrics, emergency and critical care medicine, cardiology, nutrition, occupational therapy and workplace rehabilitation. Also, SDM has reached out to embrace other health-related decisions including about home care and social care and has been adapted to Aboriginal decision making needs. Canadian researchers have developed new interprofessional SDM models that are being used worldwide. Professional interest in SDM in Canada is not yet widespread, but there are provincial initiatives in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan. Decision aids are routinely used in some areas, for example for prostate cancer in Saskatchewan, and many others are available for online consultation. The Patient Decision Aids Research Group in Ottawa, Ontario maintains an international inventory of decision aids appraised with the International Patient Decision Aid Standards. The Canada Research Chair in SDM and Knowledge Translation in Quebec City maintains a website of SDM training programs available worldwide. These initiatives are positive, but the future of SDM in Canada depends on whether health policies, health professionals and the public culture fully embrace it.","389":"Patients' rights to autonomy, information and participation in their own health care are recognized in the Spanish legal system from the early 2000's. Public institutions have progressively launched several initiatives to promote and improve patients' empowerment and self-care. However, the concept of shared decision making (SDM), although embedded in the more general concept of \"active\/empowered patient\", usually has not been specifically advocated as an essential requisite for improving the quality of health services, either in the legal normative or the existing educational proposals. Research on SDM and the development of Patient Decision Aids (PtDAs) has increasingly grown and currently there are several of these materials available for patients with different diseases. Along with this research activity, the growing interest of patients and professionals in patient participation and SDM makes us optimistic about a gradual development of this care model in the medium term. However, there are several limitations and challenges that must be overcome in the near future. The implementation of PtDAs in clinical practice is imperative and issues such as their inclusion in clinical guidelines and electronic medical records should be encouraged. Concurrently, it is necessary to train professionals in SDM skills and the use of encounter PtDAs.","390":"What about the political climate? Although there is no explicit description of patient involvement in Danish legislation, patient-centred care is on the political agenda in Denmark. It is integrated as one of eight new national indicators of quality in health care, as well as in the most recent national plan for cancer treatment. What about tools for patient decision support? Development of evidence-based patient decision aids (PDAs) are still at an early stage in Denmark, but recent national and private funding has helped push the field forward. Furthermore, a few stakeholders have started working more systematically with developing and testing PDAs in clinical settings. What about implementation? There is growing interest among Danish health care professionals, but SDM is still far from standard practice in Denmark. Although some courses in SDM and use of PDAs now exist, few health care professionals have received systematic training, and there is little knowledge about implementation and sustainability of SDM in daily clinical practice. What does the future look like for SDM in Denmark? Future progress will depend on the extent to which SDM is systematically integrated in the daily routines of health care professionals and in patient trajectories across treatment courses. The Danish health care system needs to invest further in training and to start addressing the challenges on the organisational and system level, which affect implementation.","391":"Currently, shared decision making (SDM) is on the agenda among target patient representative groups, policy makers and professional bodies. Although the International Conference for Shared Decision Making (ISDM) 2011 generated a positive boost, hesitation was also felt among Dutch clinicians, who are challenged by many new tasks. No hesitation is seen among the majority of patients, opting mostly for the SDM model. We haven't reached these patients' needs fully yet, given disappointing research data on patients' experiences and professional behaviour. There is plenty of room for improvement in daily practice, for which many best practices are being designed and increasingly implemented, such as national campaigns to empower patients, central governance of patient decision aids that are developed along clinical practice guidelines, postgraduate training, collaborative learning and system changes, and merging goal setting and SDM in complex care. This is explicitly supported by the Dutch government, the Ministry of Health, patient groups, professional bodies and health insurers. The culture shift in the minds and hearts of patients and clinicians has started but is still ongoing. Enthusiasm for this way of working could be undermined if SDM is defined and implemented in a simplistic, dogmatic manner leading to irresponsible transferring of the professionals' uncertainty, responsibility, and decisional stress to patients.","392":"The Chilean legislation establishes that patients have rights and responsibilities in regards to their healthcare. This is an important statement as it declares that people must be informed and become actively involved in their care; meanwhile, the health system needs to coordinate the provision of personalised and effective services. Although patient-centred care (PCC) and shared decision making (SDM) are relatively new concepts in Chile, the country is experiencing an interesting political momentum to create more interventions to achieve PCC and SDM and explore clinical implementation. Currently, research efforts in Chile have focused on better understanding the state of the art related to both concepts and how new clinical approaches could help to operationalize them.","393":"Israel has a universal-national healthcare system and a progressive health policy legislation which, together, provide its residents with high-level healthcare services and either free or highly subsidized coverage without any pre-existing conditions. However, it is surprising that shared decision making (SDM) practices and policy are not an integral part of Israel's healthcare system. The purpose of this overview is to describe the gap between the organizational-infrastructure compatibility of Israel's universal healthcare policy and the efforts needed to advance SDM as part of routine healthcare practice. Review of recent research and education initiatives will be described as well as recommendations for policy and clinical practice.","394":"China's healthcare system has undergone extensive changes over recent years and the most recent reforms are designed to shift the emphasis away from hospital based services towards a more primary care based system. There is an increasing recognition that shared decision making needs to play a central role in the delivery of healthcare in China, but there are several significant barriers to overcome before this aspiration becomes a reality. Doctor-patient relationships in China are poor, consultations are often brief transactions and levels of trust are low. Implementing a shared decision making process developed in the Western World may be hampered by cultural differences, although this remains an under-researched area. There is, however, a suggestion that the academic community is starting to take an interest in encouraging shared decision making in practice and indications that the Chinese public may be willing to consider this new approach to healthcare.","395":"Shared decision making (SDM) is now firmly established within national clinical standards for accrediting hospitals, day procedure services, public dental services and medical education in Australia, with plans to align general practice, aged care and disability service. Implementation of these standards and training of health professionals is a key challenge for the Australian health sector at this time. Consumer involvement in health research, policy and clinical service governance has also increased, with a major focus on encouraging patients to ask questions during their clinical care. Tools to support shared decision making are increasingly used but there is a need for more systemic approaches to their development, cultural adaptation and implementation. Sustainable solutions to ensure tools are kept up-to-date with the best available evidence will be important for the future.","396":"Shared decision making (SDM) activities in Malaysia began around 2010. Although the concept is not widespread, there are opportunities to implement SDM in both the public and private healthcare sectors. Malaysia has a multicultural society and cultural components (such as language differences, medical paternalism, strong family involvement, religious beliefs and complementary medicine) influence medical decision making. In terms of policy, the Ministry of Health has increasingly mentioned patient-centered care as a component of healthcare delivery while the Malaysian Medical Council's guidelines on doctors' duties mentioned collaborative partnerships as a goal of doctor-patient relationships. Current research on SDM comprises baseline surveys of decisional role preferences, development and implementation of locally developed patient decision aids, and conducting of SDM training workshops. Most of this research is carried out by public research universities. In summary, the current state of SDM in Malaysia is still at its infancy. However, there are increasing recognition and efforts from the academic institutions and Ministry of Health to conduct research in SDM, develop patient decision support tools and initiate national discussion on patient involvement in decision making.","397":"Up to now, little attention has been paid to West Africa when it comes to shared decision making (SDM). West African countries seem to lag behind with regard to SDM initiatives compared to many other countries in the world. There is some interest in informed decision making or informed consent, but little in a full SDM process. Few decision-making tools are available for healthcare professionals and the majority are not designed to support decision-making with patients. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no training programs for implementing SDM in healthcare teams. Many barriers exist to implementing SDM in West Africa, including lack of options, few or poor health resources and low levels of education. However, African countries present many opportunities for SDM as well. Existing SDM innovations developed for other populations with low literacy could be explored and adapted to the West African context, and research on implementation and outcomes in West Africa could contribute to SDM worldwide. West African countries are in an excellent position to both learn from other countries and contribute to SDM development in other parts of the world. In this paper we reflect on SDM challenges and opportunities, and propose a research agenda for West Africa. We hope to awaken interest in SDM in West Africa and encourage future collaborations on SDM with various West African stakeholders, including patients, healthcare professionals, policymakers, non-government organisations (NGOs) and academic institutions.","398":"Switzerland with its decentralized, liberal health system and its tradition of direct democracy may be an ideal place for shared decision making (SDM) to take root organically, rather than using top-down regulations seen in other countries. There are now multiple directives and programmes in place to encourage SDM, with the creation of several decision aids and specific training programs in the five Swiss medical schools. There has been an emphasis on preventive care, with the integration of patient preference into an organized colorectal cancer screening program, clear recommendations for prostate cancer screening, and inroads into the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Focusing on the experience of the University of Lausanne, we describe multiple approaches being taken to teaching SDM and the local development of decision aids, drawing on international experience but tailored to local needs. Efforts are being made to further involve patients in not only SDM, but also associated research and quality improvement projects.","399":"The paper aims to introduce the current status of shared decision making (SDM) in Taiwan under its mixed health care system and single-payer health insurance system. With experiences in promoting both evidence based medicine and patient safety, the Joint Commission of Taiwan has implemented a nationwide SDM program under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Welfare since 2016, incorporating multiple approaches such as developing patient decision aids (PDAs), executing the Medical Decision Aids Campaign, establishing a SDM platform, and integrating SDM in clinical practice. In this article, we share the positive and negative responses to the SDM program from hospitals, health care providers, and patients.","400":null,"401":null,"402":null,"403":"","404":"The integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) is increasingly considered in the development of healthcare structures. This fact is also recognised in the e-Health Act. In this context, personal health records (PHR) have a specific meaning. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview on utilization, barriers and possible effects on the implementation of PHR. This analysis is based on a literature search in Web of Science (Core Collection) (01\/2000 to 12\/2014) using the following terms: \"personal health record\", \"personal medical record\", \"personal electronic health record\", \"interpersonal health record\", \"personally controlled health record\". In general, patients have positive attitudes towards the electronic exchange of personal health information (PHI) on a PHR. Even the sharing of PHI with physicians, health professionals, family and friends appears to be an option for many patients. Physicians also see the potential of a PHR on the internet, but they are more critical than patients. Barriers exist towards the use of complex and non-intuitive PHR concepts along with technical faults and the lack of functionality. From the physicians' perspective, prejudices concerning the use of PHR have not been confirmed and, other than previously expected, the workload has not increased so much. However, clinical outcomes have so far been rather moderate. Stronger effects may be achieved by embedding the PHR in a broader healthcare concept. In the context of chronic disease, a connected PHR (patient-controlled, cross-sectoral, and interoperable) can be a valuable tool for organizing healthcare for patients. To take full effect, the development of such systems should focus on patients and their families as well as on physicians and other healthcare professionals. Whether the e-Health Act is a step in the right direction will have to be established by future analysis. ","405":"A novel peer-led communication seminar for medical students and for students of the Interprofessional Health Care B.Sc. degree programme at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg is currently being developed to address the increasing need for interprofessional collaborative competencies in health care professionals. The core elements of this course include role plays in interprofessional communication situations, patient-centred professional practice, and reflections on underlying attitudes. Each seminar will be conducted by a team of two senior students from both undergraduate programmes, practising their new roles as interprofessional tutors and, at the same time, serving as competent role models for interprofessional collaboration. To provide tutors with the necessary didactic preparation, an interprofessional tutor training was developed and implemented. It was positively evaluated and well accepted by participants. The seminar and tutor training concept presented in this paper aims to foster (inter-)professional ethics and communication competency development in medical students.","406":"The assessment of quality of life is a central aspect in the current debate in support groups, certified cancer centres, benefit assessment, and also in palliative care. Accordingly, quality of life has become an essential part of clinical trials for more than two decades. But most of the time results are presented in a descriptive manner without any concrete therapeutic consequences for the improvement of quality of life. Likewise, there are no uniform recommendations for considering quality of life data in the decision-making process. Therefore, a guide with recommendations for the assessment of quality of life in trials has been developed. Its implementation is illustrated by a complex intervention for a targeted diagnosis and therapy of quality of life in patients with breast cancer or colorectal cancer. The basis is a standardised quality of life assessment and the presentation of results in an intelligible fashion as well as the close collaboration of all healthcare providers to create regional network structures for the targeted support of patients in both the inpatient and outpatient sector.","407":"","408":null,"409":"","410":"\"Putting patients first in health care\" seems to be a rhetorical statement. But is it really the case that patients always come first? And where exactly do we stand with patient involvement and patient orientation in Germany? What participation options are currently available? Is the patient involvement and patient orientation we have so far achieved sufficient? What needs to be done? These questions will be addressed in the following discussion. Patient self-help organizations, patient interest groups, patient representatives as well as the industrial and political decision-making bodies agree that the patient perspective should be more strongly integrated into health care and health care delivery decisions. The relevant information and sources of evidence, however, are yet insufficiently provided and used. Patients are experts for their own cause. There is consensus that patient participation is and must be an integral part of all levels of health care. Patient representation has made enormous progress in the last decade. This article outlines the current state of affairs of patient representation, patient involvement, their legal legitimacy and possible future scenarios. The transformation from of a paternalistically oriented health care system towards a patient-oriented system is far advanced, but much remains to be done.

Gender, parental status, training conditions and specialty choice were of particular interest. Postal questionnaires were sent to medical graduates from seven different German faculties annually, starting in 2009. This paper presents cross-sectional data of domestic, working and training conditions four years after graduation. We used descriptive statistics and t-tests. In order to identify factors with an impact on career satisfaction, multiple regression analyses were calculated. Male residents who have children tended to be more satisfied with their career than residents without children. For female residents, however, having children was associated with lower career satisfaction. Those who chose training in general surgery or orthopedic surgery were less satisfied with their career progress. Residents with prolonged specialty training showed lower career satisfaction. Junior doctors who rated the quality of their residency training higher were more satisfied with their career. Those who perceived their job as particularly demanding were less satisfied. Concerning intrinsic factors, occupational self-efficacy and overall satisfaction with life were significantly associated with career satisfaction. Residents in general are quite satisfied with their career after four years of training. Opportunities to work part-time during residency as well as structured training programs should be implemented in order to overcome parenthood as a career obstacle for female residents.

We asked 109 GPs who attended a medical education conference to form groups (of 5 to 7 GPs each) and develop three interventions that are relevant to their work and should be avoided. We then compared the most frequently suggested interventions with those of the \"Choosing wisely\" campaign list and the \"Smarter medicine\" campaign shortlist. Finally, we asked the Swiss Young GPs Association (JHaS) members for additional suggestions. Five groups suggested avoidance of check-up examinations, especially in younger or asymptomatic individuals. Further unnecessary interventions, which were mentioned with similar frequency, included resting or exercise electrocardiography in asymptomatic individuals and cholesterol analysis in individuals older than 75 years, or statin therapy in primary prevention and\/or high age. Four groups suggested avoiding arthroscopy or magnetic resonance imaging of the knee joint after an injury (in the absence of joint instability or blockade), and three groups recommended to avoid imaging diagnostic procedures in patients with unspecific headache (in the absence of red flags).

Shared decision making, however, is not a straightforward process. In practice, it might fall short of what it promises and might even be misused to whitewash monetary motives. In this article, which summarizes a presentation given at the 17th Annual Conference of the German Network Evidence-based Medicine on March 4th, 2016 in Cologne, Germany, we discuss three contextual factors that in our opinion can have a tremendous impact on any informed decision making: 1) opinions and convictions of physicians or other clinicians; 2) uncertainty of the evidence regarding benefits and harms; 3) uncertainty of patients about their own values and preferences. But despite barriers and shortcomings, modern medicine currently does not have an alternative to shared decision making. Shared decision making has become a central theme in good quality health care because it has a strong ethical component. Advocates of shared decision making, however, must realize that not all patients prefer to participate in decision making. For those who do, however, we must ensure that shared decisions can be made in a neutral environment as free of biases and conflicts of interest as possible.","441":"For long-term maintenance and improvement of quality within a clinical research institute, the implementation and certification of a quality management system is suitable. Due to the implemented quality management system according to the still valid DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 desired quality objectives are achieved effectively. The evaluation of quality scores and the appraisal of in-house quality indicators make an important contribution in this regard. In order to achieve this and draw quality assurance conclusions, quality indicators as sensible and sensitive as possible are developed. For this, own key objectives, the retrospective evaluation of quality scores, a prospective follow-up and also discussions establish the basis. In the in-house clinical research institute the measures introduced by the quality management led to higher efficiency in work processes, improved staff skills, higher customer satisfaction and overall to more successful outcomes in relation to the self-defined key objectives.","442":"Health professionals in early childhood intervention and prevention make an important contribution by helping burdened families with young children cope with everyday life and child raising issues. A prerequisite for success is the health professionals' ability to tailor their services to the specific needs of families. The \"Systematic Exploration and Process Inventory for health professionals in early childhood intervention services (SEVG)\" can be used to identify each family's individual resources and needs, enabling a valid, reliable and objective assessment of the conditions and the process of counseling service. The present paper presents the statistical analyses that were used to confirm the reliability of the inventory. Based on the results of the reliability analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), the SEVG seems to be a reliable and objective inventory for assessing families' need for support. It also allows for calculation of average values of each scale. The development of valid and reliable assessments is essential to quality assurance and the professionalization of interventions in early childhood service.

Effectiveness and cost effectiveness can only be demonstrated to decision makers and potential users with methodologically sound and fully published evaluations. There is a lack of well-founded and mandatory standards for adequate, comparable evaluations of telemedicine applications. As part of the project CCS Telehealth Eastern Saxony (CCS THOS), a systematic review on evaluation concepts for telemedicine applications (search period until September 2014, databases Medline, Embase, HTA-Database, DARE, NHS EED) as well as an additional selective literature search were conducted. Suggestions for evaluation fundamentals were derived from the results. These suggestions were subjected to a formal consensus process (nominal group process) with relevant stakeholder groups (healthcare payers, healthcare providers, health policy representatives, researchers). 19 papers were included in the systematic review. In accordance with the predefined inclusion criteria, each presented an evaluation concept for telemedicine applications that was based upon a systematic review and\/or a consensus process. Via a formal consensus process, the suggestions for evaluation principles derived from the review and the selective literature search (23 papers) resulted in ten agreed evaluation principles. Eight of them were unanimously agreed upon, two were arrived at with one abstention each. The principles enclose criteria for the planning, conduct and reporting of telemedicine evaluations. Adherence to them is obligatory for users of the telemedical infrastructure provided by CCS THOS. Furthermore, right from the beginning the intention was very much for these principles to be seized upon by other projects and initiatives. The agreed evaluation principles for telemedicine applications are the first in Germany to be based both upon evidence and consensus. Due to the methodology of development, they have a strong scientific and health policy legitimation. Therefore, and because of their general applicability, adherence to these principles beyond the context of the telemedicine platform developed within CCS THOS is recommended, namely throughout the German telemedicine scene.

Advantages they mentioned included their own relief by the committed conversation between patient and care manager, the continuous monitoring of the patients as well as the regular feedback via protocols. GPs who refused to take part in the study expressed different attitudes towards collaborative care. Due to the general overall positive valuation of care managers as well as their positive attitude towards collaborative care a continuation of the IMPACT program in Germany should be considered.

In 2012, in a pilot unit CIRS was implemented within an intensive care unit. After evaluating its results, CIRS was then implemented in all organizational units of the University Hospital Graz in 2013. The definition of a CIRS report as well as the processing of CIRS reports was described in a CIRS manual. On average, 1.6 CIRS reports per week were submitted in the University Hospital Graz. Compared to data from a university hospital in Switzerland (27 CIRS reports per week), it becomes evident that, in general, CIRS is used, but the question arises whether CIRS is commonly known and whether information on the proceeding of CIRS cases is sufficiently transparent. Overall, the implementation of CIRS is relatively simple, but in order to achieve acceptance and thereby continuous reports, trust and a value-free handling of critical reports is required. Meetings with openly discussed case analysis could help to increase the awareness of CIRS among healthcare professionals. In Europe CIR systems are used in different ways. In Austria, both an academic exchange process on how to use CIRS and a common definition of CIRS reports has so far been lacking. The preparation of a guidance document for Austria is recommended.

A national improvement program was developed and conducted in Switzerland to implement and improve the use of the surgical safety checklists. The aims of the implementation program were to implement comprehensive and correct checklist use in participating hospitals in every patient and in every surgical procedure; and to improve safety climate and teamwork as important cultural context variables. 10 hospitals were selected for participation in the implementation program. A questionnaire assessing use, knowledge, and attitudes towards the checklist and the Safety Climate Survey were conducted at two measurement occasions each in October\/November 2013 and January\/February 2015. Significant increases emerged for frequency of checklist use (F(1,1001)=340.9, p&lt;0.001), satisfaction (F(1,1232)=25.6, p&lt;0.001), and knowledge(F(1,1294)=184.5, p&lt;0.001).

All relevant patient safety guidelines and checklists of the University Hospital Graz were screened. Subsequently, questions were extracted from these documents which can be used in a checklist for \"real-time\" ward rounds by local observers. Based on the document screening two sets of criteria were prepared, one for operating rooms and one for normal hospital wards and intensive care units. Using a survey tool two checklists were then generated on the basis of these criteria, which can be used for the so-called \"patient-safety feedback\" from the observers. Whether guidelines or checklists, which should theoretically improve patient safety, are properly understood and applied as intended by healthcare professionals can only be evaluated by using methods like monitoring the respective processes.

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was applied for risk identification and assessment. For the analysis of the current status in hospitals, three hospitals were interviewed about their discharge processes. For the system perspective, the legislative and self-administrative framework specific for the German setting was reviewed. The FMEA allowed the identification of a number of actions for risk control in the responsibility of the hospitals and within the framework. Some risks are mainly caused by the legal framework, whereas others can only be addressed by the hospitals themselves. The continuity of drug treatment and the lack of back-up systems after discharge were identified as posing relevant risks to patient safety. Rich interaction was found between the hospitals and the framework they work in impacting patient safety at hospital discharge.

Efforts to improve a nationwide quality management for oncology have so far not been successful in the development of comprehensive documentation at all levels of care. New organizational structures such as population-based clinical cancer registries were supposed to solve this problem more sufficiently, but they must be accompanied by valid trans-sectorial documentation and evaluation of clinical data.

It must also be taken into account that clinical trial data and results must be sufficient to allow for the reimbursement of the new treatment option.

In order to enable consistency and fairness across all decisions, NICE uses as a unit of health benefit the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Both QALYs and costs for a technology are estimated by long-term disease modelling. This requires a variety of clinical input parameters, and often extrapolation beyond the trial period, and of intermediate or surrogate to final outcomes. RCT data will remain the main data source for the majority of appraisals, but because the data necessary for disease modelling is often not available from RCTs, particularly for the UK context, the use of non-RCT data is the norm in NICE technology appraisals. This does not only apply to data on resource use, service provision and HRQL data, but also to efficacy data. In some situations non-RCT data are more relevant to a decision context than the RCT data, and in some situations, as illustrated by 3 examples, it would be unreasonable, not to take account of existing non-RCT data. The use of non-RCT clinical evidence is most common for devices, interventions where RCTs are difficult, and in conditions with poor prognosis where single arm studies are often carried out. Therefore, a pragmatic approach to the available evidence is needed for many decision made by the NICE Appraisal Committees to come to a reasonable and defendable decision.

Under the headline of Evidence-based Medicine nowadays a comprehensive set of tools is offered which can be used to assess the benefit and the risk of medical interventions. The overarching rule which evolved for the grading of evidence from studies is to maximize the protection against bias. Despite this coherent approach, there is still controversy that is regularly mainly sparked by the dominant position of randomized controlled trials. Observational studies and registries are deemed to be more relevant because they provide results that are produced under \"everyday conditions\". These controversial discussions often show a lack of orientation, as they do without the explicit naming of scientific criteria for the evaluation and to a large extent rely on common sense. That the latter may not be a good guide for assessments in the medical field is known from numerous studies. For unbiased assessments the rigorous use of basic scientific principles is the only way. To express doubt and question these principles requires a scientific basis itself. The alternative is to move away from the established scientific foundation. The path to a \"new\" scientific paradigm is currently dominated by a discussion under the buzzword Big Data.

Apart from inadequate compensation and work load, another barrier identified by the GPs was their uncertainty about how to deal with affected patients. Most German universities presently spend no more than 90minutes lecture time on addiction medicine teaching. Our research aims to investigate the question whether medical studies and advanced medical education increases the role security of medical students and physicians and their commitment to implementing alcohol screening and brief intervention. Moreover, we will explore whether lack of therapeutic commitment can be related to lack of role security.

Role security and therapeutic commitment of students and senior house officers were assessed using the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Questionnaire (SAAPPQ) subscales \"Role Security\" and \"Therapeutic Commitment\". Analysis was based on 367 questionnaires. As expected, senior house officers reported more Role Security than clinical medical students who showed a higher level of Role Security than pre-clinical medical students. No differences could be found for Therapeutic Commitment. An association between Role Security and Therapeutic Commitment was only revealed for clinical medical students. Medical studies and advanced medical education can increase students' and senior house officers' Role Security to treat patients with excessive alcohol consumption, but not Therapeutic Commitment. Moreover, no association between Role Security and Therapeutic Commitment could be found for senior house officers.

All submitted comments were documented and assessed regarding the need to revise or amend the draft. Changes were subsequently implemented following approval by the author group. Gute Praxis Gesundheitsinformation calls for a transparent methodological approach in the development of health information. To achieve this, evidence-based information must be based on (a) a systematic literature search, (b) a justified selection of evidence, (c) unbiased reporting of relevant results, (d) appropriate factual and linguistic communication of uncertainties, (e) either avoidance of any direct recommendations or a strict division between the reporting of results and the derivation of recommendations, (f) the consideration of current evidence on the communication of figures, risks and probabilities, and (g) transparent information about the authors and publishers of the health information, including their funding sources.

To ensure a high quality of the doctoral research program and to take into account the needs of doctoral students, both the individual courses and the doctoral research program as a whole were evaluated. The doctoral research program has been very well accepted by doctoral students, with a total of 449 doctoral students, who attended an average of five courses from 2011 to 2014. The total number of participants amounted to 2,302 in 159 courses. The results of the evaluation show that on average all the basic courses were considered to be 'good' or 'very good'.

The program development proceeded in several steps: in the first step (2009\/2010), a pilot study with eleven doctoral candidates was carried out at the Institute of General Practice. Their ratings of the perceived relevance and their own knowledge of 15 topics of scientific work were used to identify a provisional need for support. Subsequently an interdisciplinary panel of experts established the program throughout the faculty. Since its implementation, a requirements analysis in the form of questionnaires has been continuously carried out in order to assess the doctoral students' prior knowledge and their preferences expressed. At the same time, systematic searches for support programs in other medical fields have been conducted throughout Germany on several occasions. On the basis of the pilot study, the research results and the expert panel discussions the following topics were found to be particularly relevant: principles of good scientific practice, literature search, reference management, organization and structure of a doctoral thesis, formatting of Word documents, clinical epidemiology and data management. A specific, stepwise development process was used to design a concept for the faculty of medicine that pays close attention to the knowledge and interests of doctoral candidates.

Against this background, we carried out an analysis of data which had been documented for the purpose of certification by a German Medical Association. A central aim of the study was to obtain evidence of possible influences of economic interests on continuing medical education. Furthermore, strategies for quality assurance of CME contents and their implementation were to be examined. We analyzed all registration data for courses certified in the category D (\"structured interactive CME via print media, online media and audiovisual media\") by the Bavarian Chamber of Physicians in 2012. To measure the effects of conflict of interest, relationships between topics of training and variables relating to the alleged self-interest of the organizer\/sponsor (for example, drug sales in a group of physicians) were statistically verified. These data were taken from the Bavarian Medical Statistics 2012 and the GKV-Arzneimittelschnellinformation. In 2012, a total of 734 CME course offerings have been submitted for 51 medical specialties by 30 course suppliers in the Bavarian Medical Association. To ensure the neutrality of interests of the CME courses the course suppliers signed a cooperation treaty ensuring their compliance with defined behavior towards the Bavarian Medical Association concerning sponsorship. The correlation between course topics and drug data suggests that course suppliers tend to submit topics that are economically attractive to them. There was a significant correlation between the number of CME courses in a specific field and the sales from drug prescriptions issued by physicians in the respective field. The results show that neutrality of interests regarding continuing medical education is difficult to achieve under the current framework for the organization, certification, and especially the funding of CME events in Germany. The cooperation agreement between the Bavarian Medical Association and training applicants is taken as an example of how legal certainty can be ensured. Based on the findings described below, suggestions and strategies to strengthen assessment expertise of course participants have been developed and elaborated.

This pilot study provides methodological insights into evaluating the DMP for coronary heart disease (CHD), which currently includes 1.7 million participants, and reveals trends in healthcare outcomes for mortality, guideline adherent prescribing and costs. Major methodological challenges that need to be considered for the development of an appropriate matching method for this indication have been identified. The results show positive trends in favor of the DMP regarding mortality, costs and medication according to guidelines. A matching design is applicable to the CHD indication; the knowledge gained regarding the quality of care can be used for a targeted development of the program.

It is not known what patients in Germany know about relationships between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry and if and how they want to be informed about these relationships. An information sheet explaining conflicts of interest and a 19-item questionnaire were distributed to 765 patients at various medical offices and hospitals in two German cities. 80 % (n=612) of the patients completed and returned the questionnaires anonymously. 65 % of the patients did not know of conflicts of interest (COI) doctors may have with the pharmaceutical industry. 74 % of the patients would like to know if their doctor had obtained any benefits through contacts with the pharmaceutical industry. 71 % agreed that a disclosure would increase their confidence, and 74 % wanted their physicians to declare COI verbally to them during a consultation. 40 % would prefer a doctor who is not receiving any benefits from the pharmaceutical industry. The desire for disclosure was significantly higher in patients who had an awareness of the problems of COI (OR 4.95; 95 % CI 3.33 - 7.35). However, 35 % of the patients trusted their attending physicians anyway and did not see a need for disclosure of any COI. The majority of patients, but not all patients want to be informed about COI of their physicians. The best way to do this has yet to be determined. ","514":"No doubt, the public should be involved in healthcare decision making, especially when decision makers from politics and self-government agencies are faced with the difficult task of setting priorities. There is a general consensus on the need for a stronger patient centeredness, even in HTA processes, and internationally different ways of public participation are discussed and tested in decision making processes. This paper describes how the public can be involved in different decision situations, and it shows how preference measurement methods are currently being used in an international context to support decision making. It distinguishes between different levels of decision making on health technologies: approval, assessment, pricing, and finally utilization. The range of participation efforts extends from qualitative surveys of patients' needs (Citizen Councils of NICE in the UK) to science-based documentation of quantitative patient preferences, such as in the current pilot projects of the FDA in the US and the EMA at the European level. Possible approaches for the elicitation and documentation of preference structures and trade-offs in relation to alternate health technologies are decision aids, such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), that provide the necessary information for weighting and prioritizing decision criteria.","515":"National safety alert systems publish relevant information to improve patient safety in hospitals. However, the information has to be transformed into local action to have an effect on patient safety. We studied three research questions: How do Swiss healthcare quality and risk managers (qm\/rm(1)) see their own role in learning from safety alerts issued by the Swiss national voluntary reporting and analysis system? What are their attitudes towards and evaluations of the alerts, and which types of improvement actions were fostered by the safety alerts? A survey was developed and applied to Swiss healthcare risk and quality managers, with a response rate of 39 % (n=116). Descriptive statistics are presented. The qm\/rm disseminate and communicate with a broad variety of professional groups about the alerts. While most respondents felt that they should know the alerts and their contents, only a part of them felt responsible for driving organizational change based on the recommendations. However, most respondents used safety alerts to back up their own patient safety goals. The alerts were evaluated positively on various dimensions such as usefulness and were considered as standards of good practice by the majority of the respondents. A range of organizational responses was applied, with disseminating information being the most common. An active role is related to using safety alerts for backing up own patient safety goals. To support an active role of qm\/rm in their hospital's learning from safety alerts, appropriate organizational structures should be developed. Furthermore, they could be given special information or training to act as an information hub on the issues discussed in the alerts.

The most frequently cited reasons are deficient structures and a lack of perspectives. The German Research Foundation warned against supply gaps in the medical sciences and in 2010 published recommendations for the improvement of professional development at all levels of medical education. A systematic survey of existing support tools and their dissemination among the medical societies has not yet been conducted. Network members of the AWMF were contacted by e-mail and asked to answer 59 questions regarding the support of junior scientists in their respective societies. 28 out of 147 societies replied to the questionnaire. Most of the societies offer at least one of the following tools (multiple responses; selective topics): award for oral presentations (n=27), free attendance at conferences (n=15), financial research funding (n=19), assessment of any funding application (n=10), mentoring (n=6), support of students working on their doctoral thesis (n=26), support of studies abroad (n=16), training course on statistics\/ laboratory methods (n=17), support with clinical studies (n=22). Here, we present our survey findings on established support tools for junior scientists for the first time. Apart from the medical schools, several medical-scientific societies have also started to provide tools of support for their junior scientists. However, to ensure that long-term perspectives and attractive conditions are provided in the field of medical science for junior scientists, broader support and interdisciplinary exchange of established tools are needed.

To identify nurses' attitudes, perceptions and behavior regarding industry and marketing strategies. 1) Systematic literature search in Medline via PubMed and CINAHL for international studies on nurses' conflict of interests towards pharmaceutical companies; 2) analysis of a survey with PhD students from two Nursing Science doctoral programs. The review including 16 publications published between 1999 and 2014 and the survey among 82 PhD students revealed comparable results. The majority of nurses already had contact with pharmaceutical companies. Nurses are often uncritical in their attitudes, and suggestibility is claimed to be low. The majority of nurses were not - or at least not sufficiently - provided with conflict of interest training, neither as part of their vocational training nor their continuing education. Conflict of interest seems to be an important topic for nurses. Increasing relevance in the future underpins the need for making nurses more sensitive towards this issue, especially through professional training programs. ","527":"A common justification of the failure to perform scientific evaluations of integrated care programs (in accordance with Sect. 140 SGB V) is the high level of expenditure which is strongly influenced by the conditions of the particular program. Two practical examples will be used to outline frameworks of integrated care programs that may create obstacles to evaluation. If possible, appropriate solutions that may help to avoid or at least reduce these obstacles will be presented. In many programs target groups and program objectives are inaccurately defined. Especially disease-specific programs bear the risk of having too small a sample size to exclude random effects. Only a few integrated care programs include evaluations that have been proactively planned from the outdet. In particular, early planning of evaluations plays an important role in avoiding distortions of results and additional expenses. It may also have a positive influence on all other frameworks. ","528":"Joint replacement surgery is one of the most often performed routine procedures for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis in Germany. Currently, there is no consensus on indication criteria for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The topic indication for TKA was processed using six guiding questions concerning: 1) Common practice in determining the indication for TKA; 2) Inclusion criteria in clinical trials; 3) Treatment goals\/goal criteria; 4) Predictors for goal attainment; 5) Economic aspects of determining a TKA indication; 6) Guidelines of the \"Working Group of Scientific Medical Societies\" (AWMF) in other areas. The evidence mapping was conducted by systematically searching Medline via Ovid, the Cochrane Library, through hand searching national guidelines and selected journals as well as the AWMF guideline portal. 1) In Germany there is currently no consented guideline regarding indications for TKA surgery. 2) Indication criteria for clinical trials are: diagnosed osteoarthritis of the knee, limitations of age and BMI. The most common criteria for exclusion include rheumatoid\/inflammatory arthritis, secondary diagnoses and allergies. 3) As yet, no international initiatives have been identified which, by involving all relevant stakeholders, have reached consensus regarding the indication criteria for TKA. 4) A variety of predictors were identified with effects on individual treatment goals acting in different directions. 5) Very few studies were identified concerning economic aspects of determining TKA indication. 6) Comparable AWMF guidelines are currently not available. The findings of this study suggest that specific systematic reviews are needed to explore the following questions: What are the treatment goals of a TKA intervention? For whom are these relevant? And how are they measured? Continuous analyses are recommended in the field of predictors for a positive TKA outcome. ","529":"The objective of this study is to determine the number of patients who receive anti-retroviral medicinal products (ARMs) and to assess the frequency of prescriptions depending on age, gender and treatment regimen by evaluating German statutory health insurance data. We analysed a number of databases of several million customers of various nationwide statutory sickness funds and extrapolated the results to the overall population of the statutory health insurance. The number of HIV-positive patients with ARMs varied considerably between the statutory sickness funds analysed. The number of patients with HIV diagnosis receiving ARMs that are exclusively approved for HIV increased from about 23,262 in 2008 to 30,200 in 2010. For ARMs labelled for both, HIV and HIV\/chronic hepatitis B, indications, we calculated about 34,032 patients for the year 2011. In about 24.2% of the cases with HIV-only and HIV plus HIV\/chronic hepatitis B-approved ARMs no HIV-diagnosis was documented. Patients in this group were significantly younger and more often female as compared to patients with documented HIV diagnosis who received prescriptions of ARMs. 16.5% of the patients received treatment within the label for chronic hepatitis B. In 7.7% of the patients ARMs were used off-label for prophylaxis (10.0%), for hepatitis (65.0%) or for unknown reasons (25.0%). Hence, the number of people under ARMs was estimated to be below the 44,000 patients calculated for statutory sickness funds patients on the basis of prescription data in 2011. According to our analysis only 39,000 of those could have a documented HIV diagnosis. ","530":"Patient satisfaction (PS) surveys are frequently used evaluation methods to show performance from the customer's view. This approach has some fundamental deficits, especially with respect to theory, methodology and usage. Because of the significant theoretical value of the expectation confirmation\/disconfirmation concept in the development of PS, an expectation-based experience typology has been developed and tested to check whether this approach could be a theoretical and practical alternative to the survey of PS. Due to the mainly cognitive-rational process of comparison between expectations and expectation fulfilment, it is easier to make changes in this stage of the process than in the subsequent stage of the development of PS that is mainly based on emotional-affective processes. The paper contains a literature review of the common concept of PS and its causal and influencing factors. Based on the theoretical part of this study, an expectation-based experience typology was developed. In the next step, the typology was subjected to exploratory testing, based on two patient surveys. In some parts of the tested typology explorative differences could be found between hospitals. Despite this rather more complex and unusual approach to expectation-based experience typology, this concept offers the chance to change conditions not only retrospectively (based on data), but also in a prospective way in terms of a \"management of expectations\". ","531":"Existing rehabilitation aftercare offers in Germany are heterogeneous, and there is a lack of transparency in terms of indications and methods as well as of (nationwide) availability and financial coverage. Also, there is no systematic and transparent synopsis. To close this gap a systematic review was conducted and a web-based database created for post-rehabilitation support. To allow a consistent assessment of the included aftercare offers, a quality profile of universally valid criteria was developed. This paper aims to outline the scientific approach. The procedure adapts the RAND\/UCLA method, with the participation of the advisory board of the ReNa project. Preparations for the set included systematic searches in order to find possible criteria to assess the quality of aftercare offers. These criteria first were collected without any pre-selection involved. Every item of the adjusted collection was evaluated by every single member of the advisory board considering the topics \"relevance\", \"feasibility\" and \"suitability for public coverage\". Interpersonal analysis was conducted by relating the median and classification into consensus and dissent. All items that were considered to be \"relevant\" and \"feasible\" in the three stages of consensus building and deemed \"suitable for public coverage\" were transferred into the final set of criteria (ReNa set). A total of 82 publications were selected out of the 656 findings taken into account, which delivered 3,603 criteria of possible initial relevance. After a further removal of 2,598 redundant criteria, the panel needed to assess a set of 1,005 items. Finally we performed a quality assessment of aftercare offers using a set of 35 descriptive criteria merged into 8 conceptual clusters. The consented ReNa set of 35 items delivers a first generally valid tool to describe quality of structures, standards and processes of aftercare offers. So finally, the project developed into a complete collection of profiles characterizing each post-rehabilitation support service included in the database. ","532":"Medical care in German nursing homes is predominantly provided by general practitioners. The extent of care provided by specialists is rather limited. The aim of this project was to develop a catalogue of criteria for a successful cooperation between nursing home staff and physicians. Based on empirical data from a mixed-methods study with qualitative and quantitative elements, which was conducted in 52 Bavarian nursing homes, a catalogue of criteria was developed in a review process in cooperation with a working group consisting of representatives of different professional groups and public authorities. Based on the empirical results six main criteria for successful medical care in nursing homes and actions to be taken for implementation were developed. The essential requirements for successful medical care in nursing homes include binding arrangements between professional groups, a small number of designated contact persons between nursing home staff and physicians, and an appreciative and mutually respectful interaction between all the parties involved. ","533":"Mental disorders are common in family practice, but their meaning for variables of consultation is rarely considered. Thus, we examined the influence of mental disorders on patients' expectations regarding time, openness and seriousness as well as ratings of satisfaction with the consultation. Prior to consultation for 219 patients a screening for anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and hypochondriasis (WI-7) was performed. Before and after the consultation patient expectations and ratings were recorded. Subgroup analysis was based on Mann-Whitney U tests. Almost half of the sample were screen-positive. Prior the consultation, screen positive patients had higher ratings for expectations compared with screen negative patients, but did not differ in their experiences after the consultation. There was no association between consultation length and ratings for satisfaction. Patients screened positive for mental disorders do not necessarily require longer consultation length, if their expectations regarding openness and seriousness are met. This is underlines the importance of communication skills in undergraduate medical education and specialist training for future GPs. ","534":"In Germany, utilization of ambulatory health care is high compared to other countries. Classical models of health care utilization cannot sufficiently explain these differences. The aim of this study was to explore relevant factors which can explain the higher health care utilization in Germany. In this article, we focus on regulations regarding sickness certification as a potential factor. An explorative qualitative study design. We conducted episodic interviews with 20 patients in Germany and 20 patients in Norway and participant observation in four primary care practices each. Additionally, we conducted a context analysis of relevant health care system related factors which emerged during the study. Qualitative data analysis was done by thematic coding in the framework of grounded theory. The need for a sickness certificate was an important reason for encounter in Germany, especially regarding minor illnesses. Sickness certification is a societal topic. GPs play a double role regarding sickness certification, both as the patients' advocate and as an expert witness for social security services. In Norway, longer periods of self-administered sickness certification and more differentiated possibilities of sickness certification have been introduced successfully. Our results point to regulations regarding sickness certification as a relevant factor for higher health care utilization in Germany. In pilot studies, the effect of extended self-certification of sickness and part-time sickness certification should be further assessed.

The Integrated Quality Management System (IQMS) was developed on the basis of a pre-existing and validated model for quality promotion, namely the European Practice Assessment (EPA). The methodology for quality assessment and feedback of assessment results to the service teams was adopted from the EPA model. Quality assessment methodology included data assessment through staff, patient surveys and service visitation. Quality is assessed by indicators, and so indicators had to be developed that were appropriate for assessing reproductive health care in rural Kenya. A search of the Kenyan and international literature was conducted to identify potential indicators. These were then rated for their relevance and clarity by a panel of Kenyan experts. 260 indicators were rated as relevant and assigned to 29 quality dimensions and 5 domains. The implementation of IQMS in ten facilities showed that IQMS is a feasible model for assessing the quality of reproductive health services in rural Kenya. IQMS enables these services to identify quality improvement targets and necessary improvement measures. Both strengths and limitations of IQMS will be discussed.

Quality indicators for pressure ulcer prevention are among the most widely used for geriatric clinical institutions. To enable more precise risk adjustment established risk factors are employed in conjunction with the OPS 9-200. Using a PKMS case to produce an OPS 9-200 is far too heterogeneous, sketchy and vague to create an accurate and satisfactory pressure ulcer risk assessment for patients with varied and individual case factors. Therefore we propose to include risk factors which, according to experts, are clearly and specifically related to pressure ulcers (e.g. immobility and incontinence) and matched by unique ICD codes.

Specification of the recommendations of the German Coalition for Patient Safety (APS) for users and operators of anaesthesia equipment, explore opportunities and challenges for the safe use and organisation of anaesthesia devices. We conducted a literature search in Medline\/PubMed for studies dealing with the APS recommendations for the prevention of medical device-related risks in the context of anaesthesia. In addition, we performed an internet search for reports and recommendations focusing on the use and organisation of medical devices in anaesthesia. Identified studies were grouped and assigned to the recommendations. The division into users and operators was maintained. Instruction and training in anaesthesia machines is sometimes of minor importance. Failure to perform functional testing seems to be a common cause of critical incidents in anaesthesia. There is a potential for reporting to the federal authority. Starting points for the safe operation of anaesthetic devices can be identified, in particular, at the interface of staff, organisation, and (anaesthesia) technology.

A questionnaire consisting of 10 questions was used to evaluate these feasibility criteria for each indicator. Survey results were subjected to descriptive analysis. The analyzed sample comprises 103 participants who have been working as practice-based physicians for an average of 13 years. 40% only keep electronic medical records and 2% only paper records, and the rest uses both. The rating of QIs in the field-specific QI sets shows the following mean values: 67% of the participants consider the QIs assigned to them as corresponding to their practice care mandate. Data on these QIs deemed to be applicable are collected by 94% of respondents, documented by 91%, and by 51% electronically. 58% of the data required for the denominator, and 38% for the numerator are retrievable from the practice management system. The time required to access data on a QI is more than 30minutes for 84% of respondents, and 67% consider the effort involved as unacceptable. The rating received was 61% for the relevance of QIs to the assessment of a practitioner's own quality of health care, 69% for the estimated reliability of data collection, and 58% for the acceptance of being evaluated via QIs. In order to improve the feasibility of QI-based practice assessments it will be necessary to a) fine-tune the selection of QIs for the respective groups of specialist, b) to promote the use of computerized practice management systems, and c) integrate effective and user-friendly retrieval functions in the software.

This article questions the concept of overall comparisons of hospitals, which are multiproduct enterprises and may have specialties that provide good results in some areas despite having worse outcomes in others. Therefore, the authors argue for a disease specific view of outcome measurement. The concept of the German Inpatient Quality Indicators is explained. These indicators cover volume, mortality, and other information by a disease specific approach, which includes information for potential patients as well as specific feedback to the physicians responsible for the respective specialty. This article focuses on the feedback to the hospitals and explains how these indicators can be used for improvement in conjunction with a peer review process. The indicators provide information to the hospitals regarding their relative position because German reference values are available for all indicators. Thus, the indicators can serve as a trigger instrument for identifying possible quality problems. Based on these indications, peer review can be used to analyze the treatment processes and to eventually verify weaknesses and define actions for improvement. The first studies indicate that the use of this approach within hospital quality management can largely improve hospital outcomes in hospitals with subpar results compared to the German average.

The main purpose of the peer review is the principle of self-determination, the intention to learn from each other more effectively, and a commitment to quality improvement. During the past five years the Quality in Medicine Initiative (IQM) has successfully promotes peer reviewing in German-speaking areas. The aim of this study is to investigate all records of IQM peer reviews and to outline the results in the course of development. The major focuses include medical aspects for improvement, information concerning organizational processes and the satisfaction of the visited hospitals. A systematic descriptive analysis of all records as well as feedback sheets was conducted between 2010 and 2014. 294 of 304 planned peer reviews were considered, involving among different hospital owners and different clinical conditions. The identified potential for improvement of the peer team was higher than that of the physicians of the hospitals visited. The assessment of the medical review criteria illustrates the following different trends: a positive development occurred concerning the appropriate and timely diagnostic and treatment; a clear potential for improvement could be established concerning a complete and conclusive documentation. Regarding the clinical conditions, anomalies were identified which are important for all IQM hospitals. As regards sustainability, first results from so-called re-reviews were available and provided important information pointing in the direction of structure and process improvement. The satisfaction of the visited physicians increased continuously within these five years. In the light of all data records and satisfaction sheets, the IQM peer review has become well-established over the last five years. Possible reasons are a well-defined framework, clear structures and different kinds of support. The success of the cooperation of the German Medical Association and IQM is illustrated by the development of the curriculum peer review. Re-reviews provide impulses for sustainability.

Therefore, Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS) team members either attend ward rounds or perform a chart review to provide feedback to and discuss with the attending physician. Acceptance and effectiveness of both options are discussed in this article. Attending physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating ABS activities. The modality of the reviewing process and its effectiveness, as well as the feasibility of recommendations was assessed. As the degree of implementation of ABS recommendations decreased on a trauma ward, the reviewing process was changed from chart review to attending the daily ward rounds. In this setting, the duration of the reviewing process and the consumption of antiinfectives in recommended daily doses\/100 patient days (RDD\/100PT) were assessed, comparing the two intervention modalities. Attending physicians predominantly appreciated the modality and extent of ABS currently offered to them by the ABS team, rating it relevant and effective. Implementation of ABS recommendations was increased on the trauma ward by academic detailing during the daily ward round; the consumption of broad spectrum antibiotics was reduced. ABS team members with formal authority and dedicated time for antibiotic stewardship activities effectively optimize antiinfective therapies by reviewing antibiotic prescriptions. The interaction of ABS experts and attending physicians contributes fundamentally to the effectiveness and degree of implementation of ABS interventions.

A proactive audit of antibiotic use is performed weekly on four intensive care units at the University Hospital Dresden by a infectious disease specialist a pharmacist and the attending physicians. Patient-related therapy adjustments were systematically documented over a 4-month period; antibiotic use before and after audit as well as ABS strategies (de-escalation, oral switch, duration of treatment, dose and administration optimization) were analyzed. Both targeted therapy and interventions regarding the duration of treatment led to a reduction in the prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics by 20%. Routine interdisciplinary proactive audit of antibiotic use with intervention and feedback increases guideline-adherent therapy and process quality.

This article aims to summarize the findings of numerous studies that investigated the impact of ID consultation services on patient care and outcome in patients suffering from infectious diseases. The strongest evidence for a clinical benefit is found in the context of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), where in-hospital- and day-30 mortality was significantly and consistently reduced by about 40% in patients that were evaluated and treated in cooperation with an ID physician. Furthermore, studies revealed that this effect was associated with an improved adherence to standards of care. Newer studies show a reduced length of hospital stay due to ID consultations, especially if patients are evaluated early in the course of their hospital stay. Of note, informal or curbside consultations do not seem to be equivalent to a formal ID consultation with bedside patient evaluation. Studies in other patient groups (solid organ transplant recipients or intensive care unit patients) or in the context of other infections (infective endocarditis, pneumonia, other bloodstream infections) also revealed positive effects of ID consultations. Higher rates of appropriate empirical and targeted antimicrobial treatments and de-escalation strategies due to successful pathogen identification were documented. These modifications resulted in lower treatment costs and decreased antimicrobial resistance development. Although there are methodological limitations in single studies, we consider the consistent and reproducible positive effects of ID consultations shown in studies in different countries and health care systems as convincing evidence for the improved quality of care and treatment outcomes in patients with infectious diseases. Thus, strong consideration should be given to establish ID consultation services in small and medium sized hospitals as well. ","556":"Clinical infectious diseases have only slowly been established as a medical specialty in Germany. The density of infectious diseases (ID) specialists and the number of ID divisions in general hospitals is still limited when compared with the situation in many other European countries, and there is also a lack of hospital-based medical microbiologists and infection control doctors for many reasons. Often, there is a lack of understanding of the roles and the performance of ID specialists versus microbiologists. Experience in other countries shows that ID specialists are important as clinical experts at the bedside, can help ascertain healthcare quality and patient safety, and are perfectly suited for undertaking strategic tasks in the field of cost-effective antimicrobial therapy algorithms and antibiotic stewardship (ABS) in hospitals. ID specialists are responsible for infection control in several countries, can improve the utility of diagnostic microbiology and are key partners in translational research. We estimate that more than 1,000 additional ID specialists are needed in this country, and believe that specially trained ABS experts can take over parts of their responsibilities and tasks in smaller hospitals. More capacity and flexibility in postgraduate training in infectious diseases, antibiotic stewardship and infection control in Germany will be critical to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance.

The review was performed according to the PRISMA guideline. Relevant instruments were categorized and evaluated in regard to construct definition, operationalization approach and psychometric properties. Overall, N=12 publications reporting on the development and validation of a cancer literacy instrument could be identified. Cancer literacy is defined as the ability to search for, understand and use health related information in health care decision-making (health literacy) or as the knowledge a layperson needs to understand the information and advice the health system offers with regard to preventing, diagnosing and treating cancerous conditions. In most cases, cancer literacy is operationalized by using cancer knowledge tests across distinct knowledge areas. The analysis of the psychometric properties yields the finding that only every second paper (N=6) is reporting reliability and validity data. Altogether, reliability data is quite satisfactory whereas construct and criterion validity data demonstrates low to moderate correlations between the instruments developed and external criteria as well as comparative instruments. The aspect of cancer literacy is gaining relevance in terms of its contribution to quality assurance and patient safety. Currently, there are a limited number of cancer literacy instruments available. Definitions of constructs and instrument conceptions mostly rely on the aspect of cancer knowledge making it difficult to differentiate cancer literacy from cancer knowledge. Prospective studies should take greater account of more sophisticated measurement approaches used to assess health literacy. ","560":"The German Guideline Program in Oncology defines quality indicators which provide the basis for the certification of oncology centers of the German Cancer Society. The results of the quality indicators are published annually in benchmarking reports which summarize the data of over 400,000 oncological patients in the course of time. The reports will be presented to the guideline groups during their guideline updating process. In addition, the explanation of the certified centers and the auditors for non-adherence to guideline recommendations is being recorded. In this way, the guideline group obtains important information about how and to which extent the guideline is implemented in clinical routine, and can derive conclusions for the further definition of recommendations and quality indicators. ","561":"Efforts in nationwide quality management for oncology have so far failed to comprehensively document all levels of care. New organizational structures such as population-based clinical cancer registries or certified organ cancer centers were supposed to solve this problem more sufficiently, but they have to be accompanied by valid trans-sectoral documentation and evaluation of clinical data. To measure feasibility and qualitative effectiveness of guideline implementation we approached this problem with a nationwide investigation from 2000 to 2011. The rate of neoadjuvant radio\/chemotherapy in stage UICC II\/III rectum cancer, cut-off point 80% for separating good from insufficient quality, was used as a quality indicator. The nationwide analysis indicates an increase from 45% to 70%, but only with the implementation strategy of CME. The combination of new structures, evidence-based quality indicators, organ cancer center and clinical cancer registries has shown good feasibility and seems promising.","562":"For several years patient versions of guidelines have become mandatory in the German Guidelines Program in Oncology (GGPO). Based on the methodology that has been developed for the German National Disease Management Guidelines Program, patient versions of guidelines translate the recommendations of clinical practice guideline into plain language and provide information about the harms and benefits of the interventions being addressed in the guideline. They are developed by a group of guideline authors (experts as well as patients), they are consensus-based and aim to create transparency in recommendations for physicians and their rationales. An automated analysis of readability shows that patient versions of guidelines are specific to the target group of educated lay people. Moreover, the responses to a reader feedback questionnaire indicate that comprehensibility, level of detail and depth of information are considered highly relevant and positive by users. Thus, patient versions of guidelines meet the needs of a specific target group. Nevertheless, the development of other formats for readers with low levels of health literacy or cognitive competencies is desirable. Currently it remains unclear if these simplified formats are able to reflect the complexity of high quality clinical practice guidelines. ","563":"In 2008, the German Guidelines Program in Oncology (GGPO) was launched to promote the development and updating of evidence-based multidisciplinary practice guidelines. This paper describes the organizational structures and methods as well as the embeddedness of the program within a comprehensive strategy to enhance quality of cancer care. Using the example of the German Cancer Plan we argue that the GGPO guidelines are not only an instrument to transfer and exchange knowledge, but also provide an important basis for further initiatives in the field of quality improvement. It is illustrated what was achieved in the first seven years of the GGPO and which challenges will dominate the next years. ","564":"Study registries serve various purposes. Primarily, they provide as complete an overview as possible on planned, ongoing and completed studies and are thus intended to contribute to transparency in research. As such, they are an instrument for identifying and reducing publication bias. Study registries can also help doctors and patients to identify suitable studies for them. The National Cancer Plan (NCP) calls for ensuring an efficient oncological treatment, which requires the knowledge derived from trials. Study registries can play an important role in their identification. This paper describes the purpose that study registries fulfil in oncology as well as their health policy rationale. It then discusses two registries relevant for oncology, i. e. StudyBox and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), against the backdrop of the National Cancer Plan and introduces the cooperation of the two registries.","565":"Until May 31, 2015 the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) conducted 108 assessments for various diseases on the basis of 103 dossiers within the scope of the early benefit assessment of drugs pursuant to the Act on the Reform of the Market for Medicinal Products (AMNOG). 29 of these assessments (28 dossiers) referred to advanced stages of oncologic (including neoplastic-hematologic) diseases. In 21 of these 29 assessments (72%), IQWiG found an added benefit for at least one subpopulation or subgroup, compared to 33% with non-oncologic diseases. For oncologic diseases, the extent of benefit was classified as \"major\" in six assessments (21%), compared to 5% for non-oncologic disorders. In contrast, the conclusions of the oncologic studies were less certain: only one assessment provided proof (of an added benefit); for non-oncologic diseases, this was the case in eight assessments. A distinctive methodological feature of the available oncologic studies is that, as a rule, treatment switching was planned in the event of progression (normally on the basis of imaging or laboratory findings) and that shortly afterwards the follow-up of important endpoints (adverse events and patient-reported outcomes) was normally discontinued. In particular, the pre-specified option in the study protocol allowing the control group to switch treatment to the experimental intervention after progression (\"protocol-permitted treatment switches\") makes it extremely difficult to interpret the results beyond the outcome \"progression\" (or progression-free survival). This treatment switching is mostly justified by reference to ethical necessity. This, however, alleges that the experimental intervention (i. e., the new drug) is superior to the control intervention, which means that circular reasoning is unavoidable. But despite this, oncologic studies are better than their reputation. Hence, so far the results of the early benefit assessment of new drugs (regarding the existence and extent of an added benefit) are clearly better than expected. In this context, the IQWiG methods have not been shown to be extremely conservative. On the contrary: in all cases where IQWiG rated the extent of benefit as \"major\" for the oncologic indications, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) has so far not shared this assessment, and instead rated the extent of benefit to be smaller.","566":"","567":"","568":"","569":"","570":"In the autumn of 2014, more than 3,000 surgeons completed an online questionnaire asking for the prevalence and efficiency of instruments to prevent adverse events within surgical departments in Germany.

The surgeons were asked to rank the different instruments for the prevention of adverse events. According to the respondents, preoperative marking of the surgical site and the use of checklists were at the top of the efficacy ranking, followed by an introductory course for surgeons starting work in a hospital or when new devices became available. Only 50 % of the responding surgeons perceived CIRS as being efficient. Overall, the answers showed that instruments to increase patient safety were commonly available in surgical departments. On the other hand, there is still room for improvement in daily practice. ","571":"An evidence-based healthcare system necessitates a new role allocation and new role definitions of the players. By means of professional delegation, physician-nurse substitution and adoption of new professional functions, which so far have not been part of their professional profiles, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals will adopt a broad spectrum of new responsibilities. At present, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals lack basic scientific competencies and opportunities to acquire skills in evidence-based practice. A reliable link between evidence-generating sciences in nursing, midwifery and allied health professions and clinical practice is missing. In the future, an increase of academically qualified health professionals and a new skills mix within each profession might promote active and effective participation in an evidence-based healthcare system.

The aim of this paper was to compare recommendations from different cancer institutions in German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland) regarding screening for breast, cervix, colon, and prostate cancer and to assess the quality and development process of patient information materials. Relevant information material was identified through web searches and personal contact with cancer institutions. To achieve our objective, we employed a qualitative approach. The quality of 22 patient information materials was analysed based on established guidance by Bunge et al. In addition, we conducted guided interviews about the process of developing information materials with decision-makers of cancer institutes. Overall, major discrepancies in cancer screening recommendations exist among the Austrian, German, and Swiss cancer institutes. Process evaluation revealed that crucial steps of quality assurance, such as assembling a multi-disciplinary panel, assessing conflicts of interest, or transparency regarding funding sources, have frequently not been undertaken. All information materials had substantial quality deficits in multiple areas. Three out of four institutes issued information materials that met fewer than half of the quality criteria. Most patient information materials of cancer institutes in German-speaking countries are fraught with substantial deficits and do not provide an objective source for patients to be able to make an informed decision for or against cancer screening.

Oncotyrol is funded through the COMET Excellence Program by the Austrian government via the national Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). This article focuses on the role of health technology assessment (HTA) and outcomes research in personalized cancer medicine in the context of Oncotyrol. Oncotyrol, which currently comprises approximately 20 individual projects, has four research areas: Area 1: Biomarker and Drug Target Identification; Area 2: Assay Development and Drug Screening; Area 3: Innovative Therapies; Area 4: Health Technology Assessment and Bioinformatics. Area 4 translates the results from Areas 1 to 3 to populations and society and reports them back to Area 3 to inform clinical studies and guidelines, and to Areas 1 and 2 to guide further research and development. In a series of international expert workshops, the Oncotyrol International Expert Task Force for Personalized Cancer Medicine developed the Methodological Framework for Early Health Technology Assessment and Decision Modeling in Cancer and practical guidelines in this field. Further projects included applications in the fields of sequential treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness evaluation of prostate cancer screening, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiple cervical cancer screening strategies, and benefits and cost-effectiveness of genomic test-based treatment strategies in breast cancer. An interdisciplinary setting as generated in Oncotyrol provides unique opportunities such as systematically coordinating lab and bench research, product development, clinical studies and decision science\/HTA and transparent joint planning of research and development with a partnership of researchers, manufacturers and health policy decision makers. However, generating a joint research and legal framework with numerous partners from different sectors can be challenging, particularly in the starting period of such an endeavor. The journey to translational personalized medicine through multidisciplinary collaborations may still be long and difficult, but it is evident that it must be continued to turn vision into reality. ","578":"The development of evidence-based guidelines is an interdisciplinary process in which methodologists play an important role. In addition to creating new or assessing existing systematic reviews as a basis for evidence-based decision making, methodologists can support the entire development process. Due to the increasing complexity of methods and the information overload of available publications, cooperation between the involved experts (especially clinicians and methodologists, but also patient representatives) is essential in order to develop reliable, acceptable and practical guidelines. This article looks at eight key points of the guideline development process (transparency, conflicts of interest, composition of guideline development group, establishing evidence foundation, development and formulation of recommendations, external review and updating) from the perspective of methodologists, and highlights problems, challenges and solution approaches. The earliest possible involvement of methodologists, a clear and a--for non-methodologists--understandable presentation of the best available evidence, the integration of methodologists in the creation and formulation of recommendations (systematic, evidence-based decision-making process) and cooperation between the participating experts are essential to improve the development process of evidence-based guidelines.","579":null,"580":"The \"overview of reviews\" has evolved as a method to aggregate information from systematic reviews.

The six analysed projects differed in their objectives as well as in the corresponding methodology. We identified the following strengths of the overviews of reviews performed: the overview of the evidence base on an issue, the rapid detection of the results of numerous reviews, the demonstration of evidence gaps and potential savings in time and resources. At the same time, the methodology could lead to a loss of information, limited relevance and to uncertainties regarding the robustness of the overall results. However, the heterogeneity of the methods used shows that the development of methods for overviews of reviews is still ongoing. Whether overviews of reviews provide valuable decision support depends on the research question and realistic expectations towards the method.

In preparation for the 2015 Cochrane Colloquium in Vienna, we discuss the issues faced by three major actors of this system: patients, healthcare practitioners, and systematic reviewers. We analyze their situation through the concept of \"filter failure\", positing that the main problem is not that there is \"too much information\", but that the traditional means of managing and evaluating information are ill-suited to the realities of the digital age. Some of the major instances of filter failure are inadequate information retrieval systems for point-of-care settings, the problem of identifying all relevant evidence in an exceedingly diverse landscape of information resources, and the very basic lack of health information literacy, concerning not only the general public. Finally, we give an overview of proposed solutions to the problem of information overload.

It is a highly contested endeavour. One backdoor of justifying CAM interventions - even if, according to the scientific standards of conventional medicine, they have been proved to lack specific effectiveness - is their use as therapeutic placebos. In this paper we will first discuss general critical considerations regarding deceptive placebo use and then argue that in the specific case of CAM interventions used as placebos general ethical reservations are reinforced by the fact that their use is prone to promote a non- or antiscientific attitude among physicians and patients, which we consider highly problematic.

For this reason various measures have been designed over the past few years to ensure a greater level of patient safety in surgery. One such measure is the implementation of the WHO safety checklist in German hospitals. The benefits of this checklist on postoperative complications have been substantiated by evidence from EbM level II studies and meta-analyses. The application of further tools such as the systematic rating of hospitals in terms of defined operative procedures would appear theoretically rational, but has not been demonstrated by studies with a higher level of evidence.

The operative disciplines are often associated with innovations because of their continuous, stepwise adaptation of daily practice to established procedures. Medical devices play a significant role in integrating surgical technology with surgical experience. The success of a surgical innovation and other invasive treatments does not only depend on the surgical procedure, but also on the context of the whole treatment process including the pre- and postoperative phase, the interaction of the surgical team and the setting. High standards have been set for the assessment of surgical innovations in terms of patient safety, efficacy and patient benefit, which will be discussed in the present paper. A stepwise approach to evaluation will be used, split into preclinical development, clinical development (feasibility and safety), evaluation phase (efficacy and patient benefit) and longtime surveillance.

Currently, the CHIR-Net comprises 12 regional surgical centres with their associated clinical partner hospitals. The major aim of this network is to generate patient-relevant surgical questions of high clinical impact and to answer these questions in high-quality prospective randomised multicentre trials with well-trained study personnel. Since 2006 32 mRCTs have been initiated in the CHIR-Net. Twelve surgical regional centres - in cooperation with 333 German and European hospitals - have recruited more than 7,500 patients.

This article provides an insight into the guideline's underlying methodology, using graphics as an example. In addition, the results of a qualitative study exploring the competencies of health information developers are presented. These results will guide the implementation of the guideline. We conducted systematic literature searches (until June 2014), critical appraisal and descriptive analyses applying GRADE for two selected guideline questions. Out of 3,287 hits 11 RCTs were included in the analysis. The evidence has been rated to be of low to moderate quality. Additional graphics may have a positive effect on cognitive outcomes. However, the relevance of the results is questionable. For graphics, we found some indication that especially pictograms but also bar graphs have a positive effect on cognitive outcomes and meet patients' preferences. In order to prepare for the implementation of the guideline, we conducted a qualitative study to explore the competencies of health information developers using expert interviews. Four telephone interviews were conducted, audio recorded, transcribed and analysed according to Grounded Theory. Six categories were identified: literature search, development of health information, participation of target groups, continuing education and further training of health information developers, cooperation with different institutions, essential competencies.

This paper describes the first implementation experiences on the basis of internally collected data on the involvement of multipliers, availability and assessment of their relevance. A first analysis shows that the short information leaflets are broadly available amongst the self-governing bodies and that they are considered to be of high relevance. Due to the direct involvement of the members of specialty societies and patient organisations and other experts, short information leaflets are also gaining acceptance outside the self-governing system. This is emphasised by the rising number of requests to reprint or cite or use the leaflets. Consistency with evidence-based treatment recommendations promotes acceptance of these leaflets among physicians.

Since 2006 IQWiG has maintained the publicly available website gesundheitsinformation.de. Currently, about 80 million people live in Germany, and the majority of them have internet access. The goal of this project was to evaluate published studies examining health information seeking behaviour (who, when and how) on the internet. A systematic search was conducted in several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE [Ovid)], PsycInfo [Ovid] und CINAHL [Ebsco]) for studies on internet searches for health information. No study type restrictions were imposed. Data were extracted from the relevant studies, and then discussed in the project group and summarised qualitatively. Of the 1,150 abstracts identified, 169 publications were analysed in full. 74 studies were included, most of which were surveys (n=59). The data were extracted from these studies and then summarised qualitatively to obtain an overview of the current state of research in this field. The results suggest that the group most often searching for health-related information on the internet - either on their own behalf or on behalf of others - consists of middle-aged women with a higher level of education and income. The most common reason for initiating a search for health information is a visit to the doctor, and the most common starting point is a search engine. Page layout and user-friendliness are the main criteria for assessing the credibility of websites and the information they provide. Users are more likely to trust information that is consistent with their own experiences and opinions. There is a growing trend of using the internet as a source for health information. It seems that trust in the credibility of a given website or information mostly depends on factors that are hardly related to the quality of content.

A guideline implementation strategy was examined in a four-armed, non-randomised, controlled intervention study with an additional control group. The study participants were general practitioners and paediatricians recruited from primary care quality circles. All study participants attended an interactive seminar on the evidence-based recommendations for patients with asthma. In addition, the participants were asked to choose among the following options: no further intervention, additional e-learning, training of their practice nurses, or e-learning and training of their practice nurses. The success of the intervention was measured by questionnaire (and the success rate expressed as a percentage). About one third of all participants (n=313) opted for the combination of an interactive seminar and a training of practice nurses; two third preferred the classic way of continuing medical education with an interactive seminar without a further intervention. Just 10 % of the physicians participated in e-learning. Independently of their choice for continuing medical education, all participants demonstrated an increase in knowledge about asthma and an improvement in the management of asthma. The physicians exhibited an average increase in both categories of about 10 % of the percentage values, compared to an increase of about 28 % among the practice nurses without continuing medical education. The physicians' free choice of the educative modules might be an integral part of successful implementation strategies. However, this will require a change of focus from general continuing medical education packages to a more individualised culture of continuing professional development in Germany.

Development of recommendations for German general practice on managing fitness to drive in dementia. Specification of problem areas by using relevant parts of a metasynthesis of international qualitative dementia research with GPs; literature review on evidence regarding the pre-defined problem areas; deduction of a preliminary design for a recommendation in a multi-professional team. The difficulties include the assessment of fitness to drive in the office setting, concerns about damaging the patient-physician relationship by raising the issue of driving fitness, and uncertainties about the GP's own legal role. A diagnosis of dementia does not per se preclude driving. The majority of elderly people would accept discussing fitness to drive with their GP. In Germany, GPs are not obliged to assess fitness to drive, or to report unsafe drivers to the Licensing Agency, but under certain conditions they do have the right to report. Addressing the issue of driving and dementia early with the patient seems to be a prerequisite for a resource-oriented and patient-centred management. The distinction between medical, ethical-communicative, and legal aspects enabled us to break down this complex problem and thus provide the informative basis to draft tailored recommendations. In an ongoing project, this framework will be further developed and informed by the expertise of patients, family caregivers, and professionals from various fields. ","604":"Context and implementation of health interventions have received increasing attention over the past decade, in particular with respect to their influence on the effectiveness and reach of complex interventions. The underlying concepts are both considered partially mature, limiting their operationalization in research and practice. We conducted systematic literature searches and pragmatic utility (PU) concept analyses to provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the concepts of \"context\" and \"implementation\" in the health sciences to create a common understanding for their use within systematic reviews and HTA. We performed two separate searches, one for context (EMBASE, MEDLINE) and the other for implementation (Google Scholar) to identify relevant models, theories and frameworks. 17 publications on context and 35 articles on implementation met our inclusion criteria. PU concept analysis comprises three guiding principles: selection of the literature, organization and structuring of the literature, and asking analytic questions of the literature. Both concepts were analyzed according to four features of conceptual maturity, i.e., consensual definitions, clear characteristics, fully described preconditions and outcomes, and delineated boundaries. Context and implementation are highly intertwined, with both concepts influencing and interacting with each other. Context is defined as a set of characteristics and circumstances that surround the implementation effort. Implementation is conceptualized as a planned and deliberately initiated effort with the intention to put an intervention into practice. The concept of implementation presents largely consensual definitions and relatively well-defined boundaries, while distinguishing features, preconditions and outcomes are not yet fully articulated. In contrast, definitions of context vary widely, and boundaries with neighbouring concepts, such as setting and environment, are blurred; characteristics, preconditions and outcomes are ill-defined. Therefore, the maturity of both concepts should be further improved to facilitate operationalization in systematic reviews and HTAs.

The presence of gaps between knowledge and practice is well documented and a range of strategies is available to overcome these gaps. To optimize their impact, it is recommended that implementation strategies are tailored to the target population, setting and goals for improvement. Themes for future research in the field are: implementation of personalized medicine, the economics of implementation, knowledge implementation in various health professions, patient involvement in implementation, and a better understanding of the determinants of implementation. Addressing these challenges requires dedicated training programs, research funding, and networks for effective collaboration with stakeholders in healthcare.

Many health promotion and prevention measures, by contrast, (also) address the societal level and the environment, but there are few robust studies on their effectiveness, not least because of a lack of resources, the complexity of the measures, or randomisation problems. For example, regulations that protect non-smokers from smoke are subject to political processes where the majority of decision-makers would decline consent for randomisation. In a workshop at the 15(th) Annual Meeting of the German Network for Evidence-based Medicine (DNEbM) two case studies on controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) were developed by the audience as possible alternatives to randomised controlled trials for the evaluation of health promotion and health prevention programmes. The suggestions made by the audience were compared to the study designs chosen in published studies, and the strengths and weaknesses of the different study designs were discussed. The wide array of suggestions for effectiveness studies illustrated the potential of evidence-based health promotion and prevention, but also the specific challenges to be faced. ","617":"The German prostate cancer study PREFERE (www.prefere.de) started in January 2014. It is the first randomised controlled and preference-based trial to investigate all four options available for the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer. According to the \"Interdisciplinary evidence-based S3 guideline for the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of the different stages of prostate cancer\" [1], these options include: radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, brachytherapy and active surveillance. In the context of PREFERE preference-based means that potential study participants who do not agree to being randomised into all four treatment arms can maximally refuse two treatment arms. This poses a big challenge to the patient education strategy employed and the information material it requires. In order to inform patients in the context of the PREFERE trial patient education materials (patient leaflet and video) had to be designed that provide patients with balanced and guideline-based information about the disease and the treatment options available, about the need for randomisation and, in particular, about the PREFERE trial and support their individual preference finding and shared decision making for participating in the trial. An iterative structured approach was used to develop the information materials on the basis of a previous literature search. Six focus groups with a total of 40 participants from three different self-help groups, affected men that do not belong to a self-help group, healthy men as well as experts, the members of the steering committee of the PREFERE trial and a focus group consisting of 18 male and female urologists were involved in the development and testing of both the patient information leaflet and the patient video. Both the patient information leaflet and the video supporting preference finding and decision making for participating in the PREFERE trial were tested for understandability and suitability by using a questionnaire and conducting a comprehensive discussion. The results of these lay evaluations have been included in the final revision. Also, a communication resource for physicians has been created comprising all the essential aspects of the PREFERE patient education materials. A short course conducted all over Germany will focus on the process of patient teaching as well as patient education materials. Whether and to what extent the decision for participating in the PREFERE trial has actually been influenced 1) by what the treating physicians communicated to the patient and 2) by the patient education materials used is one of the subjects of a quality of life survey that will be conducted following treatment or - in the case of the active surveillance option - after randomisation during the PREFERE trial.

Since then, the assessment of the added benefit of new drugs versus a therapeutic standard on the basis of dossiers submitted by pharmaceutical companies has been required by law. The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) generally commissions the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) with this task. The added benefit is primarily to be demonstrated on the basis of patient-relevant outcomes. The aim of this paper is to describe the feasibility of the early benefit assessment on the basis of patient-relevant outcomes by systematically characterising the outcomes available in company dossiers and comparing the companies' and IQWiG's evaluations regarding patient relevance and surrogate validity. Dossier assessments published between October 2011 and June 2012 were used for this purpose. The outcomes available and the respective evaluations were extracted and compared. 12 out of 22 submitted dossiers contained sufficient data to assess outcomes; all 12 assessable dossiers provided data on patient-relevant outcomes. Data on mortality and adverse events were available in all dossiers, except that one dossier did not contain adverse event data on the relevant subpopulation. In contrast, data on morbidity and health-related quality of life were available in 8 and 7 dossiers, respectively. Of a total of 214 outcomes extracted by IQWiG, 124 patient-relevant and 3 surrogate outcomes were included in IQWiG's assessment (companies: a total of 183 outcomes included, of which 172 were patient-relevant and 11 were surrogates). The first experiences with AMNOG have shown that in principle an early benefit assessment of drugs based on patient-relevant outcomes is feasible. The companies' and IQWiG's evaluations regarding patient relevance and surrogate validity of outcomes partly deviated from each other. By increasingly considering patient-relevant outcomes in approval studies, pharmaceutical companies can create the necessary data basis for the early benefit assessment. ","623":"Quality assurance is required for all relevant instruments and procedures in epidemiological studies just like for clinical trials. The structure and complexity of the monitoring was developed based on the monitoring in clinical trials and applied to an epidemiological cohort study on early detection of cervical cancer (MARZY Study). Analyses of the on-site monitoring in participating gynaecological practices during the baseline investigation of the MARZY cohort were presented. The baseline investigation of the MARZY study was conducted between 2005 and 2007 in the city of Mainz, the rural district of Mainz-Bingen and surrounding areas. Women, who were randomly selected via population registries, were invited to attend cervical cancer screening at a gynaecologist's office of their choice. All study participants received a study swab in addition to their routine Pap smear. The on-site monitoring included equipment and support of all participating gynaecological practices during study recruitment. Each participant and physician signed an informed consent form. In addition, the participant completed an epidemiological questionnaire. The gynaecologist took the study swab and completed the study documentation form. Prior to recruitment, standardised processes and documentation forms were developed for the monitoring process. The monitoring visits were carried out every six to eight weeks. During the baseline investigation, participants were included in the study among 121 gynaecological practices. In total, 2,892 monitoring documentation forms from 390 on-site monitoring visits in 96 gynaecological practices from the study region and surrounding areas were analysed. On-site monitoring visits were more frequently conducted during the first year of the study. The average time needed for an on-site visit was 107 minutes (minimum 73 minutes, maximum 200 minutes). Problems such as incomplete study documentation forms or erroneous inclusion into the study occurred among 975 study participants (33.7%). 664 study participants (68.1%) did not fully complete the study forms, and 89 (9.1%) were included in the study despite the fact that they met the exclusion criteria such as hysterectomy or pregnancy. Most of these problems could be sufficiently corrected during the on-site monitoring. Monitoring in epidemiological studies performed at physicians' offices should be carried out in accordance with the monitoring in clinical trials. On-site monitoring helped to avoid missing data and to ensure adherence to exclusion criteria. On-site monitoring considerably contributed to the correct and complete study inclusion of all eligible participants and a high quality of study data.","624":"Secondary data analyses will play an increasingly important role in health services research. But to date, there is no guideline for the systematic, transparent and complete reporting of secondary data. We investigated whether the STROBE statement, i.e., the recommendations for reporting observational studies, satisfies the specific characteristics of secondary data analyses and whether any specifications\/modifications and extensions are necessary. For the majority of the 22 STROBE criteria, specifications and extensions are needed to meet the requirements of systematic, transparent and complete reporting of secondary data analysis. Seven aspects of secondary data analysis not covered by STROBE (legal aspects, data flow, protocol, unit of analysis, internal validations\/definitions, advantages of secondary data utilisation, role of data owners) should be considered as a specific complement to STROBE. The so called STROSA (STandardized Reporting Of Secondary data Analyses) checklist therefore includes 29 items that relate to the title\/abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. The STROSA checklist is intended to support authors and readers in the critical appraisal of secondary data analyses. This proposal will now be subject to continued scientific discussions.

But not every clinical study is optimally planned, conducted and analysed and is therefore exposed to risk of systematic errors which can distort (bias) the study results. Clinical studies should be conducted in accordance with specific quality criteria in order to reduce these risks. To estimate the methodological quality of studies instruments such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool were developed. But it can only be appraised what is reported. Often important information on the conduct and analysis of a study is missing in research articles, and in most cases detailed study protocols are not freely available. Reporting guidelines available for different study types can help improve the transparency and completeness of reports of clinical studies and thus the reporting quality. ","627":"In Germany, the aims of hospital quality measurement have evolved from intra-professional quality assurance via organisational quality improvement to public reporting. Recently, quality-based purchasing is also discussed as a political option. These developments lead to new requirements for quality measurement which have gained little attention so far. Quality indicators have to become more comprehensive, more outcome-related, and more tamper-resistant. Furthermore statistical limitations of quality measurement related to low case numbers may impair quality assessment and therefore have to be considered in political discussions. In many cases the use of administrative data allows for the measurement of meaningful endpoints and is less prone to manipulation than separate data collections. Also, it allows for the extension of quality measurements to other medical conditions without causing additional effort. Bearing costs and benefits in mind, the use of administrative data might be the only way to establish nationwide long-term outcome measurements. Using administrative data also enables the advancement of provider-independent quality measurement. This may cause political controversies. Irrespective of future political regulations, new outcome-related quality measurements already have been shown to contribute to improving hospital care, if used in internal quality management systems. ","628":"This paper describes the core principles and processes used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to develop quality standards and quality indicators from evidence based guidelines. ","629":"The German Guideline Programme in Oncology (GGPO) is a joint initiative between the German Cancer Society, the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and German Cancer Aid. In accordance with the aims of the German National Cancer Plan, the GGPO supports the systematic development of high-quality guidelines. To enhance implementation and evaluation, the suggestion of performance measures (PMs) derived from guideline recommendations following a standardised methodology is obligatory within the GGPO. For this purpose, PM teams are convened representing the multidisciplinary guideline development groups including clinical experts, methodologists and patient representatives as well as those organisations that take an active part in and share responsibility for documentation and quality improvement, i.e., clinical cancer registries, certified cancer centres and, if appropriate, the institution responsible for external quality assurance according to the German Social Code (SGB). The primary selection criteria for PMs include strength of the underlying recommendation (strong, grade A), existing potential for improvement of care and measurability. The premises of data economy and standardised documentation are taken into account. Between May 2008 and July 2014, 12 guidelines with suggestions for 100 PMs have been published. The majority of the suggested performance measures is captured by the specific documentation requirements of the clinical cancer registries and certified cancer centres. This creates a solid basis for an active quality management and re-evaluation of the suggested PMs. In addition, the suspension of measures should be considered if improvement has been achieved on a broad scale and for a longer period in order to concentrate on a quality-oriented, economic documentation. ","630":"For several years, the use of administrative data in mandatory quality measurement has been requested by several stakeholders in Germany. Main advantages of using administrative data include the reduction of documentary expenditures and the possibility to perform longitudinal quality analyses across different healthcare units. After a short introduction, a brief overview of the current use of administrative data for mandatory quality assurance as well as current developments is given, which will then be further exemplified by decubital ulcer prophylaxis. By using administrative data coding expenditures in this clinical area could be reduced by nine million data fields. At the same time the population analysed was expanded resulting in a more than tenfold increase in potentially quality-relevant events. Finally, perspectives, further developments, possibilities as well as limits of quality measurement with administrative data are discussed. ","631":null,"632":"","633":"The German \"Dr med\" plays a specific role in doctoral thesis settings since students may start the underlying doctoral project during their studies at medical school. If a Medical Faculty principally encourages this approach, then it should support the students in performing the respective projects as efficiently as possible. Consequently, it must be ensured that students are able to implement and complete a doctoral project in parallel to their studies. As a characteristic efficiency feature of these \"Dr med\" initiatives, the proportion of doctoral projects successfully completed shortly after graduating from medical school is proposed and illustrated. The proposed characteristic can be estimated by the time period between the state examination (date of completion of the qualifying medical examination) and the doctoral examination. Completion of the doctoral project \"during their medical studies\" was then characterised by a doctoral examination no later than 12 months after the qualifying medical state examination. To illustrate the estimation and interpretation of this characteristic, it was retrospectively estimated on the basis of the full sample of all doctorates successfully completed between July 2009 and June 2012 at the Department of Human Medicine at the Faculty of Health of the University of Witten\/Herdecke. During the period of investigation defined, a total number of 56 doctoral examinations were documented, 30 % of which were completed within 12 months after the qualifying medical state examination (95% confidence interval 19 to 44 %). The median duration between state and doctoral examination was 27 months. The proportion of doctoral projects completed parallel to the medical studies increased during the investigation period from 14 % in the first year (July 2009 till June 2010) to 40 % in the third year (July 2011 till June 2012). Only about a third of all \"Dr med\" projects at the Witten\/Herdecke Faculty of Health were completed during or close to the qualifying medical studies. This proportion, however, increased after the introduction of a curriculum on research methodology and practice in 2010; prospective longitudinal studies will have to clarify whether this is causal or mere chronological coincidence. In summary, the proposed method for determining the process efficiency of a medical faculty's \"Dr med\" programme has proven to be both feasible and informative. ","634":"Medical schools in Germany may select 60% of the student applicants through their own admission tests. The influence of the school-leaving examination grades (EGs) in each of the procedural steps is controversial. At Goettingen Medical School, we combine a structured interview and a communicative skills assessment. We analysed how many applicants succeeded in our admission test, compared to a model which only takes EGs into account. Admission scores were transferred into SPSS-21. Sociodemographic data were submitted by the Stiftung Hochschulstart. Besides descriptive statistics, we used Pearson-correlation and means comparisons (t-test, analysis of variance). 221 applicants (EGs 1.0-1.9) were invited in the winter semester 2013\/14 and 222 applicants (EGs 1.1-1.8) in the summer semester 2014. The proportion of women was 68% (winter) and 74% (summer). Sixteen and 37 applicants had a medical vocational training and performed slightly better. The analysis showed that our test was gender neutral. EGs did not correlate with interviews or skills assessment. Despite a two-fold impact of EGs, 26 (winter) and 44 (summer) of the overall 181 applicants had EGs of 1.4 -1.9, which would have been too low for admission otherwise. If EGs were only considered once, 40 (winter) and 59 (summer) applicants would have succeeded.

Existing clinical practice guidelines facilitate a more participatory and evidence-based approach to the development of top 5 lists. In return, adding top 5 lists (for overuse and underuse) to existing clinical practice guidelines nicely addresses a neglected dimension to clinical practice guideline development, namely explicit information on which Do or Don't do recommendations are frequently disregarded in practice. ","638":"","639":"","640":"The involvement of patient representatives in the development process of clinical practice guidelines is accepted as an international standard. However, there is no consensus on the optimal methods to be used. We explored how patient advocates experienced their role while being actively involved in guideline development. From November 2012 to January 2013 problem-centred interviews were conducted with eleven patient representatives from Germany who were involved in evidence-based guideline development. The interviews were analysed using the methods of Grounded Theory. Three main categories were derived which patient representatives perceived as the most important prerequisites for active participation in guideline development groups: knowledge, endorsement and adopting the role. Knowledge combined with an explicit clarification of the role of the patient representative seems to have a positive impact on the adoption of the specific role in a guideline developing group. Our study indicates how active involvement of patient representatives in guideline development processes can be optimised. Initially, the role of the patient representative should be explicitly clarified; and courses offering methodological support should be provided. The informative value of the study is limited by the small number of interviews. Therefore, further studies are needed. ","641":"Over the past decades, a large number of measures for quality management and quality assurance (QM\/QA) of healthcare were established in the German healthcare system. Considering the resources required, it has been repeatedly demanded that such quality programmes be checked for their effectiveness. In this context, the present paper describes the results of a systematic literature review to evaluate German QM\/QA programmes in the inpatient sector. A systematic literature search was conducted in the electronic databases Medline, Cochrane Library and topic-related institution websites. In addition, hand searches were conducted, and the search engine Google Scholar was used. For Germany, no time limit was placed on the literature search. Evaluation studies were only selected if they included a comparison group without or at the beginning of a QM\/QA programme and measured the effects on outcomes, process or structure of inpatient care. The methodological quality of the eligible studies was assessed and summarised. Out of 3,065 hits, 18 publications were included in the literature review. In Germany, no causal relationships between QM\/QA programmes and a relevant benefit for improved quality of care for patients in the hospital sector could be detected in any study. Results were inconsistent or insufficiently reliable without demonstrating a clear positive or negative impact of the analysed programmes on the quality of care. Overall, the quality of the included studies was low. No acceptable scientific studies for the German healthcare system could be detected that provided proof for a patient-related effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the established quality programmes. Due to the insufficient evidence and despite the challenges faced when conducting convincing evaluation studies in the field of QM\/QA, established methods of the evaluation research should be applied and extended. ","642":"Involving patients or patient-representatives in the development of guidelines is widely recommended. The expected benefits of patient involvement include an increase in the relevance and acceptability of the guidelines. So far there has been no systematic review of patient involvement in the development process of the German AMWF S3 and nursing guidelines and no description of the recommendations made by guideline-developing organisations and the scientific literature concerning the methods of patient involvement. A systematic search was performed (July 2013) to identify AWMF S3 and nursing guidelines, manuals for guideline development, and scientific literature on methods of patient involvement. The following data were extracted: the methods of patient involvement from the guidelines, and all recommendations on a successful patient involvement from the manuals of guideline development and from the scientific literature. A total of 124 AWMF S3 and 18 nursing guidelines, six manuals of guideline development and ten scientific publications were included. Patient representatives were involved in the development process in 71 out of 142 guidelines (n=63 AWMF S3 and n=8 nursing guidelines). The manuals for guideline development included recommendations for a global involvement of patient representatives and recommendations for specific stages of the development process. In the scientific publications, active and early involvement has been identified as a key element to a successful involvement of patient representatives. In the German AMWF and nursing guidelines, patient involvement is currently not an established standard. This could be improved by including mandatory rules for patient involvement in the manuals for guideline development. More research is needed on the effects of patient involvement on the content and applicability of guidelines. ","643":"Guideline synopses, i.e. the systematic synthesis of clinical practice guidelines, are used as a basis for Disease Management Programmes (DMPs) in Germany. One of the responsibilities of the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) is the preparation of guideline synopses for DMPs. The article describes the experiences with this methodology. For the preparation of guideline synopses, a systematic search for evidence-based guidelines is conducted, and their recommendations are extracted and synthesised. In parallel, the quality of the guidelines is assessed using the AGREE instrument. The need for updating or supplementing a DMP is justified by means of the Grade of Recommendation (GoR) or, alternatively, the Level of Evidence (LoE). Since 2006 IQWiG has synthesised recommendations from 256 evidence-based guidelines in 12 guideline synopses for DMPs. The results are then used by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) to update DMPs. Using the example of the 12 synopses, several analyses were conducted. It was determined that a search for guidelines in guideline databases is sufficient and that a search in bibliographic databases can be dispensed with. Furthermore, the analyses showed that a large proportion of recommendations in evidence-based guidelines are not clearly linked to a GoR or LoE. If GoR and LoE are provided, only about 42% of recommendations with a strong GoR also refer to a strong LoE. It was also shown that only 21 % of the analysed guideline providers supplied information on the handling of unpublished data. With consistent average to high values, the assessment of the methodological quality across all of the prepared synopses allows for the conclusion of a basically acceptable guideline quality, but with a need for improvement. A guideline synopsis is an established tool for identifying health care standards as a basis for developing and updating DMPs. Further methodological development, particularly in collaboration with guideline providers, appears to be reasonable. It should be examined whether guideline synopses are suitable not only for guideline and DMP development, but also for other health care issues. ","644":"Following a recommendation of the National Advisory Council for the Concerted Action in Health Care, the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) have promoted, supported and coordinated the development of clinical practice guidelines in Germany since 1995. The allocation of the responsibility for guideline development in the scientific societies corresponded to the principle of subsidiarity, in contrast to other countries counting on government-organised guideline programmes. To fulfil internationally consented criteria of high-quality guidelines, a quality improvement system was established relying on frequent assessments of the current state. Today, high-quality clinical practice guidelines developed by the scientific societies organised under the umbrella of the AWMF are an indispensable tool for various initiatives to improve healthcare in the German healthcare system. The next challenging goal is to establish a theory-driven framework allowing for a systematic implementation and evaluation of guidelines in Germany on the basis of existing approaches. However, success in this endeavour will require further research and funding. ","645":"","646":"The nursing Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS 3.0) and other nursing quality indices summarise relevant health and nursing outcomes for long-term care that are recommended as quality measures. These are measures like \"Percent of High-Risk Residents with Pressure Ulcers\", \"Percent of Low-Risk Residents Who Lose Control of Their Bowels or Bladder\", \"Percent of Residents Experiencing One or More Falls with Major Injury\", \"Percent of Residents Who Lose Too Much Weight\" etc. Analyses of healthcare data in Germany showed a substantial higher risk for negative outcomes in the long-term care setting in persons with dementia compared to persons without dementia. There already exist evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for most of the quality measures and underlying health problems (e.g., the German \"Expertenstandards in der Pflege\"). Implementation and translation of evidence have not been systematically researched yet, and there is uncertainty about structures and processes that support implementation and eventually lead to improved nursing outcomes in people with dementia in long-term care. Studies showed a potential benefit of master-level geriatric advanced practice nurses (GAPNs) concerning the implementation of evidence-based guidelines. This corresponds to the expectation that academic nursing staff positively influences research utilisation in practice. A systematic review identified four controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of GAPN on select quality measures. Both the internal and external validity of the trials require a thorough investigation into the intervention before translation and effectiveness research in Germany can be recommended. In accordance with national and international recommendations on the development and clinical evaluation of complex interventions, we recommend a multistage model. Such a model comprises the conceptualisation and adaptation of the original intervention. In this way, the original concept of a GAPN has to be translated into the context of the German healthcare system. Furthermore, feasibility of the intervention in general has to be investigated. This includes acceptance of GAPNs in practice and the necessary prerequisites, especially concerning a comprehensive commitment of one APN to more than one long-term care facility. ","647":"In Germany, about 100,000 people currently suffer from aphasia. This speech disorder occurs as a result of neurologic events such as stroke or traumatic brain injury. Aphasia causes major limitations in social participation and quality of life and can be associated with unemployability and social isolation. For affected persons, it is essential to regain and maintain autonomy in daily life, both at work and with family and friends. The loss of autonomy is perceived much more dramatically than the loss of speech. Clients wish to minimise this loss of autonomy in daily life. As full recovery is not achievable in chronic aphasia, treatment must focus on improved compensatory approaches and on supporting the clients' coping strategies. Based on eight randomised comparisons including 347 participants, a recent Cochrane review (Brady et al., 2012) revealed that speech therapy - as compared with no treatment - had positive effects on functional communication in clients suffering from aphasia (0.30 SMD; 95% CI[0.08 to 0.52]). There was no evidence suggesting that one type of training was superior to the others. However, quality of life and social participation were not evaluated as outcomes. Recent studies found that speech therapy-led training for communication and self-efficacy and the integration of communication partners may have a positive impact on these client-centred outcomes. Speech therapy-led training for communication within a group setting should be manualised and pilot-tested with respect to feasibility and acceptance in a German sample of people with aphasia and their communication partners. Instruments measuring quality of life and social participation can be validated within the scope of this feasibility study. These research efforts are necessary to prepare a large-scale comparative effectiveness research trial comparing the effects of both usual speech therapy and speech therapy-led group communication training on quality of life and social participation. ","648":"In order to address the increasing complexity and continuously changing needs and demands in the German healthcare system, there is a need to strengthen knowledge translation, evidence-based practice and the conduct of clinical trials in the field of allied health professions. An interdisciplinary working group representing the fields of nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy developed a guide and a concept for seminars to provide potential analyses for research and innovations in the allied health professions in Germany. These potential analyses compare the current state of health care delivery for specific health problems and the corpus of evidence for the effectiveness of related interventions. Thus innovations can be identified which might improve client-centred healthcare in Germany. The introductory paper briefly reports the activities and results of the working group, describes the international context of transferring research into practice and outlines possibilities for the future development of coordinated research strategies in Germany. The following papers consist of five potential analyses: (1) Advanced Practice Nursing (APN) in long-term care; (2) giving birth in an upright position; (3) treadmill training for patients with Parkinson's disease; (4) training of everyday activities after stroke; and (5) communication training for patients with aphasia.","649":"Every year about 200,000 people in Germany suffer from a first stroke and 65,000 persons from a recurrent stroke. Stroke is one of the major causes of acquired life-long disability. It is associated with multiple limitations in functioning, activities of daily living and social participation. People with stroke must develop and apply considerable coping and adaptation strategies to manage the consequences of disabilities in daily life. Insufficient adaptations may result in social isolation, depressive disorders, need for medical and nursing care and subsequently lead to increasing costs for care. Thus occupational therapy-led treatment addressing social participation as well as skills training, adaptation strategies and assistive technology for activities of daily living is essential for stroke patients after hospital discharge. Based on nine randomised comparisons, a Cochrane review from 2006 revealed that occupational therapy-led training after stroke had positive effects on personal activities of daily living (8 studies; 961 participants; 0.18 SMD; 95 % CI [0.04 to 0.32]), on extended activities of daily living (6 studies; 847 participants; 0.21 SMD; 95 % CI [0.03 to 0.39]), and on poor outcome (7 studies; 1,065 participants; odds ratio 0.67; 95 % CI [0.51 to 0.87]). However, direct implementation into the German healthcare context is not recommendable due to (1) different settings and heterogeneity within the primary studies, (2) lack of manualisation of treatment programmes and (3) insufficient evaluation of client-oriented outcomes. It is recommended to manualise client-centred standardised modules of a stage-specific occupational therapy-led training of activities of daily living and to pilot-test this intervention programme in a feasibility study. If this trial results in a set of reliable and valid client-oriented outcome measurements applicable within the German care context and in a feasible treatment programme well accepted by stroke patients and their treating occupational therapists, a large-scaled randomised clinical trial in terms of comparative effectiveness research may follow. ","650":"Parkinson's disease is one of the major neurodegenerative disorders with prevalence rates between 0.1 and 0.2 % in the global population and 1.8 % in people aged 64 years and over. Future incidence rates are estimated to increase within aging societies. The progressive course of Parkinson's disease is clinically characterised by bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. These limitations in motor functioning reduce the capacity to work, social participation and the clients' quality of life. Parkinson's disease causes incapacity to work and a large number of days off from work. The benefits clients expect from physiotherapy-led treatment include an improvement of gait, a better speed of motion and the decrease of fatigue and rigidity. A recent Cochrane review (Mehrholz et al., 2010) analysed seven randomised comparisons with 153 participants and found that treadmill training compared with no treatment improved gait speed (SMD 0.50; 95 % confidence interval [0.17 to 0.84]). A lack of evidence exists on how to reduce fatigue and rigidity. There is also need to evaluate long-term effects and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, an updated meta-analysis should include eleven new randomised trials on treadmill training after 2009. Physiotherapy-led treadmill training can easily be transferred into the German healthcare context since the environmental and educational preconditions are met by German physiotherapeutic care. Within the German context, there is need to prepare a randomised clinical trial evaluating the impact of physiotherapy-led treadmill training on motor functioning, quality of life, costs, adverse events und long-term effects. Prior to this, a feasibility study should explore the acceptance and intensity of treadmill training as well as the access of private physiotherapy practices to people suffering from early- to mid-stage Parkinson's disease. ","651":"In German hospitals, three quarters of all low-risk pregnant women give birth in the supine position, despite the fact that German, British and WHO guidelines do not recommend a supine birthing position which is associated with a higher risk to the health of both mother and fetus. Based on 22 RCTs with 7,280 participants, a systematic Cochrane review (Gupta et al., 2012) revealed that an upright position - compared with a supine or lithotomy position - (1) has a positive impact on fetal heart rate patterns, (2) reduces the requirement for analgesic or anaesthetic medications in the second stage of labour, and (3) results in fewer episiotomies and (4) fewer instrumental deliveries. There is a lack of evidence regarding perceived maternal autonomy, self-efficacy and anxiety when giving birth. Furthermore, evidence on long-term effects is absent. Some studies indicate that the choice of an upright birthing position might be boosted by a supporting physical and social environment and by specially trained midwives. There is a need for a feasibility study and a subsequent cluster RCT in the German healthcare context in order to investigate the effects of the upright posture for birthing on perceived maternal autonomy, self-efficacy and anxiety, on the reduction of perinatal complications and on long-term complaints. The complex experimental intervention consists of (1) evidence-based and user-friendly information for women and their partners, (2) facilitating the choice for an upright labour position by special training for midwives and (3) providing a supportive physical and social environment. Within the first study phase, the exploration of feasibility in terms of access to the target group and acceptance of the intervention by pregnant women, their partners and midwives is recommended. Thereby, the implementation of guidelines for upright labour and birth, the documentation and collection of outcome and cost data could be evaluated. Non-German instruments for measuring benefits, harms and long-term effects could be adapted to and validated for the German context.

This article addresses GRADE's approach to determining the direction and strength of a recommendation. The GRADE describes the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes of interest among alternative management strategies depending on four domains, namely estimates of effect for desirable and undesirable outcomes of interest, confidence in the estimates of effect, estimates of values and preferences, and resource use. Ultimately, guideline panels must use judgment in integrating these factors to make a strong or weak recommendation for or against an intervention. ","654":"This article describes the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to classifying the direction and strength of recommendations. The strength of a recommendation, separated into strong and weak, is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects. Alternative terms for a weak recommendation include conditional, discretionary, or qualified. The strength of a recommendation has specific implications for patients, the public, clinicians, and policy makers. Occasionally, guideline developers may choose to make \"only-in-research\" recommendations. Although panels may choose not to make recommendations, this choice leaves those looking for answers from guidelines without the guidance they are seeking. GRADE therefore encourages panels to, wherever possible, offer recommendations. ","655":"The universal access to a health care system for the Brazilian population was established in 1990. Brazil is a country with no tradition in the production and use of health economic evaluation (HEE) to guide decision making in the public health system. It is only within the last two decades that HEEs using a microeconomic approach have appeared in the academic field. On a national level, HEE and Health Technology Assessment (HTA), in a wider sense, were first taken into account in 2003. Two policies deserve to be mentioned - (i) the regulation of medicines in the Brazilian market, and (ii) science, technology and innovation policy. The latter required the fostering of applied research to encourage the application of methods which employ systematic reviews and economic analyses of cost-effectiveness to guide the incorporation of technologies in the Brazilian health care system. The Ministry of Health has initiated the process of incorporating these new technologies on a federal level during the last ten years. In spite of the improvement of HEE methods at Brazilian universities and research institutes, these technologies have not yet reached the governmental bodies. In Brazil, the main challenge lies in the production, interpretation and application of HEE to all technologies within the access scheme(s), and there is limited capacity building. Setting priorities can be the solution for Brazil to be able to perform HEE for relevant technologies within the access scheme(s) while the universal coverage system struggles with a triple burden of disease. ","656":"Medicines expenditure consumes a significant proportion of public health expenditure in Thailand, where Universal Health Coverage has been in place since 2002. The National List of Essential Medicines has been successfully used as a pharmaceutical benefits package for all public health plans. All patients are eligible for all medicines included in the list free of charge by law. Health economic evaluation has been employed as a tool for the development of this list, including price negotiation of medicines before inclusion, especially of high-cost medicines or medicines with high budget implications. This paper illustrates the current process, mechanisms, and impact and informs of seven success factors that have contributed to the successful use of health economic evaluation in Thailand. These include strong political commitment, development of individual and institutional capacity, participation of all relevant stakeholders, establishment of standard methodological and process guidelines, consideration of several elements in the decision-making process, using evidence as a starting point rather than a deciding factor, and strong enforcement. The lessons learned from this study are likely to be applicable to other settings committed to evidence-based decision making. ","657":"For many years, the legal situation within the statutory health insurance (SHI) system in Germany has allowed for health economic evaluations. There are various reasons why health economic evaluations have played virtually no role in decision making until now: to begin with, a method for the evaluation of the relation between benefits and costs which needed to be in accordance with the legal requirements had to be developed, the outcome of which was the efficiency frontier approach. Subsequent health care reforms have led to changing objectives and strategies. Currently, price negotiations of newly launched drugs are based on an early benefit assessment of dossiers submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Other reasons might be the presently very comfortable financial situation of the statutory health insurance system as well as a historically grown societal fear and discomfort towards what is perceived to be a rationing of medicinal products. For the time being, it remains open how long the German health care system can afford to continue neglecting the benefits of health economic evaluations for drug and non-drug interventions, and when it will be time to wake this sleeping beauty.

The counties and municipalities are free to make their own prioritizations within the framework of the state healthcare laws. To guide prioritization of healthcare resources in Sweden, there is consensus that cost-effectiveness constitutes one of the three principles. The objective of this paper is to describe how cost-effectiveness, and hence health economic evaluations (HEE), have a role in pricing decisions, reimbursement of pharmaceuticals as well as the overall prioritization and allocation of resources in the Swedish healthcare system. There are various organizations involved in the processes of implementing health technologies in the Swedish healthcare system, several of which consider or produce HEEs when assessing different technologies: the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV), the county councils' group on new drug therapies (NLT), the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU), regional HTA agencies and the Public Health Agency of Sweden. The only governmental agency that has official and mandatory guidelines for how to perform HEE is TLV (LFNAR 2003:2). Even though HEEs may seem to have a clear and explicit role in the decision-making processes in the Swedish healthcare system, there are various obstacles and challenges in the use and dissemination of the results. ","660":"The 2010 National Health Service Constitution for England specified rights and responsibilities, including health economic evaluation for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations. The National Screening Committee and the Health Protection Agency also provide advice to the Government based on health economic evaluation. Each agency largely follows the methods specified by NICE. To distinguish the methods from neoclassical economics they have been termed \"extra-welfarist\". Key differences include measurement and valuation of both benefits (QALYs) and costs (healthcare related). Policy on discounting has also changed over time and by agency. The debate over having NICE's methods align more closely with neoclassical economics has been prominent in the ongoing development of \"value based pricing\". The political unacceptability of some decisions has led to special funding for technologies not recommended by NICE. These include the 2002 Multiple Sclerosis Risk Sharing Scheme and the 2010 Cancer Drugs Fund as well as special arrangements for technologies linked to the end of life and for innovation. Since 2009 Patient Access Schemes have made price reductions possible which sometimes enables drugs to meet NICE's cost-effectiveness thresholds. As a result, the National Health Service in England has denied few technologies on grounds of cost-effectiveness. ","661":"All governments face immense challenges in providing affordable healthcare for their citizens, and the diffusion of novel health technologies is a key driver of growth in expenditure for many. Although important methodological and process variations exist around the world, health economic evaluation is increasingly seen as an important tool to support decision-making around the introduction of new health technologies, interventions and programmes in countries of varying stages of economic development. In Australia, the assessment of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new medicines proposed for subsidy under the country's national drug subsidy programme, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, was introduced in the late 1980s and became mandatory in 1993, making Australia the first country to introduce such a requirement nationally. Since then the use of health economic evaluation has expanded and been applied to support decision-making across a broader range of health technologies, as well as to programmes in public health. ","662":"","663":"","664":"Presenting continuous outcomes in Summary of Findings tables presents particular challenges to interpretation. When each study uses the same outcome measure, and the units of that measure are intuitively interpretable (e.g., duration of hospitalisation, duration of symptoms), presenting differences in means is usually desirable. When the natural units of the outcome measure are not easily interpretable, choosing a threshold to create a binary outcome and presenting relative and absolute effects become a more attractive alternative. When studies use different measures of the same construct, calculating summary measures requires converting to the same units of measurement for each study. The longest standing and most widely used approach is to divide the difference in means in each study by its standard deviation and present pooled results in standard deviation units (standardised mean difference). Disadvantages of this approach include vulnerability to varying degrees of heterogeneity in the underlying populations and difficulties in interpretation. Alternatives include presenting results in the units of the most popular or interpretable measure, converting to dichotomous measures and presenting relative and absolute effects, presenting the ratio of the means of intervention and control groups, and presenting the results in minimally important difference units. We outline the merits and limitations of each alternative and provide guidance for meta-analysts and guideline developers. Summary of Findings tables provide succinct presentations of evidence quality and magnitude of effects. Summarising the findings of continuous outcomes presents special challenges to interpretation that become daunting when individual trials use different measures for the same construct. The most commonly used approach to providing pooled estimates for different measures, presenting results in standard deviation units, has limitations related to both statistical properties and interpretability. Potentially preferable alternatives include presenting results in the natural units of the most popular measure, transforming into a binary outcome and presenting relative and absolute effects, presenting the ratio of the means of intervention and control groups, and presenting results in preestablished minimally important difference units. ","665":"In general, the evaluation of health technologies is a time-consuming process being performed on the basis of systematic reviews of clinical (primary) studies. In order to save time, health technologies may be assessed based on previously published systematic reviews. However, this assessment method can be associated with a high risk of bias of the obtained results. We developed, therefore, the \"Systematic Reviews for assessment based on Primary Studies\" (SR\/PS) method to enable a transparent, valid and time-saving evaluation of the technologies. Using the SR\/PS method the evaluation of the hits that were identified through the literature search for systematic reviews and, if appropriate, through additional search for primary studies is being performed in three stages, namely identification, quality assessment and information synthesis. This process results in the ascertainment of the three most important sets of information: the pool of identified studies, the pool of methodologically sound studies and the results of the information synthesis. Each stage of the evaluation comprises the comprehensive use of relevant data on primary studies from the systematic reviews. At each stage, the corresponding systematic reviews will be selected from the identified hits using certain quality criteria. If information obtained from the systematic reviews is insufficient it will be completed by additionally incorporating the primary studies. The SR\/PS method can be especially helpful in performing projects with many primary studies (e. g., guidelines development).

This essay investigates whether these new and existing coordination mechanisms build up to a Joined-up Government approach. The analysis shows that the regulatory process should be adjusted along several dimensions. First, many organisations lack awareness regarding their stakeholders and focus solely on their immediate organisational activities. Second, the regulatory process (marketing authorisation and market surveillance) is too fragmented for an effective communication to take place. Finally, the underlying strategy process is an ad-hoc approach lacking continuity and continued involvement of, in particular, the responsible federal ministries.

The different certificates show large differences in their certification requirements, which makes comparing them difficult.

The present paper aims to provide a selective review of various approaches describing effective interdisciplinary teamwork in the OT. Furthermore, it covers observational methods to assess OT teamwork with particular focus on Germany. Our definition of successful surgical teamwork is based on an already established classification system considering five criteria for effective and safe OT teams: coordination, communication, cooperation, leadership, and team monitoring. Well-defined and reliable measures are necessary to examine the quality of OT teamwork. Those methods should entail the special characteristics of the OT team. They should include all phases of the surgical procedure and incorporate all the professions involved (surgeons, surgical nurses, and anaesthetic staff). We conclude that research into methods for the assessment of OTs in Germany needs to be undertaken as a prerequisite to investigating the relationship between OT teamwork and its effects on patient safety and surgical quality. ","670":"As part of the \"Cancer Care in the Family Practice\" project sponsored by the German Cancer Aid association, this overview for the first time assesses to what extent general practitioners (GPs) are considered in the formulation of German cancer guidelines. Guidelines relating to cancer care for adult patients were sought in eight national guideline and specialist association portals. Identified guidelines were initially examined to discover whether they referred to health care programmes, which were specifically developed for general practice, whether GPs were involved in their development, and whether GPs were regarded, either directly or at least indirectly, as a target group. Subsequently, all recommendations that were relevant to GPs were assigned to various main categories (communication, treatment measures) as well as subcategories and quantitatively assessed. Of a total of 559 hits, 29 relevant guidelines were identified, of which 21 clearly referred to cancer care programmes in general practice. Eight guidelines reported that GPs were involved in the development of the guideline, and in four GPs were directly addressed as a target group. The majority of relevant recommendations were assigned to the category 'communication' but often included recommendations for the implementation of measures that were not directly applicable to family doctors (such as diagnosis and therapy). Relevant recommendations were found mostly in S3 guidelines. Not a single cancer guideline mentioned family practice health care programmes, and less than half of them involved family doctors in their development process. Most recommendations from cancer guidelines could not be directly implemented by GPs. The guideline's development stage and subject matter (tumour-specific or across all tumour entities) appeared to influence its potential relevance to GPs. ","671":"Language barriers in the care for patients with limited German language proficiency contribute to impaired quality of care, more frequent medical errors and decreased patient satisfaction. However, professional interpreters are not systematically used in Germany. We conducted a pilot study in a German paediatric hospital to explore the demand for an interpreter by conducting a survey among parents and to test the use of telephone interpreters. Eight percent of the respondents said they were interested in interpreter support. All physicians and parents using a telephone interpreter were very satisfied with the quality and the organisation of the service.

These are designed to address previously identified barriers and enablers. A common definition or methodological concept for TI has not yet been established. In this paper, a concept for TI is introduced. We describe the stepwise development of an implementation intervention for GP settings where recommendations based on current evidence are provided for the treatment of multimorbid patients receiving polypharmacy. Each step will be explained and illustrated by original data. A stepwise approach was used to develop a TI: problem analysis, identification and prioritisation of determinants, identification and prioritisation of strategies and the design of a complex intervention and its underlying logic model. The stepwise exemplary description of this tailoring strategy may support other researchers in this field when designing a TI.

The German Council of Health Experts proposes hospitalisation rates for diabetes, asthma, hypertension and chronic heart failure as ACSC measures in Germany. This article focuses on regional differences in ACSC rates, describes the longitudinal development and explores potential determinants. Descriptive statistical analyses as well as spatial regression analyses were performed on the basis of Federal Statistical Office data. We included data from the hospital and physician statistics. Bayesian spatial regression techniques were used. Whereas hospitalisation rates for asthma decreased between 2000 and 2010, hospitalisation rates for diabetes, hypertension and chronic heart failure increased. Comparing age-adjusted ACSC rates across all German federal states, the Eastern states as well as Saarland showed significantly higher ACSC rates over time. This observation can in part be explained by physician density and the number of hospital beds. Although not all ACSC hospitalisations can be avoided, these results display a potential for optimising care across healthcare sectors in Germany.

Health checks target a healthy or symptomless population. This is why randomised controlled trials (RCTs) must be conducted to provide high-quality evidence for the benefit of an intervention. The present article presents examples to demonstrate that the benefit of preventive interventions is usually overestimated. Standard screening criteria are used to critically appraise selected preventive interventions. Screening criteria cover the disease, the test, the treatment and the whole programme including evaluation and quality assurance. Type-2 diabetes mellitus is used as an example to discuss specific criteria for preventive interventions. The current state of the evidence is outlined. The article is based primarily on systematic \/ Cochrane reviews of RCTs. A recent Cochrane review including 16 RCTs concluded that there is no benefit of general health checks. High-quality evidence on individual components of health checks is frequently missing or inconclusive. Over the last 30 years reference values for normal blood glucose and normal blood pressure as well as treatment targets for patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension have been repeatedly decreased though this is not supported by evidence. Recent high-quality RCTs have shown that these \"hit hard and early\" interventions are detrimental, particularly to those who were the primary target group. Consequently, treatment targets have again been raised and recent guidelines recommend individualisation of treatment goals taking age and comorbidities into account. Important criteria for the implementation of preventive interventions are not currently met. With regard to type-2 diabetes uncertainties remain as to the clinical significance of pre-diabetes, the treatment of pre-diabetes and early treatment of diabetes, the screening tests, and target groups. The ADDITION study was unable to prove the benefit of a diabetes screening. Intensive lifestyle interventions may result in modest reductions of body weight and fewer diabetes diagnoses. However, the clinical relevance of the underlying metabolic changes is doubtful or even negligible. After almost 10 years, the Look AHEAD study has been terminated early due to the ineffectiveness of its intensive lifestyle interventions and the lack of hope that the study will succeed in demonstrating any benefit on the primary cardiovascular endpoints during the originally planned study period of another 3 years. The benefit of prevention is overestimated whereas harm is underestimated. It is most unlikely that medical preventive interventions targeting individual behaviour changes will result in better health for our population. ","684":"In the German healthcare system, general practitioners (GPs) play an important role with regard to individualised prevention, as they are often the first contact for patients seeking advice. Additionally, there is a great need for preventive counselling from the patient's perspective.

The potential target-group specific or generalised nature of teaching activities in EbM were explored by comparing the contents and structures of educational offers in order to detect differences and commonalities. First, several large institutions of the healthcare system were contacted. In addition, the participants of the EbM Academy were consulted as key informants, and the members of the German-speaking colleges of general practitioners and the German Network for EBM were asked to identify potential providers of EbM teaching activities. In the second step pretested detailed questionnaires were sent out that allowed a target-group specific analysis of contents, structures and didactic methods. Altogether, 185 teaching activities in EbM are described; 117 (6.8%) of these address students, 70 (37.8%) physicians and 55 (29.7%) caregivers and members of other healthcare professions. Further target groups include people interested in the healthcare system with a total of 38 (i.e., 20.5%) and patients with 18 (9.7%) teaching activities (multiple responses allowed). Students are mainly taught in obligatory seminars, courses or lectures with a high number of participants, whereas teaching activities addressing other target groups are mostly offered to small groups of participants in the form of optional seminars, courses or workshops lasting a similar length of time. As regards the content, attendees from all target groups with only little previous knowledge are taught the first three steps of EbM according to Sackett. Specialised contents are not distributed evenly and reveal some adaptation to the respective target groups. Structural differences between the target groups are most likely attributed to distinct framework conditions in education and career. Parallels in content demonstrate high rates of conformity concerning the teaching of basic knowledge, though, while individually selecting particular focus areas of special expertise. ","690":"The economic pressure on German hospitals has increased considerably over the last years, mainly because of the introduction of a flat-rate payment system, and it will most likely further increase under the current demographic and political conditions. The growing dominance of economics in the inpatient sector increases the pressure on hospital staff and results in an increased volume of care (with sometimes inappropriate overtreatment) and uncontrolled rationing and a continuous struggle to maintain the quality of patient care. This development is not only alarming from an ethical perspective, but also impairs the hospital's economic performance. To counter the increasing economic pressure with \"more ethics\" does--according to the line of reasoning adopted in this article--not appear to be very successful. Rather, central ethical values in inpatient care have to become an integral part of hospital management. This value management first requires a clear definition of the normative standards, e.g. within a mission statement. Second, the realisation of the normative standards in routine inpatient care has to be systematically assessed, evaluated and managed. Since normative standards are difficult to measure objectively and on a quantitative scale, (repeated) surveys among hospital staff are the central instrument to secure the \"internal quality\" of the hospital. It appears very likely that more ethics in the hospital will pay off by improving its economic performance. The empirical proof for this conceptually extremely plausible hypothesis has yet to be provided.","691":"As the highest decision-making body of the joint self-government of physicians, dentists, hospitals and health insurance funds in Germany, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is responsible for determining the catalogue of benefits for those insured by statutory health insurance (SHI) funds. The G-BA uses patient-relevant, health-related quality of life outcomes as a decision criterion in the assessment of new examination or treatment methods, the benefit assessment of new pharmaceuticals, the quality assurance of services, and in determining treatment goals for disease management programmes and special forms of care. But the data generally available on quality of life are considered insufficient by the G-BA. Studies submitted for methods assessments or the benefit assessments of pharmaceuticals often lack findings on quality of life, or the data are of limited value due to methodological shortcomings. Because the burden of disease is shifting more and more towards chronic and oncological diseases due to demographic changes, the G-BA considers an improvement in the data available on health-related quality of life to be urgently necessary.","692":"\"Healthcare\" is not an exact term but an abstract representation of a system which itself is unable to create quality of life. The term \"quality of life\" is a general term. Every human being is part of the world he or she lives in (his or her \"lifeworld\", \"Lebenswelt\"). Health and disease have a direct and, through individual system components, significantly different effect. Is there a healthcare system? Which resources are available to this healthcare system and the individual persons themselves? There are numerous and quite different components influencing a patient's individual quality of life. These components also include the professional philosophy of physicians, their professional practice and their communication skills in dealing with their patients. The disease-related quality of life can be categorised into the groups \"occasional diseases,\" \"chronic, incurable diseases,\" \"diseases leading to disability,\" or \"fatal diseases\". In each group, the factors influencing quality of life are subject to a different individual assessment. Disease does not stop at the doctor's office, but becomes an integral part of life, which is especially true of predestined, life-long chronic diseases such as, for example, psoriasis, a chronic skin condition. Diagnosis und limiting factors in treatment have an impact on the patient's quality of life, too, and must be conceived of as \"indication-related\". Also, support from outside the professional healthcare system, in particular from patient self-help organisations, contributes to assisting patients with maintaining a high level of individual quality of life. Self-help is not only effective, but useful as well, as has been demonstrated by initial studies in Germany.","693":"Quality of life is highly appreciated as an evaluation criterion and a goal of interventions in medicine, but it is insufficiently applied. There is no unanimous definition of \"quality of life\". From a philosophical point of view, subjectivistic concepts can be differentiated from objectivistic ones. In medicine there are the three concepts of general, health-related and disease-specific quality of life. In this paper it is argued that a general and subjectivistic account of quality of life is of prevailing ethical significance, due to patient orientation and patient autonomy reasons. The normative function of quality of life should be given much more consideration by the responsible players in clinical research, healthcare and allocation decisions within the healthcare system.","694":"Only rarely is the term quality of life explicitly mentioned in the Social Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch, SGB). In the statutory health insurance law (Book V of the Social Security Code, SGB V), the term is explicitly regulated within the context of the entitlement to pharmaceuticals. While there are pharmaceuticals that have the priority to increase the quality of life but are excluded from the provision of healthcare (Section 34 (1) Sentence 7 SGB V), the improvement of the quality of life has to be taken into account for the cost-benefit assessment (Section 35b SGB V) as well as for the early pharmaceutical benefit assessment (Section 35a SGB V) and for the formation of reference price groups (Section 35 SGB V) for and in the case of an entitlement to benefits in the event of illness.","695":"The multidimensional, complex construct of 'quality of life' as a patient-reported outcome is used in medicine as a measurable indicator of health and illness. But do we know what we do when we measure 'quality of life'? Can we grasp how the patient with his individual concept of disease really feels when we use instruments that were designed, administered and analysed by professionals? Do we know the meaning of what we have measured? Is it not shortsighted to focus on health-related quality of life? And is it really quality of life that patients actually want? From a general practitioner's perspective, these questions will be asked of three patients.","696":"Measuring health-related quality of life is an important aspect in economic evaluation of health programmes. The development of utility-based (preference-based) measures is advanced by the discipline of health economics. Different preference measures are applied for valuing health states to produce a weighted health state index. Those preference weights should be derived from a general population sample in case of resource allocation on a collective level (as in current valuation studies of the EuroQol group).","697":"Early benefit assessment aims to prove a benefit of a new pharmaceutical over the appropriate comparator based on patient-relevant endpoints. In addition to mortality and morbidity, quality of life is a patient-relevant endpoint. Thus, phase III clinical trials are the basis of evidence. But HTA and health authorities attach different importance to quality of life. Using the example of oncology, the challenges with study design and analysis will be discussed. A particular challenge to the analysis of quality-of-life data is varying observation times in treatment arms with different effectiveness. Based on the example of Crizotinib possible solutions will be presented.","698":"Numerous instruments for measuring health-related quality of life have been developed over the past decades.

The increasing recognition of the topic is obvious from the number of publications and its representation in academic discussions. Despite a rather weak theoretical foundation, methods of quality-of-life assessment have been developed successfully. Both the number and the quality of assessment tools have increased over the years so that there is now a broad spectrum of instruments for adults and children available, which is used from epidemiological studies to health services research, and especially in quality assurance and comparative benchmarking. Assessment is still underrepresented in clinical trials, which is why only few meta-analyses and reviews are available. Also, implementation of results in recommendations for treatment and in guidelines has just started. Implications for clinical practice also relate to the patient orientation in the physician-patient communication. A future perspective is the widespread use of available instruments, provided that relevant information is gained, which depends on the study design as well as the interpretation and dissemination of results. Consequences for the healthcare systems are expected if improvements in quality of life can be attributed to benefits of treatment and surrounding services.","700":"","701":"","702":"","703":"","704":"","705":"","706":"","707":"","708":"Transitions between the outpatient and inpatient sector are a critical phase in medication treatment.

Therefore, a survey was conducted amongst physicians and nurses (\"MPA\") working in Swiss German primary care offices leading to a subsequent project on the telephone triage. Using a standardised questionnaire, healthcare professionals in primary care offices have been surveyed to determine safety risks and safety climate in their offices. The questionnaire consisted of safety-climate items as well as descriptions of 23 safety incidents. These incidents were rated in terms of frequency (appearance in the office during the past 12 months) and severity (harm associated with the last occurrence in the office). In addition, physicians and nurses answered an open-ended question referring to patient safety risks they would wish to eliminate in their offices. In the subsequent project, interviews and group discussions have been conducted with physicians and nurses in order to perform a process analysis of the telephone triage and to develop a tool that may help primary care offices to strengthen telephone triage as a secure process. 630 physicians and nurses (50.2% physicians, 49.8% nurses) participated in the study. 30% of the physicians and 17% of the nurses observed at least one of the 23 incidents in their offices on a daily or weekly basis. Errors in documentation were reported most frequently. As regards severity, the triage by nurses at the initial patient contact, errors in diagnosis, failure to monitor patients after therapeutic treatment in the office, and errors regarding the medication process were shown to be the most relevant. Most frequently participants wanted to eliminate the following risks to patient safety in their offices: medication (28% of all mentions), medical procedures in the office (11%) and telephone triage (7%). Participation in team meetings and quality circles proved to be relevant predictors of the safety climate dimension \"team-based error prevention\". Differences between occupational groups were found regarding safety incidents as well as safety climate. The results of this study show the telephone triage to be a relevant area of patient safety in primary care that has not been focused on so far. In order to enhance safety of the triage process a new project was initiated. The result of the project is a triage guide for primary care offices. This guide supports physicians and nurses in a joint and critical examination of office structures and processes related to telephone triage. The systematically observed differences between occupational groups indicate that the entire office team need to be involved when analysing safety risks and taking action to improve patient safety. Only in doing so, risks can be identified comprehensively. Moreover, measures can be taken that are relevant to and supported by all healthcare professionals working in a primary care office. This approach of involving the entire team forms the basis for the guide on telephone triage.

No other professionals in the healthcare sector are involved in or responsible for so many different processes. They play a key role in, on the one hand, identifying and potentially avoiding errors and, on the other hand, in causing them. Traditionally, error handling in Germany is still strongly influenced by pointing a finger to and tabooing problematic behaviour. Structured systems for detecting errors and error reports can help to improve risk management in nursing. There is a need to develop fundamental structures like national indicators of nursing quality for systematic and valid error measurements and the structured collection of nursing-sensitive outcomes at a national level. ","721":"For some years patient safety has been an important topic for the design of the healthcare systems in many countries. In Germany we are still in the starting phase of this development. Here, patient safety is not a main focus for research and there is only little funding for these topics. Thus most findings on patient safety have been derived in foreign studies. Slowly, some find their way into the clinical routine in Germany. This paper summarises the state of development of patient safety from a trans-sectoral point of view and outlines essential fields of action for the German healthcare system. ","722":"","723":"","724":"","725":"Summary of Findings (SoF) tables present, for each of the seven (or fewer) most important outcomes, the following: the number of studies and number of participants; the confidence in effect estimates (quality of evidence); and the best estimates of relative and absolute effects. Potentially challenging choices in preparing SoF tables include using direct evidence (which may have very few events) or indirect evidence (from a surrogate) as the best evidence for a treatment effect. If a surrogate is chosen, it must be labeled as substituting for the corresponding patient-important outcome. Another such choice is presenting evidence from low-quality randomised trials or high-quality observational studies. When in doubt, a reasonable approach is to present both sets of evidence; if the two bodies of evidence have similar quality but discrepant results, one would rate down further for inconsistency. For binary outcomes, relative risks (RRs) are the preferred measure of relative effect and, in most instances, are applied to the baseline or control group risks to generate absolute risks. Ideally, the baseline risks come from observational studies including representative patients and identifying easily measured prognostic factors that define groups at differing risk. In the absence of such studies, relevant randomised trials provide estimates of baseline risk. When confidence intervals (CIs) around the relative effect include no difference, one may simply state in the absolute risk column that results fail to show a difference, omit the point estimate and report only the CIs, or add a comment emphasizing the uncertainty associated with the point estimate. KEY STATEMENTS: Summary of Findings (SoF) tables provide succinct; easily digestible presentations of confidence in effect estimates (quality of evidence) and magnitude of effects. SoF tables should present the seven (or fewer) most important outcomes. These outcomes must always be patient-important outcomes and never be surrogates, although surrogates can be used to estimate effects on patient-important outcomes. SoF tables should present the highest quality evidence. When the quality of two bodies of evidence (e.g., randomised trials and observational studies) is similar, SoF tables may include summaries from both. SoF tables should include both relative and absolute effect measures, and separate estimates of absolute effect for identifiable patient groups with substantially different baseline or control group risks.","726":"GRADE requires guideline developers to make an overall rating of confidence in estimates of effect (quality of evidence-high, moderate, low, or very low) for each important or critical outcome. GRADE suggests, for each outcome, the initial separate consideration of five domains of reasons for rating down the confidence in effect estimates, thereby allowing systematic review authors and guideline developers to arrive at an outcome-specific rating of confidence. Although this rating system represents discrete steps on an ordinal scale, it is helpful to view confidence in estimates as a continuum, and the final rating of confidence may differ from that suggested by separate consideration of each domain. An overall rating of confidence in estimates of effect is only relevant in settings when recommendations are being made. In general, it is based on the critical outcome that provides the lowest confidence. ","727":"In general, the prevalence of diseases is low in primary care. Therefore, the positive predictive value of diagnostic tests is lower than in hospitals where patients are highly selected. In addition, the patients present with milder forms of disease; and many diseases might hide behind the initial symptom(s). These facts lead to diagnostic uncertainty which is somewhat inherent to general practice. This narrative review discusses different sources of and reasons for uncertainty and strategies to deal with it in the context of the current literature. Fear of uncertainty correlates with higher diagnostic activities. The attitude towards uncertainty correlates with the choice of medical speciality by vocational trainees or medical students. An intolerance of uncertainty, which still increases as medicine is making steady progress, might partly explain the growing shortage of general practitioners. The bio-psycho-social context appears to be important to diagnostic decision-making. The effect of intuition and heuristics are investigated by cognitive psychologists. It is still unclear whether these aspects are prone to bias or useful, which might depend on the context of medical decisions. Good communication is of great importance to share uncertainty with the patients in a transparent way and to alleviate shared decision-making. Dealing with uncertainty should be seen as an important core component of general practice and needs to be investigated in more detail to improve the respective medical decisions. ","728":"The recently revised German transplantation law provides that people are to be supported to make informed decisions on post-mortem organ donation by implementing broad education campaigns. A comprehensive web-based decision aid \"organ donation after death\" was developed, evaluated and optimised utilising multiple methodological phases. The decision aid comprises 1) factual information in a question-answer format, 2) tools for the individual assessment of this information, and 3) narratives addressing attitudes and emotional aspects. The website content was compiled by participating experts and potential users of the decision aid. Potential users also participated in the usability evaluation. Version 1.0 was made publicly available on the Internet in April 2012. Currently, version 2.0 of the decision aid is being updated step-by-step, based on the results of the evaluation. ","729":"Events in which the health and life of a large number of people are at stake impose particular challenges to all who are involved in healthcare. An effective response requires prompt decision-making under time pressure, in a context characterised by uncertainty and low routine. The hypothesis is that healthcare staffs' preparedness-related competency increases response quality. An evaluation tool was developed to assess response-relevant competencies of emergency nurses. Competencies relevant to the German healthcare system were systematically defined and operationalised into observable items. Multiple phases of qualitative field studies were employed to develop a conceptual guide to planning and conducting the evaluation. The usability of the evaluation tool was piloted and iteratively optimised. The resulting evaluation approach has the potential to substantiate education and training in the context of curriculum development. ","730":"Evidence-based medicine (EbM) has proved to be very useful in healthcare; thanks to its methodology the reliability of our knowledge of the benefits and harms of interventions can be assessed. This at least applies to interventions which are based on a plausible concept for their mechanism of action and which have already achieved positive effects in experiments and simple studies. However, for interventions whose concepts contradict scientific findings EbM has proved to be unsuitable; it has not been able to prevent that they are still regarded as effective amongst wide parts of the population and medical experts. Particularly homeopathy has managed to even present itself as scientifically justified by using EbM. With the aim of highlighting the speculative character of homeopathy and other procedures and of preventing EbM from getting damaged, the concept of scientability is introduced in this article. This concept only approves of clinical studies if the intervention that is to be tested does not contradict definite scientific findings. ","731":"In Germany as in other countries of the European Union (EU), the majority of people with dementia are cared for by their informal caregivers at home. Across countries, however, there are considerable differences in the time to nursing home admission. The European research project RightTimePlaceCare intends to establish good practice recommendations for how to sustain the preferred living situation as long as possible. The Balance of Care approach was used to develop these recommendations, which combines empirical data, cost estimates and expert consensus, and thus implemented in a multinational context for the first time. In eight EU countries a survey was conducted among 2,014 people with dementia and their informal caregivers in nursing homes (n=1,223) or at home (n=791). Selected descriptive characteristics of the study participants were used for case type development. The case types were translated into 14 case vignettes, which were discussed by five to six expert panels (each consisting of three to four participants) per country. The experts (n=161) recommended the most suitable living place (at home or in a nursing home) and customised care packages for home care situations. Across all countries, the experts predominantly recommended care at home for four of the case types whose reference group of study participants actually lived in a nursing home. These case types represent a relevant part of the study population. In Germany, the experts judged the case vignettes as realistic but criticised that information relevant for proper decision making was missing. Expert group discussions always ended in consensus, and care at home was predominately recommended. The proposed care packages most often comprised standard care services, and hence appeared to be realistic and feasible. The development of country-specific recommendations is still ongoing. In order to assess economic feasibility, estimated costs of home care packages will be compared with costs of nursing home care. Further outcomes like the quality of life will be considered for good practice recommendation finding. Balance of Care supports the development of empirically based expert recommendations. The approach is widely applicable but seems to be particularly useful for the development of local custom-fit healthcare services. The clinical effectiveness, safety, and cost implications of the Balance of Care approach remain to be investigated in future studies. ","732":"The increase in scientific literature has led reviewers to conduct overviews, hereby creating a new publication type. Overviews of reviews may have several advantages. For example, they can be conducted in a shorter time frame, they offer the opportunity of providing decision makers with a broader summary of the evidence, allowing comparison of multiple treatments, and they can be helpful in investigating discordant findings from multiple systematic reviews. However, there are some specific characteristics concerning methodology in conducting overviews. Questions that arise are how to deal with overlapping reviews, how the quality of the included reviews should be assessed, how discordant results should be dealt with, whether and how additional searches for current primary studies should be conducted. Overviews of reviews often lack methodological rigour. Methodological standards and reporting guidelines for overviews are needed to improve the quality of this new publication type. ","733":"In a primary care setting the diagnostic process typically starts with a symptom or sign reported by the patient. Primary care physicians face the challenge to consider a broad spectrum of possible aetiologies or differential diagnoses when choosing appropriate diagnostic tests. The classical diagnostic cross-sectional study investigates the accuracy of a diagnostic test or a combination of several tests in regard to just one target disease. The complexity facing the clinician remains unconsidered or is being split and presented in several parts which the clinician has to combine. In this paper we suggest a design for diagnostic studies that considers the requirements of diagnosis in primary care more comprehensively: the comprehensive diagnostic study. The essential characteristic of the design is the simultaneous consideration of the whole spectrum of relevant aetiologies when evaluating several diagnostic tests. We present single characteristics and specific features of this design in regard to research question, study sampling, index test, reference standard and analysis, and illustrate them using the example of a study investigating chest pain in primary care. ","734":"Decision analysis (DA) and value-of-information (VOI) analysis provide a systematic, quantitative methodological framework that explicitly considers the uncertainty surrounding the currently available evidence to guide healthcare decisions. In medical decision making under uncertainty, there are two fundamental questions: 1) What decision should be made now given the best available evidence (and its uncertainty)?; 2) Subsequent to the current decision and given the magnitude of the remaining uncertainty, should we gather further evidence (i.e., perform additional studies), and if yes, which studies should be undertaken (e.g., efficacy, side effects, quality of life, costs), and what sample sizes are needed? Using the currently best available evidence, VoI analysis focuses on the likelihood of making a wrong decision if the new intervention is adopted. The value of performing further studies and gathering additional evidence is based on the extent to which the additional information will reduce this uncertainty. A quantitative framework allows for the valuation of the additional information that is generated by further research, and considers the decision maker's objectives and resource constraints. Claxton et al. summarise: \"Value of information analysis can be used to inform a range of policy questions including whether a new technology should be approved based on existing evidence, whether it should be approved but additional research conducted or whether approval should be withheld until the additional evidence becomes available.\" [Claxton K. Value of information entry in Encyclopaedia of Health Economics, Elsevier, forthcoming 2014.] The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the framework of systematic VoI analysis to guide further research. In our tutorial article, we explain the theoretical foundations and practical methods of decision analysis and value-of-information analysis. To illustrate, we use a simple case example of a foot ulcer (e.g., with diabetes) as well as key references from the literature, including examples for the use of the decision-analytic VoI framework by health technology assessment agencies to guide further research. These concepts may guide stakeholders involved or interested in how to determine whether or not and, if so, which additional evidence is needed to make decisions.

This paper deals with the development of a set of evidence- and consensus-based meaningful indicators to assess the quality of outpatient oncology care in Germany. These indicators are intended to be applied in assessments of quality of patient care in oncology practices, in quality reports and in peer-to-peer benchmarking. A set of 272 already existing indicators was identified through internet and literature searches. After redundancy reduction and addition of newly developed indicators for areas of ambulatory oncology care that were not yet covered, a preliminary set of 67 indicators was established. The further development of the indicator set was based on a modified version of the two-step RAND\/UCLA expert evaluation method, which has been internationally established for developing quality indicator sets. The indicators were modified after the first round of ratings. After completing and assessing the second round of ratings, a set of 46 homogeneously positively rated quality indicators is now available for outpatient oncology care in Germany.

In addition, useful interactions and linking with mandatory quality benchmarking and with internal quality management are discussed. (As supplied by publisher). ","740":"Overcoming rigid sectoral segmentation in healthcare has also become a health policy target in quality assurance. With the Act to Enhance Competition in Statutory Health Insurance (GKV-WSG) coming into effect, quality assurance measures are to be designed in a cross-sectoral fashion for in- and outpatient sectors equally. An independent institution is currently mandated to develop specific quality indicators for eleven indications. For three of these operating tests have already been commissioned by the Federal Joint Committee. This article depicts the major results of a feasibility study, including a compliance cost estimate, for the aforementioned indications of cross-sectoral quality assurance (cQA). In conclusion, a number of both practical and conceptual basic challenges are still to be resolved prior to the full implementation of cQA, such as a sufficient specification to activate documentation requirements and an inspection system capable of separating actual quality problems from documentary deficits. So far, a comprehensive cost-utility analysis of cQA has not been provided, in particular with comparison to existing QA systems. In order to optimise cost and utility of cQA an evidence-based approach is required for both the extension of cQA areas and for QA provisions. ","741":"External quality assurance has three main aims: to make service provision in medicine and nursing comparable, to systematically identify deficits in service quality and to support the introduction of measures for quality improvement. This article reflects on three major developments in mandatory external quality assurance in the German healthcare system that took place during the last five years. These developments include the implementation of cross-sectoral quality assurance, the utilisation of new data sources and a new focus on quality deficits and practicability. The article highlights the challenges that come along with these developments. ","742":"The assessment of the health state in patients and changes in their health state for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of treatment response plays a central role in clinical practice. Quality criteria for measurements in medicine include validity, reliability, responsiveness, interpretability, and feasibility. High-quality measurement instruments are a prerequisite for evidence-based medicine. Therefore, international outcomes research groups have developed methods for quality assurance and for the standardisation of measurement instruments. Quality indicators are instruments to measure the quality of care. Due to the increasing relevance of quality assessment for all stakeholders in healthcare and due to the political intention to draw relevant conclusions from the assessment of the quality of care, quality indicators must at least meet the same high standards that are required for clinical trial end points. However, independent researchers and clinicians do not engage in the validation and standardisation of quality indicators in Germany; currently, only the AQUA institute (as assigned by the German GBA) deals with this important issue. Current activities concerning the validation of quality indicators do not meet the requirements of evidence-based healthcare. This is a critical barrier to achieving the political goals of quality medicine. Therefore, the authors propose a multi-step, multi-professional, evidence-driven and evidence-generating consensus process on the basis of established methods of outcomes research for the advancement of quality assessment with quality indicators in Germany. All relevant stakeholders should participate in this process. ","743":"","744":"Disease Management Programmes (DMPs) are structured treatment programmes for chronic diseases. The DMP requirements are primarily derived from evidence-based guidelines. DMPs are regularly revised to ensure that they reflect current best practice and medical knowledge. The aim of this study was to assess the need for updating the German DMP module on heart failure by comparing it to relevant guidelines and identifying recommendations that should be revised. We systematically searched for clinical guidelines on heart failure published in German, English or French, and extracted relevant guideline recommendations. All included guidelines were assessed for methodological quality. To identify revision needs in the DMP, we performed a synoptic analysis of the extracted guideline recommendations and DMP requirements. 27 guidelines were included. The extracted recommendations covered all aspects of the management of heart failure. The comparison of guideline recommendations with DMP requirements showed that, overall, guideline recommendations were more detailed than DMP requirements, and that the guidelines covered topics not included in the DMP module. The DMP module is largely consistent with current guidelines on heart failure. We did not identify any need for significant revision of the DMP requirements. However, some specific recommendations of the DMP module could benefit from revision. ","745":"In recent years, the emergency medical services in Wiesbaden and the Rheingau-Taunus district made great efforts to standardise structures. Since there are only few established procedures in the annual examinations for paramedics, there is reason to assume that treatment procedures for patients have not been standardised either. Materials and equipment are not handled uniformly, and employee satisfaction has significantly decreased over the last few years. To solve these problems, all paramedics undergo standardised and structured trainings. These training courses make use of the internationally accepted PHTLS (Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support) and AMLS (Advanced Life Support Medial) programmes. In addition, practising skills and handling the equipment as well as on-scene supervision is to be established in practical training sessions.

One competency is professionalism, a definition of which has not yet been developed but is being discussed in the literature. The aim of this qualitative study is an approximation to professionalism among German general practitioners and general practitioner trainees. A qualitative study was conducted by interviewing seven pairs of GPs and their trainees. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The analysis was performed according to Mayring supported by the software Atlas.ti. Four categories of professionalism emerged: responsibility towards patients, responsibility towards other professionals, responsibility towards the society and responsibility towards oneself. Professionalism was perceived as important for general practice in Germany. In addition, barriers of professional behaviour have been identified. The perception of professionalism among German GPs and GP trainees is in accordance with the frameworks of professionalism found in the literature. These results underline the need for conceptualising professionalism among general practice trainees in Germany.

Our exemplary work investigates the costs of new drugs that were licensed in the two years prior to AMNOG, and compares them to the costs of standard treatment that has been used in pivotal trials. Also, the important components of pharmaceutical prices will be illustrated. We retrospectively analysed the European Public Assessment Reports of proprietary medicinal products that the European Medicinal Agency initially approved in 2009 and 2010 and that were tested against an active control in at least one pivotal trial. If the standard treatment was a generic, the average pharmacy retail price of new drugs was 7.4 times (median 7.1) higher than that of standard treatment. If the standard treatment was an originator drug the average price was 1.4 times (median 1.2) higher than that of the new drug. There was no clear correlation of an increase in costs for new drugs and their \"grade of innovation\" as rated according to the criteria of Fricke. Our study shows that prices of new drugs must be linked to the evidence of comparative benefit; since German drug pricing is complex, cost saving effects obtained thereby will depend on a range of other rules and decisions.

There are no reference values for assessing emerging health insurance expenses. The aim of this study was to obtain a frame of reference for the costs of the treatment for neonates, infants, and young children using the example of the expenditures of one health insurance fund. The individual health insurance expenditures were analysed for the first five years of life of children insured with the AOK PLUS in Saxony, Germany, in 2005. Costs of hospital treatment, ambulatory care, remedies, tools, medicines and care were included. The costs per insured child and year amounted to approximately 1,277 Euro (N = 11,147), with the highest costs arising in the first two years. 858 Euro were spent annually for an \"average\" child; 5,691 Euro per year incurred for a child with special medical needs. The present cost analysis describes both the height and structure of a health insurance's spendings on children within the first five years of their life in consideration of regional medical care offers. The question of whether this analysis provides valid reference values for other health insurances or other service areas will have to be answered by other analyses.

The study was based on claims data of all policy holders aged 65 and over of a statutory health insurance company operating nationwide in Germany in 2004 (n=123,224). Utilisation was analysed by the number of contacts with practices of physicians working in the ambulatory medical care sector and by the number of different practices contacted. The criteria for frequent attendance included greater than or equal to 50 contacts and\/or greater than or equal to 10 different practices contacted and\/or greater than or equal to 3 practices of the same discipline contacted within one year. Descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression were used. 19% of the elderly were identified as frequent attenders, which corresponds to some 3.5 million people in Germany. Two main types of frequent attendance were identified: one is characterised by very many contacts, old age, frequent presence of multi-morbidity, and\/or long-term care dependency. The other type is the younger, less frequently multi-morbid attender who is considerably less often dependent on long-term care, and characterised by large numbers of contacted practices and\/or practices of the same discipline. Frequent attendance is due to several factors. The problem of frequent attendance needs further research that is not exclusively based on claims data. We found a high rate of frequent attendance.

Participants were selected according to area (rural\/urban), region (North\/South, East\/West) and grade of professionalisation. Focus groups were digitally recorded and fully transcribed. Data were analysed in a multidisciplinary team using qualitative content analysis. Most participants felt positive towards EBM. Lack of feasibility was explicitly mentioned: the participants distinguished between \"practised\" and \"true\" EBM. Guidelines are often considered unsuitable for general practice. The GPs felt confident that their treatment of patients was evidence-based. Compared to older studies, German GPs have an increasingly favourable opinion about EBM. In order to enhance the practical application of EBM and guidelines the attitudes of GPs need to be considered.

Patients' and physicians' questions about the need for this routine procedure prompted our critical review. Based on guidelines from six industrial nations, recent scientific studies, and from the type 2 disease management programme of North Rhine-Westphalia we reviewed alternative retinopathy screening strategies and their implications for over- and underuse. A comparison of the English, Australian, US, Swedish, Canadian and German guidelines shows that a fixed screening interval is recommended in four countries, while an individualised, risk profile-adjusted screening interval of up to two to three years is favoured in two countries (Sweden, Canada). Current studies indicate that diabetes patients without retinopathy may safely be screened every two to three years without adverse health outcomes if performed consequently.

The majority of publications assume that a general learning curve exists. It is estimated that a range of 20 to 50 cases is needed to achieve a stable outcome level. For the most part, these findings are based on the HoLEP (Holmium laser enucleation of prostate) technique and intraoperative measures, such as enucleation efficiency.

Drug safety in this population is characterised by age-associated changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, an increased risk for drug-drug interactions, an unmanageable situation of side effects and co-morbidities, and a questionable adherence to complex therapies. Moreover, elderly multimorbid patients are usually not enrolled in clinical trials, and therefore the evidence for efficacy and safety of drugs is sparse. Many practice guidelines do not consider multimorbidity and age-associated changes in physical function, cognition and reduced life expectancy. Most published approaches to reducing polypharmacy such as algorithms and checklists have not yet been validated prospectively in randomised, controlled trials. However, some studies have shown the feasibility of stopping medications, in some cases accompanied by remarkable improvements of quality of life.

One possible interpretation, which is well established in the Swedish health system, is \"Accomplishing more (of the things that are important) by doing less (of the things that are dispensable)\". Essentially, this is the basis of prioritisation in Swedish health care. While the concept of prioritisation is very well established in Sweden, the discussion about prioritising in Germany has always been difficult. It is, from a Swedish perspective, unclear why, of all things, health care should be exempted from prioritisation which otherwise is a necessity concerning all aspects of human and societal life. Some conditions complicate prioritisation in German health care, including the system of private and statutory health insurance and economic incentives which do not reward procedures based on indications. It will be argued that the Swedish health care system is more effective than the German not at least because of the system of prioritisation that allows for providing more necessary and essential health care instead of offering unnecessary and dubious procedures, thereby also improving patient outcome.

Being confronted with a malignancy posts an existential threat for many patients that is linked with loss of control, challenge of autonomy and fear of the future. In contrast, patients with non-malignant disease do not realise the scope of their diagnosis and the potentially life-limiting nature of their disease. The prognosis of patients with chronic organ failure is often shorter than that of some patients with malignancies. Patients with malignant and non-malignant disease suffer from pain and many other symptoms. Tumour-oriented therapies, side effects and changes of the body image add to the suffering of cancer patients. Although consequences of the disease and the therapies are often not visible in patients with non-malignant disease, the increasing functional decline, psychosocial burden, lack of co-ordination of care, and information needs burden patients. Wishes at the end of life are similar in cancer and non-cancer patients. Access to palliative care is much easier for cancer patients than for non-cancer patients.","792":"Oncologic drug therapies have gained wide attention in the context of health policy priority setting for serious and socially significant diseases with high human and monetary costs. Due to uncertainties and scepticism about the actual therapeutic importance of newly approved oncology products, an early assessment programme was already established in Austria in 2007. The assessment of new oncology products is thereby faced with special challenges, since study populations are frequently not representative or the study design is laid out in such a manner that a definitive assessment of patient-relevant endpoints is not possible (cross-overs after interim assessments, surrogate parameters as primary endpoints, uncontrolled studies or those with unrealistic comparators, invalidated post-hoc identified biomarkers). On account of these major uncertainties, even the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is already contemplating multi-stage, \"adaptive\" approvals, and national reimbursement institutions are increasingly working with outcome-oriented, conditional reimbursement. (As supplied by publisher).","793":"For innovative oncological medicines the centralised procedure at the European Medicines Agency is mandatory for a marketing authorisation application for the European Union. As with other medical drugs, the marketing authorisation decision is based on the assessment of its efficacy, safety and pharmaceutical quality but does not consider price or reimbursement. More sophisticated diagnostic methods drive an increasing stratification of cancer into a multitude of different diseases. Regardless of their different pathogenesis and therapeutic options the most relevant clinical endpoints remain cure, overall survival and progression free survival. These endpoints include both efficacy and safety, as patient survival reflects the sum of the beneficial anti-tumour effects (increasing survival) AND the adverse effects (decreasing survival). The benefit of an anticancer medicine should be evident from both overall survival and progression free survival (e.g. used as primary and secondary endpoints). Mature data on overall survival may not be needed for marketing authorisation if a clear increase in progression free survival convincingly predicts a beneficial effect on overall survival. In these exceptional cases treatment of patients with an obviously beneficial medicine must not be delayed - possibly for years - until the exact size of the benefit has been established. The continued stratification of the disease cancer results in a lower prevalence for each of the newly distinguished disease entities and an ever increasing number of orphan designations for medicines for rare diseases. Incentives for the development of orphan medicines include market exclusivity for up to ten years. In specific circumstances, however, the orphan legislation may restrict the authorisation and marketing of competing generic products even beyond these ten years. Conditional approval and approval under exceptional circumstances may accelerate patients' access to a new medicine. Both postulate that the extent of the benefit cannot be determined with sufficient certainty at the time of marketing authorisation. This uncertainty may have a negative impact on price and reimbursement as these decisions may consider data or assessments from the marketing authorisation procedure. Therefore, marketing authorisation applications and subsequent pricing and reimbursement negotiations should not be regarded as completely independent processes, but be included in an overall strategy for the development of oncologic drugs.

Apart from improving cancer prevention, the development of effective therapies for advanced cancer is a key task in oncology. Here we compare the criteria of clinical effectiveness that are applied to medical cancer therapies with those that are applied to therapies for cardiovascular diseases. (As supplied by publisher).","795":"The history of cancer in the 20(th) century demonstrates that various factors have contributed to the perception of cancer as the \"Emperor of All Maladies\" although this has never been true from an epidemiological perspective. Depending on the geographical area, infectious diseases like tuberculosis or malaria or cardiovascular diseases still head the list of the most common illnesses. Within the group of chronic degenerative diseases, however, cancer has outdistanced the widespread classic infectious diseases as a result of the epidemiologic transition in 1900, at least in the more developed countries. Under the Nazi dictatorship (from 1933 to 1945), the perception of cancer in Germany got particularly promoted for propaganda purposes. In the Atomic Era cancer attracted strong public interest as a worthwhile object of research in radiation therapies using large-scale facilities (electron accelerators, \"electron guns\"). A further upsurge of interest in cancer could then be witnessed in the context of the debate about the pathogenic role of environmental factors. Notably, this increased perception of cancer has not yet been significantly associated with a sweeping success in cancer treatment, but rather with ideologies, hopes and innovation impulses.

However, simple transfer of the GCP criteria is not always possible and often not useful. Given the fact that research questions regarding non-drug interventions are common in primary care (e.g., general practice), the \"Network for Clinical Studies in General Practice\" has developed a manual for planning and conducting non-drug trials. This manual is based on the GCP guideline, taking account of the conditions and circumstances in primary care settings. Both structure and relevant content of the manual are presented in the article.

A research question that emanated from this discussion was whether appropriate QI might be developed based on German general practice guidelines. In spring 2010, the DEGAM guideline committee (SLK) decided to conduct a project on guideline-based development of QIs using the DEGAM guidelines for dementia, neck pain and sore throat. All members of the SLK were invited to participate in the development process which comprised three face-to-face meetings and four paper-pencil ratings. Finally, 17 QIs for the three guidelines on dementia (n=8), neck pain (n=7) and sore throat (n=2) emerged. These QIs received different ratings in the dimensions relevance, practicability, and appropriateness for public reporting as well as for pay for performance. In this project, guideline authors themselves developed QIs based on German general practice guidelines for the first time ever. Not before practice administration systems facilitate the availability of data in the context of clinical documentation, the practicability of the new QIs can be proven in real every-day practice.","800":"","801":"Since 2006 the office of the Federal Joint Committee (FJC) has been offering training courses in Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) to its delegates. The courses were initiated due to a comprehensive and far-reaching restructuring of the FJC. For example, in 2004 it was decided to involve patient representatives in the discussions. Furthermore, the enactment of the cross-sectoral Code of Procedure in 2005 led to the removal of sectoral differences in the evaluation of the benefit of diagnostic and therapeutic methods. The main aim of the training courses is to build a common understanding of EbM in the interdisciplinary boards of the FJC. From the first course in 2006 until the middle of 2012, 385 people participated in these courses. Since many of them attended more than one course, the total number of participants is 663. In 2011, the courses were certified as the \"Basic EbM-Course\" by the German Network for Evidence-Based Medicine. The results of the course feedback and the continuing demand for further courses confirm their successful implementation and demonstrate that teaching EbM to groups with a fairly heterogeneous academic and professional background is advantageous.","802":null,"803":null,"804":null,"805":"To what extent is evidence-based nursing practice (EBP) implemented in Germany?

Studies examining the efficacy of educational interventions are rare. We studied which educational interventions in the field of education and training have been evaluated in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) during the past three years. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Psyndex, Psychinfo, and Education Research Information Center (ERIC). The database searches were limited to the RCT study design and trials published in German or English language for the period from January 2009 to February 2012. Studies with the following target groups were included: children, pupils, students, and employed persons; settings: pre-school institutions, schools, universities and universities of applied sciences, and settings of vocational or occupational education and training; interventions: educational interventions in pre-school institutions, schools, universities, universities of applied sciences and institutions of vocational or occupational education and training, as well as prevention programmes in schools and pre-school institutions. We excluded studies on patient education. The data collection was carried out using a data extraction sheet. Only predefined categories were used for the interventions. Further categories were developed in a second step. The following data were surveyed: target group, setting, type of intervention, country, institutions conducting the studies, and funding. Sample size calculations were documented to survey the quality of studies. Frequencies were calculated for the categories. 259 RCTs carried out in 36 countries were included. About half of the educational studies (n=154) were initiated in the medical field. The majority of the 95 studies, which addressed pre-schoolers and pupils, studied prevention programmes (n=75). Only 16 out of 259 studies were conducted in Germany. Sample size calculations were reported in 85 studies. As yet only very few RCTs of educational interventions have been conducted.

Evidence can be indirect in one of four ways. First, patients may differ from those of interest (the term applicability is often used for this form of indirectness). Second, the intervention tested may differ from the intervention of interest. Decisions regarding indirectness of patients and interventions depend on an understanding of whether biological or social factors are sufficiently different that one might expect substantial differences in the magnitude of effect. Third, outcomes may differ from those of primary interest - for instance, surrogate outcomes that are not themselves important, but measured in the presumption that changes in the surrogate reflect changes in an outcome important to patients. A fourth type of indirectness, which is conceptually different from the first three, occurs when clinicians must choose between interventions that have not been tested in head to head comparisons. Making comparisons between treatments under these circumstances requires specific statistical methods and will be rated down in quality by one or two levels depending on the extent of differences between the patient populations, co-interventions, measurements of the outcome, and the methods of the trials of the candidate interventions against some other comparator.","812":"This article deals with inconsistency of relative, rather than absolute, treatment effects in binary\/dichotomous outcomes. A body of evidence is not rated up in quality if studies yield consistent results, but may be rated down in quality if inconsistent. Criteria for evaluating consistency include similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals, and statistical criteria including tests of heterogeneity and I(2). To explore heterogeneity, systematic review authors should generate and test a small number of a priori hypotheses related to patients, interventions, outcomes, and methodology. When inconsistency is large and unexplained, rating down quality for inconsistency is appropriate, particularly if some studies suggest substantial benefit, and others no effect or harm (rather than only large versus small effects). Apparent subgroup effects may be spurious. Credibility is increased if subgroup effects are based on a small number of a priori hypotheses with a specified direction; subgroup comparisons come from within rather than between studies; tests of interaction generate low p-values; and have a biological rationale.","813":"In August 2011 the Coordination Group for the implementation and continuation of the agenda for improving medication safety in Germany (1) published a memorandum on the development of research in the field of drug therapy safety management titled \"Memorandum for research in drug therapy safety management\". This memorandum highlights the need for research in this field for the German health system. It describes current research objectives, thematic priorities and the characteristics of the methodology of drug therapy safety management research. After presenting the state of research on drug therapy safety management, the kind of research activities needed will be outlined.

In addition, there are insufficient human data for the majority of drugs used by women of reproductive age to precisely assess their prenatal risk or safety. The Berlin Institute for Clinical Teratology and Drug Risk Assessment in Pregnancy provides pertinent information in this field to healthcare professionals and pregnant women. After the initiation of a risk inquiry exposed pregnancies are followed through as to birth outcome and beyond. These follow-up data allow the detection of signals and the quantification of safety or risks for the unborn through evaluation in prospective cohort studies. Both a detailed risk characterisation and\/or quantification of safety are essential to risk management after inadvertent drug exposure or when looking for a drug of choice. Individual consultations are available drawing on the results from the institute's own database and other working groups, and regularly updated information is also available via the open access database www.embryotox.de.","815":"To reduce medication errors and other drug-related problems, their systematic discovery, documentation and evaluation is essential. The web-based documentation database ADKA-DokuPIK enables both the documentation and the publication of annotated individual cases and, moreover, systematic errors or accumulations of risk drugs may be determined. Medication reconciliation is another important component to increase safety in drug therapy. Hospital pharmacists may support and significantly improve this process. In Germany some initial information from various projects is available. Medication reconciliation performed by hospital pharmacists may significantly increase the completeness and accuracy of medication regimens. Patient counselling together with the necessary drug supply at discharge improves patients' knowledge, closes supply gaps and improves the satisfaction of all parties.","816":"Multimorbidity, polymedication and functional impairment together with diminished everyday competence and communication ability predispose nursing home residents to adverse drug events (ADE). The high number of psychiatric drug prescriptions is a characteristic feature. The project \"Medication Safety in Nursing Homes\", funded by the Federal Ministry of Health, found an incidence of approximately 8 ADEs per 100 nursing home resident-months. About one third of the ADEs had clinical consequences, notably hospital admissions and additional visits of general practitioners. Many ADEs are due to errors in the medication process, coupled with the effects of poor communication among health care professionals. Thus, structured interventions are intended to not only sensitize to these problems, but also to support and foster a multidisciplinary way of thinking and acting.","817":"Terms and definitions for drug safety management have changed and are not used uniformly. Due to the different use of definitions many studies cannot be compared directly. After the amendment of the EU Directive on pharmacovigilance in 2012 a proposal for using these terms und definitions now exists. However, some definitions and terms are imprecise. Furthermore, the authors make suggestions regarding a more detailed version of the terms in pharmacovigilance in order to have a better differentiation for types of medication errors.","818":"","819":"","820":"GRADE suggests that examination of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provides the optimal primary approach to decisions regarding imprecision. For practice guidelines, rating down the quality of evidence (i.e., confidence in estimates of effect) is required when clinical action would differ if the upper versus the lower boundary of the CI represented the truth. An exception to this rule occurs when an effect is large, and consideration of CIs alone suggests a robust effect, but the total sample size is not large and the number of events is small. Under these circumstances, one should consider rating down for imprecision. To inform this decision, one can calculate the number of patients required for an adequately powered individual trial (termed the \"optimal information size\" or OIS). For continuous variables, we suggest a similar process, initially considering the upper and lower limits of the CI, and subsequently calculating an OIS. Systematic reviews require a somewhat different approach. If the 95% CI excludes a relative risk (RR) of 1.0 and the total number of events or patients exceeds the OIS criterion, precision is adequate. If the 95% CI includes appreciable benefit or harm (we suggest a RR of under 0.75 or over 1.25 as a rough guide) rating down for imprecision may be appropriate even if OIS criteria are met.","821":"In the GRADE approach, randomized trials are classified as high quality evidence and observational studies as low quality evidence but both can be rated down if a body of evidence is associated with a high risk of publication bias. Even when individual studies included in best-evidence summaries have a low risk of bias, publication bias can result in substantial overestimates of effect. Authors should suspect publication bias when available evidence comes from a number of small studies most of which have been commercially funded. A number of approaches based on examination of the pattern of data are available to help assess publication bias. The most popular of these is the funnel plot; all, however, have substantial limitations. Publication bias is likely frequent, and caution in the face of early results, particularly with small sample size and number of events, is warranted.","822":"EGONE is an E-Learning Forum for Gynaecology, Obstetrics, Neonatology and Reproductive Endocrinology based on the Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives. For two semesters, students attending the gynaecology block at the Medical Faculty of the University of Ulm have been provided with licences to use EGONE. Students can work on a specially equipped computer and practise whenever they want. The aim of this study was to generate hypotheses as to which factors favour the use of EGONE and which didactic implications for the learning success the application of EGONE has. During August 2009, 28 medical students in their 8th and 9th semester were interviewed after having completed their block of training in gynaecology. The instruments used included a questionnaire and a partially standardised interview. We found that the e-learning offering EGONE was basically met with a positive response from the medical students at the University of Ulm. Regarding the integration of EGONE, three problem areas were identified: shortage of equipment, lack of dependable access and functional, but not curricular integration. Students' suggestions for better integration of EGONE were related to two subject areas: establishing an assisted learning centre (e.g., PC pool with library) and developing curricular independence and relevance (e.g., specific application to patient cases, conducting seminars with EGONE). The integration of the e-learning programme EGONE presupposes a logical, didactic concept for the whole clinical block of training in gynaecology as well as dependable, sufficient infrastructure and technical equipment and providing didactic support to users.

A declining number of general practitioners will soon cause a lack of health care supply in a growing number of regions. Nurses constituting the largest occupational group in the health care system contribute by filling the resulting gap. Internationally, models have been developed to incorporate new responsibilities for nursing professionals. However, nursing education needs to be adapted as well. Presently nurses are not qualified to take on medical tasks. The current nursing curriculum needs to include medical skills and content to reach a qualification status comparable to other European countries. The transition towards a more team-oriented medical care will have to be supervised and evaluated by health services research in both nursing and clinical care. The aim is to also provide a basis for the further development of the relevant socio-legal framework.","824":"Disease management programs (DMPs) were implemented in the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) in a nationwide rollout in 2002. The explicit goal of the programs is to improve coordination and quality of care for the chronically ill (Sect. 137f, SGB V). To reach this goal extensive quality assurance measures in the programs are mandatory, enrolment and coordination of care rests with the primary care or DMP physician, treatment is based on evidence-based care guidelines, and patients are offered diabetes education classes to support self-management. The present study evaluates the DMP diabetes mellitus type II, a nationwide program offered by the BARMER, a German health insurance company. To minimize selection bias we formed a control group of administrative data using a propensity score matching approach. In comparison to the control group DMP participants have a significantly lower mortality rate, and their average drug and hospital costs are reduced. Enrolled patients also had a lower mean number of hospital stays and shorter hospital stays. These results indicate that the programs meet the initial goal of improving the quality of care for the chronically ill.","825":"Given the high prevalence of work-associated health problems and the significance of work-related stress factors, cooperation between general practitioners (GPs) and occupational health physicians (OPs) is of particular interest to the healthcare system. Both groups of physicians have an important role to play in supporting prevention, rehabilitation and workplace reintegration. In Germany, however, cooperation between GPs and OPs is often lacking or suboptimal. In our study, we assessed relevant deficiencies in and barriers to this cooperation. Three focus groups were interviewed: GPs, OPs, and medical doctors working in both fields. Data were analysed according to the qualitative content analysis method of P. Mayring. Deficiencies such as lack of communication (e.g., opportunity to make phone calls), insufficient cooperation in regard to sick-leave and professional reintegration, lack of knowledge about the specialty and influence of OPs as well as about patients' working conditions in general. Barriers: Prejudices, competition, mistrust, fear of negative consequences for the patients, lack of legal regulations, or limited accessibility. Similar deficiencies and barriers were mentioned in all three focus groups. The data are helpful in understanding the interface between GPs and OPs in Germany to provide an informative basis for the development of quantitative research instruments for further analysis to improve cooperation. This is the basis for additional cooperation projects. ","826":null,"827":"Health care for persons with depressive disorders is not networked to an optimal degree in Germany. In order to improve outpatient care, an integrated care model for patients with depressive disorders was initiated in Freiburg in December 2008. The model aims at implementation of central recommendations of the \"Conceptual Framework Integrated Care: Depression\" of the German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. Usage of health services and effects of the model were analyzed by means of patient and physician data as part of a continuous project evaluation. Since the launch of the project in December 2008, 40 physicians have been participating, and have included a total of 234 patients. Unipolar depressions constitute by far the most frequent disorders (91%). Most patients showed moderate (58%) or severe (36%) depressive symptoms. Most disorders were recurrent (61%). About three quarters of patients (75%) are treated exclusively by general practitioners. According to the physicians' ratings, 58% of the patients were remitted or showed subsyndromal symptoms in the eighth treatment week following their inclusion in the Freiburg model. After 16 weeks this number rose to 70% of patients. According to the information provided by the patients, in the PHQ-D, 59% of the patients were remitted or showed minimal symptoms. In the Freiburg model the \"Conceptual Framework Integrated Care: Depression\" could be implemented under current routine conditions. The first evaluation results indicate the success of this model.

However, one of the results of the reform in 2007 was that most of the advantages of medical service units were no longer idiosyncratic to this legal form, but granted to individual general practitioners as well. Since then, a decline in the foundation of medical service units by medical doctors can be observed. Today, the medical service unit rather seems to be a means for hospitals expanding in the intermediary medical sector and, maybe, a re-foundation of the former hospital-owned polyclinics.","829":"Appropriate communication behaviour during medical consultations has been shown to improve doctor-patient relationships, and should therefore be an integral part of medical training. In Germany, though, there are almost no reliable and validated checklists for assessing communication skills during medical examinations. Our aim was to develop and validate the first German checklist to examine communication skills that can be used during examinations: the Frankfurt Observer Communication Checklist (FrOCK). The checklist was developed according to a set of requirements that would need to be met by medical training checklists. It was pilot tested, revised and validated over several steps. Data analyses are provided for 371 assessments (371 students) by 17 examiners. After reviewing face validity and comprehensibility, we also checked for validity by comparing a trained and an untrained group of students and testing for both inter- and intrarater reliability. Interrater reliability was analysed by means of 37 interviews that were simultaneously assessed by five examiners. Intrarater reliability was calculated by having three examiners assess the same 37 students at two different points in time. The final version of FrOCK consists of 31 items for conducting medical interviews which can be broadly divided into four areas: \"beginning and conclusion of the interview\", \"interview technique\", \"contact skills \/empathy\" and \"history taking\". Several aspects of validity could be demonstrated, and both intra- and interrater reliability were high. The results of this study have shown that FrOCK is a clear and concise checklist for assessing communication skills in medical examinations and one that satisfies psychometric requirements as well. It takes only 3 to 5minutes to complete and thus is particularly useful for assessing communication skills in medical examinations. ","830":"To provide comprehensive high-quality health care is a great challenge in the context of high specialisation and intensive costs. This problem becomes further aggravated in service areas with low patient numbers and low numbers of specialists. Therefore, a multidimensional approach to quality development was chosen in order to optimise the care of children and adolescents with life-limiting conditions in Lower Saxony, a German federal state with a predominantly rural infrastructure. Different service structures were implemented and a classification of service provider's specialisation was defined on the basis of existing references of professional associations. Measures to optimise care were implemented in a process-oriented manner. High-quality health care can be facilitated by carefully worded requirements concerning the quality of structures combined with optimally designed processes. Parts of the newly implemented paediatric palliative care structures are funded by the statutory health insurance.

This evolved into the initiative of pathologists in Saxony to implement the peer review practice within the remit of their State Medical Association. Since the 14(th) of May 1999 various institutes as well as medical group practices in pathology and cytology have joined forces to undertake voluntary inter-institutional quality control measures. The aim was to improve the process and especially the outcome quality by reviewing each other's quality (analysing samples) on the basis of defined criteria. A positive review outcome report, which will have to be unanimously agreed upon by all participants, will lead to a positive recommendation for a certificate issued by the Medical Association of Saxony. Between 1999 and 2011 a total of 56 peer review proceedings took place. The potentials for improvement concern the problem of \"kitchen pathology\" still being used in the context of macroscopic description, the quality of microscopic description including the use of correct nomenclature, the quality of tumour classification and immune histological investigations. Statements concerning the advantage of the peer review method in particular refer to the integration of resident pathologists. Due to the long period of implementation of the peer review system und the small number of proceedings, it is not possible to come to a clear conclusion about the improvement or deterioration of quality. During a period of more than 10 years three peer review proceedings were not successful. In this situation, it is appropriate to ask the question of how restrictive peer reviews should be. The three most important aspects for the pathologists in Saxony are: self-determination, learning from each other, and a commitment to quality improvement. So this method set an example of how a quality management method can persist for more than 10 years through voluntary engagement. And the initiative of pathologists in Saxony has given an important impetus to the development of other peer review systems in various health care organisations or disciplines in Germany.","834":"Peer reviewing in intensive care medicine is an evaluation process that promotes a professional understanding of quality and the exchange of experience in intensive care.

A highly qualified workforce is needed to face the challenges ahead and to coordinate health care. In addition, there is evidence that interprofessional education strengthens interprofessional collaboration which can lead to improved health outcomes. The University of Heidelberg, Medical Faculty, decided to develop a bachelor programme integrating specific health professions and interprofessional qualifications into the curriculum. The manuscript describes the identification process of the outcome-focused competencies for this bachelor degree. The six-step curriculum model by Kern et al. was applied. An expert panel identified major tasks and health care fields for which the students should be qualified for. These results were transferred into a questionnaire and distributed among targeted learners as well as practitioners, experts and employers in different health care fields for relevance ratings. Also, individuals were interviewed to receive additional information and to generate further ideas. Thirteen different practice fields, five tasks and thirteen topics common to all health care professions were collected. The subsequent survey comprising 66 items was completed by 139 targeted learners as well as 82 practitioners and experts. All identified practice fields were rated as relevant for future professional life. Top ratings were \"supervising procedures\" (targeted learners) and \"interprofessional communication and coordination\" (practitioners, experts and employers). The results were discussed and consented in the expert panel and learner outcomes\/objectives were categorized according to the CanMED roles. A thorough needs assessment was performed setting the foundation for the further development of the curriculum. The identified competencies are in line with the five core competencies defined by the WHO which are necessary for interprofessional collaboration: patient-centred care, partnering, quality improvement, information and communication technology, and public health perspective. The application of the CanMED framework proved to be suitable. It may be used as common terminology to help define interfaces with curricula of other health professions. The interprofessional development of the bachelor programme fostered a deeper understanding between health professionals and can therefore be regarded as a first step in improving interprofessional collaboration. ","842":"Rules and regulations form the framework of Health Technology Assessments. Legal issues are directly associated with the technology (as patents\/licenses) or to the patients and their basic rights (as autonomy). In order to identify the regulations of interest as well as the relevant publications in a systematic and transparent way a specific methodological approach is required. In the absence of adapted methods, our objective was to develop a methodological approach to the systematic retrieval of information on legal issues.  No publications on adapted methods could be identified. We therefore developed a procedure following the workflow of information retrieval for effectiveness assessments. This workflow consists of 8 steps: 0. pre-search: identification of the relevant rules, regulations and patient-related issues, 1. translation of the search question, 2. concept building, 3. identification of synonyms, 4. selection of relevant information sources, 5. design of the search strategies, 6. execution and quality check, 7. saving the results and reporting. There are numerous publications on legal issues associated with health technologies. Specifically adapted procedures are qualified to identify them in a systematic and transparent manner using the appropriate sensitivity and precision. A wider application seems to be reasonable in order to further test its practicality against more topics and to modify the proposed method if indicated.

Well-established limitations of randomised trials include failure to conceal allocation, failure to blind, loss to follow-up, and failure to appropriately consider the intention-to-treat principle. More recently, recognised limitations include stopping early for apparent benefit and selective reporting of outcomes according to the results. Key limitations of observational studies include use of inappropriate controls and failure to adequately adjust for prognostic imbalance. Risk of bias may vary across outcomes (e.g., loss to follow-up may be far less for all-cause mortality than for quality of life), a consideration that many systematic reviews ignore. In deciding whether to rate down for risk of bias - whether for randomised trials or observational studies-authors should not take an approach that averages across studies. Rather, for any individual outcome, when there are some studies with a high risk, and some with a low risk of bias, they should consider including only the studies with a lower risk of bias.","850":"This article introduces the GRADE approach to rating the quality of evidence. GRADE specifies four categories (high, moderate, low, and very low) that are applied to a body of evidence, not to individual studies. In the context of a systematic review, quality reflects our confidence that the estimates of the effect are correct. In the context of recommendations, quality reflects our confidence that the effect estimates are adequate to support a particular recommendation. Randomised trials begin as high quality evidence, observational studies as low quality. \"Quality\" as used in GRADE means more than risk of bias and so may also be compromised by imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of study results, and publication bias. In addition, several factors can increase our confidence in an estimate of effect. GRADE provides a systematic approach for considering and reporting each of these factors. GRADE separates the process of assessing quality of evidence from the process of making recommendations. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation depend on more than just the quality of evidence.","851":"In November 2010, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland dismissed a plea seeking reimbursement for treatment of glycogen storage disease type II - a very rare genetic metabolic disease also referred to as acid maltase deficiency (AMD) or Pompe disease -with a drug called 'Myozyme'. The Court held that the medication was not sufficiently effective or, alternatively, there was insufficient evidence for its effectiveness. The Court argued that the cost was out of balance with respect to the effects of the drug and concluded that it would be against the principle of legal equality if taxpayers were required to defray excessive expenses benefiting only an extremely small fraction of the population. Cost-effectiveness, however, cannot be accepted as a standard criterion governing the allocation of health insurance benefits because diversity of individual health must be regarded as a risk which nature has distributed equally among the members of the population. Therefore, it is a manifestation, rather than a violation, of the principle of legal equality that a public health insurance provider should pay for medical treatment in a particular case even if such treatment could not necessarily be administered to all other insured parties as well. At the same time, if cost-effectiveness in public health care is taken into account carefully, the risk of irrational resource allocation may be minimised.

On the national level, the Swedish priority guidelines ascribe priority values ranging from 1 (high priority) to 10 (low priority) to measures (in terms of condition-treatment pairs) of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, this list contains interventions that should be avoided and those that should only be provided as part of clinical research projects. The government then commissions a multi-professional team under the supervision of the National Board of Health and Welfare \"Socialstyelsen\" with the development of corresponding guidelines. In addition to the scientific evidence, the priority lists incorporate ethical and economical aspects and are based on the so-called ethics platform consisting of human dignity, needs, solidarity and cost-effectiveness. At the other level of prioritisation there are regional projects aiming at the in- and exclusion of medical measures. The Swedish prioritisation process will be described using the example of priority lists in cardiology.

This development has raised the question of which substantial and procedural criteria should be used to guide fair and legitimate prioritisation. It seems to be obvious that in a pluralist, democratic society citizens should be involved in such a discussion. But which is the adequate method, and what is the potential of citizen participation? In this paper we compare the results of a regional citizens' conference on prioritisation in medicine with various European reports on principles and criteria for prioritisation, and thereby aim to identify the conference members'contributions to the German debate on prioritisation criteria. The results of this exemplary deliberative event can provide hints towards the general potential of discursive participation.

By involving the general public or affected stakeholders in priority setting, advocates hope to legitimise this process and increase the acceptability of future decisions on resource allocation. Here, we differentiate between two ideal-typical methods of stakeholder involvement: 1) qualitative and 2) quantitative ones. We argue that the level of information of participants is important to the quality of the outcome of participatory events. Qualitative methods aim at fostering deliberative discussions among well-informed stakeholders. By contrast, quantitative methods usually do not have the capacity to ensure or, at least, control the level of information that participants use to guide their decisions. Hence, we conclude that in the context of priority setting qualitative and especially deliberative methods are preferable to quantitative approaches.","856":"Decisions on priority setting and rationing in health care have both informational and distributional aspects, which is why they require expert knowledge and specialised bodies on the one hand and democratic consent on the other hand.

As procedural decisions always have implications for resulting distributional decisions, the bodies charged with priority setting and rationing decisions must be subject to democratic institutional design.

Politicians, members of a Federal Joint Committee and health insurance representatives, however, refused to promote or participate in the establishment of a public discussion. A change to that attitude only became apparent after former FCP President Hoppe's opening speech at the annual FCP assembly in Mainz in 2009. The present paper applies the Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse, implemented through Qualitative Content Analysis and elements of Grounded Theory, to examine the development of the national public discourse in leading German print media. It creates a matrix that represents the discourse development between May 2009 and May 2010 and reflects central actors, their \"communicative phenomena\" and their interactions. Additionally, the matrix has been extended to cover the period until December 2011. Hoppe's arguments for priority setting in health care are faced with a wide opposition assuming opposing prerequisites and thus demanding alternative remedies. The lack of interaction between the different parties prevents any development of the speakers' positions. Incorrect accounts, reductions and left-outs in the media representation add to this effect. Consequently, the public discussion on priority setting is far from being an evolving rational discourse. Instead, it constitutes an exchange of preformed opposing positions.","860":"The debate on prioritisation aims to generate broad consensus on the social distribution of health care goods. There is nothing wrong with this aim but the political debate around it should include a discussion whether prioritisation is the strategy needed to realize this goal. Obviously, prioritisation follows the currently prevalent logic of evaluation as a universal legitimating strategy but, due to its multiple and unforeseeable effects, this does not necessarily imply that prioritisation will deliver on its promises. Hence, the debate cannot be focused on the appropriate strategies of prioritisation as its proponents seem to intend, but must also include the social costs and potentially adversary effects of this strategy of rationalisation.

It also requires specification of all important outcomes - whether evidence from research studies is, or is not, available. For a particular management question, the population, intervention, and outcome should be sufficiently similar across studies so that a similar magnitude of effect is plausible. Guideline developers should specify the relative importance of the outcomes before gathering the evidence and again when evidence summaries are complete. In considering the importance of a surrogate outcome, authors should rate the importance of the patient-important outcome for which the surrogate is a substitute and subsequently rate down the quality of evidence for indirectness of outcome.","863":"This article is the first of a series providing guidance for the use of the GRADE system of rating quality of evidence and grading strength of recommendations in systematic reviews, health technology assessments, and clinical practice guidelines addressing alternative management options. The GRADE process begins with asking an explicit question, including specification of all important outcomes. After the evidence has been collected and summarised, GRADE provides explicit criteria for rating the quality of evidence that include study design, risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and magnitude of effect. Recommendations are characterised as strong or weak (alternative terms: conditional or discretionary) according to the quality of the supporting evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the alternative management options. GRADE suggests summarising evidence in succinct, transparent, and informative Summary of Findings tables that show the quality of evidence and the magnitude of relative and absolute effects for each important outcome and\/or as evidence profiles that provide, in addition, detailed information about the reason for the quality of evidence rating.

Navigated total knee arthroplasty is done for better control of the postoperative axis as well as to reduce the revision burden. The time interval needed to demonstrate the decrease in revision has not yet passed. Additional benefits of total knee navigation have been observed for certain patient populations and for the training of physicians. These benefits have not been investigated so far. Using registries, expert opinions and case series the desired benefit from the use of medical devices can be shown. Safety is one major aspect of innovative medical devices as an additional benefit. The safety paradigm needs intense investigation in the future. The IDEAL Statement provides the clinical researcher with the methodological framework. The METEOR Statement focused on the medical problem and the possible benefit with using innovative medical devices.

It legitimises its claim in patient care through operations with proven benefit consisting of cure or improvement of symptoms. Moreover, clinical research and evaluation of surgical technique, strategy and innovation is closely entangled with medical devices.

Standardisation of surgical and perioperative care is the inevitable prerequisite in clinical trials to define and to evaluate effectiveness of surgical devices.

However, mortality rates of 3 % are low, and half of the patients will die from intercurrent disease. Due to the significantly improved diagnostic methods and the increasing use of PSA screening, there has been a stage migration towards early tumour stages that are prognostically heterogeneous and require differentiated treatment. Based on the discussions of the Joint Federal Committee (G-BA) and the conceptual work of the MDS, the Competence Centre Oncology of the MDK, the IQWIG and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband), a prospective randomised multicentre trial was developed comparing the four treatments actually recommended by the German and European guidelines for localised prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy, percutaneous radiotherapy and permanent seed implantation and active surveillance) allowing a rejection of one or two treatment options.

We first discuss important differences between medicinal products and medical devices. Emphasis is put on the differences in the framework for clinical trials. We point out that a different analysis set should be used in clinical trials of medical devices when compared with medicinal products and medical devices in the USA. Specifically, regulators generally ask for the full analysis set based on the intention-to-treat principle as proof of efficacy of medicines. A central aspect of clinical trials of medical devices is that they have to be tested under normal conditions of use according to the performance data. As a result, all data acquired while the medical device was not during normal conditions of use should be excluded from statistical analyses. We discuss statistical methodological particularities of medical devices, such as blinding and the control of placebo effects. Using the conservative treatment of anal incontinence as an example, we show that comprehensive technical and physical knowledge is required for assessing the utility of medical devices. Finally, we consider reporting of severe adverse events and of severe adverse device effects of medical devices.","870":"Clinical trials with medical devices need to be considered in terms of the complexity of surgical procedures. Creating the proper environment for the conduct of trials includes improved academic career opportunities in the field of clinical research, methodological competence, and established structures. The challenges and pitfalls in the design of clinical trials involving medical devices are based on aspects such as blinding, placebo, learning curves and surgeons' expertise. Surgical procedures should be standardised, and a study hypothesis needs to be established which is answerable by a relevant and feasible sample size. Besides the above-mentioned challenges, efficient interactions between authorities, universities, hospitals, and medical device manufacturers are mandatory to allow for quality and relevance of clinical studies in this field.","871":"","872":"","873":"","874":"The development of guidelines almost always requires considerable time and financial resources.

The current study investigated the extent to which the IQWiG's \"Change of Life\" information pack was found to be both comprehensible and useful by users. A total of 41 qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with menopausal women. The partial analysis presented here is based solely on the \"Decision Aid\" part of the information pack. For many women the information contained in the Decision Aid was new and the manner of presentation unusual. In the sample investigated here the Decision Aid was used rather as a confirmation of decisions that had already been made than as an aid in the decision-making process. Where it was not possible to harmonise the scientific evidence presented with the individual's own opinion, the decision-making conflict was intensified. Balancing of individual preferences against study results proved to be difficult for two reasons: first, the unusual manner of presentation and second, the two contrasting poles of \"science-based information\" and \"own preferences\", which were not regarded as being of equal significance. This conflict represents a fundamental problem in evidence-based decision aids.","876":"Shared decision making (SDM) between patient and physician is an interpersonal process. Most SDM measures use the view of one party (patient, physician or observer) as a proxy to capture this process although these views typically diverge. This study suggests the compound measure SDM(MASS) (SDM Meeting its concept's ASSumptions) integrating these three perspectives in one single index. SDM(MASS) was derived theoretically and compared empirically to unilateral perspectives of patients, physicians and observers by application to a data set of 10 physicians (40 consultations) receiving an SDM training. The constituting parts of SDM(MASS) were highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha .94; interrater reliability .74-.87). Unilateral appraisal of training effects was divergent. SDM(MASS) revealed no effect. SDM(MASS) combines noteworthy information about SDM processes from different viewpoints and thereby delivers plausible assessments. It could overcome immanent shortcomings of unilateral approaches. However, it is a complex measure needing further validation. ","877":"Shared decision making is based on the idea of cooperation and partnership between patients and doctors. In this concept both parties may initiate and perform specific decision-making steps. However, the common observation-based instruments focus solely on doctors' behaviour. Content and quality of information provided to involve patients in medical decisions are hardly considered in evaluation of SDM. This study investigates the advantages of a revised observer inventory taking into account these aspects. Based on the OPTION scale, a more comprehensive observation-based inventory was developed, additionally considering both the patient-sided indicators for patient involvement and the criteria of evidence-based patient information. The inventory comprises three scales (doctor, patient, doctor-patient dyad) and 15 indicators each. Rater training and re-analyses of 76 consultations previously analysed using the OPTION scale were conducted. Convergent validities were calculated between the observer-based scales and the patients' ratings on the Shared Decision Making Questionnaire, the Decisional Conflict Scale and the Control Preference Scale. Interrater reliabilities of the revised scales were high (r=.87 to .74) and even higher when only the dyadic perspective was coded (.86). The revised inventory provided additional information on the involvement taking place. No substantive correlations were found between observation-based and patients' subjective judgments. The observers' perspective on patient involvement needs to consider patient activities. Inconsistencies of patients' and observers' judgements concerning patient participation need further investigation.

Reliable and valid measures are necessary to evaluate interventions designed to promote shared decision making and to understand determinants and associations. The OPTION (\"observing patient involvement\") scale is the most prominent observation instrument for assessing the extent to which clinicians actively involve patients in decision making. This paper discusses psychometric and methodological characteristics of the OPTION scale. There is little support for the purported unidimensional structure. Although reliabilities are acceptable, results are highly heterogeneous across studies. There is also little evidence concerning validity. In particular, studies mainly failed to support convergent validity. Additional issues pertain to lack of item independence, restriction of range, and failure to consider dyadic aspects. Given these findings, a number of methodological and conceptual issues still need to be addressed for the effective measurement of patient involvement. Directions for future research are discussed. ","880":"The aim of our study is to introduce a statistical framework using latent variable modeling for the investigation of correspondence between patients' and physicians' perceptions that were measured using dyadic instruments. This statistical approach combines multitrait-multimethod and measurement invariance methodologies. In an illustrative example we used a sample of 285 primary care consultations on chronic diseases to test correspondence between patients' and physicians' views on the process of shared decision-making (SDM), which was measured by the patient and physician version of the nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc), respectively. We revealed that while patients and physicians seem to agree on what is the core of SDM, they differ in their ratings regarding to which extent it is present in a certain consultation. The described statistical approach provides important insights into correspondence between perceptions of different stakeholders that cannot be gained using traditional approaches. However, its generalizability is questionable due to the partly explorative data-driven approach and its flexibility is limited by the requirement of samples including at least 200 cases.","881":"Decisional conflict is a central determinant of decision making, particularly in the context of uncertainty. It is also one of the most frequently reported outcomes in studies on decision support interventions. Decisional conflict is defined as personal uncertainty about which option to choose. The Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) is a self-administered questionnaire that was originally designed to assess decisional conflict in patients. The scale has since been adapted to and tested among health professionals, since decisional conflict as seen by doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers has proven useful in evaluating the quality of the shared decision making (SDM) process. In recent years, however, more and more researchers have found that evaluating the perspectives of the patient and the health professional as interdependent members of a dyad, rather than as two autonomous individuals, offers exciting avenues for developing interventions to improve decision making in the clinical setting. For that reason, the SDM community has increasingly turned its attention to a dyadic approach to SDM. In this paper, we briefly review the history of the Dyadic Decisional Conflict Scale (D-DCS), update its psychometrics based on published work, and propose a research agenda for refining it further.","882":"The article comments on Shared Decision Making (SDM) research from a different perspective, i.e. psychotherapy research. Psychotherapy research had to face similar challenges, both conceptual as well as methodological. Meanwhile, the generic model of psychotherapy has helped researchers to put single results into a perspective that also might be helpful to the SDM field. Since SDM research increasingly focuses upon process perspectives directed towards the doctor-patient dyad, we propose measures and constructs from interpersonal theory as useful tools to be introduced into SDM research. A selection of these measures and their potential within SDM research is described.","883":"","884":"Service quality for patients with genetic conditions can be assessed through the analysis of clinical genetic data sets, as was the case in this study. It represents a secondary analysis of a compilation of a single genetic expert's medical opinions covering the years 2000 to 2009, solicited by private health insurance companies with the intention of probing into medical necessity and adequacy of genetic testing ordered by physicians. Genetic testing has become an increasingly important part of clinical diagnostic services. Controlling these services does not only reduce costs but also saves patients from unwarranted over-utilisation. Therefore, the reasons given by doctors when ordering genetic tests are part of the quality of service delivery. The study revealed that more than 30% of the molecular genetic tests ordered lack sound medical reasoning and 30% of the cases studied show violation or neglect of guidelines and recommendations for diagnostic procedures with respect to genetic testing. In essence, the findings indicate a need for human genetic information among physicians. Their professional organisations are called upon to design and offer CME\/CPD programmes in medical genetics to maintain and continually improve the quality of medical genetic care for patients with genetic conditions.","885":"To answer this question we first need to clarify the term \"responsibility\". Based on the different meanings of this term, it will be outlined how the expectations of different participants towards the group of patients lead to different demands being placed on their behaviour. Using examples of the interaction between patients and participants of the health care system these different role assignments will be reviewed with a view to their implementation. Subsequently the author derives conditions that need to be met in order to enable patients to act responsibly.","886":"In our society, taking personal responsibility is basically regarded as a key step to adopting a more active lifestyle. In health care, however, personal responsibility is primarily equated with higher levels of financial contribution from patients. Obviously, the individual's responsibility for his or her health and towards the mutually supportive community is a highly emotional and ideological issue, so the debate is usually rather heated. This is, however, at odds with the \"empowered patient\" concept. In the present paper \"personal responsibility in practice\" will be understood to include both physician and patient responsibility. Examples will be employed to demonstrate that, on an individual level, physicians are responsible for diagnosing and treating their patients as indicated and that, on a collective level, they are expected to make responsible use of the resources allocated. Here, patient responsibility will be defined as both taking care for one's own health and the individual's obligation to contribute to the maintenance of our solidarity-based health care system. The tensions between solidarity and subsidiarity and personal responsibility, respectively, will be outlined, and a readjustment of the relation between external support and individual strengths, between solidarity and personal responsibility in terms of Sect. 1 of the Social Book Code V will be advocated.","887":"In the health care context, the phrase \"personal responsibility\" is frequently used as a euphemism for restricting publicly funded health care services. The concept of responsibility, however, primarily comprises the individual's own autonomous choices in consideration of their possible implications. In order to be able to act responsibly in respect to health care issues, the individual must rely on objective information about the possible consequences of his or her decision. The current profit-oriented competitive medical care environment prevents the distribution of objective information. A mutually supportive community benefits from its members acting responsibly, since citizens are capable of supporting themselves before they avail themselves of community support. This requires the State to respect the individual and his or her autonomous decision-making. If the community established rules as to what is considered a healthy lifestyle or even required people to adopt one, it would, to a large part, take away the citizens' autonomy and thus prevent them to assume responsibility.","888":"One of the most fundamental characteristics of a liberal order is that both the state and the law follow the principle of personal responsibility and assign to the citizens the responsibility for the consequences of their voluntary decisions. But to rely primarily on the principle of personal responsibility in the health care system holds the danger of attributing the cause of their health problems to the already disadvantaged (\"blaming the victim\") and of releasing the welfare state from its responsibility to foster social structures that support health-conscious decisions.","889":"Two meanings of personal responsibility are distinguished, and different policy options for promoting health and responsibility are presented. Key insights from research seeking to promote personal responsibility through health information and incentives are outlined and discussed with regard to their potential to improve health and reduce cost. Data is presented on the socioeconomic characteristics of incentive programme users. It is concluded that due to different factors the availability of data regarding the effectiveness of incentive programmes is unsatisfactory. Evaluation requirements set out in the German Social Security Code (SGB V) should focus not only on cost, but should also extend to changes in health status and the socioeconomic status of users: provisions should be revised accordingly.","890":"Science journalists working for public media are caught between the two poles of factual correctness (\"Thou shalt not harm\") and entertaining presentation (\"Thou shalt not bore\"). Writing about (in most cases) complex topics they need to stand their ground against the mass media, the consumption of which is--in contrast to science and technology media--inherently voluntary. Within the general framework of the mass media, science journalism has emerged from a \"late department\" to become an important, but by no means leading part of the press arena. The trend is moving away from interpreting towards critically accompanying science. Due to the strong support to high-quality science journalism that major foundations provided during the past thirty years, the numbers of better trained scientific journalists operating in Germany have considerably increased, but so have the requirements: higher levels of work stress and a higher demand for real-time information, particularly from online media, the risk of economic and other organisations taking control over information by intensifying their public relations campaigns.","891":"Although it appears that the methods of medicine cannot be approached from a legal perspective, the law--as a code of conduct--establishes requirements for the effectiveness of treatment and standards for decision-making in healthcare. Central provisions of the relevant law relate to extraordinarily vague legal concepts, taking recourse to knowledge based on experience scattered across the profession. However, the sometimes explosive dissemination of new--heterogeneous or specific--knowledge and an increasing specialisation of treatment approaches very much relativise the importance of medical experience. This has promoted the rise of a professional evidence-based knowledge management in medicine, to which the law--especially case law--has only partially responded so far.","892":"Surrogate markers are only acceptable in single exceptional cases to demonstrate a patient related true outcome in medical care. This is especially true in drug therapy. Although many surrogate markers are correlated with an outcome, only a few have been shown to capture the effect of a treatment on the outcome. The examples for aberrations in medical care are numerous: They include menopausal hormone therapy, the prevention of cancer or cardiovascular diseases with vitamins, the therapy of cardiac arrhythmias using a special type of drugs as well as the treatment of osteoporosis with fluoride. All these treatments caused more harm than good to the patients; and very often mortality increased. In summary, most of the surrogate markers are not worth discussing, and they should not be utilised to demonstrate patient related outcome; they may only be acceptable in rare cases and would then have to be rigorously validated to protect patients from harm.","893":"In this article we describe the methodological underpinnings in assessing the confidence in estimates of effects (quality of evidence) for diagnostic questions and resulting recommendations in guidelines.

In the second section some descriptive data concerning the Faculty of Medicine in Zurich are summarized to exemplify current and future aspects of the quality development in the clinical electives year in Switzerland.","902":"Medical education in Germany has undergone significant changes. The current article attempts to give an overview of final year medical education in Germany and implications for further developments. Challenges in final year medical education mainly arise from the lack of clearly defined learning objectives, the provision of structure, independent patient management and professional guidance and supervision. The abolition of the one-and-a-half-year period of pre-registration medical training in 2004 and the changes in the structure of state examinations in line with the amendment of medical licensing regulations in 2002, meant pressure on the efficiency of final year medical education on the one hand, and additional burden on final year students on the other. In this article, a broad variety of innovative models that have been implemented at different medical faculties, and which address final year students' needs, will be reported. Further challenges, such as the integration of general medicine rotations, the abolishment of the second state examination in its present form, and the integration of final year students' individual career plans will be discussed.","903":"","904":"Medical curricula are currently being reformed in order to establish interactive and case-based teaching concepts. Here we present a novel radiological course combining several innovative training components and report our initial experience with its practical implementation and the students' evaluation of it. A novel longitudinal radiological teaching course was established, integrated with the medical curriculum and evaluated systematically. Radiology case vignettes were created for three clinical teaching modules. Using a PC with PACS access, web-based databases and CASUS cases, a problem-oriented, case-based, and independent way of learning was implemented, which served as a complementary form of teaching to established radiology courses and lectures. In student evaluations the novel CLICR course fared significantly better than the conventional radiology block course. More than 50% of the participating students gave the highest rating for 'overall satisfaction' with the novel CLICR course compared to only 3% for 'overall satisfaction' with the conventional block course. A similar trend was observed for the other endpoints. Both the innovative interactive concept of the course and the opportunity to use a web-based database has been favourably accepted by students. An interactive, case-based teaching concept like the presented CLICR course, and web-based databases appear to be useful extensions to the radiology course programme.

Hopefully, preventive or therapeutic interventions may thus be better adapted to the individual's physical endowments to increase treatment efficiency and reduce unwanted drug reactions. These developments have been summarised under the conceptual umbrella of \"individualised\" or \"personalised medicine\". In contrast to early expectations, clinical implementation of individualised medicine proceeds rather slowly. At the same time important philosophical and social issues emerge. This article will start by introducing some areas of applications of individualised medicine. In a second step, the guiding principle of \"individualisation\" of treatment and its ambiguity will be reflected. The third part discusses some of the philosophical and social implications of these developments. The article ends with a conclusion and some suggestions for further research.","907":"The paradigm of personalised medicine has many different facets, further to the application of pharmacogenetics. We examine here (direct-to-consumer) personal genome analysis and whole body scans and summarise findings from the Nuffield Council's on Bioethics recent report \"Medical profiling and online medicine: the ethics of 'personalised healthcare' in a consumer age\". We describe the current situation in Germany with regard to access to such services, and contextualise the Nuffield Council's report with summaries of position statements by German professional bodies. We conclude with three points that merit examination further to the analyses of the Nuffield Council's report and the German professional bodies. These concern the role of indirect evidence in considering restrictive policies, the question of whether regulations should require commercial providers to contribute to the generation of better evidence, and the option of using data from evaluations in combination with indirect evidence in justifying restrictive policies.","908":"Journalistic reporting on medical topics is subject to the same basic quality requirements as \"health information\" in a stricter sense. The aim is to inform patients and the general public in an unbiased and understandable way. Using the example of reporting on individualized medicine, a concept is described of how statements on the benefit and harm of interventions can be distinguished and classified and their content assessed in journalistic research. The step-by-step analysis of statements on the benefit of (personalized) medicine and the comparison of these statements with scientific evidence will help to distinguish proven facts from uncertain predictions. Journalistic reporting is then required to ensure that the basic messages of the report comply with the quality of the scientific evidence and that uncertainties be presented adequately.","909":"Research over the past two decades has untangled the molecular heterogeneity of cancer at the cellular level. The molecular techniques that have been developed in the past 5 to 10 years are dramatically improving our understanding of the genomic aberrations that underlie the malignant transformation of normal cells. At the same time, however, advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of solid tumours and hematologic malignancies have revealed how complex cancer is, and consequently how much more challenging it is in many of the more common cancers to identify the right drug for the right patient in the adequate dose at the right time. Given the slow pace of translation from genome science to individualised medicine in oncology, this expert review, mainly taking into account recently published perspective articles and reviews, describes the molecular heterogeneity of cancer, the difficulties in developing novel molecularly targeted agents, and the need for developing biomarkers to optimise drug development and clinical use. Distinct types of biomarkers, breakthroughs as well as disappointments in the clinical implementation of biomarkers and targeted therapeutics into clinical practice are discussed by focusing on four targeted anti-cancer drugs. Finally, as clinical biomarker tests that predict response to particular therapies will play an important role in achieving stratified medicine in the near future, this article will conclude by giving some recommendations for effective biomarker evaluation and clinical trial designs for predictive biomarker validation.","910":"A so called individualized or personalized medicine is currently stimulating peculiar attention. The terms promise better, i.e. more successful, medical treatment with fewer side effects for the future. The present article discusses the biologic concept underlying the terms as well as the promises connected with it and places the terms into the broader context of diagnostic methods. It is pointed out that an assessment of methods called individualized medicine can and should be carried out in adherence to the same methodological principles as they apply to the assessment of other diagnostic tests. Even individualized medicine needs to be subjected to the standard evaluation and review procedures of evidence based medicine.","911":"","912":"","913":"","914":"In this article we describe how to include considerations about resource utilisation when making recommendations according to the GRADE approach. We focus on challenges with rating the confidence in effect estimates (quality of evidence) and incorporating resource use into evidence profiles and Summary of Findings (SoF) tables. GRADE recommends that important differences in resource use between alternative management strategies should be included along with other important outcomes in the evidence profile and SoF table. Key steps in considering resources in making recommendations with GRADE are the identification of items of resource use that may differ between alternative management strategies and that are potentially important to decision-makers, finding evidence for the differences in resource use, making judgements regarding confidence in effect estimates using the same criteria used for health outcomes, and valuing the resource use in terms of costs for the specific setting for which recommendations are being made.","915":"The most common reason for rating up the quality of evidence is a large effect. GRADE suggests considering rating up quality of evidence one level when methodologically rigorous observational studies show at least a two-fold reduction or increase in risk, and rating up two levels for at least a five-fold reduction or increase in risk. Systematic review authors and guideline developers may also consider rating up quality of evidence when a dose-response gradient is present, and when all plausible confounders or biases would decrease an apparent treatment effect, or would create a spurious effect when results suggest no effect. Other considerations include the rapidity of the response, the underlying trajectory of the condition and indirect evidence.","916":"","917":"Questions in nursing research are often studied in heterogeneous and instable fields such as nursing homes and use highly complex interventions. With the usual designs the mechanisms of their effects are difficult to evaluate. These interventions usually cannot be completely standardised. Comparison with 'care as usual' is hardly possible, since 'care as usual' can vary a lot. Moreover, the motivation to participate in a study with the chance of not getting an intervention is very low. Control groups with an active intervention, however, involve the risk that effects cannot be distinguished. This is why process evaluation and implementation research using multi-method approaches and triangulation are central to evaluating the effects of complex interventions. A solid theoretical foundation is the key to the proper interpretation of empirical results. (As supplied by publisher). ","918":"","919":"The present paper deals with selected aspects of psychotherapy research. Psychotherapy is an effective treatment approach for mental disorders. Since research in psychotherapy is entirely dependent on public funding, several research questions remain open. Psychotherapy efficacy studies can be conducted in a randomised, but not in a placebo-controlled or double-blind manner. Apart from the effect of psychotherapy on the main outcome variables, one has to differentiate between specific and common factors of psychotherapy. Research in psychotherapy will gain societal relevance only after effective approaches have been successfully implemented in general practice. Transfer studies thus represent a new challenge in psychotherapy research. The funding activity of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) \"Networks in Research on Psychotherapy\" made it possible that for the first time large multi-centre psychotherapy studies meeting GCP criteria can be conducted in Germany. These studies will generate highly innovative and in part unique findings. (As supplied by publisher).

Guidelines and treatment recommendations promote such interventions. However, the evidence supporting physical therapy modalities is often weaker than that found for drug treatments. One reason is that a simple blinding of treatment assignments by means of a placebo is usually not possible. Another issue is patient preferences that have an impact on the conduct of the study and the interpretation of the results. This article highlights methodological challenges of studies investigating physical therapy modalities, and points out some possible solutions. (As supplied by publisher).

Diskussionsforum zur Nutzenbewertung im Gesundheitswesen\" of the German Ministry of Education and Research \"Gesundheitsforschungsrat (GFR)\" and the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) I will analyse some methodological idiosyncrasies of studies evaluating non-pharmacological non-technical interventions (NPNTI). I will focus on how the methodological framework of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group may support design and appraisal of NPNTI. Specific design features that may be of particular value in NPNTI research, such as expertise-based randomised controlled trials, will be briefly described. Finally, based on an example, I will argue that - despite the methodological idiosyncrasies - there is neither a sufficient reason to accept different standards for the assessment of the confidence in the evidence from NPNTI nor for using study designs that are less rigorous compared to \"simpler\" interventions but that special measures have to be taken to reduce the risk of bias. The example that will be used in this article will primarily come from the field of respiratory rehabilitation, a typical multi-component or complex intervention and by definition a complex NPNTI, which has been evaluated in many randomised controlled trials.

In this regard the GBA has so far never given any instructions to the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). The level of evidence for these methods is often limited by the lack of randomised controlled trials. The available studies often show a high risk of bias because of poor planning, processing and reporting as well as lack of blinding. External validity is often limited by use of a standardised monotherapy in the study, but a mix of different, individualised methods in the field. Another common problem is the lack of patient-related, long-term outcome variables. Further research is needed to develop methods for high-quality trials and evidence-based assessments in the area of non-medical, non-technical therapeutic interventions. (As supplied by publisher). ","928":"","929":"A clear definition of the broad field of non-pharmaceutical and non-technical therapeutic interventions in patient care does not exist, making the discussion more difficult. Here, the relationship between patient and professional, contextual factors, and the influence of the patient play a more prominent role than with drug therapy and technical interventions. The vast majority of non-pharmaceutical and non-technical procedures consist of complex and nearly always communication-based interventions. It is difficult to describe their role, since reliable data on criteria like frequency, time required, costs, quality, number of professionals involved and the importance for the patient are sparse. These therapeutic interventions may well form the core and biggest part of therapy in patient care. (As supplied by publisher). ","930":"","931":"","932":"Many medical interventions are of a complex nature. They comprise interdependent components differently interacting within various complex settings, e.g., stroke units. Appraising the efficacy, benefit and harm of complex interventions is far more difficult than appraising single interventions like specific drug treatments. Detailed methodological procedures for the development, appraisal and synthesis of complex interventions are increasingly discussed internationally. Systematic inventory of methodological guidance for the development and evaluation of complex interventions through searching scientific literature databases and web resources of international institutes. Review of the current state of discussion and suggestions for the development, appraisal and synthesis of complex interventions. Five methodological guidance papers have been identified. In particular, the UK Medical Research Council's guidance offers a structured introduction to the development and evaluation of complex interventions in health care and medicine. Synthesis of complex interventions using customary methods of systematic reviews is not satisfying. Other approaches to synthesis like realist evaluation as well as statistical procedures exploring the active components of complex interventions have been discussed. However, post hoc analytical procedures could never adequately replace careful prospective development and exploration of complex interventions and interdependencies with contextual factors. Complex interventions require multi-stage development, use of different methods, reporting on all developing phases and new approaches for synthesis. Presentation of the complete evidence on a specific complex intervention might be more useful than synthesis of a variety of different complex interventions by customarily applied methods of (meta-analytical) systematic review. ","933":"Patients with little knowledge of the German language have a special need for information. Due to language barriers they behave more passively in medical encounter, have a poorer knowledge about their disease and are generally less satisfied with their medical care. Foreign language patient information material could bridge the gap between medical consultation and the patients' self-responsibility and involve patients more actively in the treatment process. Based on extensive research in several areas (internet, clinic and practice leaflets, drug patient information leaflets) the present article illustrates that in all these areas foreign language patient information is very poorly available compared to German material. The reinforcement of the development of such material could lead to a higher involvement of immigrant patients' in the decision-making process, higher rates of patient safety and satisfaction and, overall, to a better quality of care for all patient groups in Germany.","934":"This article presents the first hospital-wide survey on patient safety climate, involving all staff (medical and non-medical), in the German-speaking area. Its aim is to share our experiences with planning, organising and conducting this survey. The study was performed at the university hospital in Zurich and had a response rate of 46.8% (2,897 valid questionnaires). The survey instrument (\"Patientensicherheitsklimainventar\") was based on the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (AHRQ). Primarily it allowed for assessing the current patient safety climate as well as identifying specific areas for improvement and creating a hospital-wide awareness and acceptance for patient safety issues and interventions (e.g., the introduction of a Critical Incident Reporting System [CIRS]). We discuss the basic principles and the feedback concept guiding the organisation of the overall project. Critical to the success of this project were the guaranteed anonymity of the respondents, adequate communication through well-established channels within the organisation and the commitment of the management across all project phases.","935":"As a result of more economising in German hospitals, changes evolve in organising the deployment of senior medical staff. New demands are made of senior hospital management. Leadership competencies in the training and development of physicians are of prime importance to the successful perception of managerial responsibilities. The present study investigates the actual and targeted demands of leadership made of senior medical staff in terms of how these demands are perceived. To this end, the demands of leadership were surveyed using a competence-based questionnaire and investigated with a view to potentials in professional development by way of example of the senior management of psychiatric hospitals in Germany. In all, the results show high ratings in personal performance, the greatest significance being attributed to value-oriented competence in the actual assessment of demands on leadership. Besides gender-specific differences in the actual assessments of single fields of competence, the greatest differences between the targeted and the actual demands are, in all, shown to be in the competencies of self-management and communication. Competence-based core areas in leadership can be demonstrated for the professional development of physicians and an adaptive mode of procedure deduced.","936":"Hospital transfers from nursing homes are frequent, costly, often preventable, and can have negative effects on the residents' health. The present study investigated the current situation in Carinthia (Austria) regarding the characteristics of relocated nursing home residents, the proportion of avoidable transfers, the consequences of relocation from the physicians' and nurses' perspectives and ways for improving nursing home care. Retrospectively, the documentations of a regional hospital (N=4149), a rescue service (N=10754), and a social insurance agency (N=7051) were analysed; qualitative interviews with physicians (N=25) and nursing administrators (N=16) were conducted. A considerable proportion of these transports seemed to be avoidable: for example, about 40% of the ambulatory treatments in the emergency department of the investigated hospital were inappropriate. Options for improving the current situation will be discussed.","937":"One of the most important issues in today's health sector is productivity, and more attention should be paid to this topic by health managers and correspondingly by those in charge. It is believed that providing a suitable culture is necessary to improve productivity. We tried to provide this culture by establishing a Productivity Committee in different hospitals and academic medical centers of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS). The present study aimed to explore the managers' perspectives on the influences and roles of this productivity improvement committee. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008. The study population included all managers of 30 hospitals and academic medical centers of the IUMS. Data were collected by questionnaire after having tested its validity and reliability and analyzed using SPSS software. From the perspective of the center's managers, establishing a productivity committee had a great deal of influence on improving the quality of the services provided. Influence on increasing income and customer satisfaction was ranked second, followed by the influence on decreasing costs. Alternatives such as conducting more training courses and workshops (about productivity) for managers and other decision makers, supervising the committees and their performance, establishing central productivity committees, issuing more guidelines and regulations are suggested to promote productivity in the health sector.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the final reports of the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) addressing non-medical interventions. These reports were analysed in order to determine how many endpoint-related comparisons were evaluated by clinical studies, how many by RCTs and how many by methodologically reliable RCTs. Seventeen out of eighteen final reports of the IQWiG department of non-medical interventions were critically analysed. The final reports had been generated from 2006 till 2009. Comparison of therapeutic procedures and patient relevant endpoints were taken from the final reports. Additional patient relevant endpoints were considered whenever these had been included in the result section. RCTs considered essential for the assessment were identified. RCTs obtaining the biometric rating no shortcomings, moderate shortcomings or low bias were considered to be of methodological reliability. A total of 537 comparisons addressing single endpoints were identified. Clinical studies were available for 50% of these comparisons (n=272). For 38% of the comparisons (n=205) RCTs could be included, but in only 18% these RCTs had reliable methods. The number of reports containing zero, one, and more than one RCT was 6, 4, and 7, respectively. Methodologically reliable RCTs were included in only 8 out of 17 final reports. The analysis of evidence showed that both the number and the quality of studies were insufficient. This is why better standards for the evaluation of non-medical interventions need to be established. This may be achieved by raising the regulatory requirements and by intensifying research from independent institutions. ","943":"Various investigations have identified deficits in clinical studies conducted for the market authorisation of haematological and oncological drugs. Based on data from European Public Assessment Reports (EPAR) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), an analysis of the quality of these studies, which serve as the basis of marketing authorisation of currently approved drugs, is showing improvement. For example, endpoints recommended by the EMA are frequently used. However, deficits of marketing authorisation studies are still noticeable, e. g., results based on unplanned interim analyses or post hoc subgroup analyses. In addition to the improved quality of studies prior to marketing authorisation, independent clinical studies need to be conducted after marketing authorisation has been obtained, a good example of which are therapy optimisation studies (TOS) in acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL). A goal of TOS is the examination of multimodal therapy concepts in the real world context of routine clinical practice. They can supply valuable data for drug safety and long-term observation. In order to conduct post-marketing authorisation studies, funding is required and bureaucratic hurdles associated with the 12(th) amendment to the Pharmaceutical Act will have to be reduced. The results of these studies are needed to efficiently handle limited health resources and to adequately inform and treat patients.","944":"The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the paramount decision-making panel of the self-government body of service providers and health insurance funds. The G-BA commissions the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct benefit assessments as one of the Institute's main tasks. Both organisations are regularly faced with \"evidence gaps.\" These are situations where, on the one hand, a new medical technology is being propagated and pushed into the health care system, and on the other hand, no sufficiently reliable proof of benefit exists based on the methods of evidence-based medicine. It is possible to encourage closure of such evidence gaps by making \"negative decisions\" (meaning, for example, rejection of coverage for a certain intervention) but also by \"conditional coverage decisions,\" whereby fluent transition is conceivable. Innovative ideas, such as a multilaterally financed research funds, are called for to sponsor clinical trials in those areas which are of little commercial interest.","945":"Translating clinical research findings into daily medical practice is a complex procedure and subject to multiple impacts. Studies sponsored by drug manufacturers produce positive results more frequently than would be expected by chance alone; positive studies have a better chance to be published than negative ones. There is a lack of effective implementation strategies for medical guidelines. The mismatch of study population and own patients renders the generalizability of study results difficult. Other confounding factors in head-to-head studies are drug comparisons that do not conform to the gold standard, non-equivalent dosages and study duration. To solve these problems clinical research must pick up questions and problems from daily medical care. Studies independent of drug companies should be funded with public money, and health care research needs public support. Access to study protocols and data must be open to the public.","946":"Head-to-head trials can contribute considerably to improving patient-centred care. To ensure that patients are optimally supplied with drugs and medical devices following market release, it is necessary to choose the best therapy from several options. The gold standard of efficacy comparisons is randomised head-to-head studies comparing alternative methods. These trials establish the evidence base for choosing and excluding a treatment, which in turn improves the quality of health care services, even from an economic point of view. These trials are performed under high international quality standards of planning, conducting and reporting. Since comparative effectiveness research (CER) largely includes science-initiated investigations, all stakeholders should participate in the funding of these studies.","947":"","948":"Hardly any other part of the healthcare sector is under such a pressure to change as the hospital sector. Hospitals are high-performers in coping with complex changes in modernising patient care, process design, quality, cost-effectiveness and service orientation. But, what really makes value to the patient? Currently, this question is raised with new seriousness. Those hospitals which consequently align their portfolio to value based and 'patient driven' healthcare delivery will succeed by both quality and cost-effectiveness. We receive such messages from the USA. In Germany there are on-going and admonishing pleas since the end of the 1990s not to lose sight of the patients' needs while designing new concepts for healthcare delivery. Future challenges imply not only the renaissance of patient centred care, but also demand for a comprehensive user orientation as a key factor to successful hospital modernisation. This is particularly true of concepts of structured, integrated and regional healthcare delivery. But a consequent alignment of healthcare with value for patients clearly exceeds the focus on integrating hospital and outpatient care. In designing new services of coordinated regional healthcare, hospitals gain strategic options for a single-source healthcare delivery. In terms of business development, user orientation does not only yield important impulses for stronger patient centred care, but also opens up chances for better quality and competitive advantages. Nevertheless, it requires a new understanding of innovation processes which considers value for patients and quality of results and outcome as a relevant scale for measuring effects of change management. Finally, the methods of the assessment of user oriented healthcare delivery are an essential challenge for the evaluation of cooperative healthcare services.","949":"","950":"A long-term outcome project for the special high-risk group of extremely preterm (ELBW) infants has been established in the federal state of Lower Saxony, which is unique in Germany. All departments of neonatology and all divisions of paediatric neurology are participating. Since October 2004 children who were born at &lt;28 weeks gestation are examined using a standardised concept at defined follow-up intervals (at the age of 6 months, 2, 5 and 10 years). The aim is to achieve a cross-sectoral improvement of quality in healthcare on the basis of neurodevelopmental outcome parameters (the right therapy for the right child, at the right time). So far 739 extremely preterm infants (81% of the survivors) were examined at the age of six months, 513 ELBW infants (74% of the survivors) at the age of two years, and 99 children (59% of the survivors) at the age of five years. The comparison of the follow-up intervals has demonstrated an increase of children with minor and major impairment, which indicates the importance of the long-term scheme. At the age of five years 27% of the children exhibit normal development, 49% minor impairment and 24% major impairment. Many ELBW infants need therapy. The model of the project can be transferred to other federal states or regions and other high-risk groups.","951":"\"Gesundes Kinzigtal Integrated Care\" (GKIC) is one of the few population-based integrated care systems in Germany. The external evaluation of GKIC has a modular design and is coordinated by the Department of Medical Sociology of Freiburg University. In this article we will outline the different evaluation modules and address typical problems arising in the evaluation of regional integrated health care systems. One of these problems is the small size of the intervention population in a recently established pilot care system which makes the use of epidemiologic measures (such as incidence figures) difficult. Total population surveys could alleviate this problem, but when the same intervention population is questioned repeatedly for different evaluation modules, the danger of 'over-surveying' arises. This may lead to decreasing participation in further studies. These problems may be managed by using short survey instruments, by conducting surveys successively (not simultaneously) using time shifts, and by analysing claims data from health insurers. Another problem in the evaluation of comparably small systems of care is how to attribute outcomes (effects) to certain health promotion or disease management programmes: Since participants usually take part in more than one programme, the intervention effect is contaminated by multiple programme effects. These will have to be adjusted for in the final evaluation of the data. Finally, randomised controlled study (RCT) designs frequently cannot be used in the evaluation of a region-wide pilot intervention, so the evidence generated by such a (non-randomised) study is weaker than the evidence generated by an RCT.","952":"The regional integrated care model \"Gesundes Kinzigtal\" pursues the idea of integrated health care with special focus on increasing the health gain of the served population. Physicians (general practitioners) and psychotherapists, physiotherapists, hospitals, nursing services, non-profit associations, fitness centers, and health insurance companies work closely together with a regional management company and its programs on prevention and care coordination and enhancement. The 10 year-project is run by a company that was founded by the physician network \"MQNK\" and \"OptiMedis AG\", a corporation with public health background specialising in integrated health care. The aim of this project is to enhance prevention and quality of health care for a whole region in a sustainable way, and to decrease costs of care.

The programmes and projects are developed, implemented, and evaluated by multidisciplinary teams.","953":"Like the Netherlands, England, and the USA, Germany is facing challenges posed by globalisation, medical and technological progress, and demographic change. Strategies to meet these challenges and practice models in these countries vary because they depend on the organisation and funding of the health care system and the traditional role of primary care. However, some of the approaches from other countries and health care systems may be transferable to the German situation. We describe the background and the main challenges for primary care in Germany. Subsequently, we review the strategies pursued to prepare primary care for the future in the Netherlands, England, and the USA and analyse their applicability for Germany. All countries reviewed struggle with the improvement of cooperation and integration of care for patients with chronic illness. Proposed changes concern the organisation and funding of primary care, including cooperation in multidisciplinary teams within larger organisations such as virtual provider networks, GP-led health centres, or polyclinics which focus on the management of the patient population they are accountable for. This can be aided by national standards of care, care pathways, and guidelines. An appropriate funding model should provide incentives for population management which includes the whole team, e.g. through a mixture of capitation, fee-for-service, and pay-for-performance. The strategies pursued in other countries suggest how primary care in Germany could be restructured and improved to prepare for future challenges. However, in addition to considerable changes in organisation, funding, and incentives, educational, cultural, and other conditions need to be taken into account as well, especially in the case of forming multidisciplinary care teams. Improvement collaboratives and a national programme of practice coaches could be a way to prepare GP practices for and help them implement such major changes. ","954":"All modern healthcare systems need to respond to the common challenges posed by an aging population combined with a growing number of patients with (complex) chronic conditions and rising patient expectations. Countries with 'stronger' primary care systems (e.g. the Netherlands and England) seem to be better prepared to address these challenges than countries with 'weaker' primary care (e.g. USA). The role of primary care in a health care system is strongly related to its organisation and funding, thus determining the starting point and the possibilities for change. We selected the Netherlands, England, and USA as examples for the diversity of approaches to organise and finance health care. We analysed the main problems for primary care and reviewed strategies and practice models used to meet the challenges described above. The Netherlands aim to strengthen prevention for chronic diseases, while England strives to improve the management of patients with multimorbidity, prevent hospital admissions to contain costs, and to satisfy the increased demand of patients for access to primary care. Both countries seek to reorganise care around the patient and place their needs at the centre. The USA has to provide sufficient workforce, organisation, and funding for primary care to ensure better access, prevention, and provision of chronic care for its population. Strategies to improve (trans-sectoral) cooperation and care coordination, a main issue in all three countries, include the implementation of standards of care and bundled payments for chronic diseases in the Netherlands, GP commissioning, federated and group practice models in England, and the introduction of the Patient-Centred Medical Home and accountable care organisations in the USA. Organisation and financing of health care differ widely in the three countries. However, the necessity to improve coordination and integration of chronic disease care remains a common and core challenge. ","955":"In its 2009 report the Federal Advisory Council on the Assessment of Developments in the Health Care System developed a model of Primary Care Practices for future general practice-based primary care. This article presents the theoretical background of the model. Primary care practices are seen as developed organisations requiring changes at all system levels (interaction, organisation, and health system) to ensure sustainability of primary care functions in the future. Developments of the elements comprising the health care system may be compared to the developments and proposals observed in other countries. In Germany, however, the pace of these developments is relatively slow.","956":"Over the last ten years changes in the legal framework of the German health care system have promoted the development of new health service models to improve chronic care. Recent innovations include the nation-wide introduction of disease management programmes (DMPs), integrated care contracts, community nurse programmes, the introduction of General Practitioner (GP)-centred care contracts, and new opportunities to offer interdisciplinary outpatient care in polyclinics. The aim of this article is to describe the recent developments regarding both the implementation of new health care models by statutory health insurance companies and their evaluation. As part of a European project on the development and validation of disease management evaluation methods (DISMEVAL), we carried out a selective literature search to identify relevant models and evaluation studies. However, on the basis of the currently available evaluation and study results it is difficult to judge whether these developments have actually led to an improvement in the quality of chronic care in Germany. Only for DMPs, evaluation is legally mandatory; its methods are inappropriate, though, for studying the effectiveness of DMPs. Further study results on the effectiveness of DMPs mostly focus on the DMP Diabetes mellitus type II and show consistent improvements regarding process parameters such as regular routine examinations, adherence to treatment guidelines, and quality of life. More research will be needed to determine whether DMPs can also help reduce the incidence of secondary disease and mortality in the long term.","957":"","958":"Patients' reports of safety-related events and perceptions of safety can be a valuable source for hospitals. Patients of eight acute care hospitals in Switzerland were surveyed for safety-related events and concerns for safety. In workshops with hospitals areas for improvement were analyzed and priorities for change identified. To evaluate the benefit of the approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with hospital risk managers. 3,983 patients returned the survey (55% response rate). 21.4% reported at least one definite safety event, and the mean number of 'definite' incidents per patient was 0.31 (95% CI=0.29 to 0.34). 3.2% were very concerned and 14.7% were somewhat concerned about medical errors and safety. Having experienced a safety-related event, younger age, length of stay, poor health and a poor education increased the probability of reporting concerns. With some exceptions, results confirmed the hospitals' a priori expectations regarding the strengths and weaknesses of their institutions. Risk managers emphasized the usability of results for their work and the special value of referring to the patient's perspective at their home institutions. A considerable fraction of patients subjectively experiences safety-related events and is concerned about safety. Patient-generated data introduced a new quality into the discussion of safety issues within hospitals, and some expected that patients' experiences and concerns could affect patient volumes. Though the study is limited by the short time horizon and the lack of follow-up, the results suggest that the described approach is feasible and can serve as a supplemental tool for risk identification and management.","959":"All medical subspecialties and, in particular, high-tech field neurosurgery are subject to continuous change in therapeutic concepts due to novel treatment options emerging through research and evolution in the field. Hence, the question arises if the patient's informed consent needs to be adjusted in the face of multiple therapeutic options with different configurations of risk\/benefit relationships. In this paper we discuss different therapeutic scenarios with regard to ruptured intracerebral aneurysms (RIA) and unruptured intracerebral aneurysms (UIA), and we advise the medical doctor involved in the process. Indeed, experienced neurosurgeons and endovascular interventionalists are very familiar with the management of these scenarios; likewise, interns, residents, and otherwise affiliated physicians may be faced with these situations. In general, asymptomatic and mentally capacitated patients as well as legal guardians of minor patients and of mentally incapacitated patients with incidental aneurysms and more than one therapeutic option need to be accurately informed about the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options available to them. In case of emergency or when treating a mentally disabled patient who is incapable of making a sound judgment and has no legal guardian, the attending doctor will have to choose the best possible treatment option.","960":"Patients' self-determination needs to be much more specific and at an earlier point in time than is presently the case. We should find ways and methods to support this deliberative process. The questions currently explored in studies fail to take account of many patients' personal circumstances. It is necessary to reflect on the current steps and procedures.","961":"Patients have the right to know whether they are ill and what the nature of their disease is. Apart from general preventive health examinations introduced by the Federal Joint Committee they are not eligible to diagnostic testing when there are no symptoms. Actual suspicion of disease, though, entitles them to diagnostic testing services as long as the diagnostic work-up does not show that further testing is useless in terms of cure, mitigation or prevention of disease and its symptoms. The Social Code Book V (SGB V) does not provide for an independent right of information of medical staff, for example, to prevent their acquisition of infection. But if the insured claims a medical service associated with a specific risk for the medical personnel, e.g. in case of an infectious disease, mandatory testing for such a risk can be administered.","962":"Many diagnostic tests ordered by physicians cannot be justified by rational criteria. However, this is not necessarily a problem of knowledge or lack thereof. The rational use of diagnostic tests must also be understood as a behavioural problem. Apart from knowledge, financial incentives, tradition and patient expectations have an impact on diagnostic decisions, too. Traditional academic teaching with its emphasis on pathophysiology prevents medical students from adopting a critical attitude to diagnostic testing. Against the background of cognitive psychology research on adaptive behaviour, I would suggest to increase clinical exposure in the undergraduate curriculum. This should be accompanied by a \"reflective practicum\" to improve the understanding of the usefulness of diagnostic tests in a particular situation. Working environments should be examined as to the feedback they provide for clinicians. Remuneration and utilization patterns may be more important determinants of test-ordering than a clinicians' knowledge. Nevertheless, a basic understanding of Bayes' theorem and likelihood ratios are an essential part of the medical curriculum.","963":"There is a high interest in developing diagnostic tests, e.g. in terms of molecular markers. Usually diagnostic tests are judged by their accuracy. The benefit of diagnostic testing for the patient, though, can only derive from the received treatment after diagnosis. In this way, interaction between diagnostic testing and therapy is a prerequisite. In such cases diagnostic testing is predictive of therapy. To show its interaction, diagnostic tests should be embedded in randomised controlled trials.","964":"During the 1960s less than five percent of the children suffering from cancer could be cured. Today we are able to cure approximately three quarters. It is research in molecular biology elucidating the origin of cancer at the level of cells, genes and molecules that has accounted for this success. Research results include, for example, the identification of molecular markers of leukaemia that are able to predict the intensity of therapy necessary for maximum benefit. Furthermore, molecular markers have been identified for paediatric brain tumours which raise the hope for more individualized and targeted therapy.","965":"The patient-relevant benefit of diagnostic tests should be evaluated; addressing diagnostic accuracy alone is not sufficient, though. Several phased evaluation schemes for diagnostic tests have been proposed in the literature. They all have in common that studies evaluating the effect on patient outcome have a central position. Various designs are available to evaluate the effect of a diagnostic test on patient outcome. Five design options are presented and their pros and cons discussed. Indeed, such studies are feasible. Under exceptional conditions, however, it may be sufficient to base evaluation on diagnostic accuracy studies combined with further information (mostly from treatment trials).","966":"Reviewing and using diagnostic research for decision making involves complex issues about what are the exact diagnostic questions, how they should be studied, and to whom the results of such studies apply in real life. In this paper we aim to address some of the main issues concerning applicability of diagnostic research by looking at different diagnostic questions, what different study designs can be used and how bias and variability may impact on applicability. Users of diagnostic research should be aware of these issues in order to avoid confusion and misunderstandings about why modern diagnostic research addresses particular patient groups and uses certain study designs, whilst choosing to ignore others that at first glance seem relevant. We conclude that there are 4 main points to be addressed in doing and using diagnostic research, and these are: \"Get the question right\"; \"Get the study design right\"; \"Include patients for whom the test will also be used in practice\"; and \"Educate users of research\". Simple as they may seem, these points cover extremely complex issues in practice, and these need to be addressed by more communication between methodologists, practitioners and decision makers.","967":"","968":"","969":"","970":"","971":null,"972":"While methods for the production of guidelines (evidence analysis, assessment, adaptation) have been continually refined throughout the past years, there is a lack of instruments for the production of easily understandable synopses. Definition of a methodological approach to encompass synopses by Spidernet diagrams. Tables of synopses can be generated with distinct information to bring down the main results in one Spidernet diagram. This is possible for both the entire synopsis and parts of it. Guideline comparisons require detailed analyses on the one hand and easily understandable presentations of their results on the other. Guideline synopses can be substantially supported by graphic presentation of the results of synopsis. Graphic synopsis is also helpful in other cases; it may be used, for example, to summarise HTA reports, systematic reviews or guidelines. ","973":"Without transparent reporting of how a randomised controlled trial was designed and conducted and of the methods used, its internal validity cannot be assessed by the reader. A congress abstract is often the only source providing information about a trial. In January 2008, an extended CONSORT statement on abstract reporting was published. Its impact has yet to be evaluated. Using a slightly modified CONSORT checklist comprising 17 items, we thus investigated the reporting quality of randomised controlled trials published in the book of abstracts presented at the World Congress of Geriatrics and Gerontology in Paris in July 2009. A total of n=4,416 abstracts was screened for inclusion; n=129 met the inclusion criteria. The overall quality of the abstracts was remarkably poor. The primary outcome was mentioned in 34\/129 abstracts (26%), none of the abstracts reported on the procedure of random allocation of participants or clusters, 21\/129 abstracts (16%) reported some kind of blinding, and the attrition rate was mentioned in only 12\/129 abstracts (9%). The majority of abstracts fulfilled two items: description of intended intervention for each group (102\/129; 79%) and general interpretation of results (107\/129; 83%). Trial status was reported in all abstracts. Both journal editors and committees organising congresses are requested to define the use of the CONSORT statement as a prerequisite in their guidelines for authors and to instruct reviewers to conduct compliance checks. Medical associations should finally endorse the indispensability of the CONSORT statement and publish it in their journals. Otherwise the intended benefits cannot be fully generated.","974":"Medical staffs have a key role in the adequate treatment of victims of domestic violence. The present study collects self-report data about subjective perception, general knowledge and motivation for further training about domestic violence from medical staff of inpatient and outpatient clinical settings. A questionnaire was developed and sent to doctors, nursing staff, midwives, and psychotherapists working in outpatient clinical settings in Dresden and Chemnitz and in the inpatient departments of the Medical University of Dresden in Saxony, Germany. 1,107 (23%) of 4,886 distributed questionnaires were returned and analysed. The participants reported that they were seldom confronted with the consequences of domestic violence in their clinical practice. The unawareness among staff in specialised care facilities and advisory centres was highly noticeable. More than 90% of the participants did not know the main advisory centre for victims of domestic violence. Even if some facilities were known there was virtually no contact. The majority was not satisfied with the level of support they were able to offer. Further difficulties pointed out by participants included lack of time and the assumption that victims were unwilling to answer questions about domestic violence. The participants also expressed a high demand for further training.","975":"Good cooperation between physicians is an essential requirement for quality health care. General practitioners (GPs) have a key role in coordinating the various levels of care and physician contacts. Within the scope of the \"InteraKtion\" study of the Competence Centre of General Practice Baden-Wuerttemberg GPs were interviewed about their experiences and opinions regarding their cooperation with specialists. The aim of this study was to identify criteria and barriers of the referral process. 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted among GPs in Heidelberg, Tuebingen and Ulm. Data analysis was carried out using ATLAS.ti according to the qualitative content analysis by P. Mayring. From the GPs' point of view, the criteria for referral to specialists include: specialists' medical skills, good doctor-patient relationship and patient satisfaction. In addition, the willingness to arrange short-term appointments in urgent cases, timely diagnosis and adequate communication were mentioned. The following barriers were pointed out: long appointment wait times and the specialists' increased provision of Individual Healthcare Services. These results indicate that GPs have clear criteria for referral to specialists. These findings should find their way into future quantitative studies to explore the weighting of the criteria and barriers discussed here. Joint training activities or quality circles could improve the personal contact between GPs and specialists working in the same region. ","976":null,"977":"Effective implementation of disease management programmes (DMPs) in primary care practices often requires changes in practice workflows and responsibilities and acceptance by the parties involved. Within the ELSID study (evaluation study of the DMP diabetes mellitus type 2) the physicians' attitudes toward DMPs were obtained and an optimised implementation of DMPs was developed by conducting a quality management cycle with primary care practice teams. The aim was to investigate which practice workflows will have to be changed and what kind of barriers to implement these changes are perceived. In 78 primary care practices of the two German federal states of Rheinland-Pfalz and Sachsen-Anhalt a quality management cycle was conducted using a structured analysis of the current state of DMP workflows and the need for improvement identified. Subsequently, an optimised workflow was developed and targets were agreed upon. After 6 months, the study team called to inquire about the current state of implementation and, if appropriate, actual barriers to change. After 6 months, 71 practices had been interviewed by phone. 64 of them (90.1%) had agreed on at least one target (e.g., to purchase new instrumentation, to regularly discuss feedback reports, to set up a patient registry). On average three targets had been formulated, and 2 out of 3 had been implemented in the meantime. In most cases lack of time was given as the reason for non-implementation. The majority of surveyed practices perceived some need for improvement. But sufficient resources (time, staff and money) are required to ensure efficient implementation of DMPs in primary care practices and their integration with routine processes. A redefinition of responsibilities for DMPs will strengthen the role of medical assistants and promote high-quality implementation of these programmes. ","978":"The so-called \"Check up 35\" is a structured preventive examination to be conducted by primary care providers. Recent interviews have shown that expectations with regard to this examination vary among physicians; some of them expressed doubt that the consultation is useful at all. The aim of this study was to representatively examine Brandenburg's family physicians' attitudes towards this \"Check up\". 50% of the family physicians listed in the data base of the Association of SHI Physicians were randomly selected to receive a mail questionnaire (n=748). Participation in the study was voluntary, the questionnaires were evaluated anonymously. The physicians were asked about both content and assumed benefit of consultations. The questionnaire was answered by 37% of the physicians (n=274). In 2008, 40 \"Check ups\" were conducted every three months. 96% of the physicians amended the standard programme with additional preventive examinations - most frequently serum creatinine measurements. In most of the respectively rated categories, they appreciate the usefulness of the examination. In contrast, they take a rather sceptical attitude towards the en bloc standard programme. The study shows that many family physicians are very critical of the \"Check up 35\"; in particular, this applies to the range of scheduled examinations. There are considerable variations in the individual shaping of the consultation process among the physicians. They use the \"Check up\" as a tool for individual prevention instead of limiting it to the reduced standardised screening as intended. ","979":"","980":"The German Health Ministry funded 10 demonstration projects and accompanying research of benchmarking in health care. The accompanying research work aimed to infer generalisable findings and recommendations. We performed a meta-evaluation of the demonstration projects and analysed national and international approaches to benchmarking in health care. It was found that the typical benchmarking sequence is hardly ever realised. Most projects lack a detailed analysis of structures and processes of the best performers as a starting point for the process of learning from and adopting best practice. To tap the full potential of benchmarking in health care, participation in voluntary benchmarking projects should be promoted that have been demonstrated to follow all the typical steps of a benchmarking process.","981":"The Federal Joint Committee as the guardian of quality assurance has a vested interest in benchmarking in health care. This is reflected in the fact that essential features of benchmarking can be found in the cross-institutional quality assurance procedure, which is the main quality assurance measure of the G-BA. However, a morphological analysis of the various quality assurance methods reveals differences in these characteristics. To a large extent this refers to the particular mix of different sub-goals that are pursued with the respective quality assurance measure. Benchmarking is correlated more with the sub-goal of promoting quality rather than with quality control. To other sub-goals pursued with quality assurance, there is rather an indifferent relationship. Whether and to what extent benchmarking will shape these measures is therefore a question of how quality assurance will be put into practice.","982":"The European Practice Assessment (EPA) is a comprehensive quality management which consists of 220 indicators covering 5 domains (infrastructure, people, information, finance, and quality and safety). The aim of the project presented was to evaluate EPA as an instrument for benchmarking in ambulatory care practices. A before-and-after design with a comparison group was chosen. One hundred and two practices conducted EPA at baseline (t1) and at the 3-year follow-up (t2). A further 209 practices began EPA at t2 (comparison group). Since both practice groups differed in several variables (age of GP, location and size of practice), a matched-pair design based on propensity scores was applied leading to a subgroup of 102 comparable practices (out of the 209 practices). Data analysis was carried out using Z scores of the EPA domains. The results showed significant improvements in all domains between t1 and t2 as well as between the comparison group and t2. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the implementation of total quality management and the re-assessment of the EPA procedure can lead to significant improvements in almost all domains.","983":null,"984":"IQM is a non-profit association of hospitals and open to all kinds of hospitals.

Twelve QCs, involving 96 general practitioners from 85 practices, were randomised. Six QCs worked with traditional anonymous feedback and six with an open benchmark. Two QC meetings supported with feedback reports were held covering the topics \"drug-drug interactions\" and \"asthma\"; in both cases discussions were guided by a trained moderator. Outcome measures included health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment, asthma severity and number of potentially inappropriate drug combinations as well as the general practitioners' satisfaction in relation to the performance of the QC. A significant improvement in the treatment of asthma was observed in both trial arms. However, there was only a slight improvement regarding inappropriate drug combinations. There were no relevant differences between the group with open benchmark (B-QC) and traditional quality circles (T-QC). The physicians' satisfaction with the QC performance was significantly higher in the T-QCs. General practitioners seem to take a critical perspective about open benchmarking in quality circles. Caution should be used when implementing benchmarking in a quality circle as it did not improve healthcare when compared to the traditional procedure with anonymised comparisons. ","986":"Depression is the most common mental disorder in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) with an average prevalence of about 40% to 50%. Depression in PD has a major impact on the patient's health-related quality of life and caregivers' distress. Although common depressive symptoms in PD are under-diagnosed and therefore often untreated in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current status of treatment in PD patients with depression in Germany and to develop approaches to improve awareness and therapy. The study was divided into three parts: 1. a pre-study to evaluate treatment patterns in a registry of PD patients with and without depressive symptoms, 2. a pilot trial to establish a valid and feasible questionnaire for patients with PD and depression, 3. main study: quality measurement by benchmarking in 14 centres followed by a final phase for developing an integrated algorithm for the treatment of PD patients with depression. In the main study only 27.6% of the patients received antidepressant therapy, and only 55% with moderate to severe depression were treated. Only seven patients received behavioural therapy. There were two groups: one with and the other without training and benchmark information. No significant difference could be detected between the two treatment arms. This study provided important data on the treatment of patients with PD and depression in Germany. There are a number of reasons for the observed lack of efficacy in this study. More studies are needed to develop an appropriate approach to performing benchmarking for the treatment of neurological disease.","987":null,"988":"The aim of this project was to improve treatment processes and results in acutely ill inpatients within a network of nine psychiatric state hospitals of the Landschaftsverband Rheinland by introducing a benchmarking process. The project was based upon pre-existing measures of quality management. Patient groups were selected that were characterised by a severe clinical development or a high demand for mental health care services (alcohol abuse, depression of the elderly, schizophrenia). Room for improvement concerning specific hospitals and the overall hospital network were identified. The project was conducted with two patient cohorts before and after a quality-related intervention. Interventions were implemented for specific hospitals and the overall hospital network. Overall treatment documentations of 1,696 patients (1(st) cohort n=1,856, 2(nd) cohort n=1,696) were completed. Although there was no constant quantifiable statistically significant improvement of quality within the three patient groups (and certainly not with respect to the overall network), there was successful improvement of essential treatment processes for certain hospitals and the overall network under benchmarking. This was especially relevant where treatment recommendations were concerned. Future projects should focus on the conformance with treatment guidelines by defining both structural and process measures as a starting point and evaluation criterion.","989":"Quality-controlled documentation and evaluation of long-term course of disease is essential for measuring the outcome quality in the care of cancer patients. This project, based on the ongoing clinical cancer registry of the Comprehensive Oncology Centre (COC) Stuttgart, was aimed to integrate a long-term follow-up documentation and to compare outcome quality between centres of the OCC. In a prospective, non-randomised, multi-centred, registry-based cohort study overall survival, disease free survival and quality of life were evaluated as indicators of outcome quality. The study included all patients suffering from breast, colon or rectum cancer, who were treated with curative intent in one of the centres of the OCC between Sep 30, 2003, and Dec 31, 2008. Cox regressions were used for the statistical evaluation of differences between centres. Patients suffering from breast cancer (n=3,213), colon cancer (n=1,216) and rectum cancer (n=847) were eligible for the analysis. They were treated in 10 of 13 centres of the OCC. Statistically significant differences in the overall survival could be demonstrated between centres. This project initiated a regular comparative evaluation of the outcome quality and showed that there are statistically significant differences between centres. Based on these findings, the benchmarking process will have to be further developed and elaborated. ","990":"Coercive measures that restrict personal freedom have been in the focus of critical public interest since the beginning of modern psychiatry. Psychiatric hospitals have the two-fold mission to prevent danger to self or danger to others on the one side and on the other to keep optional coercive measures as little restrictive and as short as possible. Critical and regardful handling of coercive measures has both qualitative and quantitative aspects. For quantitative comparisons, we introduced benchmarking in psychiatric hospitals in Baden-Wuerttemberg, which in the meantime have been joined by hospitals in other German federal states, Switzerland, and Luxemburg. The most important quality indicators include the percentage of admissions exposed to coercive measures and the mean duration of a coercive measure. For the purpose of benchmarking, the results of four quality indicators are presented, separated for each ICD-10 principal diagnostic group, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The project has been continuously pursued since 2004. Participating hospitals were allowed to develop their own projects to reduce coercive measures according to the benchmarking results.","991":"Benchmarking, i.e. learning from the best, by means of appropriate and established quality indicators is one of the central management tools to improve patient care in the field of cystic fibrosis in Germany. The Deming cycle is used as a controlling instrument to realise purposeful and stringent measures in hospitals. Benchmarking only works on a voluntary and confidential basis. This is the most important factor to drive motivation and activities. Benchmarking is changing and optimising the quality of structures, processes and outcome performance. The implementation of an independent external expert as a moderator and methodologist is a successful element of the benchmarking process.","992":"Despite the availability of high-quality guidelines and advanced pain management techniques acute postoperative pain management is still far from being satisfactory. The QUIPS (Quality Improvement in Postoperative Pain Management) project aims to improve treatment quality by means of standardised data acquisition, analysis of quality and process indicators, and feedback and benchmarking. During a pilot phase funded by the German Ministry of Health (BMG), a total of 12,389 data sets were collected from six participating hospitals. Outcome improved in four of the six hospitals. Process indicators, such as routine pain documentation, were only poorly correlated with outcomes. To date, more than 130 German hospitals use QUIPS as a routine quality management tool. An EC-funded parallel project disseminates the concept internationally. QUIPS demonstrates that patient-reported outcomes in postoperative pain management can be benchmarked in routine clinical practice. Quality improvement initiatives should use outcome instead of structural and process parameters. The concept is transferable to other fields of medicine.","993":"By initiating and taking part in the pilot project obra (outcome benchmarking in rheumatologic acute care), which was supported by the German Ministry of Health, the rheumatologic hospitals committed themselves to the continuous improvement of quality through a collective benchmarking and learning process.

However, as the field of SDM research is still relatively young, new instruments for the measurement of (shared) decision making (process, outcome and surrounding elements) are constantly being developed. Thus, the aims of this structured review were to give an update on current developments regarding the measurement in the field of SDM, as well as to give a short overview of published and unpublished instruments. We conducted an electronic literature search in PubMed and the Web of Science database, performed hand searches of relevant journals and contacted key authors in the field. We found eight scales that have been subjected to further psychometric testing, eleven new and psychometrically tested instruments and nine developments that are still in the publishing process. The results show that there is a trend towards measuring SDM processes from a dyadic approach (assessing both the patient's and the clinician's perspective). More and more scales have been developed and tested in languages other than English, which indicates the growing research efforts in various countries. While reliability of most scales is good, they differ in their extent of validation. Further psychometric testing is needed, as well as the development of a theoretical measurement framework in order to improve consistency of measured constructs across research groups.","999":"Shared decision making in the United States has become an important element in health policy debates. The recently passed federal health care reform legislation includes several key provisions related to shared decision making (SDM) and patient decision support. Several states have passed or are considering legislation that incorporates SDM as a key component of improved health care provision. Research on SDM is funded by a range of public and private organizations. Non-profit, for-profit, academic and government organizations are developing decision support interventions for numerous conditions. Some interventions are publicly available; others are distributed to patients through health insurance and healthcare providers. A significant number of clinical implementation projects are underway to test and evaluate different ways of incorporating SDM and patient decision support into routine clinical care. Numerous professional organizations are advocating for SDM and social networking efforts are increasing their advocacy as well. Policy makers are intrigued by the potential of SDM to improve health care provision and potentially lower costs. The role of shared decision making in policy and practice will be part of the larger health care reform debate.","1000":"WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? SDM is on the national policy agenda and has been prioritised as part of the health reform bill currently going through the Houses of Parliament. The NHS Constitution emphasises patients' right to be involved in decisions and this is reinforced in standards set by professional regulators. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? The UK governments have invested in patient information and a few decision aids are freely available on public websites. WHAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND IMPLEMENTATION? There is interest in SDM and in collaborative care planning, but this is not yet the norm in clinical practice and few clinicians have received training in the topic. Several programmes are under way to encourage implementation of SDM. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? Future developments will depend on the extent of clinical commitment and on whether there are sufficient funds available to invest in the promotion of SDM at a time when health care resources are tightly constrained.","1001":"In Switzerland there is a strong movement at a national policy level towards strengthening patient rights and patient involvement in health care decisions. Yet, there is no national programme promoting shared decision making. First decision support tools (prenatal diagnosis and screening) for the counselling process have been developed and implemented. Although Swiss doctors acknowledge that shared decision making is important, hierarchical structures and asymmetric physician-patient relationships are still prevailing. The last years have seen some promising activities regarding the training of medical students and the development of patient support programmes. Swiss direct democracy and the habit of consensual decision making and citizen involvement in general may provide a fertile ground for SDM development in the primary care setting.","1002":"In the last two decades there has been a growing recognition in the Spanish National Health System (NHS) of the importance of considering patients' values and preferences in clinical decisions. Patient participation in shared decision making (SDM) is gaining importance as a suitable approach to patient-health professional communication and decision making in Spain. In addition, the NHS is funding the development of patients' decision aids (PtDAs) for shared decision making (SDM) by Health Technology Assessment Agencies. However, the NHS has still not incorporated reforms in law that includes SDM and PtDAs as a key component of health care services and professional curricula, nor is there a standardised implementation of interventions to support decisions in routine care. Most patients are not very familiar with their rights to be kept informed and participate in their own health care decisions. Most professionals are not familiar with or educated about patients' rights to be kept informed and participate in health care decisions either. The future of SDM in Spain is promising. The next course of action should be to maintain the production and adaptation of high-quality PtDAs while at the same time reinforcing effective dissemination strategies among patients and training programmes for professionals focused on SDM.","1003":"WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? The Dutch health care system has been reformed in 2006 to make it more patient-oriented and demand-driven. We shortly describe four strategies of this health care reform. Although research projects are now fully spread over the country, a coordinated research agenda on SDM is lacking. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? The Dutch governmental healthcare internet portal for patients hosts 16 patient decision aids. WHAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND IMPLEMENTATION? There is quite a strong patient participation movement in the Netherlands, on macro and meso level. Limited effort, related to the local research projects has been put into training professionals in SDM skills. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? We need concerted action on the level of educating health care professionals, empowering patients, making patient decision aids easily accessible, supporting the professionals in this new task, and measuring the process of SDM in performance indicators used in quality assurance. The Dutch Platform for SDM that will be launched in Maastricht in June 2011 is therefore a timely and relevant initiative.","1004":"WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? The Italian National Health Plan and many regional and local health authorities explicitly recognise the importance of patient\/citizen participation. These official documents rarely mention the specific concept of SDM, but they use terms such as patient involvement, participation, and empowerment. Patient associations are actively involved in promoting patient\/citizen participation, but still play a marginal role in the health debate compared to health professionals, clinicians and healthcare managers. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? There are only a few examples of decision aids designed for patients according to SDM concepts. A critical point is the lack of specific tools for the evaluation of SDM processes. Exceptions include the Italian versions of the OPTION scale and the SDM-Q, used at the micro-level for the evaluation of SDM. What about professional interest and real implementation? Health professionals recognise that doctor-patient communication is an important area. Italian research in SDM has grown and improved. It is very promising, but still limited. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses of some medical schools include specific programs on doctor-patient communication skills, focusing also on promotion of patient participation. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? In conclusion, there is room for improving the Italian efforts to implement SDM into practice at both the individual and public level.","1005":"WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? Though informed consent and patients' right to information are regulated by Israeli law, there is a low level of formal activities focused on shared decision making (SDM) in Israel. Further, there are few organized programs to promote SDM among medical professionals or the public, and governmental support of SDM-related research is minimal. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? The Israeli government does not have a program on development of patient decision aids. WHAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND IMPLEMENTATION? Nonetheless, patients have begun to influence litigation in both formal and informal capacities, medical schools have begun to incorporate courses for improving physician-patient communication into their curricula, and the largest national health plan has initiated a plan to increase pubic awareness. Funding for researching and promoting SDM is not centrally allocated, and studies show that despite the positive effects of SDM, such an approach is infrequently applied in actual clinical practice, and initiatives to promote SDM (e.g., decision aids) are in their infancy. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? In conclusion, though not actively promoting SDM at present, Israel, with its governmentally regulated universal coverage with good access to high-level services possesses all the requisite elements for rapid, widespread advances in SDM in future years.","1006":"The main focus of the present paper is to describe 1) the healthcare system specific influences on patient participation in medical decision making and 2) the current state of research and implementation of shared decision making (SDM) after ten years of substantial advances in health policy and research in this field. WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? The \"Medical Patients Rights Act\" is to standardise all the rights and responsibilities within the scope of medical treatment. This also comprises the right to informed decisions, comprehensive and comprehensible information for patients, and decisions based on the partnership of clinicians and patients. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? SDM training programmes for healthcare professionals have been developed and partly implemented. Several decision support interventions - primarily with support from health insurance funds - have been developed and evaluated. WHAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND IMPLEMENTATION? Against the background of the German health policy's endorsement of patient participation, the German government and other public institutions are currently funding different research programmes in which shared decision making is playing a substantial role. The development and implementation of decision support tools for patients and professionals as well as the implementation of trainings for healthcare professionals require stronger efforts. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? With the support of health policy and with the utilisation of scientific evidence, the transfer of shared decision making into practice is considered to be meaningful in the German healthcare system. The translation into routine care will remain an important task for the future.","1007":"WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? There is a social demand in France for more healthcare user information and greater patient participation in the decision making process, as reflected by the law of March 4(th) 2002 pertaining to patients' rights and the quality of the healthcare system known as the Law on Democracy in healthcare. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? At the micro level, some research projects are being developed, some of them using decision aids. Preliminary results show that patients want to be informed but that the concept of shared decision making needs to be analysed and refined from both the patients' and the physicians' points of views. WHAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND IMPLEMENTATION? However, the relationship between physicians\/healthcare professionals and patients\/healthcare users is very complex and progress in this field takes time. Only ten years after enactment of the Law on Democracy in healthcare, it might be premature to try and determine the state of the art of shared medical decision making at the macro and meso levels in France. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? There is room in France for further studies on shared decision making in the medical encounter. Researchers, decision makers, healthcare users and healthcare professionals need a place to meet and exchange. An observatory dedicated to shared decision making will be launched in the coming months, both at the national level and in collaboration with several other French-speaking areas like Switzerland and the province of Quebec.","1008":"WHAT ABOUT POLICY REGARDING SDM? Since 1999, there has been a small but growing interest by academics, the government, and society as a whole in strengthening patients' and professionals' involvement in shared decision making (SDM). Two governmental policy documents that indicate support for SDM are (1) Health Reform in 2003 and (2) Sanitary Objectives 2011-2020, which includes a brief section on client participation and SDM. WHAT ABOUT TOOLS - DECISION SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS? Research by Chilean academics has highlighted the patients' desire to participate in health decisions and effective approaches for enhancing health professionals' skills in interprofessional SDM; however, little has been done to support this need and the work is centralised in only one academic institution. Decision support tools and coaching interventions are limited to patients considering decisions about managing type 2 diabetes. WHAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST AND IMPLEMENTATION? Although there is increasing attention to studying patients' participation and involvement on their healthcare, little has been studied in relation to professionals' interest in SDM. As well, there are significant challenges for implementation of a country-wide SDM policy. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE? The future looks promising given the new health policies, local Chilean research projects, and international initiatives. Collaboration between health professionals, academics, and government policy makers, with public involvement needs to be strengthened in order to promote concrete strategies to implement SDM in Chile.","1009":"Canada's approach to shared decision making (SDM) is as disparate as its healthcare system; a conglomerate of 14 public plans at various administrative levels. SDM initiatives are taking place in different pockets of the country and are in different stages of development. The most advanced provincial initiative is occurring in Saskatchewan, where in 2010 the provincial government prepare to introduce patient decision aids into certain surgical specialties. With regard to decision support tools for patients, perhaps the most active entity is the Patient Decision Aids Research Group in Ottawa, Ontario. This group maintains a public inventory of decision aids ranked according to International Patient Decision Aid Standards and has developed the generic Ottawa Personal Decision Guide, as well as a toolkit for integrating decision aids in clinical practice. All of these tools are publicly available free of charge. Professional interest in SDM in Canada is not yet widespread, but Canada's principal health research funding agency is sponsoring several important SDM projects. Researchers from institutions across the country are promoting SDM through continuing professional development programs and other interventions in fields as varied as primary care, dietary medicine and workplace rehabilitation. Still, the future of SDM in Canada remains uncertain. Canada's provincially based structure obliges promoters to work with each province separately, and the recent growth of private healthcare risks dissipating efforts to implement SDM.","1010":"There is no SDM in clinical practice in Brazil. The first steps have been taken towards research and tool development recently. Likewise, our society is starting to get involved with decision making in health care. This paper aims to offer an overview of the Brazilian health system history, its values, and its influence on SDM. The participative social control concept is introduced as a result of the movement against the dictatorship era. In addition, the influence of social changes on the Medical Ethical Code is delineated. SDM state of the art in Brazil is also discussed and the challenges to implement it on clinical practice are described. Regardless the challenges, it is possible to make a positive assessment of SDM in Brazil.","1011":"The paper describes the current position of shared decision making (SDM) within the Australian healthcare system. SDM POLICY IN AUSTRALIA: Support for SDM exists through guidelines and policy documents, and is strongly endorsed by consumer organisations; however, there is no clear overarching policy framework for SDM in Australia. TOOLS FOR SDM: There are limited tools available for SDM in clinical practice. Access to tools exists through some Australian health research and consumer organisation websites but the use of tools remains idiosyncratic. IMPLEMENTATION OF SDM: Comparatively little has been achieved in the implementation of SDM in Australia. Although there is wide recognition that consumer involvement in health decisions is important, provision of resources and infrastructure to achieve it is limited, and there is no clear strategy to support implementation within the healthcare system. SDM IN THE FUTURE: Current reforms to the healthcare system may enable a more centralised approach to implementation of SDM in the future. A new federally funded consumer health information organisation may assist by providing a central point through which SDM interventions may be made available to the Australian public and the Australian Charter of Rights has the potential to provide a national framework for consumer involvement. However, priority needs to be given to SDM by both federal and state governments with greater investment in SDM research and in activities to support implementation in clinical practice.","1012":"","1013":"Several studies show that the findings of clinical trials are often not published in full, resulting in a biased presentation of results (publication bias). First, this paper discusses the ethical arguments in favour of complete transparency of biomedical research data. There are relevant deontological (like obligations towards study participants and research sponsors) and consequentialist (harm for patients and misallocation of scarce resources) ethical reasons for the full publication of all trial results, which cannot be overridden by counter arguments like freedom of research, data protection or the individual interests of researchers and manufacturers. The article therefore discusses (1) which strategies are appropriate to guarantee data transparency and (2) who bears responsibility for the implementation of these strategies. Finally, open questions and the need for further action will be discussed.","1014":"The issue of selective publishing of research results is gaining more and more scientific, public and political awareness. For guideline authors, in particular, it leads to uncertainty about the interpretability of the methodological quality and clinical relevance of the available evidence and the risk of bias where their conclusions and thus guideline recommendations are concerned. The actual impact of publication bias on guideline contents appears to be low if a systematic and methodically sound approach is followed in the process of guideline development. However, the quality of the evidence on this topic is poor. Different strategies to deal with publication bias have been proposed for authors of systematic reviews but they are of limited use for guideline authors. The goal must therefore be to implement appropriate measures in order to avoid the problem ex ante. The first step would be the systematic registration of study results in publicly accessible registers.","1015":"Publication bias arises from the preferential publication of studies with positive, statistically significant, or particularly strong effects. In meta-analysis on the effectiveness of interventions this may, for example, lead to an overestimation of an effect. In studies on harm, though, wish bias and publication bias frequently take opposing directions. In consequence the overall effect is more difficult to interpret. Generally, non randomized studies might be expected to have a higher potential for publication bias as they have lower publication rates. Specifically, adverse effects are often not reported in a standardized way and tend to be secondary outcomes. Related biases such as positive outcome bias and location bias (problems in locating studies, retrieval bias) are therefore also more likely. As yet, however, there is no empirical proof to support this since research activities on the subject of publication bias is almost exclusively focused on randomized controlled trials.","1016":"The medical device industry, strongly dominated by medium-sized firms, has significant growth potential and a high number of job opportunities with 170,000 employees in more than 11,000 companies. Approximately one third of the business volume is achieved with innovative products that are less than three years old. The safety, quality and efficiency of the products is tested and approved by CE certification. Due to the heterogeneous field of devices, however, evidence requirements must be differentiated according to the type of device in question. Transparency is as important as the type of evidence, and industry is well aware of the significance of transparency for credibility in the market. Industry believes that all the stakeholders affected must collaborate to define the evidence requirements and decide which data are necessary to assess the benefits of a technology. Before a consistent level of transparency can be achieved, however, it is crucial to jointly develop a framework of requirements including invasiveness, risk potential, patient-relevant endpoints and intended use of the technology, as well as the data source. Transparency is a process that can only be achieved if all stakeholders cooperate successfully. Also, it is important to keep in mind that the development of study designs and reliable evidence needs time. In the interest of all patients it is essential to maintain an innovation-friendly climate in Germany.","1017":null,"1018":"The assessment of the balance between benefits and harms of population-based interventions faces both methodological and practical difficulties. This paper uses the example of cancer screening to outline existing challenges such as the consideration of outcomes that occur at substantially different times, or the lack of direct evidence which can lead to false conclusions and adverse health effects for healthy individuals undergoing screening. Sometimes not even sound evidence provides clear answers about the benefits and harms of preventive interventions. This is why informed decision-making is a particularly important step for individuals taking preventive interventions into consideration. Due to the lack of a clear answer to the question of benefits and harms from scientific evidence, individuals' attitudes and values may become a decisive factor. Studies, however, indicate that the prerequisite for informed decision making, namely objective and balanced information about benefits and harms, is often missing.","1019":"The significance of palliative care as an interdisciplinary and multi-professional approach to treating patients with extremely severe medical conditions should be investigated using the same methodological standards as for clinical medicine in general. Clinical studies in palliative medicine show that certain standards, e.g. in pain therapy, have still not been sufficiently implemented. There is also a lack of methodologically appropriate studies to investigate palliative medicine as a complex intervention. This research deficit is all the more regrettable as - specifically in the field of oncology - it can be demonstrated that the benefit provided by the services of palliative care teams is very large, especially for patients with a particularly unfavorable course of the disease.","1020":"Efficacy, efficiency, value, and harm constitute the terminology that is used to decide about drug licensing and reimbursement. This article discusses to what extent legal requirements dictate the way clinical trials are planned and assessed. Cardiovascular disease is the best example of indications where efficacy and safety are described with the same set of endpoints. It is explained that the assessment of clinical trials must not be restricted to the assessment of primary endpoints. Instead components of a composite endpoint, secondary endpoints, and relevant subgroups of the patient population all require careful inspection. In cases where efficacy and safety are not two sides of the same medal, assessment is either trivial, or extremely difficult, and eventually benefit and risk can be balanced only for individual cases.","1021":"Measurement of health-related quality of life can play a major role in benefit-risk assessment. Preference-based methods for measuring quality of life where data are aggregated into a single quality of life index are particularly well suited for use in quantitative analysis. Using two examples from research on cancer and multiple sclerosis, this paper compares approaches in which quality of life data from genuine studies or from external sources is used. It will be demonstrated that quality of life data can provide relevant information for quantitative benefit-risk assessment in applied research. In addition, quality of life data may be included in more complex approaches of multi-criteria decision analysis.","1022":"","1023":"1. The transfer rate of mature newborns will be presented as a new quality indicator. 2.

Based on 17 clinical and 3 structural factors, a logistic regression model was used to develop a specific \"risk\" predictor for the quality indicator \"transfer rate\". For care level III (basic care) a \"risk\" predictor for the transfer rate was developed, which consists of 15 factors. The AUC(ROC)-value of this quality indicator was 78.6%, which is sufficient. The hospital ranking based on the adjusted risk assessment was different from the hospital ranking prior to this adjustment. The average correction of ranking position was 10.4 for 43 clinics. 1.

The perinatal\/neonatal database of 41,055 newborns of the Saxonian quality surveillance from 1998 to 2004 was analysed. Based on 18 possible risk factors, a logistic regression model was used to develop a specific risk predictor for the quality indicator \"late-onset infection\". The developed risk predictor for the incidence of late-onset infection could be described by 4 of the 18 analysed risk factors, namely gestational age, admission from home, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and B-streptococcal infection. The AUC(ROC) value of this quality indicator was 83.3%, which demonstrates its reliability. The hospital ranking based on the adjusted risk assessment was very different from hospital rankings before this adjustment. The average correction of ranking position was 4.96 for 35 clinics.

","1025":"The last decades have brought about an unprecedented proliferation of scientific knowledge necessitating a structuring and standardization of content for the training of novices and junior staff in all academic disciplines. In medicine, great effort has been expended by individual faculties to compile learning objectives, yet one disadvantage is common to almost all of these catalogues: their static structure limits search options and impedes an ongoing development. The learning objectives of all individual disciplines of the Heidelberg Curriculum Medicinale (HeiCuMed) were merged and assigned to levels and attributes of competency. In order to achieve easy access and to offer optimal search options to students, teaching staff and curriculum coordinators, the generated Heidelberg Catalogue of Learning Objectives (HCLO) was established as an online portal. The easy to handle online interface of the learning objectives catalogue allows for an individualized search for items with an unlimited combination of text and\/or attributes. Thus, students and teaching staff may use the tool as a discipline-based guide for learning and teaching as well as an outcome oriented tool defining the intended competence of a graduate. Curriculum designers can continuously update the catalogue to map the currently intended course contents, thus ensuring fast adaptation to changing needs and rendering a dynamic feature to the HCLO. All members of the academic community may benefit from the presented model. Students are offered the opportunity to prepare for upcoming courses and examinations and to monitor their progress of competencies over the entire curriculum. Teaching staff and curriculum designers are supported in developing intended learning spirals and aligning learning objectives, course content and examination modalities. In its immediacy the HCLO provides the base for an advanced and fast adaptation in curriculum design as opposed to the static catalogues of objectives collecting dust. With this tool we would like to contribute to ongoing activities of curriculum designers in creating well-engineered and efficient tools to manage learning objectives. ","1026":"In Germany content-related vocational training mostly is the responsibility of the trainees themselves. The aim of this needs assessment is to explore the requirements of a longitudinal training course in vocational training. A combined quantitative-qualitative needs assessment was chosen. We used data of a continuous record keeping system in primary care to assess the occupational field, and the needs of vocational trainees were explored in a qualitative survey. Data of more than 120,000 consulting problems in primary care were attributed to different medical expertises by frequency (orthopaedics 22.1%; internal medicine 17.2%; dermatology 12.2%; ear, nose, and throat medicine 11.9%). They revealed a high concordance between the needs derived from the consulting problems and the vocational trainees' needs identified in the qualitative survey (421 text units in the categories: medical expertise, competencies and skills and reflection on one's own performance). The results of this needs assessment demonstrate the importance of vocational trainees' needs and the findings of health services research for improvement of content-related vocational training. Furthermore, the results form the basis for longitudinal training courses in vocational training, as shown in the approach of the training course within the training programme Verbundweiterbildung(plus). ","1027":"","1028":"In order to ensure the delivery of primary care part of the vocational medical training must take place in the general practice setting. In Germany, this requires the authorization to provide general practitioner (GP) training. While in many countries specific qualification programmes for GP trainers are obligatory, this does not yet apply in Germany. The aim of this survey was to explore perspectives and experiences of GP trainers focusing on their needs in view of a possible qualification course. A three-page questionnaire was developed and sent to all 1,780 GP trainers in the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. Of the 1,780 GP trainers 656 responded (response rate: 37%), 18% of them being female trainers. About a quarter of the respondents had a vocational trainee, while 36% were looking for one at the time of the survey. The reason most frequently given for not having a vocational trainee was \"no applicants\" (n=323). Motivational reasons for involvement as a GP trainer were most commonly \"interpersonal co-operation\" (83%) and \"enthusiasm for education\" (69%). Only 2% of the respondents reported a bad experience with vocational trainees. Special needs were expressed regarding both legal and fiscal issues with vocational trainees in general practice and the development of a curriculum. For the first time the perspectives and experiences of GP trainers have been explored in the present study. The results may provide a basis for the development of a qualification programme for GP trainers in Germany. ","1029":"Due to the increasing lack of physicians, an ageing and thus multi-morbid society and a misdistribution of physicians in Germany primary care provided by general practitioners is at risk. Therefore, approaches to recruit more physicians for general practice are being sought. The aim of the present study was to explore individual motivations for choosing a career in general practice, vocational trainees' perspectives on the current situation of vocational training and to identify possible approaches to improve the situation with suggestions from vocational trainees in Germany. A qualitative study was conducted by interviewing 13 trainees. The interviews that were based on a predefined interview guideline were recorded and transcribed. The analysis was performed according to Mayring supported by the software Atlas.ti. In general, the reasons given for choosing general practice include the holistic view towards patients, the opportunity to see the direct impact of therapies and self-employment. Furthermore, general practice was perceived as a job with a positive work-life balance. Barriers to vocational training are the lack of structure of individual rotations and the low salaries during the rotation in practice. Furthermore, the basic conditions for working as a self-employed general practitioner in Germany were described as being a disincentive. A general suggestion for improvement was to promote professional recognition of general practice at universities. A qualification of vocational trainers was requested. Specific suggestions were: better payment, better-structured rotations and a specific preparation for the self-employed general practitioner. The results of this study reveal that a single measure is insufficient for recruiting more young doctors for general practice. In fact, a package of measures is necessary to improve aspects of the vocational training but also general conditions for the profession. ","1030":"The increasing shortage of (primary care) physicians in Germany is currently being discussed within and outside the profession. A national survey among general practice trainees aimed to explore their perspectives of vocational training (VT). After translation, cultural adaptation and web implementation of the questionnaire of the \"Vasco da Gama Movement,\" the survey was conducted during 2009. Descriptive analyses were performed. Among 436 participants (mean age 36 years, 64% female, 49 months of VT) discipline-specific (\"medically diverse discipline\", \"one-to-one care\", and \"holistic approach\"), but also gender-related (females: \"compatibility with family life\", males: \"autonomy and independence\", and \"opportunities to start their own practice\") aspects were important to their choice of career. Despite the heavy workload job satisfaction, but not salary satisfaction, was generally high. Participants rated the following general conditions and content of VT as important: \"structured rotations\", \"rotations in hospitals\", \"management skills\", \"working in a local care setting and in a multidisciplinary team\" (all&gt;88%). These results provide clues to improving VT in General Practice with respect to organisation and content including the consideration of gender-related living conditions. Furthermore, improvement and further development of VT programmes should ideally be part of an area-wide, interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach.

The results of a systematic search for national and international quality indicators relevant to the outpatient care sector in Germany provided the basis for the indicator selection process. Outpatient care doctors rated the relevance and feasibility of the indicators according to the RAND\/UCLA method. In a further step the indicators were tested in medical practices, focussing on data availability and accessibility. As a result, we established a set of 48 reliable, structurally developed and patient-oriented quality indicators which can be used for quality improvement in the outpatient care setting, both by specialists and general practitioners. The project provides important information with regard to the future development and use of quality indicators. Depending on the potential fields of application, the development of new indicators as well as a corresponding IT infrastructure is of high priority. Possible unintended effects of indicators will have to be considered. ","1033":"Certifications for quality management systems or disease-specific certifications have become increasingly popular in the German healthcare system. For chronic or rare diseases, however, patient safety and a patient-centred healthcare management have high priority. These aspects are often not adequately accounted for by the usual certification models. The BQS Institute for Quality and Patient Safety has developed a certification for the Deutsche Myasthenie Gesellschaft (DMG), a patients' self-help organisation. Standards for the certification were drafted by medical experts on the basis of guidelines and the scientific literature and were implemented into applicable criteria by the BQS Institute. Special emphasis was placed on translating patients' needs into the criteria catalogue. The certificate \"Integrierte Myasthenie-Zentren der DMG\" [Integrated Myasthenia Centres of the DMG] is based on an all-day audit and includes a peer review. The active involvement of patients in the audit teams and in the certification board ensures that patient-relevant aspects are consistently taken into consideration besides medical criteria and quality management requirements. Notwithstanding the high medical quality in the two hospitals participating in the pilot phase, additional potential for improvement could be identified during the audits. Certifications issued under the responsibility of patient organisations meet the need for specific quality improvement instruments for chronic and rare diseases. Acceptance of those certifications is enhanced by peer reviewing during the audits. From the patients' viewpoint all important aspects were incorporated into the certification concept. ","1034":"This paper introduces the QUALIFY instrument as an indicator assessment method used to select quality indicators suitable for public disclosure in Germany. Fifty-five hospital quality indicators previously approved in routine use were systematically tested for suitability in public disclosure. A multi-disciplinary expert team including patient representatives used the QUALIFY instrument to assess the methodological quality of these indicators in detailed respect to their purpose. The team applied 14 of the 20 QUALIFY criteria to each indicator, the minimum acceptance level for public reporting was determined in advance. Thirty one indicators from eleven clinical conditions fulfilled all fourteen methodological criteria required for national reporting. They include eleven outcome and twenty process indicators. QUALIFY proved to be a useful tool for selecting quality indicators suitable for public disclosure and thus contributes substantially to proper information on German hospital quality. It ensures high transparency in a very sensitive context to all stakeholders. ","1035":"Quality indicators are used world-wide to monitor the quality of health care. For these indicators to be effective they also have to meet certain quality criteria. The QUALIFY tool is used for assessing the quality criteria themselves against a scientific background. The present paper evaluates the QUALIFY tool and provides an indication of its further development. The evaluation of the QUALIFY tool was carried out using structured group interviews. Participants of the first focus group were involved in both the development of the tool and in its implementation. The second focus group exclusively consisted of QUALIFY users. There was no essential difference in the rating between the two focus groups. Up till now, QUALIFY has been used for the designation of quality indicators for the German Quality Record for Hospitals, for a pre-selection of indicators for the National Disease Management Guidelines, and for a pharmaceutical drug safety project of the Coalition for Patient Safety. Its wider distribution is hampered by the fact that the actual QUALIFY tool is far too complex and requires a lot of resources. Nevertheless, its cost-effectiveness was rated 'adequate' because the application of inappropriate quality indicators can be very expensive. Our ambition should be to define QUALIFY subsystems of various complexity for different purposes and to enforce anchoring of the tool at an international level. QUALIFY, and thus the assessment of quality indicators, has entered virgin territory. Since quality assessment will be gaining relevance the further evaluation and development of these tools is warranted. In this context group interviews could provide an applicable approach to evaluating acceptance and implementation problems.","1036":"Together with an expert committee a structured approach to determining quality indicators for National Disease Management Guidelines has been developed. The key steps of this approach include: introducing guideline authors to the methodology at an early stage of the process of guideline development, pre-selecting recommendations of the guideline which are potentially measurable by means of quality indicators, assessing the potentially measurable quality indicators in written form using five criteria (including their importance for the health care system and clarity of definitions) and approving them in a formal consensus process. For lack of a database these quality indicators must be regarded as preliminary. For the National Disease Management Guideline \"Chronic Heart Failure\" nine rate-based indicators have been chosen. The indicators correspond to important strong recommendations (grade of recommendation: A) from the fields of diagnosis (two), general therapeutic strategy (two), specific treatment (three), clinical monitoring (one) and co-ordination of care (one). In a second step, the quality indicators have to be validated within a pilot project. The determination and assessment of the potential quality indicators have revealed room for improvement of guideline development. In particular, there is a need for more health care data and for specification of recommendations.","1037":"In December 2009, the first version of the German Disease Management Guideline (DM-CPG) for chronic heart failure was completed, including a set of proposed quality indicators for heart failure. This article explores whether proposed indicators can be derived from data collected routinely in general practices. For this purpose, previous experiences and data from the research project CONTENT (CONTinuous morbidity registration Epidemiologic NeTwork) conducted under guidance of the Department of General Medicine and Health Services Research at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, were applied. The availability of numerators and denominators needed for calculating the four quality indicators for diagnosis and pharmacotherapy proposed in the DM-CPG was checked within so-called \"routine data\" from the existing dataset of the CONTENT project. Within the given context, routine data are defined as data that are periodically transmitted from health care providers to cost units within the health care system. A thorough assessment has revealed that within the given context only one indicator could be deduced from routine data collection. This was the indicator measuring the proportion of patients receiving beta receptor antagonists, compared to all patients with heart failure NYHA class II to IV. Indeed, this single indicator will only be computable if the NYHA grade of heart failure severity and the presence or absence of contraindications to beta receptor antagonist therapy are routinely collected and the data merged into a central database. Against the background of these results it is obvious that a fully developed, transsectoral concept for data collection and data transfer needs to be implemented.","1038":"The publication of two German systems of quality indicators for ambulatory care (AQUIK and QISA) in 2009 stimulated a discussion in German general practice about how to appropriately measure the quality of care in general practice \/ family medicine. The basic properties and requirements of quality indicators (QIs) in the international literature are discussed in terms of their ability to measure the specific processes of care in general practice. In the second part of the article the QISA system is presented as an example of a methodologically sound development of QIs for ambulatory care for use in both small practices and practice networks. In addition, the context of application and usage of QIs in primary care and the quality control they may provide are discussed. We conclude that important methodological problems have yet to be solved, particularly with measuring 'horizontal' dimensions of quality in primary care (such as comprehensiveness, co-ordination and person-centredness), but that the use of QIs may increase the visibility of general practice in Germany.","1039":"Quality indicators (QIs) are used in many areas of health care in order to measure, compare, and improve quality.

It spans from the first application of a new substance or device in humans to the main proofs of its efficacy and safety. Economically speaking, it absorbs almost half of the total expenditures for the research and development of a new drug and represents a significant factor in the labour market for researchers and study personnel. Also, through participation in clinical trials, patients gain early access to new treatment methods, while on the other hand they are placed at higher risk for undesired side effects. Politics have taken significant steps to strengthen clinical research, but the pharmaceutical industry continues to complain about competitive disadvantages. Despite internationally recognised and, to a large extent, legally codified guidelines there are still significant national differences in implementation.

This article summarises a report to the Office of Technology Assessment at the German Bundestag and points out the need for action for transferring individualised medicine from research to clinical application: significant incentives are required in order to prove the clinical validity of newly identified biomarkers of complex diseases. Sustainable business models for the joint development of new applications by research institutions, biotechnology companies, pharmaceuticals and medical devices companies are required. Instruments for transferring knowledge from bench to bedside (translational research) and the existing regulatory framework should be further developed in order to strike an appropriate balance between incentives for accelerating the transfer of innovative technology to the health care sector while, at the same time, ensuring patient safety, high quality and clinical utility.","1046":"Management science defines user-generated innovations as open innovation and lead user innovation. The medical technology industry finds user-generated innovations profitable and even indispensable. Innovative medical doctors as lead users need medical technology innovations in order to improve patient care. Their motivation to innovate is mostly intrinsic. But innovations may also involve extrinsic motivators such as gain in reputation or monetary incentives. Medical doctors' innovative activities often take place in hospitals and are thus embedded into the hospital's organisational setting. Hospitals find it difficult to gain short-term profits from in-house generated innovations and sometimes hesitate to support them. Strategic investment in medical doctors' innovative activities may be profitable for hospitals in the long run if innovations provide first-mover competitive advantages. Industry co-operations with innovative medical doctors offer chances but also bear potential risks. Innovative ideas generated by expert users may result in even higher complexity of medical devices; this could cause mistakes when applied by less specialised users and thus affect patient safety. Innovations that yield benefits for patients, medical doctors, hospitals and the medical technology industry can be advanced by offering adequate support for knowledge transfer and co-operation models.","1047":"The steady progress of microelectronics, communications and information technology will enable the realisation of the vision for \"ubiquitous computing\" where the Internet extends into the real world embracing everyday objects. The necessary technical basis is already in place. Due to their diminishing size, constantly falling price and declining energy consumption, processors, communications modules and sensors are being increasingly integrated into everyday objects today. This development is opening up huge opportunities for both the economy and individuals. In the present paper we discuss possible applications, but also technical, social and economic barriers to a wide-spread use of ubiquitous computing in the health care sector.","1048":"From an innovation systems perspective the performance of the German medical devices industry, future challenges and barriers to innovation are assessed. Current performance indicators (e.g., R&amp;D intensity, export growth rates) paint a favourable picture. Nonetheless, a number of innovation barriers are identified: in particular, insufficient network integration of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and ineffective policy coordination. Finally, recommendations addressing identified future challenges and innovation barriers are developed.","1049":"Innovation in health care is a complex process taking place within a network of different stakeholders. From their specific perspective they need to continuously assess the technology under consideration to make the necessary decisions about the development and adoption of the technology. This is supported by HTA, but mainly with regard to reimbursement. Other important decisions are far less likely to be underpinned with evidence. The availability of data for both the decision criteria and the structures of decision-making processes have a role in this context. In the present contribution, we discuss the role of HTA in the innovation process. Amendments to assessment criteria, in particular from the perspective of patients, health care professionals, producers and macro-economics, are proposed to improve the basis for decisions of all relevant stakeholder groups.","1050":"","1051":"","1052":"The International Maturity Matrix has been developed with the aim to provide a European instrument for a facilitated self-assessment of primary care organisations. It covers seven dimensions; their implementation is evaluated by the whole practice team on six theoretically-founded levels of organisational development. The present paper will report the results of the German pilot study with 22 participating primary care practices. The purpose of the study was to test the feasibility of self-assessment with the International Maturity Matrix which, in addition to the practice team's self-assessment, also contains the development of options for improvement on the basis of benchmarking the practice's individual achievements with the results of the other participating practices. To summarise, the survey shows positive results for the participating practices; in two meetings, the time-saving process allows for sharing the different perspectives of the practice team members, identifying relevant strengths and weaknesses and developing ideas for improvement motivated by the benchmarking. These results can be interpreted as first promising indications of the high feasibility of the self-assessment process with the International Maturity Matrix. First applications of the International Maturity Matrix in different medical disciplines have been started.","1053":"Hardly any academic research has been conducted on physician rating sites (PRS) with regard to their medical and ethical implications. In the public media, however, representatives of health care providers and payers have been involved in a controversial debate on the, at least, possible implications and practical consequences resulting from PRS. The present article provides a conclusive explanation of why PRS can take on a significant role in future health care. Furthermore, using a framework of ethical principles, ethical and medical implications that can be related to PRS are systematically presented. Considering the so far rapid spread of Web 2.0 services, it seems plausible to assume that PRS will become a highly used source of information on selecting a physician. There are good reasons to believe that PRS may have a positive impact on health outcomes of physician-seekers as well as on the promotion of health literacy and equality of opportunity. However, considering the lack of evidence for these assumptions, the possibility of an opposite development should not be ruled out. The potential of damage for physician-seekers, for example, through misinformation, and for evaluated doctors, for example, caused by defamation, requires adequate prevention. On the other hand, preventive measures should not restrict the attempts at optimising transparency of medical practice too strongly. Further specification of the ethical principles outlined in the present article will significantly influence the upcoming decisions on the development and regulation (certification) of PRS. This raises complex normative considerations, the legitimacy of which can be enhanced by, among other things, adequate transparency, justification, participation and conflict of interest policies. ","1054":"There is some evidence that involving patients in the development of health information can increase the relevance and understandability of this information. The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) publishes easy-to-understand and freely accessible evidence-based health information on its bilingual website gesundheitsinformation.de \/ informedhealthonline.org. The aim of the Institute is to determine the information needs of the general public and patients, and to take those needs into account when producing its health information. One way in which this is done is by carrying out online surveys before the information is produced, asking the users of the website about their level of interest in various aspects of a topic. In this article we present two examples of such surveys - on the topics of \"endometriosis\" and \"skin cancer screening and prevention\" - as well as the results of these surveys and how the results influenced the contents of the health information produced. Our experience with a total of seven surveys suggests that online surveys can be a helpful additional tool to identify information gaps and determine information needs and areas of special interest. In addition, surveys provide a way to interact with the users of the website. In their current form, however, online surveys also have methodological limitations that need to be considered when developing these surveys and interpreting their results.","1055":"The Chronic Care Model (CCM) is a framework for the structured care of patients with chronic conditions. It requires access of both physicians and patients to scientific evidence in order to facilitate shared treatment decision-making on the basis of the patient's individual needs and the best available external evidence. The aim of this study was to find out whether general practitioners (GP) actually make use of evidence-based information and guidelines and whether and how they communicate this information to their patients. We interviewed 14 general practitioners and conducted a content analysis. The majority of these GPs take a sceptical view towards evidence-based guidelines. Their main point of criticism is that guidelines disregard the individual patient's reality and life style. Instead, GPs emphasize the relevance of their own knowledge of the personal and medical history of and the continual care for their patients. Since GPs themselves often do not accept guidelines, they seldom impart their content to their patients. According to the GPs' experience there are contradictions between guideline-conformant therapy and individual treatment. The integrative character of evidence-based medicine is not recognized. The reason is that evidence-based medicine is equated with guidelines and trial results by the majority of the GPs interviewed. To facilitate guideline implementation in everyday practice GPs need to be provided with adequate access to scientific evidence and an understanding of the intentions of guidelines. If the doctors themselves do not accept guidelines, they will not share them with their patients. It must be made clear that guidelines are not intended as normative demands for a specific therapy for every patient, but are rather meant to assist the physician with his struggle for the best therapy for individual patients.","1056":"Section 35b of the German Code of Social Law Book V (SGB V) mentions \"expert approved international standards of evidence-based medicine\" (EbM). An idea which started as a reform movement in and for clinical medicine more than twenty years ago is here, from a socio-legal perspective, being utilised as a normative concept in terms of a standard-creating methodology, which is meant to form the basis for the \"methods and criteria\" of comparative benefit\/risk assessment of medical drugs mentioned in the respective law. The present paper places the standards in a hierarchy between \"description and analysis of benefits\" at the bottom and, at the top, \"fundamental concerns of EbM\". Apart from a variety of standards, we propose seven basic principles and four fundamental concerns of EbM (pursuit of empirical truth, patient welfare, pragmatism, procedural justice). Each of the basic principles, standards, methods and criteria can be taken to substantiate the respective superordinate category (basic concerns etc.). The position and role of the standards will be explained using the example \"search for and selection of literature\".","1057":"Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is closely linked to clinical epidemiology. EBM itself, however, is not a science but a framework bridging science and the world of decision-making. To this purpose EBM makes use of clinical studies which have direct implications for patient care but constitute only a small part of the total medical research enterprise. EBM is, more or less, invariant to philosophical schools. Rather, it is a pragmatic approach to filter scientific results through commonly accepted validity criteria. There is no objective theoretical justification for doing so. EBM has been successful because clinicians and stakeholders with opposing interests use the results of clinical studies as an arbiter for decision-making at all levels. The development of therapeutic, but also of information and communication technologies has contributed to the rise of EBM. Finally, variations in care being demonstrated in multiple studies have changed the relationship between health professionals and society. EBM can be understood as a reaction to this change in the societal environment.","1058":"In Germany, recommendations regarding health care (system) decisions dealing with medical services which are to be included in (or excluded from) the SHI benefit catalogue clearly relate to the principles of evidence-based health care which can be defined as \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best external, scientific evidence in making decisions on a system level\". If benefit is understood as a \"causally related positive effect\" of a medical intervention, we may directly assume that only those trials which allow for causal conclusions are to be included in benefit assessments and regarded as part of the basis of the decision-making process. In general, these will be randomised controlled studies. There may be exceptions to this rule, especially when we are dealing with particularly severe disease calling for immediate action. In these cases, an adequate justification is required which must not be based solely on the absence of conclusive or more conclusive trials. Evidence-based benefit assessment comparing two or more treatment options has both qualitative (bias potential) and quantitative aspects. The quantitative aspect can be subdivided into \"precision of the estimate\" and \"magnitude of the observed difference\". On the analogy of statistical hypotheses testing the following can be postulated: if in a comparative trial the (observed) difference is sufficiently large in relation to the bias potential, it will not rest on potentially confounding mechanisms (alone), but at least on the effect of the applied intervention as well. The analogy is limited, though, as the bias potential cannot precisely be quantified. Applying the methods of evidence-based health care requires the right balance between (appropriate) scepticism on the one side and an (inappropriately) over-critical attitude on the other.","1059":"Shared decision-making (SDM) has the potential to overcome outdated social role models in the health care system. The concept, however, adheres to archaic epistemological assumptions as can be inferred from the rudimentary stage of the measurement methods used and from the information monopoly that the physician still holds in this concept. Advantages of an up-to-date model of knowledge for understanding and operationalising SDM are outlined. To this purpose, essential definitions of the concept are reflected in terms of epistemology. Accordingly, information emerges through a process of social construction. Likewise, interpersonal relations do not represent a static condition; rather, they develop anew with each interaction. Therefore, constructs suitable to focus on dyadic interaction processes can be used as indicators of sharing in SDM. Theories and methods of the interpersonal paradigm are advocated.","1060":"The debate about adequate research methods for obtaining relevant results in clinical medicine and health care does not take place in a vacuum. In the present paper the longstanding debate about the epistemological underpinnings and methodological perspectives of qualitative and quantitative research methods in the social sciences is outlined and fructified for evidence-based medicine and health care. By using examples from research practice we will demonstrate that both the utilisation of qualitative methods and the use of a \"mixed methods\" design may contribute to the current methodological debate and improve research practice in evidence-based health care.","1061":"The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence. Strange enough, scientific discussion focuses on external evidence from systematic research, but neglects its counterpart, i.e., individual clinical expertise. Apart from a lack of appropriate intellectual tools for approaching the latter, this might be due to the mutual concealment of thought and action, of sensor and motor activity (Viktor von Weizsaecker's principle of the revolving door). Behind this, and incommensurably different from each other, lie the world of physics and the world of biology with an ego animal, that is, the dilemma of the self-conscious subject in a world of objects. When practicing medicine, this dilemma of self-reference is being resolved but only through a holistic approach combining rational and external evidence with biographical, spiritual, emotional and pre-rational elements represented in the physician's individual clinical expertise.","1062":"Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) is the ongoing self-reflection of an individualised approach to medicine in terms of a science that originates from and focuses on clinical decision-making (pragmatic science=\"Handlungswissenschaft\"). EbM is particularly suitable for self-reflecting individualised medicine on the basis of decision-oriented pragmatic science because it consistently distinguishes between external evidence (i.e., other subjects' experience gained through \"qualitative\" and \"quantitative\" scientific methods) and internal evidence, i.e., the individual user's, or patient's, own experience manifesting and developing in the individual contact between therapist and patient. Therefore, internal evidence is completely different from the individual clinical experience, expertise, and conviction which therapists contribute to the encounter with clients. A deeper understanding of internal evidence as a result of this encounter has emerged only in the past 15 years. However, it is an integral part of the logic of evidence-based professional decision-making. Scientifically justified beneficial and effective treatment in the individual case cannot be deduced from external evidence but can only be gathered from internal evidence for which the best external evidence available has been utilised. In the past 15 years nursing science has not only carved out the decision-oriented scientific core of evidence-based practice but has also tried to increase the validity of studies on external evidence by employing a combination of 'qualitative' social science studies and clinical epidemiological methods.","1063":"","1064":"The discussion about the advantages of evidence-based guidelines in daily dental practice is a matter of current interest. In this report three high-quality S3 level pilot guidelines which have been developed in dental medicine were evaluated under practice conditions. Quality circles in the city of Hamburg readily accepted to join this survey. By means of a questionnaire before and after a 4-month field test in dental practices the participants of quality circles were interviewed about their attitude towards guidelines and to the application of the guidelines. In addition, the experience gained with the application of the guidelines was incorporated into a group discussion with moderators of quality circles. The inclusion of quantitative and qualitative methods enabled a recording of the complete range of differentiated opinions concerning the application of guidelines. The results show that the concerns expressed by participants can be reduced by integrating guidelines in their everyday clinical practice. A strength and weakness analysis demonstrates that the quality circle moderators' attitudes towards approved guidelines range from rather positive to ambivalent. Field testing by quality circles proves to be a sound method for evaluating the acceptance of guidelines in daily practice.","1065":"","1066":"","1067":"The internet offers doctors plenty of high-value information for medical questions. However, several barriers impair the preoccupation with this information, most notably lack of time, far too much offered information and missing confidence in the reliability of the offers. The following article points out how the Agency for Quality in Medicine developed the Internet portal \"German Medical eLibrary\" (Arztbibliothek) in which information is transparently pre-selected and grouped in a structured way as well as easy to find with the help of a simple, user-friendly search function. Evidence-based high-quality information is available in an easy, quick and well-directed manner. Thus the \"German Medical eLibrary\" facilitates knowledge management as a cornerstone of high-quality medical care.","1068":null,"1069":null,"1070":null,"1071":"Within the context of the development of evidence-based oncology guidelines, the Agency for Quality in Medicine undertook evidence reviews for diagnostic imaging procedures. Systematic searches retrieved no randomised controlled trials, but only cohort studies and case series of mostly moderate quality. The identified studies provided only a restricted basis for the guideline recommendations as their validity was limited and only outcomes of diagnostic accuracy were examined. However, decision criteria for recommending diagnostic strategies significantly comprise judgements about required resources and availability of diagnostic imaging procedures. These criteria as well as patient out-comes were mostly implicit and should be explicated in future. In order to increase the relevance of evidence reviews for oncological diagnosis, high quality studies which examine resources and patient-centred outcomes for diagnostic strategies are required.","1072":"Gender and diversity have a strong impact on health and illness as evidenced by sex and gender differences in the onset and progression of diseases as well as in diagnosis, therapy, and therapeutic outcome. The number of sex\/gender-specific studies in medicine has increased steadily in recent years, indicating sex (biological) and gender (social) differences in numerous diseases. Despite this evidence, however, sex\/gender differences are rarely considered in medical practice or in health systems, suggesting a delay in transferring such research into evidence-based medical treatment. Similarly, quality improvement guidelines in medical care do not systematically integrate the sex\/gender perspective. Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to enumerate the necessary components of a guideline development and evaluation process that systematically integrates sex\/gender differences in addition to providing a sex\/gender-based methodological approach. The latter is illustrated by a pilot study in which four international guidelines on depression were selected. The sex\/gender appropriateness of these guidelines was analysed using two methods: first, sex\/gender-relevant words were counted; and second, relevant sex\/gender differences were summarised based on a systematic literature review and then compared with the information given in the guidelines. The findings of the pilot study revealed that although strong evidence exists on sex\/gender differences in depression, such research was rarely implemented in the guidelines. Given the scope and potential of guidelines to improve the quality of health care, it is essential that they consider the crucial role of sex\/gender differences. To date, sex\/gender differences have been insufficiently addressed in guideline development and evaluation when they should be an integral component of the process.","1073":"For seven years the German National Disease Management Guidelines Programme (NDMG Programme) has been supported by its funding bodies: the German Medical Association, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, and the Association of Scientific Medical Societies. The objectives of the NDMG Programme are to develop and to implement comprehensive national clinical guidelines for the management of selected illnesses. Key points of NDMG methodology are the strict adherence to the principles of evidence-based medicine as well as the avoidance of contradictory recommendations by means of neutrally facilitated consensus rounds. Despite the standardised NDMG methodology each guideline has individual structural and content features that make it unique. For example, the complex illness type 2 diabetes is presented in topic- and problem-oriented NDMG modules. For unipolar depression, the NDMG was simultaneously developed as a S3 guideline. Furthermore each NDMG group was faced with its own content-based challenges. For instance, in the case of the NDMG Low-back Pain the guideline group intensely and controversially discussed the definition of unspecific low-back pain. The NDMG Asthma does not solely address adults, but also children and adolescents, and the NDMG Heart Failure for the first time covers other health care relevant aspects such as multimorbidity and psychosocial factors in detail. The following article aims to deliver insight into the diversity of the development of National Disease Management Guidelines and to demonstrate the complexity of guideline development.","1074":"After seven years the National Disease Management Guidelines Programme (German DM-CPG Programme) that was established under the auspices of the German Medical Association, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians and the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany has been widely accepted by both health care professionals and patients. DM-CPGs are available as tools for knowledge and quality management for widespread chronic diseases showing need for improvement in treatment pathways and coordination between health care providers. The main objective of the German DM-CPG Programme is to establish consensus among the medical professions on evidence-based key recommendations covering all sectors of health care provision and facilitating the coordination of care for the individual patient over time and across interfaces. German DM-CPGs provide a conceptual basis for disease management and integrative care aiming at the implementation of best practice recommendations for prevention, acute care, rehabilitation, chronic care and management aspects for high priority health care topics. Thus, representatives of all disciplines, professions and patients concerned with the topic of an individual German DM-CPG are involved in the development process. The methodology of guideline development is in accordance with international standards. However, the improvement of strategies for effective implementation and continuous update remain challenging. Future work will also focus on content-related aspects such as co-morbidity, gender and migration background.","1075":"","1076":"","1077":"","1078":"The appraisal of new diagnostics or therapies performed by the Federal Joint Committee in Germany often reveals a dramatic lack of evidence of the benefit of such medical treatments. For example, the evaluation of low dose rate brachytherapy used to treat men with local prostate cancer demonstrates that controlled trials still need to be conducted to ensure evidence-based patient care. In Germany, legal incentives are missing to regularly assess the benefits of medical devices and operative techniques. For the sake of patient safety there is an urgent need for a change in law in order to initiate a systematic evaluation of these new medical technologies before their widespread use.","1079":"Judging the effectiveness of external quality assurance programmes by comparing current performance with unadjusted regional or national crude averages is misleading because the influence of the actual size of the populations under consideration as well as the variance of performance between hospitals is underestimated. Not only do these artefacts lead to a general overestimation of changes in regional averages. They also may lead to a ranking confounded by regional size. An assessment at unit level circumvents these difficulties. The differential grading of degree of departure of a unit's performance from national targets available from funnel plots allows, in addition, for the discrimination between effects due to the monitoring institution and achievements attributable to the hospital under surveillance. A central role is played by the scoring system adopted for evaluating incremental changes of performance indicator values in successive years. The following proposal is intended to both assist the assessment of effectiveness of quality assurance programmes and identify areas requiring urgent improvement. Bavarian quality assurance data (BAQ 1995) are used to illustrate the method.","1080":null,"1081":"","1082":"Six Sigma is an innovative management- approach to reach practicable zero- defect quality in medical service processes. The Six Sigma principle utilizes strategies, which are based on quantitative measurements and which seek to optimize processes, limit deviations or dispersion from the target process. Hence, Six Sigma aims to eliminate errors or quality problems of all kinds. A pilot project to optimize the preparation for neurosurgery could now show that the Six Sigma method enhanced patient safety in medical care, while at the same time disturbances in the hospital processes and failure costs could be avoided. All six defined safety relevant quality indicators were significantly improved by changes in the workflow by using a standardized process- and patient- oriented approach. Certain defined quality standards such as a 100% complete surgical preparation at start of surgery and the required initial contact of the surgeon with the patient\/ surgical record on the eve of surgery could be fulfilled within the range of practical zero- defect quality. Likewise, the degree of completion of the surgical record by 4 p.m. on the eve of surgery and their quality could be improved by a factor of 170 and 16, respectively, at sigma values of 4.43 and 4.38. The other two safety quality indicators \"non-communicated changes in the OR- schedule\" and the \"completeness of the OR- schedule by 12:30 a.m. on the day before surgery\" also show an impressive improvement by a factor of 2.8 and 7.7, respectively, corresponding with sigma values of 3.34 and 3.51. The results of this pilot project demonstrate that the Six Sigma method is eminently suitable for improving quality of medical processes. In our experience this methodology is suitable, even for complex clinical processes with a variety of stakeholders. In particular, in processes in which patient safety plays a key role, the objective of achieving a zero- defect quality is reasonable and should definitely be aspirated.","1083":"","1084":"Apart from a multidimensional quality definition and the understanding of quality as a company-wide challenge, a third essential element of quality management is prevention. Thus, company quality policy has to be prevention-oriented and requires both customer and process orientation as important prerequisites. Process orientation especially focuses on the critical analyses of work flows as a condition for identifying early intervention options which, in turn, may influence the result. Developing a business organisation requires the definition of criteria for space planning, room assignment and room integration in consideration of both medical and economic aspects and the architectural concept. Specific experiences will be demonstrated as a case study using the example of a new building in the midst of the Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital in Dresden, the Diagnostic Centre for Internal Medicine and Neurology. The hospital management placed an order to develop a sustainable as well as feasible business organisation for all the different departments. The idea was to create a medical centre where maximum use was made of all planned spaces and resources on the basis of target processes which had to be defined and agreed upon with all the persons concerned. In a next step all the personal, space and operational resources required were assigned. The success of management in all industries, including the health care sector, crucially depends on the translation of ideas into practice, among them the critical factor of sustainability. In this context, the support by the management as a role model, a formal frame for the respective project group and the definition of controlling via defined indicators have special importance. The example of the Diagnostic Centre for Internal Medicine and Neurology demonstrates that the result of changed processes may release a cultural change where competition can be replaced by cooperation step by step.","1085":"Top-down process optimisation, i.e. the adjustment of hospital treatment and care processes in terms of a best possible resource utilisation straight from the desk of the managing director, is doomed to fail. Instead, the employees' \"creative potential\" should be used in order to implement change not over the heads of, but hand in hand with staff members, which sets high demands on managing directors and requires a new understanding and concept of leadership. In order to promote more staff independence, management by objectives plays an essential role.","1086":"The concept of general process orientation as an instrument of organisation development is the core principle of quality management philosophy, i.e. the learning organisation. Accordingly, prestigious quality awards and certification systems focus on process configuration and continual improvement. In German health care organisations, particularly in hospitals, this general process orientation has not been widely implemented yet - despite enormous change dynamics and the requirements of both quality and economic efficiency of health care processes. But based on a consistent process architecture that considers key processes as well as management and support processes, the strategy of excellent health service provision including quality, safety and transparency can be realised in daily operative work. The core elements of quality (e.g., evidence-based medicine), patient safety and risk management, environmental management, health and safety at work can be embedded in daily health care processes as an integrated management system (the \"all in one system\" principle). Sustainable advantages and benefits for patients, staff, and the organisation will result: stable, high-quality, efficient, and indicator-based health care processes. Hospitals with their broad variety of complex health care procedures should now exploit the full potential of total process orientation.","1087":"Today process optimisation is an indispensable approach to mastering the current challenges of modern health care management. The objective is to design business processes free of defects and free of waste as well as their monitoring and controlling with meaningful test statistics. Based on the identification of essential key performance indicators, key success factors and value cash generators two basic approaches to process optimisation, which are well-established and widely used in the industry, are now being implemented in the health care sector as well: Lean Management and Six Sigma.","1088":"","1089":"","1090":"Coping with limited resources is one of the key challenges in patient care. Rationalisation reserves have already been exhausted in many areas. Particularly in the health sector, the question needs to be clarified as to how the limited resources can be allocated fairly from both the ethical and legal point of view. The medical community proposes that health care services be prioritised. In other words, priorities are defined in order to increase fair distribution in the health sector. In this context prioritisation does not mean the exclusion of medically necessary services, but grading the granting of services in accordance with the principles of priority. The advantages of prioritisation lie primarily in the transparency of the procedure and in the chance of achieving consistent distribution decisions. Protection of the patient-physician relationship as a confidential relation would remain unaffected since prioritisation is not the same thing as rationing.","1091":"","1092":"Incidents with a large number of diseased and injured people (i.e., mass casualty incidents) require special medical logistics. Due to the disproportion between the unknown number of patients and the limited number of medical personnel and equipment, there is an urgent need to use available resources to their full extent so that the largest possible number of patients can receive the emergency care they need. This, however, requires a medical categorisation of patients based on the indication and urgency of their medical treatment. This process of prioritising is the primary task of the senior emergency physician. The result of this so-called triage is being documented on triage tags.","1093":"","1094":"In transplantation medicine there is neither fair organ allocation per se, nor a specific organ distribution required by the German law. The constitution primarily provides a restrictive framework, and it is the parliamentary legislator's task to fill in the details. Following the principle of division of labour, the involvement of medicine in solution finding is permitted and deemed to be justified. Nevertheless, these basic decisions should have been made by the German legislator in much more detail.","1095":"Solid organ transplantation is one the most successful medical innovations of the 20th century. Due to an increasing number of patients on the waiting lists for transplantation in the context of persisting organ shortage the aim of optimal allocation policy is the best possible balance between medical urgency and postoperative outcome. Because of scientific evolution and increasing waiting list mortality the allocation system for liver transplantation was altered in December 2006. As intended, the preferential treatment of sicker patients resulted in a reduced waiting list mortality. On the other hand, an unintentional decrease in postoperative survival was observed. This obvious imbalance between medical urgency and postoperative outcome has led to the current allocation problem. Several scientific approaches for optimising allocation policy will be presented and discussed in this paper. Finally, continuous review and adaptation will be a persisting challenge for people working in the field of solid organ transplantation.","1096":"After the introduction of diagnosis related groups (DRGs) in Germany for the remuneration of hospitals economic aspects have become increasingly daunting. While hospitals were used to being paid on a daily basis they are now provided with a fixed sum for a given diagnosis. This means that hospitals are under pressure to review their processes and to treat more patients during shorter hospital stays. In order to contain costs the quality of treatment and care has to be improved since poor quality, i.e. the development of complications, would cause higher costs. This has led to 25% of the 2,200 hospitals in Germany running deficits, which is reflected in a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as in a lack of adequately advanced medical equipment and suitable hospital buildings. These facts pose an enormous challenge to the hospital management: they have to bridge the gap between economic requirements and the patients' needs. This is why hospital management needs to develop visions and strategies as well as a tight financial and medical controlling and steering system to improve their financial and medical outcomes.","1097":"The responsibility of the state for ensuring the provision of hospital care services to its citizens derives from the welfare state principle laid down in Sect. 20 para. 1 GG (Grundgesetz, i.e., the German constitutional law). The state fulfils this responsibility by means of planning and funding regulations in the Hospital Funding Act (KHG), the Hospital Remuneration Act (KHEntG), the National Ordinance on Hospital Rates (BPflV), the Hospital Laws of the German federal states and other supplementary legislation. The funding of hospitals is based on a dual funding system, meaning that hospital investment costs generally need to be borne by the German federal states as required, while operating costs will have to be funded through the remuneration for hospital treatments. Because of the tight budget situation of the German federal states a considerable backlog of investment has built up. After a transition period (between 2005 and 2009) operating costs are now funded on the basis of the so-called DRG system (DRG=Diagnosis Related Groups)--irrespective of the actual costs incurred by each individual hospital, which has led to a commodification of hospital care services. Whether this commodification avoids bottlenecks in the provision of health services to hospital patients or creates additional bottlenecks, is a controversial issue.","1098":"In the public health care sector physicians may apply only those methods that are generally accepted. The result is a lack of confidence. Medical science becomes reduced to natural science. Practical experience will be eliminated.","1099":"The present paper deals with the ambulatory care setting where regulation based on economic reasoning has led to rationing. Today medical practice can best be characterised by terms like health budget, medication budget, financial volume of total remuneration for medical services, medical fee complexes, and budgeting of diagnostic and therapeutic areas. Economic reasoning has thus found a foothold in ambulatory medicine. Separate services are absorbed by medical fee complexes: the financial volume of total remuneration for health care services leads to a limitation in the medical services provided to patients, and the medication budget helps curtailing therapeutic freedom. A two-class medicine seems to be emerging as shown by special service offerings (i.e., health care services not covered by statutory health insurance); conflicts will arise between doctor and patient.","1100":"","1101":"Scarcity in the German health care system leads to an implicit allocation of means and also implies a risk of liability for physicians. Prioritisation can contribute to the solution of these problems and ascertain an equitable allocation of scarce resources. However, the criteria that will be applied to establish a ranking order will have to be thoroughly considered, particularly in light of the constitutional law, and there is still a multitude of unresolved questions seeking an answer. This requires an open political discourse about society and health care.","1102":"","1103":"Triage (\"sorting\") will only be necessary in the setting of mass casualties and lack of sufficient paramedical and medical specialists as well as equipment. Triage means that the victims will be divided into four categories denoting urgency of treatment and chance of survival. The most experienced medical doctor or officer is responsible for the triage.","1104":"The treatment of patients in mass casualties generally requires a high level of organisational understanding. The delivery of medical care to one patient should not cause delays in helping all other patients. Therefore triage and a prioritisation of treatment and transport is necessary. Military triage has developed over centuries and forms the basis of civilian triage. The differences between both systems include established military triage performed by paramedics and care under fire. These characteristics have led to the development of separate algorithms.","1105":"","1106":"","1107":"In ambulatory care diagnostic and therapeutic procedures may only be applied if they have a positive recommendation from the Federal Joint Committee. Both physicians and patients are bound by this rule. Limitations of ambulatory care cannot be attributed to the existing rules applicable to the funding for ambulatory care services; they only affect the pecuniary interests of Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) accredited physicians which are beyond the control of the insured. The prescription of medical drugs, supplements and health aids is subject to stronger restrictions, which can pose a dilemma for physicians: on the one hand, they are allowed by law to prescribe even the most costly medical drugs to every insured patient, if required, but on the other hand, they will have to prepare themselves for drug recourse claims. This situation can be relieved by appropriately handling reviews of so-called average prescription limits. Physicians should support the exertion of indirect influence over their prescription behaviour through measures like substitution (\"aut idem\" principle) and discount contracts and also, they should actively commit themselves to this approach when facing their patients. Otherwise financial viability, especially with respect to the supply with medical drugs, of the statutory health insurance system will be at risk.","1108":"Due to the ageing of our society and the enduring progress of medicine it will no longer be possible to provide universal access to everything health care providers could potentially offer. Therefore, we need a debate on legitimate health care claims and fair distribution of medical resources under conditions of scarcity - hence on matters of social justice. This paper will look at some general ethical aspects and some specific proposals for fair criteria of rationing in health care.","1109":"Complex developments are increasing the gap between the financial feasibility of the German health care system and new possibilities in diagnosis and therapy. Influencing factors, inter alia, include rapid medical progress, demographic and epidemiological trends and changing perceptions of health and illness. This raises the question of how a just allocation of scarce resources can be developed and implemented. Concepts such as rationalisation, rationing and prioritisation are being intensively discussed. In this paper definitions of and differentiations between these terms will be presented, which are often missing from the current debate. Furthermore, the need for action implying ethical and structural-political challenges will be outlined. In this regard, a sustainable process should focus on transparency, responsibility and public involvement.","1110":"Since 2007, all German hospitals are obliged to publish 27 quality indicators in their biannual \"structured quality reports\" as defined by the BQS (= Federal Office for Quality Assurance). Thus, hospitals are required to establish a timely controlling system for process and outcome quality that goes beyond the mere control of documentation rates. The University Medical Center Ulm has implemented an IT solution that allows for the continuous and timely evaluation of the quality assurance reports of the different modules. By developing an internal dialogue with colleagues of all specialties it was possible to optimise adherence to documentation and process standards, and to react promptly to deviations in outcome quality. This improved the quality of documentation and therefore the validity of quality assurance data. It even led to the identification of a programme error in the export file of one of the external modules. By cross-checking quality assurance data and accounting data according to Sect. 21 KHEntG (= regulation for DRG case invoicing), it was possible to detect down-coding in several cases and therefore increase revenue by correcting the accounting record. In current times it should be mandatory for hospitals to establish an internal IT supported medical\/quantitative control system of BQS data records for external quality assurance. Quality and quantity of documentation forms the basis for the so-called internal dialogue (standardised review process of substandard quality assurance results), and they allow to identify the potentials for improvement in the quality of care for our patients.","1111":"With the aim to study the level of evidence on which coverage decisions of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) were made and how the G-BA deals with missing or insufficient evidence, we analysed the final reports of coverage decisions after benefit assessments (outpatient care) between 1.1.1998 and 31.10.2008. A total of 36 decisions were analysed. 12 technologies were adopted for provision in outpatient care, 22 were excluded and two were suspended of assessment procedure until new evidence is provided. The G-BA decided in each case on the basis of the best available evidence. In the majority of negative decisions (16 of 22) no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available, the decision was therefore made on the basis of non-randomised studies. Even five of 12 positive decisions lacked evidence based on RCTs. In these cases the G-BA acknowledged that the evaluation of efficacy in randomised clinical trials was, due to the disease characteristic, not feasible. The G-BA uses different ways to deal with missing or insufficient evidence. It should be noted that the concept of missing evidence in the public is often diffuse and should be better defined.","1112":"Publication bias describes the distortion of data in scientific journals resulting from the fact that studies with significant and positive results are more likely to be published than studies with negative or insignificant results. In studies funded by pharmaceutical companies publication bias has a considerable impact. It has been shown that more than half of the studies that are conducted as part of the drug approval process will remain unpublished. In addition, multiple publications of the same results, the selective use of data and the withholding of data relating to adverse drug reactions were also demonstrated. It is unclear, however, whether the probability of publication of studies funded by pharmaceutical companies is different from those not funded by pharmaceutical companies. Also, data vary as to the correlation between the type of funding of clinical studies and the length of time to publication. For the benefit of patients, everyone involved in clinical studies ought to take responsibility and facilitate access to all data.","1113":"Publication bias in meta-analysis occurs if the probability of publication depends on the estimated treatment effect and the precision\/size of a study. In this article we describe the funnel plot as a graphical method to evaluate the presence of publication bias. Furthermore, tests of publication bias based on funnel plots are explained, and methods are presented that estimate treatment effects adjusted for publication bias. The article closes with a critical discussion of the various statistical methods.","1114":"Publication bias, i.e., the publication of trial results depending on the nature and direction of results, is a significant problem in healthcare, as it leads to a biased view of the treatment options available. Furthermore, publication bias hampers the adequate planning and conduct of future clinical trials. One proposal to reduce publication bias is the registration of trials and trial results. Whereas the registration of trials at inception is largely accepted and partly established, the registration of trial results is still being intensively discussed. Open issues particularly refer to legal obligations in the registration of trial results as well as to the nature and extent of their presentation. Whilst in the United States a comprehensive legal regulation on results registration has already been implemented, compulsory registration in Europe is still at a preliminary stage. The present paper describes the status quo of results registries, discusses registration requirements, and outlines the need to develop methods for the handling of results registries.","1115":"The identification of unpublished data is an important component in the assessment of drugs for a systematic review. This is why searching in clinical trials registries is indispensable. However, this type of search is not regularly conducted. At present, clinical trials registries that also contain results data are still seldom-used sources, which may be due to a number of reasons. On the one hand, there are a large number of clinical trials registries whose quality is difficult to judge sometimes; on the other hand, their heterogeneity and partly inadequate functionality such as, for example, the lack of export options, complicate searches of these sources. The present paper addresses the features of searches in clinical trials registries and describes the approach taken by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Initially, we describe the various types of registries and offer assistance with the selection of the clinical trials registries to be searched. A further focus lies on the description of the search procedure itself, as well as on the selection of the relevant registry entries and the documentation of this process in order to support those planning their own search in clinical trials registries.","1116":"Publication bias and scientific fraud are major threats to valid guidelines, especially guideline recommendations. Both topics have so far not been investigated systematically. It is assumed that guideline authors underestimate the potential influences on the validity of their recommendations. On the basis of questions and the example of depression guidelines the potential influence of publication bias will be outlined and discussed. Formal consensus processes which are used to phrase and grade recommendations might protect guideline recommendations against the influence of publication bias and might thereby imply one major difference to systematic reviews. Based on the examples of Werner Bezwoda and Scott S. Reuben, who fabricated studies in breast cancer and analgesia, it can be estimated that scientific fraud has no or only minimal effect on the recommendations given in clinical guidelines. Either the fraudulent work is in line with other (true) studies, which consequently leads only to an overestimation of the quantity of evidence in the guideline. Or the faked study is the only piece of evidence available, which guideline authors would then regard as an insufficient basis for a clinical recommendation. Although publication bias and scientific fraud had no influence on the example guidelines, guideline authors should be aware of this possibility and control this problem by systematically reviewing the evidence, critically appraising primary studies, and formulating prudent recommendations.","1117":"","1118":"The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the most important decision-making body within the self-governing German healthcare system. The G-BA assessment of medical treatments and procedures follows a standardised procedure that rests on evidence-based medicine. As a rule, randomised controlled trials with patient-relevant endpoints (in particular mortality, morbidity, quality of life) are required for benefit assessments. Under certain conditions adequate studies with valid surrogate endpoints or composite endpoints may be taken into account in exceptional cases.","1119":"Patient participation, which has been established since 2004, has brought more attention to patients' concerns in healthcare. More and more endpoints in clinical trials are defined with respect to their relevance for patients. But this development has still been found wanting. For important drugs, no evidence-based benefit has been demonstrated in the benefit assessment, which also has become possible since 2004. Furthermore, this assessment has arrived too late for patients who have been medicated for a long time. Healthcare policies, applicants and stakeholders have contributed a lot to the patients' scepticism towards benefit assessments, though, in principle, patients are interested in high evidence levels and reasonable pricing. New drugs are often licensed under less ambitious conditions. Whether this is in the patients' interest needs to be put up for a large-scale, and societal, discussion.","1120":"Patient-reported outcomes are increasingly considered as endpoints for clinical studies. Instruments for measuring patient-reported outcomes range from simple assessments of discrete symptoms or signs to complex measures addressing multidimensional constructs such as health-related quality of life. While generic measures are designed to be applicable across a wide range of clinical conditions, disease- or population-specific instruments address health problems which are relevant for a particular disease or target group. Patient-reported outcomes can provide supplementary information from the patient's perspective when clinical endpoints are the primary focus of a study. As predictors and mediators of clinical outcomes they may contribute to the understanding of how patients benefit from treatment. They are included as primary endpoints when treatment effects comprise subjective phenomena such as pain, fatigue or psychological well-being. Current research activities in the field of patient-reported outcomes include the development of new (disease-specific) instruments, head-to-head comparisons of psychometric properties of measures, analysis of the context-dependence of results, and application of patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice.","1121":"Numerous generic and disease-specific endpoints for clinical trials are available and in use. Standardised quality criteria for the assessment of endpoints have been developed which form the basis of many current reviews. In many clinical fields these endpoints were shown to pose major problems, though. These include a lack of standardisation and poor methodological quality, problems related to the applicability of endpoints and their limited appropriateness for specific research questions. In the meantime standardisation and harmonisation ecommendations have been developed (e.g., EMEA\/FDA, RECIST, IMMPACT and OMERACT). In future, the selection of endpoints for clinical trials will have to be based on the specific research question (disease, hypothesis, intervention), taking account of recommendations, standardisations as well as harmonisations.","1122":"The question of whether differences between therapeutic alternatives are judged as clinically relevant is of major importance. However, formally based solutions are rare and of limited practical use. The present state of the debate is presented. It is argued that the basis of the relevance debate is a value-based multi-dimensional decision as to which therapeutic group differences will be judged clinically relevant.","1123":"The use of a combined (composite) endpoint as a primary outcome in clinical studies offers many advantages, e.g., increased statistical efficiency, smaller sample sizes, shorter study completion times, and the possibility for a summary measure of different treatment effects. However, basic clinical and statistical requirements need to be respected in order to obtain valid results and to avoid difficulties in their interpretation later. Each component of a combined endpoint must be clinically meaningful. Patients must be followed up until death or to the planned end of the trial; these rules also apply to premature treatment withdrawal or after occurrence of the first pre-defined component event. All components of the composite endpoint need to be analysed separately in order to find out how they contribute to the overall result and to avoid the masking of negative effects on one or more components. Difficulties in interpretation may arise when the results for single components of the combined endpoint head in opposite directions, and when \"hard\" clinical outcomes are combined with \"soft\" endpoints, particularly if the latter occur much more frequently but are of minor clinical relevance.","1124":"Ideally clinicians should base their treatment decision on results from randomised controlled trials which include patient-important outcomes, such as quality of life, prevented disease events or death. Conducting such trials often involves large samples sizes and extended follow-up periods. Therefore, researchers have aimed to conduct trials with surrogate endpoints by substituting patient-important outcomes in order to reduce sample size and observation time. Surrogate endpoints are outcomes that substitute for direct measures of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. In many countries drugs are approved based on data from surrogate endpoint trials. Recently, a controversy has evolved on the reliability of results generated from surrogate endpoint trials driven by unanticipated side effects or severe toxicity leading to the withdrawal of drugs that were solely approved based on evidence from surrogate endpoint trials. We present some recent examples and criteria how clinicians can critically evaluate the validity of claims by experts or the pharmaceutical industry in regard to the expected patients' benefit from drugs approved by results from surrogate endpoint trials.","1125":"","1126":"Comparative economic evaluations are concerned with the relative efficiency of alternative uses for scarce resources. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is grounded in economic welfare theory and attempts to identify alternatives with a net social benefit, measuring the created value in terms of individual willingness to pay (WTP). In applied health economics, cost-effectiveness evaluation (CEA) is more widely used than CBA, adopting a modified efficiency criterion, minimization of incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (\"cost-utility analysis,\" CUA). CBA has been greeted with skepticism in the health policy field, primarily owing to resistance to a monetary measure of benefit and owing to concerns that WTP may be unduly influenced by ability to pay. The move to CUA, however, has not been without problems. The framework deviates from economic theory in important aspects and rests on a set of highly restrictive assumptions, some of which must be considered as empirically falsified. Results of CUAs do not seem to be aligned with well-documented social preferences and the needs of healthcare policy makers acting on behalf of society. By implication, there is reason to assume that a context-independent value of a QALY does not exist, with potentially fatal consequences for any attempt to interpret CUAs in a normative way. Policy makers seem well advised to retain a pragmatic attitude towards the results of CUAs, while health economists should pay more attention to the further development of promising alternative evaluation paradigms as opposed to the application of algorithms grounded in poor theory.","1127":"IQWiG's General Methods catalogue has raised a controversial debate among experts, and one of the major issues is the catalogue's authors' decision to exclusively use indication-specific output measures for benefit assessments. In contrast, numerous critics of this approach demand that benefit be measured using a uniform scale which is valid and interpretable for all indications, such as the \"quality-adjusted life-year\" (QALY). The present article will take a critical look at the arguments put forward by IQWiG and point out the disadvantages of purely indication-specific benefit assessments. We will then explore the legal possibilities of benefit assessments independent of the type of disease, and make some suggestions for the future approach to healthcare evaluation in Germany.","1128":"IQWiG, Germany's equivalent to Britain's NICE, has adopted an unorthodox method of cost-effectiveness analysis. The method does not use QALYs. Its main point is that it tries to avoid comparative judgement on the relative value of treatment effects in different medical areas. The present contribution assesses the controversy that has arisen over IQWiG's methods by discussing whether a. comparative judgements of the value of health will at least implicitly be made anyway as soon as IQWiG makes reimbursement recommendations in more than one medical area, and whether b. the well-known fairness objections to QALY maximization can plausibly be dealt with by equity weighting or, generally, by moving on to \"societal value\" maximization which tries to include fairness values besides efficiency. The conclusion is that the answer is no in both cases.","1129":"The title of this paper is not, as it might suggest at first glance, just a rhetorical question. It is, rather, a serious one, which I will examine in five steps: (1) No matter how affluent a society may be, it will never manage to overcome what I call \"the anthropological law of scarcity\". (2) Because of this anthropological law societies have to decide how to respond to it. This implies questions about the where and what of rationing--one possible candidate is the healthcare system. (3) A reasonable way of dealing with these issues, I propose, is based on the moral attitude of prudence. (4) Wherever the threat of unbound covetousness (pleonexia) arises prudence stimulates counter-forces. (5) Finally, I consider the question of how a society should deal with scarcity from the normative perspective of justice.","1130":"On various occasions in clinical research we may encounter the statement that \"the probability of a research claim being true\" is of major interest. The authors then claim that this probability is low and draw further conclusions about the limitations of clinical research in general. Such claims are unfounded. However, it may be useful to assess the additional information that may be gained from new trial results and use them to decide whether and in which situations clinical trials actually need to be conducted in order to answer particular clinical research questions.","1131":"In the face of tight public budgets more and more studies are being funded by the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time responsibility for conducting company-funded trials is increasingly being shifted to contract research organisations. Pharmaceutical manufacturers sponsor trials that primarily pursue company interests. The dominance of company-funded research does not only have a bearing on the choice of study priorities, though. Company sponsorship also has an influence on the results of trials. Company-funded trials are four times more likely to find evidence in favour of the trial drug than studies funded by other sponsors. There are several contributory factors, from study design (design bias) to data manipulation. And non-publication (publication bias) can distort knowledge. As a result, it is largely impossible to reliably assess the benefit and harm of medical drugs on the basis of published trials. This will have repercussions for the reliability of meta-analyses, guidelines and patient information leaflets. One consequence may be treatment errors.","1132":"A number of publications on publication bias or selected outcomes reporting have led critics to doubt that the pharmaceutical industry is able to remain objective in its research activities. This paper discusses the prerequisites for objective research and to what extent these are met by research projects conducted by the pharmaceutical industry. Problems with meeting objectivity criteria on the part of the pharmaceutical industry will be highlighted, distinguishing between industrial research activities themselves (i.e., studies) and the publication of data resulting from such research. The aim of the discussion is to illustrate how and which research-guiding conditions can ensure that sponsors indeed meet the criteria for objective research.","1133":"The existence of value judgements in a science of professional action like medicine is quite uncontroversial. Anything but uncontroversial, though, is the existence of value judgements in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) processes. While value judgements are largely accepted in prioritizing HTA topics the awareness of value judgements in the analysis of evidence in the context of HTA is only rudimentary. The present contribution argues that value judgements do occur in the analysis of evidence in the context of HTA and that they are of practical significance since they have an impact on the final results in a practice relevant manner. I will present value judgements in the determination of threshold values required for establishing the level of significance or for deding on the inclusion of trials. Taking examples from the research on and the discussion of HTA methods I will then show how the blind spot concerning value judgements is currently dealt with and how an appropriate way of dealing with it in the future might look like.","1134":"The assessment of the potential benefit of medical drugs (and other types of medical interventions) is based on the current best available evidence from experimental and observational trials. Benefit assessment implies one fundamental assumption: the results published in the international literature actually have practical relevance for the future treatment of individual patients. This assumption is, in turn, based on a number of pre-conditions, six of which will be identified and discussed: an established nosology, the priority given to treatment implications, valid and reliable comparative measurement of outcomes, aggregate statistics for different types of outcome variables, and irrelevance of the psychosocial context of health care. Once more it will be demonstrated that the fundamental basis of any medical benefit assessment is a weak one in various parts and needs continuous theoretical reflection.","1135":"","1136":"In Germany a few specialised palliative care teams (PCTs) enable paediatric palliative care patients to stay at home in the final stage of their life. During this stage patients often experience episodes of acute symptoms requiring rapid medical intervention. In this case care-giving relatives can call emergency medical care services. The present investigation aims to show the meaning of emergency medical care services in treating paediatric palliative care patients in a home-care setting. Moreover, mental strain of emergency medical staff in paediatric medical emergencies and end-of-life care will be discussed. In a multi-centre retrospective study we analyse all paediatric emergency medical care cases of four emergency sites over a 24-month period. In particular, all cases of acute palliative care in terminal paediatric cancer patients up to the age of 14 were evaluated. In the defined period we analysed 738 paediatric emergency documents (5.7% of all emergency cases); of these we identified two (0.3%) emergency calls by paediatric palliative care patients or their caregiving relatives. In both cases there was no specialised outpatient PCT involved in the treatment of the patients or the assistance to their caregiving relatives. Our data demonstrate that emergency medical treatment is less frequently provided to paediatric than to adult palliative care patients. However, these paediatric patients also need help that is based on the principles of palliative care like adult patients do. In the context of quality standard optimisation, specialised PCTs should get more involved in paediatric palliative home and pre-hospital care, even in cases of medical emergencies in these patients. After end-of-life decisions relating to paediatric patients, psychological support to the emergency medical team seems to be both helpful and reasonable. ","1137":"Cytology-based screening for cervical cancer has been criticised because of its high percentage of false-negative results. Considering HPV testing as an integral part of the screening process has been discussed as a way to address this issue in Germany. The aim of our study was to review trials comparing HPV testing with cytology in cervical cancer screening. Based on a systematic literature review, 14 studies with 85,820 women could be included. Generally HPV testing was more sensitive, but less specific than cytology. Based on the pooled data, sensitivity and specificity for HPV testing were 91% and 90%, respectively, whereas sensitivity and specificity for cytology amounted to 66% and 96%, respectively. Based on these results, including HPV testing in primary cervical cancer screening might lead to a reduction of false-negative results. Due the lower specificity false-positive test results would increase though.","1138":"General practices also require more and more evidence-based decision-making. But knowledge is increasing rapidly and guidelines produced to help doctors to find answers to their problems seem to exclude a number of problems that are important in general practices. Here we report on the introduction and activities of an EbM Service provided by general practitioners to answer questions of their colleagues. The aim is to give EBM answers, but also, in doing so, to teach the application of EBM and--in the long run--to enable the users themselves to find EBM answers. The provision of EBM answers is fairly pragmatic: after using the service the inquiring physician should be better informed, i.e., have more evidence-based information, but sometimes this need not be the \"ultimate truth\" that experts might deliver. EBM answers are published both on the homepage of the College of General Practitioners and in their journal. It took quite a while to implement this service, and the number of those using it has increased slowly but constantly.","1139":"","1140":"Although plenty of statutory requirements, concepts and tools to promote the quality of health care exist, Germany's health care system seems far from being pervaded by a vivid quality culture. In order to show ways how to succeed in developing and implementing such a quality culture in the German health care system, the Bertelsmann foundation conducted a delphi survey of seven quality of care experts and an online survey of 239 stakeholders, encompassing health care providers and representatives of the self administration of the health care system, politicians, the health care industry, and patient representatives. Based on the delphi results 31 theses within 12 subject areas have been formulated and assessed, which describe building blocks to put quality in the center of Germany's health care system. After dichotomizing the answers (school grades 1-6 into 1-2 = best, and 3-6 = worse) &gt; 66% of the stakeholders rated 28 of 31 theses with grades 1-2. The ten most accepted theses received grades 1 or 2 from more than 85% of the stakeholders. Following the main results of the surveys, establishing a vivid quality culture requires outcome oriented quality goals and quality indicators to be defined, quality management to be embedded better into the education of all health care providers, and quality promotion to be introduced which is build on quality incentives and objective quality transparency. Since experts and stakeholders agree to such a high degree in the steps necessary to establish a quality culture in the German health care system, the realization of these steps seems to be possible.","1141":"Chronic heart failure is one of the most important cardiovascular diseases. Patients with this common disease are primarily treated by general practitioners (GPs). Previous research showed deficits in drug therapy. Ambulatory care in Germany is changing; new structures for medical care (Medical Care Centres) have been registered since 2003. It was of interest to evaluate medical procedures of these new structures and compare them to the one applied in traditional single practices. Aim of this study was to investigate compliance with guidelines regarding drug therapy of chronic heart failure performed by GPs working in two different outpatient settings. A prospective observational study was conducted. Over a period of eight months medical pharmacotherapy in individual practices and a Medical Care Centre (MCC) was compared. To ensure comparability in both settings GPs treating randomly selected patients were asked to recruit patients with heart failure, encode their NYHA class and conduct echocardiography to verify the diagnosis. 241 heart failure patients were enrolled by general practitioners (137 in individual practices and 104 in MCCs). GPs working in MCCs performed more diagnostic echocardiographies than physicians in individual practices. ACE inhibitors\/sartans, beta blockers and diuretics were prescribed less often than recommended in the guideline. The hypothesis of insufficient adherence to guideline recommendations for pharmacotherapy of ambulatory heart failure patients was confirmed. However, the prescribing behaviour for pharmacotherapy of heart failure among the physicians in Berlin was better than among their European colleagues. There were only minor differences in drug prescription between the 11 GPs from single practices and the 12 GPs working in an MCC. ","1142":"Analysing the quality of integrated healthcare, as a new form of care, measurement of patient satisfaction becomes more and more important. However, there is a lack of standardised instruments of questionnaires for integrated network structures that could be used to measure and compare the satisfaction of participating insured persons. This gap should be closed by the study at hand, by arranging an exemplary measurement of satisfaction in the integrated care project OPTI-MuM. Because of the specific offers provided by the OPTI-MuM project, an existing questionnaire from the ambulatory sector had to be modified. A random sample of 1,000 insured individuals that have been enrolled in the project until now was interviewed. The response rate was 46.6%. In general, the survey respondents were very much satisfied with the provided integrated healthcare services. 75% of the respondents were 'very satisfied' or 'rather satisfied' with the range of services offered within the OPTI-MuM project. In addition, about 80% of the respondents would again participate in the project and recommend it. But the survey also demonstrated that there is potential for improving the provision of information. The study shows that the OPTI-MuM project is effective regarding the satisfaction of the participants. The questionnaire should be used for measuring satisfaction in comparable healthcare projects in order to enable a better classification of the results of this study.","1143":"","1144":"Since April 1, 2007 pharmacists in Germany are obligated by law to dispense products from particular manufacturers with whom the health insurance funds have entered into discount agreements. Only by ticking the relevant tick box (\"Aut Idem\") on the prescription form can the prescriber insist on a drug of a specific company. A standardized questionnaire was designed and piloted in a small group and adapted accordingly. By means of this questionnaire patients were asked about their experiences with drug discount contracts. 226 patients participated in this study. 75% of the participants had knowledge of these contracts. 64.6% of the patients were concerned about substitute drugs. 32.1% took no longer the drugs regularly, and 21.2% indicated that they were confused by the changed packaging of medicinal drugs. 79.5% of the participants wanted to keep their old, familiar drug, and 53.7% of the participants insisted on receiving their familiar medication against the prescriber's prescription. The survey shows that patients feel irritated by their medication and that medication errors occur. In addition, GPs and pharmacists must inform patients about the discount contracts (substitution). Many participants wanted to keep or insist on their familiar medication and compliance and physician-patient-relationship could be compromised. This intervention by the health insurance funds interferes with the medical treatment of patients. Such far-reaching changes in medication might lead to life-threatening situations. ","1145":"Several national and international studies on the care of asthma patients delivered by community pharmacists have shown that pharmacist interventions help to improve patient parameters like, for example, the patient's quality of life, self-management skills, compliance and optimization of drug therapy. These results have led to pharmacists' involvement in national asthma guidelines, e.g., in the UK and the United States. Pharmacists have now also been involved in the revised version of the German national guidelines on asthma. In this paper we will present the existing evidence in Germany on how pharmacists add value to the care of asthma patients. Furthermore, the involvement of pharmacists in the German National Disease Management Guideline for Asthma will be discussed.","1146":"Evaluation represents a substantial component of the concept of Disease Management Programmes. This and the fact that the implementation of Disease Management Programmes constitutes a major change in the German healthcare system require that the criteria established by the German Federal Social Insurance Authority (Bundesversicherungsamt) be carefully reviewed. The present paper focuses on the evaluation method and the economic data. The pre-\/-post study design used in the evaluation is known to be vulnerable to threats to internal validity. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether these threats to internal validity which have been known theoretically are confirmed by the results of the final reports. A review of the final reports of health insurance companies like the AOK, Barmer and a group of the BKK in Westfalen-Lippe shows that this question can be answered in the affirmative. The pre-\/-post design without control groups is unable to recognize the failure or success of the Disease Management concept. The reasons include a high drop-out rate as well as the lack of consideration of the characteristics of chronic disease. Hence the evaluation method has failed to prove the quality of Disease Management Programmes in Germany. This is why consistent further development is needed.","1147":"","1148":"","1149":"Quality circles (QC) are viewed as one of the most important tools of quality improvement and continuing education in ambulatory care. Yet, little is known about the quality of QC work. From 1995 to 2007, an external assessment of QC work took place at four regional Associations of Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) Physicians. After each meeting, QC leaders completed questionnaires. This basic documentation focused on important features of QC work--continuity, topics, methods, results and satisfaction. 28,800 meetings in 1,640 quality circles were documented, and 27,255 documents from 1,241 groups analysed. Continuity was high over long periods, and medical topics were dealt with in more than 80% of the time. The use of appropriate methods, however, have room for improvement. Participants were very satisfied. For the first time the quality of QC structures, processes and results was assessed in Germany using a broad dataset. The working principles of QC appear to be well-established. Using the basic documentation practical recommendations are made to improve the quality of QC. ","1150":"The concept of the \"ZQ In-house Seminars\" provided by external trainers\/experts pursues the specific aim to enable all healthcare staff members of hospital departments to analyse statistical data--especially from external quality measurements--and to initiate in-hospital measures of quality improvement based on structured team work. The results of an evaluation in Lower Saxony for the period between 2004 and 2008 demonstrate a sustainable increase in outcome quality of care and a strengthening of team and process orientation in clinical care.","1151":"The treatment of complex disease patterns demands knowledge, and hence the collaboration of many medical disciplines. Interdisciplinary approaches to treatment are thus superior to multidisciplinary ones in terms of quality and costs. To make use of those benefits, interdisciplinary centres have emerged at many hospitals. Our review of the literature has sought to answer two questions: 1) Is there any evidence for the relationship 'creation of a centre = creation of interdisciplinarity'? 2) How can interdisciplinarity be fostered in centres? Medical and economic publications were identified via key terms in PubMed, Web of Knowledge and WISO. Using their references, further publications were researched. Contributions that complied with predefined criteria were included. For 75 of the 78 publications interdisciplinarity is the means to achieve a centre's objectives in quality and cost. Almost all the positive results achieved in centres, e.g., an increase in number of cases, are attributed to the seemingly established interdisciplinarity, without any evidence to substantiate this interrelation (question 1). The recommendations for creating the requested lively interdisciplinarity are insufficient, since technical arrangements dominate and the importance of social and therewith behavioural aspects is often forgotten--the findings of the respective literature remain unappreciated (question 2). Moreover, pertinent research as well as qualitative longitudinal research designs activating the knowledge of physicians, social scientists and economists should be used to investigate the interdisciplinarity sought for in centres.","1152":"Co-ordination in terms of synergetic co-operation of the two professional groups is highly demanding and requires creative measures. Co-operation between doctors and nurses can be improved by an integrative organisational concept agreed-upon by the parties involved. The core elements of this KoPM model include jointly practised patient orientation, a process organisation approach to health care provision, successful communication as well as a process support framework. Another task that needs to be performed will be to refine this approach by improving communication efficiency, by employing qualification processes and by evaluating cooperation projects.","1153":"Taking three practical examples from a university hospital the present article describes how quality can be improved by linking deployment of qualification-oriented staff with team-oriented cooperation, especially with regard to the professional groups of physicians and nurses. In the first example, a cross-professional work group defined tasks which--in a legally acceptable manner--allow selected activities to be transferred from physicians to nurses, improving the work processes of all persons concerned. Work and duty profiles, training and modified work processes were created and implemented according to the PDCA circle-based process. The first evaluation took place after nine months using interviews, questionnaires (patients, physicians, and nurses) as well as CIRS. In the second example, emphasis was placed on offers of supplementary services for private patients resulting in a lightening of the workload on the nursing staff. These supplementary services are intended to enhance the wellbeing of the patients. Special external-service staff provide high standard hotel services. These services consistently receive high ratings from the patients. The methods used for introduction and evaluation are analogous to those used in the first example. The third example is concerned with the extension of nursing care and patient empowerment beyond the boundaries of ward and hospital. The guidelines were the implementation of the national expert standard for discharge management according to the DNQP. The methods of introduction were analogous to those used in example 1. For the evaluation interviews were conducted with all participating groups. In all examples actual quantitative measures (key ratios) are not yet available; however, the data collected from the interviews and questionnaires of all the participants are promising.","1154":"Providing health care requires the integrative co-operation of physicians, nurses and other professionals in the health care sector. The success of such interprofessional teamwork does not only rely on the team members' task knowledge, but also on their teamwork-related knowledge, their skills and attitudes. In this paper a theoretical framework for team effectiveness is developed and used to identify factors improving team success. Within this context interprofessional team composition is perceived as a characteristic of team diversity, which needs to be perceived as a chance for better patient care in order to be used effectively.","1155":"Effective teamwork is crucial for ensuring the provision of safe high quality care. Teams whose members collaborate through questioning, reflecting on and reviewing their work, offering each other feedback and where reporting is encouraged are more likely to promote a safe environment of care. This paper describes a multidisciplinary development programme intended to increase team effectiveness. The teams that took part developed their ability to work collaboratively together with levels of open dialogue, critical reflection and direct feedback increasing. The paper goes on to discuss aspects of the programme which were helpful in enabling these positive changes and concludes with a number of recommendations for those commissioning and facilitating team development initiatives. These include: the need for people from different disciplines and different levels within the hierarchy to spend time reviewing their work together, the need to explicitly address issues of power and authority, the usefulness taking an action orientated approach and requiring participants to work on real issues together, the importance of providing sufficient time and resource to support people to work with the challenges associated with implementing change and addressing team dynamics, The importance of skilled facilitation.","1156":null,"1157":"","1158":"The public's perception of doctors is the subject of continuous change. The physician's image loses its uniformity to the extent that increasing knowledge and technical ability generate a multitude of different specialisations. A high complexity arises from the accompanying necessary regulations with the professional image considerably varying across perspectives. Due to this complexity the independence of the self-employed physician becomes increasingly obscure. At the same time, though, the image of the doctor as \"an appropriate attendant\" has not lost any of its radiance.","1159":"What is the relation between additional healthcare services, marketing and competition among office-based physicians? The best and truly effective marketing strategy is a satisfied patient recommending his doctor's services to others. Hence, good marketing starts with a convincing service concept, not just with advertising. More and more frequently patients ask for supplementary health service offerings. Additional services tailored to individual practices--e.g., in the field of nutrition, sports, fitness, wellness, aesthetics--meet the patients' demands, but at the same time they provide a competitive advantage over the ordinary medical practice. And what is more, these additional healthcare services have a nice side effect: they earn an additional income which is not unwelcome in times of decreasing revenues from the public healthcare system. The much sought-after potential for additional services and income can be achieved by offering commercial medical services, e.g., the sale of healthcare products. The coexistence of the doctor's commercial and non-commercial medical services is admissible as long as certain rules of professional conduct and tax laws are followed. ","1160":"Various healthcare reforms have spurred the idea of competition among physicians. As physicians compete for a limited pool of patients advertising has become commonplace. No longer considered an unethical practice, the legal aspects of physician advertising have transformed over the years. The present article describes current laws and statutes regulating physician advertising in Germany. Especially any advertisement likely to mislead or deceive because of a failure to disclose material facts is prohibited. Important cases of German jurisdiction concerning physician advertising are given.","1161":"Competition and cooperation are contradictory aspects of economic systems; in the healthcare system they also govern the process of creation and distribution of value. Both are needed to reach higher levels of efficiency and innovation. Regarding competition as a universal remedy which only has to be applied in higher doses in order to cure the multiple illnesses of the healthcare sector is a single-sided view and does not match economic reality. As politics introduce more and more elements of competition the question arises as to what degree hospitals are in competition with private practice physicians. In contrast to statements of lobbyists we came to the conclusion that the degree of competition between hospitals and physicians is negligible when compared to the vast potential of cooperation.","1162":"Our healthcare service system which used to have a strictly sectoral structure experiences a radical change. Office-based specialists cannot any longer rely on the fact that they have exclusive responsibility for the ambulatory treatment of patients. In the past years the legislator has melted the strict separation between hospital treatment and ambulatory care. Finally the establishment of medical service centres (MVZ) and the opening of hospitals for highly specialized services and the treatment of special diseases relating to the Fifth Book of Social Code, Para. 116 b, (SGB V) have dramatically changed the position of office-based specialists. The legislative measures aim at eliminating the so-called \"double specialist track2 (doppelte Facharztschiene)\". So far no satisfying solution to this new conflict has been found.","1163":"Before December 31, 2002 hospital options were limited to demand-oriented individual authorisations and ambulatory emergency care, so there was no competition against private practice physicians. For the first time the Healthcare Reform Act (GSG) provided hospitals with the opportunity to offer ambulatory services from January 1, 2003 in individual areas of care (pre- and post inpatient treatments according to Sect. 116a SGB and ambulatory surgical interventions according to Sect. 115b SGB V). Following numerous reform acts the spectrum for hospitals has been considerably extended today, particularly by establishing medical service centres (MVZ) and the authorisation to provide certain ambulatory services according to Sect. 116b para. 2-6 SGB V after special approval. Conversely, an amendment of Sect. 20 para. 2 Aerzte-ZV from January 1, 2007 enabled office-based physicians to be employed in a hospital and provide inpatient care so that today we may speak--at least in important sections--of a competitive situation on different levels.","1164":"On the basis of a model calculation the Federal Statistical Office--despite a decreasing overall population--predicts a rise in the number of patients requiring inpatient healthcare of approximately 12% because of the ageing of our society. The comparative publication of data about the range, the character, the quality and the success of medical treatment allows more transparency of the medical achievements of a hospital, and the patients have learned to expect a high quality of medical treatment and its outcomes. Therefore hospitals have to find ways to present themselves to the patient as a suitable and desirable institution. In the inter-hospital competition for patients an individual hospital can only be successful by recruiting excellent professional (both medical and nursing) staff. Hospitals seeking to secure their existence will have to develop strategies that allow them to succeed in the competition for patients and staff. This includes a verifiably high quality of their medical treatment while striving for an efficient way of managing the costs. At the same time a realistic approach to the recruitment and motivation of the medical staff is essential, which is especially true of physicians.","1165":"Competition is tough and the cost pressure enormous. Vivantes will actively meet the challenges of the market to gain a strong market position. All measures to improve competitiveness will be taken on the basis of the communal mandate to provide prioritised medical care; quality standards need to be maintained. In times of tight budgets Vivantes uses the limited funds carefully and focuses on using them wherever they will be most beneficial. Vivantes will achieve its ambitious business objectives by concentrating services sensibly, using efficient structures and focussing on interlocking processes.","1166":"Competition between hospitals exists in many different fields. In legal terms this competition is shaped by disputes over the status of \"hospitals forming part of the Hospital Plan\" (Plankrankenhaus). The German Federal Constitutional Court's ruling of January 14, 2004 granted hospital authorities the right of action for unfair competition. According to the Federal Administrative Court's ruling of September 25, 2008, however, third-party protection is limited to cases where the hospital filing the suit has itself unsuccessfully applied for inclusion in the state-level hospitals plan for the market segment served by the accepted hospital. In contrast, action that merely challenges an unfair preference of a competitor will remain inadmissible. Third-party protection between hospitals is also under way in the field of \"Integrated Healthcare\" (Integrierte Versorgung) (Sect. 140a et seqq. Book V of the German Social Security Code-SGB V): in the case of ECJ C-300\/07 on December 16, 2008 (Oymanns\/AOK Rheinland &amp; Hamburg) the Advocate General in his final submissions not only expressed the opinion that the statutory health insurance funds are contract-placing authorities, but also argued that integration contracts are public orders. If the European Court of Justice (ECJ) takes the Advocate General's view, future integration contracts will become subject to the regulations governing public orders and thus also subject to the relevant verification procedure.","1167":"Competition between private health insurers (PKV) and statutory health insurance funds (GKV) in Germany is far from being perfect, but the advantages resulting from the duality between PKV and GKV for the insured outweigh its disadvantages. Germany is the only country in the world where two systems compete for the best health insurance services and offer actual alternatives. They represent two different ways of funding leading into one common healthcare system. The dual structure stabilizes and enhances the medical infrastructure for all insured individuals alike. The rules of competition however can only take effect if the particularities of the two system are maintained and not mixed up.","1168":"In the wake of the new healthcare legislation the German statutory health insurers--about 200 health plans of statutory health insurances--find themselves in tight competition. Since 2009 the health insurers have obtained their money from a centralised health fund (Gesundheitsfonds). If the financial contributions from this fund fail to cover costs the funds are forced to raise an additional premium from their insured members who, in turn, may immediately switch to another insurance company. By implementing this new system of a Gesundheitsfonds the old risk structure compensation scheme has been redesigned. Now the cost-predicting factors do not only include age and sex, but also additional ones like diagnosis of in- and outpatient care (morbidity factor). This approach to risk compensation is an essential prerequisite for \"solidarity-based\" competition. Sickness funds now concentrate their efforts on care management in order to achieve cost-effectiveness and to ensure quality in healthcare, which is their actual aim. This, however, requires further options of selective contracting with single providers or groups of providers.","1169":"From the patient's perspective there is no competition (at least none that has a positive effect on him)! In Germany a rather good medicine is being increasingly sacrificed on the altar of economics.","1170":"Limitations of competition in our healthcare system follow from both the natural results of competition and the natural requirements for working competition. The legal implications of the limitations of competition in our healthcare system are twofold: they comprise the right and the duty of the government and the legislator to ensure fair and functional regulation.","1171":"In the second half of the 20th century rapid progress in medicine has led to qualitative improvement and quantitative expansion of the range of healthcare services. Premature death can be avoided in many cases--but the price to be paid often is the need for permanent care. This fact has been neglected in both the cost debate and in the efforts to reform the system. Rather, statutory health insurance serves as a second taxation system. As a result of the politically imposed limitation of resources a restriction of services is inevitable. However, this poses an ethical dilemma for the individual physician, as does the call for more economic competition which frequently results in quantity and speed becoming more important than safety. Patients are turned into work-pieces in the value chain of the healthcare industry. The dominance of economics jeopardises patient autonomy and the physician's freedom of decision leading to conflicts between medical liability law and social insurance law. Scarce resources must be geared to patients' healthcare needs. This calls for abandoning the politically driven provision of all-encompassing healthcare through the state, with a national insurance plan and regulated structures for funding healthcare provision that cripple personal initiative and self-responsibility.","1172":"Over the last 20 years strategies introducing regulated competition have gradually been implemented in the corporatistically structured German healthcare system. In particular, this applies to the structure of health insurance organisation where the corporatively organised allocation system has deliberately been transformed to ensure health insurance choice. Accordingly, the laws governing membership, health insurance premiums and health benefits have been adapted and new rules for public finance including a risk structure compensation scheme encompassing the different kinds of health insurances have been established. The options for competition arising in the area of health service provision do not only affect the health insurance companies themselves, but also the relations to the providers of healthcare as well as their relationship with each other. This holds especially true of the role and function of the (regional) physicians' associations. The relation between collective agreements and individual contracts is still unclear. With the further development of strategies introducing regulated competition the possibilities and limitations of competition will have to be explored and many details--such as, for example, the implementation of the responsibility for ensuring the provision of healthcare services--need to be resolved.","1173":"That \"more competition in healthcare primarily produces more needs-based equity, better quality, higher efficiency, reduced costs and less bureaucracy\" is a familiar claim. But is it correct? Three types of competition can be identified within a triangle: (1) competition among third-party-payers for insured individuals\/customers, (2) competition among providers for patients, and (3) competition among third-party payers for contracts with providers--and vice versa. German and international evidence for these three types of competition demonstrates that many expectations--e.g., that patients can be steered based on quality information--are wishful thinking. Instead of market and competition, regulation is needed (e.g., in the form of an effective risk-based allocation mechanism) to ensure high-quality care for those 5% of the population incurring 50% of the healthcare expenditures (i.e., the seriously ill patients), while at the same time competition based on selective contracts does not pay off for the majority of the population due to high transaction costs.","1174":"","1175":"","1176":"","1177":"","1178":"","1179":"Vertical bar charts depicting unit event rates sorted in ascending order enjoy widespread usage in external quality assurance. Unfortunately they suggest a spurious ranking resulting from instability in the percentile distribution chiefly caused by varying denominators. The popular remedy of simply excluding units below a minimum threshold would solve the problem only partially since units with few operations per annum may evade evaluation altogether merely by the grace of their size. Compared with alternative solutions reviewed in this article Spiegelhalter's funnel plots exhibit clear advantages over statistical control charts or Bayesian modelling. A major drawback of control charts at present is that data are still widely transferred on a yearly rather than a quarterly or even monthly basis. The chief disadvantage of Bayesian modelling lies in the difficulty of obtaining consensus on the required prior distributions. Funnel plots on the other hand provide a flexible and sample size dependent uniform approach while at the same time offering an intuitive interpretation of volume effects. The addition of control and warning limits allows for formal assessment of deviations from target values.","1180":"The publication of the IOM report \"To err is human: building a safer health system\" in 1999 put spotlight on the primacy of the principle of primum non nocere and made patient safety a central topic of quality management. A key conclusion of the report was the need for a well-developed safety culture. While concepts of quality management have evolved along the lines of ISO and Total Quality Management over the last decades patient safety still has not got the same amount of attention (PubMed). Evidence from other safety-critical areas but also from the field of medicine itself suggests that an efficient culture of safety is a conditio sine qua non for the sustainable improvement of patient safety. Considering these arguments the present paper aims at emphasizing the importance of an efficient culture of safety for patient safety and quality management in healthcare. In addition, key instruments of safety culture as well as their limitations will be presented.","1181":"Safety climate comprises shared perceptions of safety issues and is a visible feature of a safety culture. Usually self-report questionnaires are used to assess a safety climate. The aim of this project was to develop the first German questionnaire for the assessment of the patient safety climate in general practices. The development of the instrument was based on a US questionnaire. The ambulatory care setting differs considerably between the two countries in terms of organisational and economic issues as well as the number and variety of healthcare professionals. The process of adaptation therefore required the following steps: 1) translation of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, ambulatory version (SAQ-A), 2) interviews with experts on quality improvement in order to evaluate the comprehensiveness and relevance of the SAQ-A in the new context, 3) revision of items, 4) pretesting of the preliminary version on a sample of healthcare professionals from general practices and 5) a final revision. The \"Fragebogen zum Sicherheitsklima in Hausarztpraxen\" (FraSiK) is a questionnaire consisting of 68 items, 36 of which were adapted from the original. Altogether, 32 items, relating to the involvement of patients, communication, education and training, error management and dealing with regulations were added. Substantial changes were made to the original questionnaire and items added in order to obtain an appropriate instrument for the assessment of the content and relevance of patient safety culture in the socio-cultural context of German general practices. ","1182":"Safety culture is one aspect of organisational culture. It is the pattern of shared values, beliefs and attitudes concerning safety present in an organisation. In this article, Edgar Schein's three-layer model is used to demonstrate to what extent a safety culture can be directly and indirectly measured. Several methods for the assessment of safety culture are presented: questionnaires evaluating the safety climate, methods enabling teams to perform self-assessment, interviews, audits, analyses of safety reports and observation. The aim of the assessment is crucial to the choice of the appropriate mode of measurement. In healthcare, the currently most widely used instrument is questionnaires since it is comparatively simple to use and inexpensive and yields rapid results. However, the employment of additional measures (interviews, audits, analyses of safety reports) is more appropriate if the most important aspects of safety culture in a given organisation need to be covered.","1183":"The development of a medical safety culture is spreading beyond the hospital into the ambulatory setting. Patient safety defined as \"absence of unwanted events\" (primum non nocere) can serve as a starting point for the advancement of our ambulatory medical care system. Error analyses conducted in GP and specialist practices will identify gaps and traps in the system and provide ideas for the development and implementation of new safety strategies in ambulatory patient care. In the light of the structures and processes of GP medical care aspects of patient safety will be correlated to the outcome quality and examples will be discussed. Possible strategies for the improvement of patient safety in GP practice will be presented from the perspective of both patient- and practice individuality.","1184":"The contribution is concerned with the correlations between risk information, patient safety, responsibility and liability, in particular in terms of liability law. These correlations have an impact on safety culture in healthcare, which can be evaluated positively if--in addition to good quality of medical care--as many sources of error as possible can be identified, analysed, and minimised or eliminated by corresponding measures (safety or risk management). Liability influences the conduct of individuals and enterprises; safety is (probably) also a function of liability; this should also apply to safety culture. The standard of safety culture does not only depend on individual liability for damages, but first of all on strict enterprise liability (system responsibility) and its preventive effects. Patient safety through quality and risk management is therefore also an organisational programme of considerable relevance in terms of liability law.","1185":"This article tries to review the development of patient safety culture in the German healthcare system over the last decade. Since the use of standardized questionnaires and other instruments to measure safety culture in Germany has only just begun there are no representative and longitudinal data. Therefore a set of indicators and clues is chosen to characterise the safety culture development on the micro-, meso- and macro-level of the healthcare system in four areas. Is patient safety an issue of the healthcare debates and especially of research? Have dedicated structures and processes been implemented to support clinical risk management? What are the objective outcomes of healthcare and treatment in regard to patient safety? In summary, there are a lot of signs that patient safety issues in Germany are gaining more and more importance on all levels of the healthcare system. To date there have been single evidence-based studies only indicating a causal or close temporal relationship between patient safety outcomes and the increasing efforts of hospitals, outpatient and long-term care facilities.","1186":"Safety culture is a multi-dimensional phenomenon. Safety culture of a healthcare organization is high if it has a common stock in knowledge, values and symbols in regard to patients' safety. The article intends to define safety culture in the first step and, in the second step, demonstrate the effects of safety culture. We present the model of safety behaviour and show how safety culture can affect behaviour and produce safe behaviour. In the third step we will look at the causes of safety culture and present the safety-culture-model. The main hypothesis of this model is that the safety culture of a healthcare organization strongly depends on its communication culture and its social capital. Finally, we will investigate how the safety culture of a healthcare organization can be improved. Based on the safety culture model six measures to improve safety culture will be presented.","1187":"","1188":"Industrialized countries are confronting the challenge of providing their population with accessible, high-quality, safe and efficient healthcare. They face the growing challenge of caring for an increasing number of patients suffering from chronic and complex diseases. Chronically ill patients see multiple clinicians at different healthcare sites, which increases the risks of errors and poor coordination. These experiences together with rising healthcare costs force the different healthcare systems in the industrialized countries to introduce and test new ways to offer healthcare while taking into account the entire chain of care. Disease management programmes together with institutions and structures like medical homes which are accessible and help to coordinate care make a difference for those patients. The German way to a better coordination of and a better access to healthcare is a step in the right direction, but there is a lack of data demonstrating the increase in effectiveness and efficiency. The opportunity has been missed to conduct pilot studies in order to identify measurable, reliable, and valid outcome indicators and thus create greater transparency. The question is not \"whether\" but \"how\" new ways of offering care can be introduced to increase the performance of the whole system, to decrease coordination problems, and to stabilise healthcare spending.","1189":"Ambulatory patient care in Austria is provided by self-employed, office-based physicians, independent ambulatory care centres and outpatient clinics where patients are basically free to choose among these options. The level of care in the ambulatory setting can--despite known regional variations--also be regarded as high quality. Nevertheless, there seems to be a need for reform, the more so as the average number of medical consultations appears to be relatively high in Austria. Furthermore, patient interests would have to be considered even more by strongly promoting the establishment of knowledge hubs in organisation forms which are able to meet the specific requirements (group practices, medical service centres, etc.).","1190":"Due to governmental regulation in 2004 new options to establish ambulatory care facilities have become available and are widely used by healthcare providers. Medical service centres (Medizinische Versorgungszentren, MVZs) are characterised by the obligation for interdisciplinary teams of physicians, extended options for the employment of physicians and finally by flexible avenues of investment regarding the establishment of medical service centres. Medical service centres aim to improve ambulatory healthcare provision via an integrated service approach and offer opportunities for hospitals and third-party payers to set foot into the ambulatory healthcare sector. The rise of MVZs has therefore been closely and quite sceptically watched by the medical profession. The spread of MVZs is constant but limited to a modest growth rate. 250 MVZs are set up annually; in summer 2009 a total number of about 1300 had been reached, which is fairly small compared to 92,000 individual and group practices. The prominent specialities include general medicine, internal medicine, and surgery. The majority of MVZs are located in urban and suburban areas. Especially hospitals have, however, been using this approach to establish and operate ambulatory care centres with employed physicians. It remains to be seen whether and to what extent MVZs will improve service provision to the benefit of patients or mainly represent a new business model compromising existing structures. Continuous evaluation of trends is therefore essential for the further development of new ambulatory care structures.","1191":"The German healthcare system modernization act enables healthcare providers to fund interdisciplinary healthcare centres. The Techniker Krankenkasse (TK) is a statutory health sickness fund that has contracted with some of the interdisciplinary healthcare centres named ATRIO-MED to achieve high-quality medical care and healthcare management. A range of patient-centred services is described in the cooperation agreement; in addition to central medical patient records one of the core competencies includes integrated pathways for defined diagnosis. The concept of the interdisciplinary healthcare centre is highly accepted among patients. It will serve as a platform for future TK healthcare policies.","1192":"","1193":"","1194":"","1195":"","1196":"","1197":"","1198":"","1199":null,"1200":"In primary care research interventional studies often address organisational changes or educational interventions, for example, in the context of guideline implementation. For pragmatic reasons randomisation is often conducted at practice level instead of at the individual patient level. Patients from one practice form a cluster, thus violating the basic assumption of independent patient samples. Hence an increased number of participants and a more complex analysis are required. Using the example of two cluster randomised trials the present article provides insights into the advantages and disadvantages of cluster randomisation as well as its practical significance for the planning and analysis of cluster randomised trials.","1201":"The Bellagio Model for Population-oriented Primary Care is an evidence-informed framework to assess accessible care for sick, vulnerable, and healthy people. The model was developed in spring 2008 by a multidisciplinary group of 24 experts from nine countries. The purpose of their gathering was to determine success factors for effective 21st century primary care based on state-of-the-art research findings, models, and empirical experience, and to assist with its implementation in practice, management, and health policy. Against the backdrop of \"partialization\", fragmentation in open health care systems, and the growing numbers of chronically ill or fragile people or those in need of any other kind of care, today's health care systems do not provide the much needed anchor point for continuing coordination and assistance prior, during and following an episode of illness. The Bellagio Model consists of ten key elements, which can make a substantial contribution to identify and overcome current gaps in primary care by using a synergetic approach. These elements are Shared Leadership, Public Trust, Horizontal and Vertical Integration, Networking of Professionals, Standardized Measurement, Research and Development, Payment Mix, Infrastructure, Programmes for Practice Improvement, and Population-oriented Management. All of these elements, which have been identified as being equally necessary, are also alike in that they involve all those responsible for health care: providers, managers, and policymakers.","1202":"Initiated by the Public Health Department of the City of Aachen problems and deficits in the transition from hospital-based to outpatient care of cancer patients were evaluated. From September 2002 to April 2003 the data of 145 cancer patients who met the inclusion criteria and had been treated in four regional hospitals were collected by questionnaire, phone and personal interview at four different points in time within a period of six to eight weeks and documented. Aspects of interest included: type of disease, symptom burden, well-being, home care situation and medical aids required. Problems and deficits in the transition from hospital-based to outpatient care of cancer patients were only infrequently encountered. Specific structural deficits or general problems were not identified. The majority of patients felt comfortable with their medical transition process. For a special subgroup of patients who died during the trial period worse outcomes were documented than for the whole sample. Worse outcomes of the dying patients indicate disease progression with reduced quality of life, higher symptom burden and less satisfaction. The complex study method and the resulting selection bias may have contributed to underestimating transition problems. A more simple method could reduce the burden for the patients and the amount of missing data and thus allow for a deeper insight into the patients' needs. ","1203":"Up to the present moment there has been a large controversy over the metabolic control in patients with type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus receiving ambulatory treatment from general practitioners. Hence this trial aimed to assess the parameters of treatment quality in patients under ambulatory care in two German regions. A total of 2,242 patients from 25 general practitioners' care units were assessed from October 1998 to September 1999. The mean age of the patients was 67.5 +\/- 13.1, and the mean diabetes duration was 8.8 +\/- 7.5 years. 26.1% of the patients were treated without using anti-diabetic drugs, and 44.2% took oral anti-diabetic medications. 20.0% received insulin alone and 9.5% a combination therapy of insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents. The mean HbA1c of 6.9 +\/- 1.5 was comparable in Thuringia and West Pomerania. It was measured in 68.4% of the patients. Blood pressure values were documented in 98.8%. A total of 31.6% of patients took part in structured diabetes treatment and teaching programmes. In Thuringia the percentage of patients under specialized diabetes care was 3.6%; in West Pomerania it was significantly lower (18%, p&lt;0.001). The quality of treatment and metabolic control in patients with type-1- and type-2 diabetes mellitus receiving ambulatory care from general practitioners is much better than is commonly assumed. However, as indicated by the relatively low frequency of HbA1c measurements, the treatment quality is far from reaching the requirements of national guideline recommendations. ","1204":"General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in influenza vaccination. However, reliable data on the influenza immunisation coverage rate in primary care patients are quite rare. Due to a lack of personal and time resources general practitioners cannot afford to collect such data by themselves. Hence fifth-year students have been involved in the scientific data collection during their practical placement in 118 GP practices. Using logistic regression analysis of a representative sample (n = 541) plausible factors associated with the influenza immunisation coverage rate have been identified. These factors were found to be both patient- and practice-specific. This practice-oriented study was conducted to improve the available data base on the influenza immunisation coverage rate among elderly patients in primary care settings.","1205":"The number of overweight patients in Germany has been continuously increasing during the past years. The so-called \"check-up 35\" consultation presents primary care providers with an opportunity for preventive counselling talks with the respective individuals. In this qualitative study we analysed family physician encounters. We were particularly interested in the way in which the subject matter was addressed and the risk counselling performed by the physicians when confronted with overweight patients. Twelve physicians audio-taped their final check-up dialogue with 52 overweight or obese patients (BMI &gt; or = 25 kg\/m2). The interviews were transcribed, and a content analysis was conducted using the established method developed by Mayring. Physicians used direct or more often indirect strategies to address overweight in counselling talks that were most often initiated by their patients. They largely addressed this topic while communicating laboratory results. Some obese patients did not receive any advice on health risks. In the encounters analysed the physicians did not employ standardized risk counselling tools. The reasons for addressing overweight indirectly and the lack of standardized risk counselling with obese patients are carefully discussed. ","1206":"The S3-guideline for diagnosis and treatment of venous leg ulcers published by the German Society for Phlebology (DGP) in 2006 was tested for its acceptance and practicability in outpatient care delivered by general practitioners (GPs) and phlebologists. Barriers to the implementation of the guideline's recommendations in regular health care were identified. Qualitative research using focus groups and interviews by telephone; systematic content analysis of records and transcripts by two independent researchers. Altogether, GPs and phlebologists gave a positive evaluation of the guideline, but it also became clear that it does not form the basis of their everyday work practice. Factors inhibiting the application of the guideline included the insufficient reimbursement systems and the patients' compliance, but these factors were weighed differently between the two groups. Evidence-based performance seems to play a minor role with regard to patients suffering from leg ulcers in daily practice. Barriers of implementation as well as detailed suggestions by the users will help to revise and to adapt the guideline to the needs of both users and patients. ","1207":"Many physicians agree on the advantages of using Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) in daily practice, but they do not make use of this method very often. One reason for this lack of EbM implementation is that it is difficult to access clinically relevant and appropriate information in daily practice. The division \"Principles and Practices of EbM\" in the German Network for Evidence-based Medicine (DNEbM) initiated a pilot project to improve their information management. During two weeks in February 2007 physicians in a local setting in the southeast part of Germany were offered an EbM expert service. They were asked to formulate open-ended questions arising from daily practice. Seventeen experts answered these questions within a three day period. In addition, all participants regularly received an edited version of these topics, and finally a questionnaire was sent out to evaluate physician satisfaction. Five family doctors and two hospital departments formulated 28 questions in two weeks. There was a wide range of answers, from evidence summaries (including full texts of the trials or relevant guidelines) up to expert opinion together with a discussion of different action strategies in the case of uncertain evidence. The participating physicians' satisfaction with this offer of low-barrier access to the best available evidence and the answers provided by the experts was high. Apart from the suggested solutions to the respective problems the project initiated a critical self-analysis of their individual clinical practice among the participating physicians. All of them saw the need for continuing this project. Further investigations are needed in order to optimise both the process of EbM implementation on a long-term basis and the health care quality by providing EbM expert services.","1208":"","1209":"","1210":"The assessment of the transferability, sometimes called external validity, of study results is subordinate to the assessment of the internal validity of clinical studies. Although internal and external validity seem to be related they actually are fundamentally different concepts. While assessing the transferability or generalisability of study results effect-modifying factors (e.g., age, gender, qualification of the suppliers, technical equipment) have to be considered. In principle relevant or known effect-modifying factors can be allowed for within the decisions of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). This can be demonstrated by the example of acupuncture for chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the correct utilisation (and accordingly, effectiveness) of health technologies in everyday practice cannot be influenced by the G-BA. Still it would be desirable to have a scientifically sound, standardised tool available for assessing the external validity of study results.","1211":"","1212":"Within clinical research the spectrum of possible trial objectives and designs ranges from explanatory to pragmatic. Pragmatic trials improve the knowledge base for clinicians, patients, regulatory and funding bodies as well as manufacturers of medical products. However, the pragmatic design has certain limitations and the assessment of external validity requires a considerable amount of judgment. Investigators need special expertise to conduct this kind of studies.","1213":"","1214":"The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group represents an international collaboration of guideline developers, clinicians, health services researchers and methodologists. Many leading organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), use the GRADE approach because it has led to progress in the assessment of evidence and in the development of healthcare recommendations. The GRADE system distinguishes the quality of evidence from the strength of a recommendation. The quality of evidence reflects the extent of confidence that an estimate of effect is correct if it is used in the context of single endpoints. In the context of giving guidance, it reflects the extent to which confidence in an estimate of the effect is adequate to support recommendations. The strength of a recommendation, separated into strong and weak or conditional recommendations for or against an intervention, is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. A recommendation for action requires consideration for the magnitude of the expected benefit and downsides of an intervention for all patient-important endpoints, the associate values and preferences and resource use. The GRADE system includes a systematic approach to evaluate the generalizability of study results to healthcare practice. Judgments about generalizability, better termed directness, are separated into judgments about the availability of direct comparisons between two alternative management strategies and judgments about differences between the population, intervention, comparator to the intervention, and outcomes (PICO) of interest for a given question, and those included in the relevant studies. In addition to providing an overview of the GRADE system, this article focuses on the approach to assessing directness or generalizability.","1215":"","1216":"Along with the growing number of clinical and epidemiological studies the diversity of methodological approaches increases to an extent that many physicians and their patients experience as confusing. Should we not simplify matters by limiting our view to high-quality studies of evidence class 1 and ignore all the other approaches? In fact, the generation of evidence and a scientific understanding of real-world processes would be less successful if we forewent alternative approaches to randomized studies. While it is certainly true that direct proof of therapeutic efficacy can only be accomplished with high standard randomized trials, non-randomized studies contribute substantially to exploration, to the generation of hypotheses and to the assessment of the transferability of study results to routine health care practice. Moreover, for clinical decision-making and assessment of the expected individual therapeutic benefit physicians and their patients in several regards need additional information that usually cannot be derived from randomized trials such as to the natural course of the disease without the specific treatment, safety and quality of life aspects as well as disease concepts. Should the findings obtained from non-randomized studies not likewise be incorporated into the general assessment of therapeutic benefit within a population as conducted by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) for different therapeutic approaches? Therapeutic processes could benefit most from research if randomized trials, cohort studies and registers were integrated and interconnected. This way, assessments of transferability will have a solid empirical base.","1217":"","1218":"In surgery, too, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the scientific method of choice for proving the effectiveness of a new intervention or the superiority of an innovative technique over an established one. However, there are particular challenges in surgical studies regarding the equality of structure, of treatments and observation in the study groups. The design of valid study protocols in surgery is very complex, which is the reason for the relatively small number of high-quality RCTs in surgical literature. Pragmatic studies offer a promising approach to the implementation of surgical innovations in health care. The German Society of Surgeons supports the conduct of multicentre clinical studies by providing the relevant structures (study centre, multicentre network CHIR-Net). Good clinical and comparative health care effectiveness research in surgery also needs stronger academic appreciation as a career incentive for young academic surgeons.","1219":"Transferability of results originating from randomized, controlled clinical trials is characterized by their external validity. Clinical trials are experimental in their design and conducted under standardized terms, that is, rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as an artificial trial environment may hamper the transferability of results. Studies designed for approval of new medicines usually exclude elderly patients, multi-morbid patients, pregnant women and children. For example, the median age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in Germany is 69 (men) and 75 (women) years, respectively. In clinical trials investigating chemotherapy, however, patients above the age of 70 years represent only 18% of the trial population. In cardiovascular trials, especially on acute coronary syndromes, women are usually under-represented. Guidelines derived from clinical trials should therefore explicitly mention a study's limitations. It should be communicated clearly for which patients and under which conditions the guideline is applicable.","1220":"Since 2000 there has been sufficient evidence that chest X-rays are unnecessary in infants and children with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infection. The reason is that neither the diagnosis nor the first therapeutic decisions will be influenced by the result of this procedure, and especially so if children have been infected with the respiratory syncytial virus. However, epidemiological studies in Germany reveal an ongoing use of chest X-ray in these cases. This might suggest that the X-ray images are taken as \"proof\" of pneumonia, which indeed pays off in the German DRG (Diagnosis Related Groups) system since hospitals receive a higher reimbursement for RSV pneumonia than for RSV bronchiolitis.","1221":"A prospective and randomized trial design is of utmost interest when it comes to evaluating new developments in the management of cardiovascular medicine. By defining the primary end point and a profound related statistic new therapeutic options can be tested with an adequate number of patients. The course of the trial is supervised by a Clinical Events Committee and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Registries are promising tools for describing how the results of clinical trials are translated into daily practice. Their drawbacks include lack of control of the clinical endpoints and their uniform definition and lack of a control group. There are numerous examples from cardiology of the limited usefulness of data obtained from registry studies with their often unexpected results that might have significant but unsubstantiated implications for the provision of care to cardiac patients.","1222":"","1223":"","1224":"","1225":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTA) using balloon dilatation with or without stenting are performed to treat peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Intravascular brachytherapy (IB) after PTA promises to reduce the restenosis rates. The present article addresses questions concerning medical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IB in PAOD patients. A systematic literature search for randomized controlled studies evaluating IB in PAOD was conducted in August 2007. Information synthesis was conducted using meta-analysis. Health economic modelling was performed on the basis of clinical assumptions derived from the meta-analysis and economical assumptions derived from the German Diagnosis Related Groups (G-DRG) 2007. Twelve publications covering seven studies about IB vs. no IB were included in the evaluation. IB after successful balloon dilatation showed a significant reduction in the rate of restenosis at six and\/or twelve months (relative risk 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 0.84) and a significant delay in the time to recurrence of restenosis (17.5 vs. 7.4 months, p &lt; 0.01). IB after stenting did not lead to significant results regarding the restenosis rates, but was more often associated with early and late occlusive thromboses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per restenosis avoided for IB vs. no IB after successful balloon dilatation was--depending on the G-DRG used-Euro 8,484 and Euro 9,058, respectively. In the comparison of IB vs. no IB after stenting IB was demonstrated to be inferior to no IB. IB after successful balloon dilatation in PAOD can be recommended from a medical point of view. From the health economic perspective the answer is not yet clear. IB after stenting in PAOD cannot be recommended.

Following a comprehensive search of 26 electronic databases by DAHTA DIMDI, a systematic review was performed in accordance with international standards of evidence based medicine. Eight publications on risk prediction and one study addressing clinical decision-analytic modelling were included in the assessment. The adjusted relative risk of a high hs-CRP level (&gt; 3 mg\/L) for myocardial infarction, cardiac related death, and cardiovascular events ranged from 0.7 to 2.47 (p &lt; 0.05 in 4 of 7 studies). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increased by 0.00 to 0.027 when hs-CRP was added to the prediction models (4 of 7 studies statistically significant with p &lt; 0.05). Based on a published decision-analytic model examining hs-CRP screening, the gain in life expectancy due to statin therapy in individuals with elevated hs-CRP was similar when compared to patients with hyperlipidaemia. Nonetheless, evidence on many model parameters was limited. Screening with hs-CRP in addition to traditional risk factors improves risk prediction.

In this context cost-of-illness studies are a suitable tool for quantifying disease-specific health economic consequences of disease. Their primary aim is to illustrate the economic burden of a specific disease and its implications for society and for the national economy. The present review summarizes the methods and results of cost-of-illness studies regarding the three cancer diseases mentioned. Despite some limitations and remarkable differences in respect of methodological aspects, it is possible to point out that numerous studies lead to similar results. For all three kinds of cancer, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that mainly initial and terminal states of disease are important, due to the major resource utilization caused by the claim of initial and palliative therapies. Inpatient costs--caused by the high rate of hospitalisation--account for 50% to 98% of the direct costs. As regards the societal perspective, a comparison of the three diseases considered demonstrates that especially the costs associated with breast cancer present a big challenge to the health care systems, which is primarily due to the high incidence rate in women under 65 years of age and the correspondingly high indirect costs resulting from invalidity, invalidity pensions or premature death. Future tasks to work on include analyzing the different patterns of health service utilisation and identifying the cost effects of different influencing factors. Transparency of costs, as a basis for cost-effectiveness analyses, could help to make interventions more precise.","1229":"","1230":"\"Individual responsibility\" and the abidance by any \"health-related obligations\" are key words of the present political and legal German healthcare debate. In the process of adjusting the German welfare state by focussing the ideal allocation of common health resources patients who do not meet their \"health-related obligations\" are thus expected to accept cutbacks in medical care services. However, from the perspective of constitutional law there is no \"health-related obligation\" deriving from the German constitution - the right to self-determination guaranteed in Art. 2 Sect. 2 Sent. 1 of the German constitution has not been amended to impose a corresponding duty. Hence, health-related obligations may only refer to indirect ways of exercising individual responsibility, no more and no less. The present article highlights the few possibilities which the German constitution provides for the implementation of \"health-related obligations\" and reminds us of the conceptual aspects which have to be considered by the legislator.","1231":"Health insurance companies play a very significant role in the sociopolitical context. It is their responsibility to meet the demands of modern health services delivery, while at the same time limited financial resources need to be considered.

Health insurance companies rely on secure knowledge with a high level of evidence to justify their decisions in a collectively funded healthcare system. Where the elimination of knowledge gaps is not related to the expectation of profit on the part of potential providers of medical services, procedures or products the funding of high-quality studies should be considered.","1232":"Like no other political field health politics has become the target of well-connected lobbyists.

The author has been working at the various interfaces of research and politics. In this article he takes health politics as an example to look at the actual utilisation of scientific knowledge in politics.

Pharmacovigilance activities should abide by the 'precautionary principle'. Risk management plans are a new tool for achieving this goal. The key elements of risk management plans include a drug-specific risk specification, a pharmacovigilance plan as well as appropriate risk communication procedures.","1234":"Decisions are a double-edged sword: they always and inevitably come with positive and negative consequences. Decisions in healthcare--from a systems level to the individual patient--are not different. This approach acknowledges that for all recommendations and decisions all the important consequences need to be considered. Along these lines, one must evaluate the certainty that estimates of effects and decisions are likely to be correct. Thus, as institutions, professional societies, organisations and individuals, we should follow approaches focusing on systematic and integrative assessment of available best evidence. Longstanding and broad experience with the development of recommendations, including systematically developed guidelines, led a group of methodologists, health officers, clinicians and guideline developers to form the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. The GRADE approach differentiates the assessment of the quality of evidence from the strength of a recommendation in healthcare. For a step-by-step evaluation of the quality of evidence, one must consider all patient relevant endpoints. It is common that many relevant and acceptable studies provide evidence for single outcomes. Therefore, integrating summaries and assessments beyond meta-analyses are required. The explicit and transparent description of the single steps in these assessments and the consideration of all currently known criteria for the assessment of the quality of evidence are among the most important advantages and innovations of the GRADE system and are described here briefly. The overall quality of evidence of all outcomes that are critical for decision-making are summarized on the basis of the lowest quality of evidence. If, for example, the evidence for six of seven critical outcomes is of low quality while moderate quality evidence is available for the other critical outcome, the overall quality of evidence is considered low to avoid a false sense of certainty with the assessment of the evidence for a given topic. A recommendation according to GRADE also requires a considerate judgement about the magnitude of the expected balance of benefits and downsides for the important outcomes, the relative values and preferences associated with these outcomes and considerations about the required resources. The international collaboration and acceptance by many organisations is an indicator of GRADE's innovative nature and advances in the assessment of evidence and development of recommendations in the context of healthcare.","1235":"Usually medical and\/or non-medical interventions are applied to treat both acute and chronic disease. The non-medical measures include a broad range of heterogeneous principles, among them surgical, physical, technical and psychological ones. Not uncommonly, these measures derive from particular theoretical concepts. They frequently involve complex interventions, that is, programmes with varying combinations of different interacting measures. It has been postulated by advocates of the so called complementary medicine that 'different treatment concepts and hence different assessment methods' not only do, but must exist. This claim will be examined in a four-step procedure, and it will be demonstrated that this claim cannot be maintained: 1) in the face of the German Social Code, Book V Para. 35b Sect. 1, 2) with respect to the required and available knowledge base, 3) against the background of professionally approved international standards of EbM and 4) the requirements of scientific acceptance of psychotherapeutic methods and procedures.","1236":"Effectiveness does not always mean benefit but there is no benefit without effectiveness. Benefit does not always involve necessity but there is no necessity without benefit. In spite of this simple relationship these three important terms of the social security regulations are not well-defined.

After the cancellation of the former medical doctor traineeship \"Arzt im Praktikum\" (AiP) qualification period in October 2004, the final year of medical education, the so-called \"practical year\" (PJ), has become a key teaching module in realising the demands of the AAppO. So far no studies have been carried out in the German-speaking area to qualitatively assess the specific needs and central problems that PJ students are facing. The aim of this investigation was to representatively evaluate the expectancies and experiences of final-year medical students in a workplace learning environment. 65 students (30 male, 35 female, age 25.4 +\/- 2 years) of two German university hospitals participated in focus groups both prior and subsequent (n = 60; drop-out rate 7.7%) to a 4-month period of internal medicine traineeship during their final year. Focus group protocols were transcribed and subjected to content analysis. 1137 individual statements on relevant topics were identified from the transcriptions. Students widely reported lack of time on the part of supervising doctors and exorbitant assignment to routine jobs. This results in insufficient training of independent patient management, followed by feelings of uncertainty and the fear of making medical errors. Specific educational strategies and motivation of medical teachers are important factors to the workplace learning environment. A structured curriculum including cognitive, procedural and communicative learning objectives and the introduction of defined time slots for bedside teaching is considered a good first step in this process. ","1239":"Continuing medical education (CME) increasingly focuses on measurable patient outcomes. Nevertheless, international data on this issue are insufficient, and in Germany the measurable effects of CME in terms of its efficacy and utility for patient care have hardly been subjected to scientific examination. Advanced medical education as a continuation of university education is always based on scientific standards and research-oriented learning. Advanced medical training in Germany therefore requires the implementation of a kind of learning and teaching research that should be geared toward individual training needs, personal motivation and the outcomes of medical care. In addition, the definition of educational goals and the advancement of CME in terms of continuing professional development (CPD) should be considered an important component for a reevaluation of CME.","1240":"Sampling inspections are an approved instrument for assuring and promoting the quality of healthcare. Individual documentations of medical services are requested from physicians and randomly selected for quality rating by experienced peer reviewers. For example, sampling inspections are stipulated by law for certain ambulatory services (e.g., colonoscopies) delivered by SHI-authorised physicians in order to maintain professional performance standards of colonoscopists. On behalf of the regional Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (ASHIP) experienced colonoscopists regularly rate selected visual documentations (videotapes, photographs) of colonoscopies performed by SHI-authorised physicians in the ambulatory care sector. For anatomical reasons, however, a certain proportion of colonoscopies of inadequate quality will generally be tolerated. Whenever this value is exceeded, ASHIP may impose sanctions against the physician. The question is how sampling inspections have to be performed and dimensioned in order to ensure that the tests be sufficiently meaningful in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Relevant sampling test parameters such as the false-positive rate (physicians are wrongly accused of inadequate quality) and the false-negative rate (existing deficiencies are not identified) are calculated. The calculations are performed analytically or, in the case of complex sampling test scenarios, numerically by means of computer simulations. The calculations show that single-stage sampling tests usually do not result in acceptable values for the false-positive and the false-negative rates. For example, a sampling test which requires the documentation of 20 colonoscopies will -- assuming some reasonable tolerance of inadequately performed colonoscopies -- result in a false-positive rate of 6% and a false-negative rate of 47%. The false-positive-rate, which is particularly relevant from a legal point of view, can be reduced by providing a two-stage sampling test. A significant reduction of the false-negative-rate may be achieved by (multiple) repetition of the single-stage sampling test and consideration of cumulative probabilities. In principle, sampling inspections permit statements in terms of probabilities only. In sampling inspections of healthcare quality false-negative rates are usually considered, i.e., the probability that the test is unable to identify existing quality deficiencies. However, false-positive rates also need to be considered in cases where sanctions may be imposed against the physician on the basis of a positive sampling test. Numerical calculations of false-positive and false-negative rates for simple and complex sampling test scenarios should be performed in order to choose the optimum procedure and dimension of a sampling test.

For an optimization of safety in treatment-related processes of medical care, the medical staff needs to be actively involved in preventive and proactive quality management. Using voluntary, confidential and non-punitive systematic employee surveys, vulnerable topics and areas in patient care revealing preventable risks can be identified at an early stage. Preventive measures to continuously optimize treatment quality can be defined by creating a risk portfolio and a priority list of vulnerable topics. Whereas critical incident reporting systems are suitable for continuous risk assessment by detecting safety-relevant single events, employee surveys permit to conduct a systematic risk analysis of all treatment-related processes of patient care at any given point in time.","1247":"Surveys among employees are getting more and more relevant in hospital settings since an increase in both (1) efficiency and (2) quality in connection with (3) enhanced patient orientation will only be achieved, if at the same time the employees' health status and satisfaction are taken into account. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the satisfaction of employees in a single hospital enquired in 2002 with that of 2005. Particular consideration was given to their view of quality management. Is there a correlation between employees' satisfaction, their degree of information on quality management, and their assessment of quality management? In the survey of 2005 employees were more satisfied with their work and their working conditions than in the previous inquiry conducted in 2002. They felt less mental stress, despite the declining length of hospitalisation combined with a higher turnover of in-hospital cases and with lower numbers of full-time staff. The employees' satisfaction, however, differed widely among the three departments with regard to the items \"involvement with decisions\" and \"support by the superiors\". The overall assessment of quality management is positive. Specific items such as the assessment of the management's commitment to quality management were strongly influenced by the employees' degree of information on quality management, which varies between departments. In the department with the lowest work satisfaction quality management was attributed a high potential for change and improvement. After quality management will have been implemented throughout the hospital, a new survey should be undertaken to evaluate whether quality management affects the employees' satisfaction with their work.","1248":"Medical leadership requires specific communication skills in order to meet professional demands. Communicative behaviour is usually highly automated and not necessarily conscious. Managerial communication competes against elaborated but not role-specific behaviour patterns, especially in critical situations. Accordingly, competent medical leadership requires the awareness of individual communication habits as well as the knowledge and ability to use conversation techniques suitable for a specific situational context. The training of leadership-related communication techniques requires the de-automation of existing skills and a problem-oriented construction and re-automation of new communication techniques.","1249":"All well-known quality management (QM) models in health care also address issues of the quality of leadership, even if they do so with varying intensity. Skills in managing organisations are a basically important quality in a top manager, but skills in leading people have been revealed as being most relevant. All the manuals of the most common quality management systems specify 'To-Do' lists and tasks for the top management--EFQM and KTQ\/proCum Cert have definitively linked them with quality management. Quality needs to be assessed by the degree to which management goals are achieved. However, there is no easy approach to measure leadership abilities and explain it to the public. Since this is a real challenge and very difficult to achieve it is not a central focus of the various QM manuals.","1250":"Current concepts in leadership and governance on the level of supervisory board, management and departments are often considered as insufficient to cope with the profound structural change which actually takes place in the German health care system. While vertical and horizontal disconnecting is typical of the professional bureaucracy of hospitals, transition from functional to divisional structure further increases this risk. Accordingly, medical experts are oriented towards their professional peers and patient care on the one side; on the other side the management gets isolated and looses operative and strategic control. Several studies provide evidence for the relevance of role models to serve as agents of change, which are now developed into the concept of \"Clinical Governance\": evidence-based medicine, guidelines, continuous quality improvement, safety culture, resource accountability and organisational learning. The present situation makes it necessary to extend this conception, which focuses on the departmental level in an organisation with divisional features, to one of \"Clinical Corporate Governance\". This term, which also includes supervisory structures and the management board and is relevant for the total hospital and company, respectively, is based on the corporate governance concept. Inside the hospital, the management and the heads of the departments have to agree that (1) experts really need to be integrated into the decision process, and that (2) the outcomes of the entire hospital have to be regarded as equal or superior to the aims of a single department. The public image of the hospital should be one of a strong and reliable partner in health care and health care business on a local, regional and national level. Members of the supervisory board should clearly put corporate aspects above political and other implications and pay attention to personal independence from the leaders of the medical departments.","1251":"With all these changes in health care systems the physicians' professional duties are about to undergo changes as well. Especially economic, administrative and legal aspects are becoming more and more important in medical care. In order to take responsibility with respect to leadership aspects a profound professionalisation is required. The Curriculum Medical Leadership edited by the German Medical Association provides an extensive example of a framework for continuing professional development (CPD) courses in medical leadership.","1252":"This overview of leadership research provides insights into the different leadership concepts. Early research on leadership focused on personality traits and leadership behaviour as determinants of good leadership. The recognition of leadership as a complex phenomenon resulted in concepts that examined leader characteristics and behaviour in the context of situational conditions. Modern cognitive approaches concentrated on the perception of leaders by followers and the perception of followers by leaders and the cognitive biases involved. There is a tendency in leadership research to integrate the three central aspects of leadership--person, situation and cognition--into a single framework.","1253":"","1254":"","1255":"Economic terms such as efficiency, optimality and social welfare carry strong positive connotations. Sometimes non-economists may overlook the substantive difference between the scientific definition of these terms and their use in common parlance. This difference will be highly relevant if and when economic statements about efficiency are presented or interpreted in a normative way, i.e., implying that efficiency equals social desirability. Any statement about efficiency rests on implicit or explicit assumptions concerning the appropriate effectiveness criterion because efficiency invariably is an instrumental or secondary objective only, subject to clarification of the primary objectives to be pursued. In the absence of an agreement on the primary objectives of a collectively funded health scheme, the pursuit of efficiency may lead to health care allocation decisions that are not in line with prevailing social value judgements. Therefore, exposition and acceptance of the specific value judgements underlying economic evaluations of health care programmes should be a prerequisite to any attempt towards their normative interpretation. As regards the implementation of cost benefit evaluation in health care, the cautious stance taken by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) appears to be well justified in the absence of such a fundamental consensus, especially when these evaluations are meant to address issues of allocative efficiency.","1256":"The precarious financial situation of the German public health care system requires the limitation of health care benefits. Determining priorities between groups of patients, indications, or procedures and implementing preferential treatments is one of the pressing issues in health ethics, health law, social medicine and health politics. Although a public debate on priority setting, or prioritisation, has repeatedly been called for, it was mainly the physicians' views and values as well as the interests of their sponsors that have been voiced; the perspectives of patients and the public has been deemed irrelevant. In the following, we summarise the prioritisation experiences from some foreign countries and report on preliminary results obtained from qualitative interviews with healthy German citizens concerning their views on setting priorities with respect to diseases, therapies, people's lifestyle, demographic factors, and economic and ethical aspects.","1257":"In setting health care priorities the law, and in particular the constitution, has to be obeyed. The social constitutional state must guarantee minimum access to health care. Members of the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) shall have access to health care services protecting their life and ensuring their participation in society. They shall not be discriminated according to gender, race and ethnic origin, language, disability, age and sexual orientation. Essential decisions will have to be made by the legislator. Within the EC the right to access health care services in another EC member state may be an obstacle to prioritisation on the national level, e.g., to waiting lists. The exclusion of health care services on the basis of the social security law may be too simplistic an approach. Administrative discretion needs priorities, but it is unclear whether these are set to meet political priorities and real needs. The decisions of the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) are sophisticated enough but have to respect the rule of law. There are deficits in research on the prioritisation effects of health care law. Diminishing these deficits is a prerequisite for turning political priorities into effective legal provisions.","1258":"Pure utilitarianism has come to be a rare position in the ethics of health resource allocation. Most authors favour a combination of a utility-maximising criterion with other criteria, notably fairness-related ones. Classical utilitarianism, though, claimed to be a moral theory that is already fair by itself. Trying to combine a utilitarian starting point with fairness-related ideas originating from anti-utilitarian criticism may result in inconsistent axiologies. The article is a report of discussions arguing the point.","1259":"In the Swedish priority guidelines, as opposed to traditional guidelines issued by professional associations, measures (in terms of condition-treatment pairs) of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases are assigned a priority value of 1 (high priority) through 10 (low priority). In its recent 2008 version this list also comprises procedures that should not be performed and those that should only be performed in the context of research projects. The government commissions the development of this list which will then be elaborated by a multi-professional team under the supervision of the National Board of Health and Welfare. In addition to scientific evidence, the prioritylists incorporate ethical and economical aspects. Examples from the Swedish guidelines will be discussed. The impact and limits of the priority lists will be described.","1260":"In contrast to Germany, several other countries started to develop methods for setting priorities in health care more than 20 years ago. This paper provides an overview of the experiences in Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the US state of Oregon. Acknowledging the fact that - due to the increasing discrepancy between medical demand and publicly available financial resources--it is inevitable to set limits in health care, these countries initiated a public discourse on resource allocation in health care and established national committees to develop methods for the prioritisation of health care services. In most countries, priorities were implemented by practice guidelines defining clinical indications for medical interventions. In addition to this explicit allocation of scarce health care resources most countries also rely on implicit cost-containment measures (e.g., prospective reimbursement systems). Finally the article will highlight the conclusions that may be drawn from these international experiences for the German health care system.","1261":"The starting point of the present paper is the different uses of the terms prioritisation and rationing in the debate about resource allocation in health care. Two models of the relationship between prioritisation and rationing are developed. They are intended to contribute to a deeper understanding of the basic concepts. The first model of explicit priority setting assumes deliberate prioritisation which may form the basis of explicit rationing, but also of rationalisation and quality improvements. The second model, representing the rationing perspective, conceives rationing as a societal phenomenon whose implicit prioritisation criteria have to be deduced by means of interpretation. The two models can be distinguished from each other both theoretically and by their application in practice. Some advantages and disadvantages of the models are discussed.","1262":"","1263":"Following structured forms of postgraduate training, which are already in use internationally, there are more and more reports on operationalised procedures of postgraduate training in Germany as well. The transparency, which is required by law in order to make medical postgraduate training demonstrable in terms of Sect. 8 of the new regulation on postgraduate training, creates a demand for evaluations. However, only 10 to 20% of the participants in postgraduate training use these evaluations to demonstrate their results scientifically. The aim of the present paper was to show that--with regard to content--the conceptual integration of operationalised programmes for postgraduate training is able to compensate for the given limited time frames and formally tightened structures of postgraduate training in the sense of the quality assurance required by the legislator. The evaluation showed that this can be made possible through ensuring the participants' satisfaction and achieving the goals of postgraduate training.","1264":"In each hospital the trauma resuscitation room in emergency departments is one of the areas with the highest rate of critical incidents. Delayed and insufficient medical interventions have a high impact on negative patient outcomes. Anticipating and dealing with critical situations might reduce preventable errors in the treatment process. This can be achieved by implementing an algorithm-based structured work flow. In this context some elements of quality management are well-established in clinical practice. In the present study we describe the implementation of a clinical pathway and an interdisciplinary quality circle to improve management of the trauma patient.","1265":"This systematic review will investigate the question of how non-physician health care providers may be involved in the care and treatment of patients with chronic disease and which role they could play within the scope of the German Disease Management Programmes (DMP). This article is limited to the German DMP diagnoses asthma, COPD, coronary heart disease, and type-1 and -2 diabetes mellitus. Several databases were systematically searched to find national and international studies with interventions carried out by non-physician health care providers such as nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists or occupational therapists. More than 300 studies and reviews were included in this systematic review. Nurses and dieticians were by far the prevailing professional groups performing the largest number of the interventions identified. Transferring. the results of the literature review to the German setting, non-physician health care providers could both undertake certain tasks on their own responsibility and provide other services in support of the medical treatment of the chronically ill. Some interventions are given as examples. ","1266":"Integrative concepts of teaching and learning with close reference to individual work routines are better suited to bring about attitudinal and behavioural modification--apart from a gain in knowledge and skills--than traditional educational approaches. All the same, the vast majority of continuing training courses in Evidence-based Medicine takes place during weekend courses or evening classes, outside the work environment. To counteract this deficit a modular curriculum framework for Evidence-based Medicine was developed within the scope of the European research project EUebm which aims to achieve both a harmonisation of EbM education and training in Europe and a better integration of education and training with everyday clinical practice. The modules of this curriculum are intended to seamlessly fit into our day-to-day clinical work for and with patients and thus facilitate close interaction between the actual clinical work and the learning of EbM techniques and their implementation into our own patients' care. On the basis of a survey conducted among all the project partners in Austria, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Switzerland the demand for training and continuing education in EbM in the individual countries was identified. Taking into account the results of this survey as well as previous work such as, for example, the curriculum of the German Network for Evidence-based Medicine or material provided by the Centre for Evidence-based Medicine in Oxford, an Internet-based teaching and learning module on systematic reviews and meta-analyses was developed and tested in five of the participating countries. The test demonstrated that in this way harmonisation of EbM education and training and a better integration of training with our everyday clinical work becomes feasible.","1267":"","1268":null,"1269":"","1270":"Successfully implemented clinical guidelines can contribute to improvement in the quality of care. In the context of clinical guidelines, quality indicators play an important role. Quality indicators can contribute to the further development and updating of existing guidelines by analysing their results. In addition, these results support internal and external quality improvement activities and supply information on the implementation status of guideline recommendations giving an impression of the actual quality of care. In this paper the data of the mandatory German performance measurement (specimen radiograph of impalpable breast lesions, preoperative waiting time with femoral neck fracture) were analysed in respect to the extent that guideline recommendations have been implemented in clinical care. We analysed a database of 189,756 and 331,087 patients for the quality indicators 'specimen radiograph' and 'preoperative waiting time', respectively. Depending on the quality of the clinical guideline the results varied. After the publication of this recommendation as part of the German high-quality guideline for neoplasms of the breast in 2004 the proportion of radiographic controls of specimens after breast cancer surgery increased from initially 36% to 84% in 2006, and the variance as a measure of the variability of care decreased considerably. By contrast, the percentage of patients with femoral neck fracture undergoing surgery within 48h did not change noticeably (2003: 19%; 2006: 16%). A German high-quality guideline making a clear recommendation for early surgery does not yet exist. Quality indicators of the German mandatory performance measurement system are suitable for measuring the extent to which guideline recommendations have been implemented and for supporting their (further) development.","1271":null,"1272":"Successful guideline implementation requires that the authors get feedback from target groups on the general acceptance of a guideline and the barriers to its implementation. The Guideline Group of General Practitioners (GPs) in Hesse continually surveyed participants of quality circles on pharmacotherapy who discussed these GP specific guidelines together with an analysis of their prescription behaviour. Written survey of six general practice guidelines conducted among the members of quality circles in Hesse during 2006 and 2007. The response rate ranged from 69% (n=268; guideline on 'GP Communication Skills') and 80% (n=374; Guideline on 'Chronic Heart Failure'). The questionnaire focused on both general acceptance and the relevance and practicability of individual recommendations. With pharmacotherapeutic guidelines, between 75% (guideline for dyslipidaemia) and 86% (guideline for stable angina) would be recommended by the respondent GPs to colleagues. High practice relevance was attributed to the communication skills guideline by 70% of the GPs, but only about 50% would recommend it. Three quarters of the GP rated 18 out of 22 selected recommendations as being relevant to therapeutic quality assurance, and 11 of these recommendations as being practicable. Non-medical procedures requiring communication resources and time input as well as motivated patients were more often assessed as being more difficult to implement. A written survey is a suitable tool for gaining insight into the acceptance of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and for investigating reasons for the refusal of or the barriers to implementation. Recommendations that are poorly accepted and less likely to be implemented as well as possible barriers should be discussed within the guideline group and during circle sessions in order to modify the recommendation and\/or develop aids to assist with its transfer into everyday practice. ","1273":"","1274":"","1275":"The choice of primary and secondary endpoints for the individual studies of a research and development program is a classical biometric problem. Far-reaching decisions have to be made on the basis of incomplete information. Early studies in a program usually have functional or symptom-driven endpoints; the larger subsequent trials will usually focus on quality of life, morbidity or mortality. For program acceleration and cost reduction surrogate parameters are welcome. Unfortunately, there are only a few generally accepted surrogates for morbidity or mortality. At first glance, risk scores seem to be a suitable means for filling this gap. They are easily calculated, comprehensive and thus form a solid base for shared decision-making. However, further reasoning reveals that risk scores do not meet the usual standards for surrogates. What is more, a treatment targeting the reduction of a risk score cannot be considered an evidence-based intervention, which is due to a lack of randomized trials that compare risk score reduction to conventional interventions focussing on isolated risk factors. Thus, risk scores are unsuitable for primary endpoints, whereas they play an important role as comprehensive explanatory variables in study evaluation, i.e., for the description of population characteristics and as potential control variables or effect modifiers.","1276":"Strengthening citizen participation, patient rights and patient autonomy places more and more responsibility for achieving certain health care goals on the health care consumer ('customer'). Public health based governance using tools and concepts of health economics consider this a responsibility of physicians and hospitals. The two concepts are not fully compatible. Holding health care providers responsible for goals which, in part, are beyond their control is unfair from an ethical point of view. Politics should accept that physicians are responsible for the quality of their services, and not for the health of the individual.","1277":"Utility is a concept that originates from utilitarianism, a highly influential philosophical school in the Anglo-American world. The cornerstone of utilitarianism is the principle of maximum happiness or utility. In the medical sciences, this utility approach has been adopted and developed within the field of medical decision making. On an operational level, utility is the evaluation of a health state or an outcome on a one-dimensional scale ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). By adding the concept of expectancy, the graphic representation of both concepts in a decision tree results in the specification of expected utilities and helps to resolve complex medical decision problems. Criticism of the utility approach relates to the rational perspective on humans (which is rejected by a considerable fraction of research in psychology) and to the artificial methods used in the evaluation of utility, such as Standard Gamble or Time Trade Off. These may well be the reason why the utility approach has never been accepted in Germany. Nevertheless, innovative concepts for defining goals in health care are urgently required, as the current debate in Germany on \"Nutzen\" (interestingly translated as 'benefit' instead of as 'utility') and integrated outcome models indicates. It remains to be seen whether this discussion will lead to a re-evaluation of the utility approach.","1278":"In health care, patient participation takes place on different levels. This article gives two examples of possible patient involvement on the micro level (evidence-based patient information and shared decision making) and, as examples for the macro level, a description of the opportunities for patient participation in decision making processes of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) and the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care in Germany (IQWiG). Future possibilities to enhance patient participation on the micro level include more rigorous evaluation of patient information and decision aids. The involvement of professional caregivers in the development of these tools might improve their use in health care. On the macro level, participation of patients in decision making should be further established (e.g., by increasing their resources). The involvement of patients in the weighting of patient-important outcomes before health technology assessment takes place could be a further enhancement.","1279":"In 1965, the effectiveness of psychoanalytic therapy was demonstrated, which was then included in the reimbursement schemes of the statutory health insurance. In 1987, epidemiologic evidence was provided for the high prevalence of psychosomatic diseases, often associated with a high risk load. Later a phase model described the effects of psychotherapy by the successive levels of remoralisation, symptom and functional improvement. On the basis of health insurance data Felliti (2002) provided plausible evidence for the psychosocial aetiology of most chronic somatic diseases. These data correspond to a dramatically reduced life expectancy. Thus, a causal bio-psycho-social chain exists between adverse childhood events (ACE), unspecific bodily tensions, dysfunctional health-related coping behavioural strategies (risk load), serious chronic diseases and premature death. In summary, psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy is a field of health care with a variety of target dimensions which can be brought together in an appropriate model.","1280":"Isolated risk factors are now regarded as less important in cardiovascular prevention than global absolute risk, which has been widely debated among clinical epidemiologists. However, the implications for the primary care consultation are less clear. Treating isolated risk factors such as high blood pressure is a complex procedure serving multiple purposes including emotional reassurance. Given recent study results, a change to polypill-like interventions seems likely. These require much less frequent measurements and adjustments and will therefore provide fewer opportunities for interaction between clinicians and patients. How primary care will respond to this paradigm shift is not clear.","1281":"Primary health care delivered by general practitioners and health services research are both moving through a field of high-grade complexity. Health services research questions try to highlight certain aspects of care but it has to be understood that these are just artificial sections of an interdependent network. Problems deriving from multiple objectives of health-related interventions and possible ways of dealing with them are presented, using a study on dementia care in general practice. A qualitative-quantitative design including pre and post phases leads to a marked increase of expenditure and duration of a study, but also enhances the applicability of the study results for health policy makers.","1282":"Using four main characteristics of general practice it will be shown that the one-dimensional outcome parameters that are used in health care, and increasingly so, are inappropriate for assessing the quality of care. On the contrary, such an oversimplification might be expected to be detrimental to the quality of health care. This should be kept in mind when planning studies on the quality of care in general practice. In this text general(ist) practice will be taken as a textbook example of medical, i.e., professional practice.","1283":"","1284":"","1285":"The objective of systematic reviews of the efficacy and safety of interventions is to determine in an unbiased and objective manner whether a proper balance between risks and benefits exists. However, systematic reviews including many Cochrane reports often get criticized for having an overly narrow focus on randomized controlled trials leading to results that have low applicability and do not adequately reflect the underlying risk-benefit profiles. The objective of this paper is to encourage the discussion on two important issues frequently covered inadequately in Cochrane reports: the assessment of adverse effects and the applicability of results. It also strives to outline approaches for improving the comprehensiveness and usability of Cochrane reports by including observational evidence for adverse effects assessment on a regular basis and by putting more emphasis on factors that determine the applicability of findings.","1286":"The impact that research evidence can have on patients making decisions about their own care is often overlooked. Regardless of whether patients want to lead or fully participate in their care, it appears that patients still want to be informed. We have health information that patients could benefit from knowing, a growing body of evidence and experiences about how to translate this information to patients. The Cochrane Collaboration, an organisation that produces and disseminates systematic reviews of healthcare interventions, translates the evidence from their reviews into summaries for the public. Research is presently being conducted to test a format for the plain language summaries. Principles such as presenting evidence in standard qualitative statements, as relative and absolute risks, as natural frequencies, and in tables are being incorporated into the format. Groups within the Collaboration are also translating the evidence for use by patients and the public. Effective strategies are being used to target patients directly and via their physicians, such as dissemination on specific patient group websites and decision aids. Research evidence and experiences can feed into the creation of evidence that patients can understand and use.","1287":"The present contribution describes the history of the Cochrane review on St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum L.) for depression. Work for the first version started in 1993, the year that saw the official foundation of the Cochrane Collaboration, but 3 years before a pertinent Cochrane review group was established. After the registration of the Collaborative Review Group for Depression, Anxiety and Neuroses (CCDAN) and the publication of a first print version of the review that included 23 trials in 1996 the first Cochrane version with 27 trials became available in 1998. Updates were completed in 2005 (37 included trials) and 2008 (29 trials). Due to changes in selection criteria and review methods the resources needed to complete the 2005 and 2008 updates were similar to those for the first version in 1996. Only one trial included in the 1996 version is still part of the 2008 version. Despite the large number of available trials and improvements in review methodology the current evidence is more difficult to interpret than in 1996.","1288":"The German Cochrane Centre in Freiburg contributed substantially to both the initiation of the Cochrane movement in Germany and to the development of evidence-based medicine. Alongside the Cochrane Centres, the Cochrane Review Groups are leading with responsibility for the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In doing so, Cochrane reviews need to be highly standardised, evaluate patient-oriented outcomes and also report these in the abstract and plain language summaries of the review. Furthermore, data extraction sheets should be a part of every Cochrane review in the appendices section. The new Cochrane software RevMan 5 and the information management system \"Archie\" stand for a formidable progress in the efficiency of editorial management. Continuous updates of Cochrane reviews will represent a great challenge for the future. Hence, updates should focus on patient-oriented outcomes and longer study duration to provide consumers with important up-to-date information. The future of the Cochrane Collaboration as a hallmark of high-quality health care information will depend on mastering the balancing act between exponentially increasing work loads and evidently unchanging resources.","1289":"The James Lind Library is an excellent source for documents on the history of the controlled clinical trial. It was named after the 18th century naval surgeon James Lind who performed a multi-arm controlled clinical trial on the treatment of scurvy. Iain Chalmers is a co-founder of the James Lind Library. In his presentation at the 10th anniversary of the GCC, he told us about a number of exemplary studies with special consideration of the evolution of methods to avoid allocation bias. He particularly stressed that over the centuries many individuals from many different countries have contributed to the standard of the randomised controlled trials of our days.","1290":"","1291":"In 2002 the Agency for Quality in Medicine developed an \"action plan\" to improve patient safety that can be summarized neatly as \"Sensitize, inform, discuss and implement strategies\". The following publication describes both the goals of this action plan and some of its implemented measures.","1292":"Both the quality and performance of health systems are strongly influenced by the number and the qualification of the professional staff. Quality assurance programs help to analyse causalities which are responsible for medical malpractice. On the basis of the experiences gained by the performance of established Quality Assurance Programs (QAP) in the North Rhine area since 1982 various aspects of the efficiency of these programs will be discussed. The implementation of legal regulations making these programs mandatory is criticised not only for its bureaucratic effect but also for the attempt to exclude professional experts from the interpretation of results. It is recommended to liberalize these regulations in order to facilitate improvement of methods and participation of the medical profession.","1293":"The legal framework of the statutory health insurance does not legitimize substandard therapy. There is no civil case law allowing for prescriptions that are not in line with the current \"state of the art\" procedures for economical reasons.","1294":"The risks of a less than optimum provision of drugs are shared between patients, medical staff, health insurances and the society as a whole. Often, though, they are unavoidable, sometimes due to legal constraints. Taking multiple myeloma, iron deficiency, and macula degeneration as examples it will be demonstrated that the optimal supply with drugs frequently involving off-label and not reimbursable drugs - cannot only benefit the patient, but can also be cost-saving for the health insurances. The most recent endeavours by the German government to restrain drug expenditures have remained ineffective. Nonetheless, it is expected from patients and physicians alike to bear an ever-increasing share of the health care costs. This problem has no universal solution. Common efforts of all participants in health care are necessary to find a way to evade the explosion of health care costs and to ensure continuous funding of drugs. It is important, however, that patients not be denied access to (often life-lengthening) drugs because of legal ramifications.","1295":"According to a multitude of international studies the safety of general drug treatment practice is not up to standard. It has been demonstrated that about 50% of adverse drug reactions are avoidable and that their main cause are medication errors. Such errors have often been related to dosing and non-consideration of contraindications and the individual patient's risk profile. In order to resolve this unacceptable situation pharmacovigilance has to be strengthened. Pharmacovigilance in this context does not only imply the assessment and collection of adverse drug reactions, but also the communication of treatment risks to the medical community as well as to pharmacists and patients, and the development and implementation of intelligent electronic prescribing systems. The Federal Government of Germany in co-operation with the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association has decided on a bunch of about 40 single measures to enhance drug safety in this country. This project was issued in November 2007 by the Federal Ministry of Health. The Drug Commission will be responsible for the co-ordination of any future actions.","1296":"Complementary therapies require a differentiated treatment by all the legal fields involved. First, this refers to medical malpractice law dealing with the question of medical indication, its interaction with \"classical\" medicine and the need for extensive patient information on the potential ineffectiveness of the--partly very expensive--complementary therapies. Second, it also refers to the legal specifications of the medical profession as well as health insurance law. The question is whether the expenses of an alternative therapy are borne by the statutory or private health insurance and whether it is justified to try a complementary therapy when faced with an incurable disease. In the following the range of legal aspects shall be illuminated on the basis of the relevant jurisdiction.","1297":"In public opinion methods and drugs of the so called complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) are regarded as safe and risk-free. The data on both efficacy and risks and adverse events (AEs) are insufficient. But serious direct (e.g., injuries, immunological AFs, drug interactions) and indirect risks (cases of missed essential diagnoses and therapy, etc.) and even deaths have been recorded. Refusal of vaccination poses a risk to both individuals and the general public. Factors increasing these risks by promoting questionable methods need to be considered as well. The public needs to be informed of the risks. An increased vigilance of physicians and the systematic collection of data is required.","1298":"Medical devices define our everyday patient treatment processes. But despite the beneficial effect, every use can also lead to damages. Use errors are thus often explained by human failure. But human errors can never be completely extinct, especially in such complex work processes like those in medicine that often involve time pressure. Therefore we need error-tolerant work systems in which potential problems are identified and solved as early as possible. In this context human engineering uses the TOP principle: technological before organisational and then person-related solutions. But especially in everyday medical work we realise that error-prone usability concepts can often only be counterbalanced by organisational or person-related measures. Thus human failure is pre-programmed. In addition, many medical work places represent a somewhat chaotic accumulation of individual devices with totally different user interaction concepts. There is not only a lack of holistic work place concepts, but of holistic process and system concepts as well. However, this can only be achieved through the co-operation of producers, healthcare providers and clinical users, by systematically analyzing and iteratively optimizing the underlying treatment processes from both a technological and organizational perspective. What we need is a joint platform like medilab V of the TU Berlin, in which the entire medical treatment chain can be simulated in order to discuss, experiment and model--a key to a safe and efficient healthcare system of the future.","1299":"There is ample proof for the efficacy of psychotherapy but no systematic research on unwanted effects. Cases of malpractice represent a special problem as they always result from a therapist's inadequate behaviour. Furthermore, it is especially difficult in psychotherapy to distinguish between negative life events, unavoidable and undesirable developments of the disease, side effects of psychotherapy and positive treatment effects. In psychotherapy unwanted effects (UEs) can occur in the context of diagnostic problems, selection of the wrong treatment focus, technically inadequate interventions, sensitization processes, or inadequate development of a therapeutic alliance. Examples and case vignettes will be presented for these types of UEs and conclusions will be drawn as to how UE management can be improved.","1300":"Since 1988 the MDK (Medical Service of the health insurances) in Lower Saxony has frequently been asked to clinically assess potential malpractice cases according to the German social law (Sect. 66 SGB V and Sect. 116 SGB X). In Lower Saxony this amounts to more than 2,000 assessments per year. By far the most treatment errors as compared to all other medical disciplines are seen in the surgical field. Surprisingly, the highest rate of errors is found in diagnostic and case management rather than in actual surgical therapy. With about 20% the complaint rate with the MDK of Lower Saxony has largely remained unchanged during the last years.","1301":"Recently, the medical profession has increasingly engaged in the development of non-medical assistant jobs who try to take on more and more duties that have previously been the physicians' responsibility. Here, medical professionals from the fields of anaesthesiology and surgery should be mentioned in particular. Against this background of medical supply deficits (especially in the newly formed German states) the Federal Government already stated during the negotiations over coalition formation that nursing care professionals need to be involved into medical care much more strongly. In the context of the healthcare reform the Federal Government has thus arranged to alter the rules regarding statutory health insurance physicians by transferring original medical duties and responsibilities to nursing care professionals within the scope of pilot projects. Against this background the German Medical Association has asked all Scientific Medical Societies and medical professional associations to comment on the delegation of medical responsibilities.","1302":"The organisational responsibility in a hospital lies with the individual who is actually (co-) responsible for the error (for example, the senior consultant, medical director, nursing manager, administrative director or manager of a hospital). According to the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), staff shortages are no excuse for the failure to adhere to the standard of care. According to a judgement of the Labour Court in Wilhelmshaven the Senior Consultant of a hospital is entitled to be provided with the necessary number of staff by the hospital owner who is obliged to provide a round-the-clock specialist care standard. Care should be taken that no employees be deployed who are overtired from working the previous night shift. Timely information of the follow-up physician about therapeutic issues resulting from the hospital treatment is demanded. Risk prevention strategies developed by an expert group as a form of risk management are reasonable and also requested by some liability insurances.","1303":"A doctor's third-party liability is one of the highest risk classes. This is not due to increasing claims expenditure only, but in particular to the issue of long-tail claims. This class imposes high demands on a third party liability insurer (underwriter), who must not only be well-versed in pricing and underwriting and highly competent in settling claims in both a professional and socially responsible manner, but has a duty to exhaust all possibilities of risk management.","1304":"Claims of lethal medical malpractice cases in penal law are mostly dealt with by experts in forensic medicine since in lethal cases the autopsy is crucial for determining the cause of death. Knowledge of the cause of death, in turn, is the necessary basis of an expert opinion on negligence and the causality between negligence and cause of death. Compared to civil lawsuits filed for malpractice and cases dealt with at the arbitration committees of the medical councils penal lawsuits with 1500 to 2000 cases per year are of minor importance. Our own retrospective multicentre study on lawsuits filed for lethal cases of medical malpractice (based on autopsy findings of 4450 cases) revealed an annual increase in autopsies due to medical negligence from 3 to 6 hundred. Hospital doctors are more frequently affected by medical malpractice claims than private-practice physicians. However, the rate of confirmed medical malpractice cases is much higher for doctors in private practice. Although surgeons are most frequently charged with medical malpractice the rate of confirmed medical malpractice cases is comparatively low in surgery. Medico-legal autopsies in cases of alleged medical malpractice are often ordered by the public prosecutor because the manner of death was classified as unnatural or undetermined. Therefore the often-heard reproach that doctors frequently make mistakes and do their very best to hide them is not true. Thus, it has to be recommended that in a case of unexpected death associated with medical treatment the doctor in his own interest should classify the manner of death as undetermined.","1305":"Repeatedly expressed worries that doctors are at risk for malpractice suits and for ending up in prison do not really reflect reality. An empirical study on public prosecutors' offices demonstrated that malpractice proceedings where doctors were blamed for treatment errors had predominantly been closed. If a long time passes between the opening and the closing proceedings this is often due to the colleagues who take more than average time to state their expert opinion as requested. In most cases these expert medical opinions are decisive in the outcome of these proceedings.","1306":null,"1307":"Every course of medical action is associated with some kind of risks. Basically, it is the patient who bears these risks; there is no strict medical liability. The physician can only be held liable for damages resulting from avoidable medical errors. The physician protects himself from liability for these kinds of damages by informing the patient about not entirely avoidable risks and any secondary damages. Hence proper patient information is also a means of exonerating the physician from liability for not entirely avoidable risks.","1308":"Knowledge about the benefits and harms of cancer screening is essential for physicians and patients making informed decisions. However, we will demonstrate that many physicians' and patients' knowledge of cancer screening is alarmingly limited. Only about 5 percent of the patients correctly estimate its benefits, while most either highly overestimate these benefits or do not know about their magnitude. Relying on a doctor's judgment alone is not always advantageous: One third of the gynaecologists investigated were ignorant of the benefits of mammography screening, and 79 percent were unable to interpret a positive result (the positive predictive value). Nor does consulting a patient brochure guarantee more knowledge, as only few brochures contain transparent and evidence-based information about the benefits and harms of cancer screenings. Hence, informed consent is unlikely to take place in everyday practice. Truly informed decision making in medicine requires more evidence and transparency for patients as well as a better statistical training of physicians.","1309":"","1310":"","1311":"","1312":"Patients and consumers are increasingly searching the Internet for medical and healthcare information. Using the criteria of evidence-based medicine the present study analyses the websites of Wikipedia and two major German statutory health insurances for content and presentation of patient information. 22 senior students of health sciences and education evaluated one topic each. In a first step, they identified the evidence for their specific question. Afterwards they used their results as reference for the evaluation of the three websites. Using a check list each student and a second researcher independently rated content and presentation of the information offered. All these websites failed to meet relevant criteria, and key information such as the presentation of probabilities of success on patient-relevant outcomes, probabilities of unwanted effects, and unbiased risk communication was missing. On average items related to the objectives of interventions, the natural course of disease and treatment options were only rated as \"partially fulfilled\". Overall, there were only minor differences between the three providers, except for items related to the specific nature of the websites such as disclosure of authorship, conflict of interest and support offers. In addition, the Wikipedia information tended to achieve lower comprehensibility. In conclusion, the quality of the healthcare information provided by Wikipedia and two major German statutory health insurances is comparable. They do not meet important criteria of evidence-based patient and consumer information though.","1313":"Transparent and effective quality management is an essential marketing tool for maternity clinics. Procedures for quality assurance in maternity clinics differ from those in other medical professions. Apart from evidence-based health care the pregnant woman's choice of maternity services providers is increasingly influenced by a number of other factors as well, such as, for example, the response to individual needs or the staff. Hence, the facilities need to present their services and quality of care according to the needs of the target group. In order to identify these needs, a survey was performed among 152 pregnant women during the \"Baby Fair\", which took place in Berlin in 2006. The objective of the survey was to find out about the preferences and expectations of pregnant women towards the maternity clinic and breastfeeding and their current criteria for the choice of a maternity clinic. The questionnaire contained questions about expectations towards the maternity clinic staff, traditional medicine and alternative medicine, premises, courses offered, rooming-in and expectations towards breastfeeding. The findings from the survey show that the pregnant women's ratings for personal contact, expertise and kindness of the staff were twice as high as for premises, comfort and service. The provision of traditional versus alternative medicine was rated equally. More than 90% of the respondents do see a demand for specific public relations campaigns by maternity clinics concerning information about the particular institution, its range of activities and the impact and process of rooming-in. Only 20% of the respondents felt sufficiently informed about breastfeeding. Besides medical and technical factors, staff factors play a key role in the assessment of maternity clinics. In addition to evidence-based medical information communication strategies should also include information on the staff employed. In particular, information is lacking on rooming-in and breastfeeding, which emphasises the necessity for the timely provision of scientifically based information to pregnant women. ","1314":"In recent years, many industrialised countries have moved forward initiatives to reinforce their primary healthcare sector. At the same time, there has been an increased emphasis on the engagement of patients as partners in their care. Consequently, the process by which patients are engaged to share their preferences and become involved in healthcare decisions is changing and pushing the needs for a new kind of knowledge tools, namely patients decision aids. We argue that for shared decision making to be adopted in primary care practices, patient decision aids will need to be embedded in routine clinical care. Subsequently, the objectives of this paper are twofold: to briefly review the knowledge base regarding the implementation of shared decision making in clinical practice and to identify the gaps in knowledge that will need to be addressed for the effective implementation of shared decision making in clinical practice to occur.","1315":"Medical decision making is sometimes viewed as a relatively simple process in which a decision may be made by the patient, by the physician, or by both patient and physician working together. This two-dimensional portrayal eclipses the important role that others, such as other professionals, family, and friends, may play in the process; as an example of this phenomenon, we trace the evolution of a decision of a teenager with cancer who is contemplating discontinuing chemotherapy. This example also shows how a decision can usefully be understood as consisting of a number of identifiable substeps--what we call the \"microstructure\" of the decision. These steps show how the physician can play an important role without usurping the patient's rightful decisional authority.","1316":"This paper focuses on the ethics of constructing and using a specific evidence-based decision aid that aims to contribute to clinical shared decision-making processes. Results of this integrated empirical ethics study demonstrate how both the production and presentation of scientific information in an evidence-based decision-support contain implicit presuppositions and values, which pre-structure the moral environment of the shared decision-making process. As a consequence, the evidence-based decision support did not only support the decision-making process; it also transformed it in a morally significant way. This phenomenon undermines the assumption within much of the literature on patient autonomy and shared decision-making implying that information disclosure is a conditional requirement before patient autonomy and shared decision-making even starts. The central point of this paper is that decision aids and evidence-based medicine are not value-free and that patient autonomy and shared decision-making are already influenced during the production and presentation of scientific information. Consequences for both the development of decision-aids and the practice of shared decision-making are discussed.","1317":"Shared decision making relies on the exchange of information between the physician and the patient and the involvement of both patient and physician in making the decision. Informed shared decision making thus requires that patients and doctors understand the benefits and harms of different treatment options. This, however, is severely undermined by what we call collective statistical illiteracy. Both patients and physicians have difficulties to understand the meaning of numbers so that an effective risk communication cannot take place. Risk communication based on misunderstandings, however, renders the \"informed\" in informed shared decision making obsolete. We show that the problem of statistical illiteracy can largely be solved by changing the representation of statistical information. Insight can be achieved by communicating risks in absolute, not relative terms; by using a frequentist formulation, which makes the reference class clear instead of communicating single event probabilities; and by communicating natural frequencies instead of conditional probabilities.","1318":"","1319":"","1320":"Physical restraints are routinely used in nursing home residents in Germany. Bedrails are applied to at least one of four residents. Belts, fixed tables and other measures are less frequent but are still used as routine measures. So far, beneficial effects of the use of physical restraints have not been shown, negative effects are likely. A recently completed observational study in 30 nursing homes in Hamburg showed great variations between centres concerning the frequency of restraint use. An evidence-based practice guideline could be the appropriate measure to reduce physical restraints and overcome centre variations. Currently, there are no evidence-based practice guidelines for the avoidance of physical restraints in nursing homes. This applies to nursing practice in Germany in general. The \"German Network for Quality Development in Nursing (DNQP)\" deliberately distinguishes their so-called \"national expert standards\" from \"medical\" practice guidelines. Funded by the German Ministry of Education and Science, a project aiming to develop an evidence-based practice guideline on the avoidance of physical restraints in nursing homes, for the first time applies internationally discussed methods to a nursing guideline in Germany. This article describes the methodological framework, instruments and processes of the guideline's development.","1321":"The off-label use of drugs in paediatrics is a common practice casting doubts on the adequate safety of drug therapy. Regulatory initiatives of European and national legislators aim to address this paucity of clinical drug trials in paediatrics through clarifying regulations and incentives in pharmaceutical law, thereby promoting an increase in the approval of paediatric drugs, the improvement of drug and thus treatment safety. This paper describes the present situation in paediatrics and the legal status of off-label use in pharmaceutical law, medical malpractice law and statutory health insurance law.","1322":"In Germany orphan (or rare) diseases are not a major issue of healthcare-related social security law. Laws, regulations, courts and the legislature have so far not succeeded in shaping an adequate legal approach. The deficient legal framework seems to correlate to the lack of medical knowledge about orphan diseases. Consequently, equal access to treatment--one of the principles of the German healthcare system--for patients suffering from orphan diseases is not sufficiently assured. Therefore, German legislation is facing the urgent challenge to compensate for the lack of medical knowledge and healthcare resources in this field by defining new rules, by establishing specific health authorities and by reforming the allocation of research efforts. In a way, rare diseases are orphans that attract little public and scientific interest. Provision of an adequate legal framework for the treatment of and research into orphan diseases is likely to promote significant improvements for those affected.","1323":"The term rare disease is often used to justify why special study designs and, in particular, randomisation cannot be implemented and therefore cannot be requested. Definitions of rare diseases are not uniform, and absolute numbers of common definitions are large enough to perform clinical trials. Due to smaller patient numbers in common clinical trials patients with rare diseases are subject to a higher risk for imprecise results. Increasing this risk by using inadequate methodological designs is not justified. A compromise regarding the special situation of these patients is acceptable for certain details but not for the main study concept. It should be made clear that patients with rare diseases have the same right to receive adequately tested treatments as all other patients.","1324":"There is a considerable amount of uncertainty regarding the care of individual patients. The present paper describes the handling of uncertainties in patient care and its relevance for shared and informed decision-making. What affects the physician-patient relationship, and which strategies may contribute to communicating uncertainties in a constructive manner? Data from clinical trials describe and reduce our knowledge about uncertainty of treatment effects. Regarding rare diseases, however, we are faced with methodological limitations since randomised controlled trials (the highest level of evidence) are not feasible. But other 'low-level' evidence is available and should not be neglected but systematically collected and evaluated as resources for further research activities.","1325":"Uncertainty is ever-present when doctors make decisions. For general practitioners (GPs) the task of diagnosing and prognosing is particularly difficult. They are faced with a broad range of unselected patients and their problems. For this particular task they have developed strategies that are adapted to the ecology of their practice. Some of these rules and heuristics are intended to reduce the likelihood of harm to the patient, e.g. missing a serious disease. Others help doctors and their patients to deal with uncertainty on a subjective level. Cognitive processes of practicing doctors are still far from being elucidated. However, reflecting on their work will help professionals improve their development and the quality of their work.","1326":"With rare diseases the evidence base is often poor. The reasons are, among other things: (a) strict separation of evidence users (i.e. physicians and patients) and evidence producers (i.e. scientists); (b) lack of methods and procedures for the inclusion of unused evidence sources in medical care (e.g. documentation of individual disease development, subjective patient experiences); (c) low level of referral to specialized physicians; (d) lack of rewards for the disclosure of unused but relevant evidence sources. The development of suitable methods, aids and incentives should also focus on the individual physician-patient interaction. Even today medical care suppliers can positively influence the patients' motivation for participating in the continuous documentation of the disease process. Adequate management of the medical records is not only useful for individual care, but--with suitable procedures like registers being available--on a collective level also. It should be checked which alterations in incentive systems and supporting programmes might be able to improve evidence-promoting documentation and analysis.","1327":"","1328":"","1329":"The aim of a health technology assessment (HTA) is the complete and comprehensive evaluation of a medical technology or intervention. This includes the consideration of ethical aspects associated with the use of a medical technology or with the technology evaluation process. In this context, ethics, as a moral philosophy, embraces issues of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Presentation of the working steps to retrieve information on ethical aspects; documentation and description of the various information sources available, as well as of the search terms and strategies tailored to the respective information sources. In addition to well-known national and international information sources such as bibliographic databases for HTA, biomedical sciences (e.g., MEDLINE), social sciences, and psychology, ethics databases are also used in the retrieval of information, which is performed analogously to the working steps applied in the retrieval of information for the evaluation of a health technology's clinical benefit. The databases allow search queries that present a combination of thesaurus and free-text terms or those that exclusively consist of free-text terms. The search results are completed by supplementary handsearching of ethics journals, websites of HTA institutions and institutions\/organisations with key activities involving ethics and, if necessary, requests to ethics experts. Although the search for information on ethical issues of medical technologies is performed according to the same procedures as those that are followed in clinical benefit assessments, specific search strategies and additional specialist information sources are needed. ","1330":"Randomisation is regarded as an essential principle ensuring the internal validity of clinical trials. This is why randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lead every evidence hierarchy of therapeutic interventions. At the same time, there are controversies about the role of RCTs in health research. The article addresses the principle of randomisation and deals with some of the more prominent arguments against RCT.","1331":"Dizziness can be due to multiple causes. However, the aetiology often remains unclear. At the same time, there is a lack of evidence-based treatment options. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of dizziness-related diagnoses, referrals and prescriptions in a general practice database. Data from computerized patient records of 138 general practices participating in the MedViP project were used for cross-sectional analysis of the time period April 2001 until December 2002. The identification of dizzy patients was performed via ICD-10 diagnoses, free text fields and medication issued for dizziness. Frequencies were counted and odds ratios calculated to describe associations between diagnoses and medication. For the period of investigation, 10,971 patients (from a total of 317,042 documented patients) were given at least one diagnosis of dizziness (prevalence 3.4%; mean age 59 years, 67.2% female). In 80.2% of the cases dizziness was coded as a symptom (R42) rather than a discrete disease. Prescriptions for dizziness were rather uncommon. An analysis of ATC codes showed that 6.6% of all affected patients were prescribed a specific drug for dizziness, most frequently betahistine. Antiemetics were prescribed in 7.1%, and the homeopathic preparation \"Vertigoheel\" in 2.8% of the dizzy patients. Betahistine was significantly more often prescribed for \"unspecified\" dizziness, vestibular neuritis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; but not for Meniere's disease. It was given less often in \"other peripheral\" and in central vertigo as well as in cases where the symptom was coded (R42). 3.9% of the dizzy patients had been referred to the neurologist (55.4%), ENT-specialist (30.5%) or to both specialists (14.1%). The manner of coding and prescribing reflects both a symptom-orientated classification used by general practitioners and the limitation of treatment options. ","1332":"Quality management is part of Good Medical Practice. Surveys of both patient satisfaction and collaborative aspects of medical care amongst physicians in hospital and primary care are essential. In February 2006, 92 questionnaires were distributed among office-based paediatricians in Leipzig and its suburbs. Until the reply deadline, which was in April 2006, 43 of the questionnaires had been completed and returned. The questionnaire examined attitudes of the referring physicians towards the hospital. Considering all answers, the Children's Hospital of the University of Leipzig received a positive rating. The results were influenced both by the age of the responding physicians and by the answer to the question of whether the respondents had previously been employed by the Children's Hospital of the University of Leipzig. This survey revealed important data on the attitudes of practitioners towards the strengths and weaknesses of the hospital. As a result, concrete measures could be implemented to enhance this co-operation with general practitioners. ","1333":null,"1334":null,"1335":"The Bremen General Practitioner's Association developed an interactive education tool about top-selling drugs in the GP setting. The data on various high-priced drugs identified by systematic literature search were processed by small work groups during several training courses for general practitioners and the results presented in plenary sessions. The training courses were systematically evaluated and enhanced. This is a well developed concept for the implementation of clinical evidence in the context of general practice. There will be a randomized controlled trial about the effect of this educational concept on the prescription behavior of general practitioners. ","1336":"","1337":"A decisive influence on the attractiveness of the German drug market is exerted by the institutions responsible for the prescribability of a drug in the framework of the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). In this most lucrative segment of the German market, a host of reforms in recent years has led to declining transparency, where the short-lived regulatory interventions aimed - with limited success - at containing the increase in expenditure on drugs. From 1997 to 2003, however, new and patented drugs were largely protected against regulatory measures, such as fixed reimbursement rates (reference prices). However, only little use was made of this additional promotion of research activities. The majority of the new drugs in this period were me-too products, which only rarely had therapeutic advantages or advantages in the price competition with established medicines. In addition, the pharmaceutical companies widely use the privilege to set a price for drugs being prescribed in the SHI without undertaking any negotiations or presenting cost-effectiveness studies, which is unique in the European comparison. In future, the decision regarding the reimbursability of, or the reimbursable amount for, a preparation should thus be geared to lasting, transparent and unequivocal criteria guided by efficiency optimization and therapeutic progress.","1338":"The relation between education in the context of the socioeconomic construct and health has not yet been fully elucidated, despite numerous findings that have accumulated in about 150 years. Rather, the growing knowledge of the complex interaction of various domains, which are important for health, comes to the fore. Miscellaneous biological, social, medical, behavioural and environmental parameters play a role, whereas primary medicine may have a direct protective influence on almost all population-based indicators of health. The translation of these factors into individual reality is modulated by additional circumstances like the physician-patient relationship, influences that strongly frame the normal course of life such as working conditions, and the increasingly overburdening by an overflow of information as well as health care deficiencies. Education alone does not guarantee improved health; instead it is part of a widespread continuous contest with negative aspects of a global nature which increasingly limit the quality of life and the natural habitat.","1339":"It is widely accepted that clinical trials have to be carefully reviewed for internal validity. In addition, aspects of external validity, which is also known as 'generalizability' or 'directness', must be considered. The question of whether the study results can be applied to clinical practice under different conditions than the study itself is of major importance. In contrast to internal validity, external validity has to be viewed as an aspect of the situation, not of a study per se. Assessment of external validity addresses the question of whether effects (comparisons between treatments) are different between patient groups or clinical situations. It is not sufficient and may even not be important whether the patients differ. In epidemiology this situation is well known as 'effect modification.' External validity can be assessed according to the PICO scheme. However, empirical data about effect modifiers are scarce. Consequently, external validity is merely a matter of clinical judgement.","1340":"The clinical practice guidelines of the Drug Commission of the German Medical Association (DCGMA) are intended to provide a solid basis of therapeutic rationality. Being evidence-based and practice-orientated, these guidelines are not supposed to restrict or replace independent and responsible action. The DCGMA board selects the topics with their importance to general practice being a relevant criterion. A multidisciplinary working group comprising DCGMA experts that have no conflict of interest with the pharmaceutical industry is then established. A panel of office-based physicians is involved in the process of establishing consensus. Once the paper is accepted, the respective professional societies are consulted. Finally, the guideline is released by the DCGMA board and distributed via different publications and educational events. DCGMA clinical practice guidelines are developed in consideration of the best available evidence; however, for many questions of pharmacological treatment the evidence remains fragmentary. In addition, there are many points where the results of clinical research, currently often funded by pharmaceutical companies, might not be unbiased.","1341":"There are only a few studies exploring the quality of undergraduate, graduate and continuing medical education, and there is no systematic approach to evaluating the different spheres of competence--knowledge, medical skills and attitudes. Medical state examination results are not appropriate for assessing the quality of medical education. The implementation of statutory continuing medical education requires quality assurance of its contents, which so far has not been implemented. In the majority of hospitals there is a lack graduate medical education programmes. Future challenges that have to be addressed include important problem areas such as standardized evaluation, recruitment of qualified junior researchers, dealing with the Bologna process, teaching the teachers, quality assurance in continuing medical education and lifelong learning. Since a correlation must be assumed between poor knowledge of the quality of undergraduate, graduate and continuing medical education and the quality of this education itself, we need to close the gap of knowledge relating to the quality of medical education.","1342":"Our healthcare services face radical changes. We are in the middle of the \"third healthcare revolution\", driven by patients, information technology, and knowledge. Attitudes are changing with a revolution called \"consumerism\", characterized by expectations for better healthcare and more transparent decision-making. As knowledge-based authority becomes increasingly important, knowledge management will be a major responsibility of healthcare management in the 21st century, and the ongoing information technology revolution will enable efficient knowledge communication to clinicians and patients. As professionals usually lag 1-2 decades behind the \"Zeitgeist\", the challenge is to adapt to the revolution and help shape the healthcare services of the future.","1343":"Non-compliance in patients is rarely provoked by intention or laziness. Thus, patients should not be the first to be blamed for lack of therapeutic success. Non-compliance from health care providers to supply patients with necessary information and skills, though, is an important cause of insufficient treatment outcomes. Patient knowledge can improve health outcomes. But this knowledge must be evidence-based and relevant for the patient. In addition, knowledge must enable patients to assume an important part in disease control and treatment. Evaluation of patient information or self-management programmes should consider that knowledge is just one component of a complex intervention. Self-management programmes for type 1 diabetes or severe asthma are examples of where patient knowledge as part of a complex intervention may lead to substantially improved treatment outcomes. Disease-unspecific self-management programmes like the expert patient programme do not lead to important changes of relevant outcome measures. Patients and consumers want to participate in medical decision-making. However, there is a lack of evidence-based patient information for most indications. Informed decision-making by patients may lead to intelligent non-compliance and worsening of treatment outcome according to conventional assessment criteria. Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) hits a public that lacks competencies in critical health literacy. Critical health literacy which combines the concept of evidence-based medicine and health literacy should be integrated into existing school curricula.","1344":"","1345":"Draft versions presented by the Federal Ministry of Justice and proposals submitted from the political parties represented in the German Bundestag as well as an alternative draft issued by criminal law teachers and a decision of the German Lawyers and Law Teachers Association (Deutscher Juristentag) all seek to achieve a legal regulation of euthanasia. Contrary to the regulation in the Netherlands, the prohibition of active direct euthanasia is largely maintained. The drafts suggest that the so-called passive euthanasia and the indirect euthanasia be regulated through provisions for the termination and\/or limitation of life-sustaining measures and the permission for measures that alleviate pain and suffering regardless of the risk of bringing about death. The Federal Ministry of Justice (BMJ) and the draft versions of the Bundestag bring to the fore the introduction of an advance directive to be adopted as a tool for self-determination and treatment limitation. The advance directive alone lacks sufficient regulation though. It should be permitted, but is no more than a means of \"transport\". What is to be \"transported\" as the patient's will at the end of his or her life, however, requires regulation, too.","1346":"Rationing is an emotive issue in the field of public health. This complicates the rational discourse, which is indispensable for analyzing the rationing conditions as set out by constitutional law and which requires manifold differentiation and consideration that shall briefly be outlined in the following short contribution. Of central significance is the distinction between indirect and direct rationing as well as the reference to the essential responsibility of legislators for rationing decisions.","1347":"Old-age-based rationing of health care takes places both implicitly and explicitly. Its effects show on an emotional level and it affects medical practice. A distinction is made between explicit and implicit health care rationing. For example, performing fewer human organ transplants can be regarded as explicit rationing. Implicit or soft rationing may arise through either an undersupply of medical and nursing staff or through an oversupply of medical care as a consequence of the DRG bonus system. In this way an underlying and misleading incentive for an oversupply of diagnoses and treatments is created while at the same time the pressure is increased to reduce the length of hospital stay. Consequently, patients especially miss out on what they need most at this late stage of life: care and time to care. There are no clear rules for old-age-based health care rationing, which undermines the credibility of the health care system.","1348":"Regarding the post-mortal right of privacy a distinction must be made between post-mortal protection of the personality, the post-mortal duty of confidentiality and the problems associated with the necessity to consent to a clinical post-mortem. The post-mortal protection of the personality both grants the post-mortal right to respect for privacy, which can be asserted by rights holder, and entitles to claim damages resulting from breach of any proprietary elements of the right to post-mortal privacy. The post-mortal duty of confidentiality protects against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information about the patient even after his death. The physician has to decide whether the consent of the deceased may be presumed; however, he\/she has to state the reasons why, due to medical confidentiality, he\/she feels unable to disclose such information. Basically, the consent for clinical post-mortem can be effectively declared by way of a refusal clause in the hospital admission contract.","1349":null,"1350":"Following a debate of more than 30 years the \"Dutch Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide Act\" has come into force in 2002. Basically, the termination of life on request will in accordance with the Criminal Code remain punishable. Punishability is precluded if the physician notifies the review committee that he has performed termination of life on request and the committee is of the opinion that the physician has satisfied the due care criteria dictated in the Act. The Public Prosecution Service will not be informed, so the physician cannot be penalized. The review committee is composed of a lawyer, a physician and an expert on ethical issues.","1351":"The definition of the legal prerequisites for the permissible withholding\/withdrawal of medical treatment, the limits to a physician's obligation to provide medical care as well as the differentiation between the aiding with suicide, which is exempt from punishment, and the punishable termination of life upon request or failure to render assistance is actually one of the most difficult medico-legal, professional-ethical, human, ideological and moral problems. The numerous views and opinions expressed are varying accordingly so that the call for legislative action comes as no surprise. Nonetheless, legal practice has provided clarity for a large number of aspects. The life of a human being scores the highest on the value scale of the Basic Law (GG) of the Federal Republic of Germany; the right to self-determination is of particular significance. It does not imply the \"right to suicide\", though, but suicide--and the participation in it--is not subject to punishment. But if the physician exercises control over the act (\"Tatherrschaft\") he is required to provide all necessary and reasonable life-saving assistance. There is general consent that assistance with dying by way of intentional killing (active direct euthanasia) is a crime whereas palliative treatment of the terminally ill while accepting the unintentional and inevitable side effect of hastening the patient's death is justified (so-called indirect euthanasia). The so-called passive euthanasia which is characterised by withholding\/withdrawing treatment measures is associated with the most difficult problems. In this context the permissible ,,assistance in dying\", i.e., the actual euthanasia, has to be distinguished from ,,help to die\", that is, euthanasia in a broader sense, as the Federal Supreme Court (BGH) correctly pointed out in its leading decision (BGHSt 40, 257 et sqq.). Within this differentiation the advance directive is of particular importance since only subsidiary reference may be made to the ,,presumed will or consent\" of the patient and, if this cannot be identified, to \"general values\" for the physician's decision-making. If the patient's will or the general values cannot be identified unambiguously, the protection of life must take priority with the patient's physician, his relatives or his guardian, unless there is no medical indication for the respective treatment procedure.","1352":"\"Sentenced to life\". In German newspaper and journal articles as well as on television a controversial debate has emerged about the right-to-die. In history and many Western countries people have always been discussing assisted suicide. Under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, terminally ill adult Oregonians are allowed to obtain and use prescriptions from their physicians for self-administered, lethal medications. The Oregon Public Health Division is required by the Act to collect information on compliance and to issue an annual report. This has been made public. According to these data, there was no slippery slope. In addition, no philosophical arguments can be put forward for the absolute prohibition against suicide of the terminally ill. This should give impetus to efforts to find solutions for the patients in all Western countries.","1353":"The debate on euthanasia that has been started all over Europe, but especially in Germany has been particularly complicated by unclear and inconsistent definitions. Medical decisions in end-of-life care gain increasing importance not only for the time of death but also for the kind and quality of the dying process. Though legal regulations can help to diminish doubts about the permissibility of various measures in end-of-life care, teaching and knowledge of ethical principles, communication skills, respect, transparency and knowledge of palliative care options seem to be the most important factors in accompanying the dying professionally and with dignity and even in achieving a consented compromise when aid in hastening death is asked for.","1354":"With an enduring power of attorney you can appoint someone to make decisions on your behalf if you are no longer able to do so yourself, and you may give this proxy as narrow or as broad powers as you wish. If you want to avoid the appointment of a legal representative (guardian), this power of attorney should reasonably cover all pertinent proprietary and personal affairs. A person who has issued a comprehensive power of attorney does not need a legal guardian. Only in the absence of an enduring power of attorney does the court appoint a legal guardian. A representation agreement allows you to appoint someone you trust as your legal representative in the event of your incapacity. An advance directive (living will) specifies the medical procedures and the health situations in which the principal wants or refuses the respective treatment. The advance directive is made effective if the principal is no more able to make or communicate his\/her decisions.","1355":"Enduring powers of attorney and advance directives (living wills) are prepared to specifically address the occurrence of age-related legal incompetence or disease-related incapacity. Everyday legal practice shows that in connection with these precautionary tools similar constellations of certain problems may occur in the individual case. Regarding enduring powers of attorney, the guardianship courts are requested to appoint a guardian in a case where it is unclear whether a power of attorney has effectively been granted in the first place or revoked by the grantor. But also, self-serving behaviour of the principal, multiple powers of attorney and the lack of acceptance in the field of legal relations may entail guardianship court action. Within the framework of a living will individuals appeal to guardianship courts to bindingly determine whether to refrain from a medical or nursing procedure contrary to the medical indication. Often there is contradictory information about whether a living will has been communicated verbally and, if so, about the statements expressed therein. The issues of effective execution, clarity of content, revocation and the legal or binding effect of living wills in court proceedings are likewise important.","1356":"If a person wants to preclude other people making decisions on his\/her behalf, this needs to be recorded in a legally relevant form by means of a declaration of intent. For example, the latter could be a contract (nursing home contract) or an advance directive. The circumstances under which a declaration becomes effective have to be exactly and carefully worded. Also, it has to be accurately defined who is to enforce the declaration of intent against defiance and in which situation. Physicians, lawyers, nursing staff, politicians, members of ethics committees, sponsors, relatives--everyone may have a different opinion, and the patient's well-being might easily be ignored. A legal regulation will contribute little to safety at the end of life. The responsibility lies with the physician. The legislator cannot guide the physician's therapeutic decisions, but an invalid patient can who has expressed his desire to die and unmistakably advised his physician on when to refrain from which procedures.","1357":"Problems in nursing homes, which have become the focus of public attention in recent years, increasingly require German courts to deal with nursing home-specific circumstances. Frequently these cases concern liability for falls or inadequate measures to prevent falls or decubitus ulcers (bedsore), the permissibility of restraints such as bed rails, belts and so forth, as well as the refusal to terminate life-extending treatment by the nursing home operator. Issues relating to the extent of the nursing home operator's duties of protection and the duty of care owed by him--taking account of the basic rights of the nursing home resident--as well as issues relating to the burden of proof play a central role in liability cases. In cases relating to the termination of treatment, the nursing home operator generally refuses to stop treatment providing a series of \"standard arguments\". The present paper presents the state-of-the-art of the still developing pertinent case law.","1358":"The end of life represents a borderline situation for all participants in a general practice setting. The patient finds himself trapped in the border zone of life and death and is faced with a multitude of existential and spiritual problems. The family doctor has to realize that the common decision-making pathways employed in everyday practice are hardly effective in palliative care. At this point it may be to the patient's benefit to decide against certain possible treatment options. Family and friends come into touch with the limits of their personal (com-) passion. Having to deal with feelings like powerlessness, helplessness and grief and being faced with one's own finiteness poses an enormous challenge.","1359":"Current regulations regarding living wills need to be revised in order to avoid conflicts between patients or their relatives\/surrogates on one side, and physicians on the other. For wording the will the patient should seek not only legal, but also medical advice. For doctors treating the patient, it would be helpful if a written statement existed in which the patient identifies what kind of medical treatment he\/she wants. This would apply to cases in which a patient's illness or injury precludes decision-making. Such a will could be stored on a still-to-be-established \"health check card.\" By way of this card, the physician treating the patient could retrieve information about any living will in addition to the purely medical information. Despite potential gaps and uncertainties a patient's living will indicates to the physician that this patient has certain expectations regarding his\/her treatment. In the event of a patient falling unconscious, the physician must talk to the relatives\/surrogates in order to explore the patient's expectations about his\/her treatment as nearly as closely as possible. This is the only way for the medical practitioner to meet his\/her obligation towards the patient.","1360":"","1361":"","1362":"Quality management of assessment in medical education plays a key role in Germany--owing to, among other factors, the new medical licensing regulations (\"Approbationsordnung\"). OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) is a widespread tool to assess clinical competencies. However, the quality of OSCE in terms of reliability as a criterion of a good test is highly debated in the current literature. To improve the reliability of the OSCE three accompanying measures have been implemented at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Heidelberg since the summer of 2006: 1. the application of a checklist for pre- and post-reviews of OSCEs, 2. a specific training of OSCE examiners, 3. an advanced psychometric OSCE test report giving feedback to the item developer. The reliability of the Internal Medicine OSCE at the University of Heidelberg has increased since. Currently Cronbach's alpha of the final OSCE in the summer of 2007 was 0.829.","1363":"This article offers an overview of options for the evaluation of medical education. After discussing theoretical and methodological issues we describe how medical education is currently being evaluated by medical faculties in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany.","1364":"Peer-assisted learning is a common feature of medical education and proves to be highly effective in many areas. So far there have been no reports on on-ward tutorials held by final-year students to promote the clinical competencies of medical undergraduates. The aim of the current investigation was to both evaluate undergraduate and tutor acceptance of a peer-assisted learning programme performed by final-year students and to examine the perception of the role of final-year students within an intervention and a control group. 88 medical students (51 female, 37 male; mean age 23.6 years) were assigned to one of seven intervention wards where 10 student-led, patient-centred tutorials were held. 80 medical students (58 female, 22 male; mean age 23.3 years) were assigned to one of seven control wards. Tutorials were held by 14 volunteer final-year student tutors (8 female, 6 male; mean age 26.2 years). Acceptance of the peer-assisted learning programme and ratings of the role of final-year students were evaluated on a six-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = very good to 6 = unsatisfactory and 1 = completely agree to 6 = completely disagree). Medical undergraduates rated student-led tutorials and tutors rated the introductory course and the complete programme as extremely positive (1.14 +\/- 0.36 to 2.34 +\/- 1.15). The role of final-year students as role model, teacher, contact person and integrator was rated as being significantly more relevant by students in the intervention group than by those in the control group (p &lt; 0.02 in each case). Patient-centred, student-led on-ward tutorials designed to promote undergraduate clinical competencies received extremely positive ratings from both medical undergraduates and tutors and enable final-year tutors to assume important roles. ","1365":"E-Learning applications are an integral part of modern medical curricula. Nevertheless, there is only a narrow empirical basis for an optimal integration strategy of computerized teaching methods in medical education. This article focuses on the integration experiences with three different online systems for interactive virtual patients (VPs) in clinical undergraduate medical education at the universities of Heidelberg, Munich (LMU), and Wuerzburg. Five different integration strategies for VPs are presented and compared with respect to motivational aspects, logistics and acceptance of both students and teachers. A voluntary use of VPs without curricular integration leads to low acceptance. Exam relevance of VPs and integration with face-to-face teaching are key factors for a high level of acceptance. The assets and drawbacks of all described strategies are discussed in the conclusions of this article. Case-based e-learning can be successfully integrated into clinical undergraduate medical education when key factors are considered. ","1366":"Role playing is an important element of virtually all simulation-based procedures. An improved understanding for methodological aspects facilitates its goal-oriented use in education and training, research and examinations. In the present paper we describe how different forms of role play are used in different simulation-based procedures. We describe a plausibility study from skills labs demonstrating that the introduction of role-playing can increase perceived realism. Finally we derive practical suggestions for the conduction of role plays in medical simulation.","1367":"Many faculties worldwide apply the method of problem-based learning (PBL) in their curricula as a form of instruction by which students in small groups develop problem-solving strategies on the basis of a specific case. This approach fosters self-responsible and context-dependent learning, which aims at providing an improved anchoring of knowledge. For this reason, the previous decades have seen a distribution of the method to medical schools across the world. The role of the tutor assumes particular importance since, in contrast to the traditional university system, he or she serves as a facilitator who fosters and structures content-related and group-dynamic learning processes. In some cases, this requires an intervention by the tutor. The major challenge is to intervene at the right time and in an appropriate manner. This paper presents examples of difficult PBL situations using short film sequences to demonstrate and comments on potential approaches of the tutor in attempting to resolve the problem. Standard problem situations within a PBL tutorial were defined and produced in a film. A collection of seven frequent critical PBL situations are presented in short film sequences. Potential instruments of intervention are demonstrated in the videos and discussed. The film sequences may be downloaded in the supplementary of the electronic version of this article (www.sciencedirect.com). Within the framework of a tutor-training programme, the problematic situations and interventions presented in this article will help to sensitise tutors to potentially critical PBL tutorial situations and aid the development of individual resolution approaches. ","1368":"Learning is a highly individual process that depends on multiple factors, e.g., previous knowledge, level of attention, personal interest and motivation. Efficient learning may therefore be facilitated by offering individual learning phases during educational sessions. The sandwich design of teaching sessions represents a superior principle which supports efficient learning processes by integrating individual and collective learning phases and using a wide range of didactic methods.","1369":null,"1370":null},"articletitle":{"0":"[Approaches to increase HPV vaccination rate in Germany - challenges and opportunities.
